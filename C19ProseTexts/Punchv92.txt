July 2, 1887.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. iii
66 IT was about the lovely close of a warm Summer day,” in fact it was on the night of the great Victorian Jubilee Day,
June 21st, 1887.
“Night sank upon the dusky beach and on the purple sea,”
and Mr. PUNCH, upon a chalky headland, overlooking the “silver streak," gazed forth into the vast star-spangked vault of
heaven, musing of many things.
He, the swift, the ubiquitous, had been an observant witness of the impressive pageantry, the imposing popular out-
pouring of the day. And now, Toby at heel and torch in hand, he had climbed to set fire to the beacon whose “red glare”
was to blaze out over the wide Channel waters, and blazon forth to all the land England's joy and Mr. Punch's loyalty.
Flash! The ruddy flame leaped forth on to the night with the brightness of the levin, the impetuosity of a tiger's
spring. A lurid cloud of smoke rolled upward and outward, slowly lifted and wafted by the soft salt sea-breeze of June.
The ringing rhymes of MACAULAY—that sound-hearted English writer whom prigs pooh-pooh, and PUNCH, like all
sensible Britons, enjoys—ran in the head of the Sage. He thought of that other Summer night, three centuries since, when
another Queen sat on the throne of the island realm, when—
“From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,
That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day,”
with preparations for welcoming the Armada.
“Wenit, widit, fugit 7” murmured Mr. PUNCH.
“Dua famina facti," sibillated a responsive voice in his ear.
Who, what were these two shadowy shapes in doublet and ruffle? One frail, and, like the Sage himself, slightly
hunched; the other brisk, alert, bronzed, bearded.
“Well capped, Robert CECIL!” said the Ever-Ready One, courteously bending to the illustrious Shades. “And
you, stout Sir FRANCIS, give you good greeting on this night of nights, when 'tis no marvel two such patriot spirits should
revisit thus the glimpses of the moon."
“What bodeth this?" queried DRAKE, pointing to the flaring beacon.
“Oh, this is no "ghastly war-flame,' but a jubilant Jubilee bonfire,” said Mr. PUNCH, with a smile.
“The better so, if what that ranting rantipole Lord RANDolph says is sooth,” retorted the slighter Shade, with a
touch of sardonic grimness. “Were I in the place of my living namesake, your present PREMIER, I'd take such order with
the rebellious springald as ->
“You did with Essex, eh?” interjected PUNCH. “Well, well, times have changed. We are more tolerant than of
yore, and the Tower and the block are not now looked upon as the appropriate retort to indiscreet praters of Party rubbish
or personal rhodomontade."
Then Sir FRANCIs broke briskly in. “Supposing, good Sir, that some King of Spain's beard required summary singe-
ing; dost mean to say your singeing-irons are so ready, that your Singer-in-Chief could afford to finish histgame of bowls
ere he took them in hand?"

revenues of the §. were totally inadequate to the effort of raising it to anything approaching a parity with the fleets of Spain. It
was on the spontaneous efforts of individuals that the whole safety of the country at this momentous crisis was left dependent; if these
failed, England was lost;-but in such a cause, at such a juncture, they could not fail; and the first appeal made by the Government to
the patriotism of the people was answered with that spirit in which a nation is invincible.’
So writes the historian concerning England on the eve of the advent of the Great Armada. Sir FRANois, despite doubts,
which I share with you, and notwithstanding maladministration, which, with all honest souls, I hate, I will back the

mental duffers—beshrew them l—can do much mischief, but there's one thing they cannot do.”
“What is that?” asked both the Shades, eagerly.
“Stop our supplies of DRAKEs and CECIIs, of HowARDs and RALEIGHs, of ELIZABETHs and—VICTORIAs," responded
Mr. PUNCH. “And,” pursued he, “if this were a war-beacon instead of a peace-bonfire, trust me that from “Malvern's lonely
height' in the Midlands, again would flare forth the ruddy signal of ready loyalty,+
* Till Belvoir's lordly terraces the sign to Lincoln sent,
And Lincoln sped the message on o'er the wide vale of Trent;
Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burnt on Gaunt's embattled. ile.
And the red glare on Skiddaw roused the burghers of Carlisle !’”
“Marry! but this MACAULAY of yours hath the right British ring in him 1" burst forth DRAKE, enthusiastically.
“Nathless,” said CECIL, more soberly, “let not the old lion of England be caught napping, Mr. PUNCH."
“Sirs,” said the Sage, stirring up the bonfire till it blazed forth afresh in sky-reddening radiance, “Sirs, there is an
inexinguishable beacon-l'ght, of another sort than this, ever before the eyes of that noble if somewhat somnolent animal,
which will prevent a fortuitous forty winks ever lapsing into the lethal lethargy of a Rip Van Winkle's slumber.”
“And that?” cried the Shades, simultaneously.
“It is light and fire made portable as the staff-hidden spark of Prometheus,” answered Mr. PUNCH. “Like unto a
FAURE battery, it stores immense force in small compass, and for public convenience is replenishable half-yearly. It can be
multiplied to any extent, and conveniently carried to any distance. You, if you wish, can take it with you to illuminate the
Shades, and warm your patriotic bosoms with knowledge and good hope."
“What is it?” ejaculated Mr. Punch's ghostly Visitants.
“Take it and try it, most noble Shades,” responded Pusch, heartily. “By its light you shall see both the best and
the worst of the grand old land you greatly loved, and as greatly served. You shall see how, despite the feuds of faction and
the fumblings of official folly, England is England still—only more so. You shall see how sleepless a sentinel, how vigilant
a warder, how stout a champ'on, her honour and best interests have in ->
“Yourself!" cried the great Elizabethans, simultaneously.
“Precisely,” said Mr. PUNCH, calmly. “Natural modesty must not be indulged in at the expense of obvious truth.
You shall see, also, how I counsel her counsellors, lead her leaders, enlighten her illuminati, reward her heroes, trounce her
traitors, castigate her humbugs, and flagellate her fools. In short, you shall see, as by a brilliant beacon-glare, all that is
best worth seeing in this England of the Victorian Jubilee Year.”
Whereupon, without another word, PUNCH presented to the two illustrious Elizabethans his

WISHES FOR THE NEW YEAR.
H. R. H. The Prince of Wales.—That there may be no further
opposition to my excellent scheme for an Imperial Institute. That
% Punch and myself may agree on every subject.
Lord Salisbury.—That HARTINGTON will listen to reason," and
that every blessing may light on my dear RANDOLPH's head.
Iord Hartington.-Wish RANDOLPH hadn't spoilt my holiday.
Wish I hadn't been born an hereditary politician.
Mr. Parnell.—That my friends in Ireland will in future leave me
to fix on the “plan of campaign.”
The Czar.--That the Powers would unanimously accept KATKOFF
as Prince of Bulgaria, so that I could have a few hours' peace in my
own dominions.
The Prince of Mingrelia.--That the CzAR would let me go off
quietly to Monte Carlo, instead of Sophia.
Mr. Justice Butt.—That the Divorce Court may be turned into a
Camera Obscura.
Mr. Gladstone.-That the SULTAN had given me that diamond
cigar-case instead of CHAMBERLAIN.
Mr. Labouchere.—That the G. O. M. may be led to see the value
of my constant support by the time he is making up his next
Cabinet.
Mr. Chamberlain.—That I may get the Premiership.
Mr. Morley.—I wish he may get it.
Lord R. Churchill.—That those idiotic London Members really
knew º of the º º they are supposed to represent,
and that I had never been led by them into an unpopular crusade
against the Coal and Grain Dues.
Sir Philip Cunliffe Owen.—That I had never set eyes on South
Kensington
The Governor of Kilmainham.—That the Nationalist platform
may always contain a plank-bed as one item.
Sir Charles Warren.—That not a single *†† citizen during
the whole twelvemonth may have reason to think that the Force is
no remedy.
Mr. Punch, for the whole, British Public.—That, the year may
contain as few º scandals, prosecutions of Irish leaders, Par-
liamentary wrangles. All-night Sittings, Trafalgar Square Meetings,
Prize-fights, East Winds, Burglaries, and Bye-Elections as is con-
sistent with the continued and unimpaired existence of the British
Constitution.
ANOTHER “NEw DEPARTURE.” — Lord RANDOLPH's from the
Cabinet,
THE MYSTERY OF GREAT PRINTING-HOUSE SQUARE.
THE only newspaper, as far as we are aware, that published the
startling news of Lord RANDOLPH's resignation last Thursday morn-
ing was the Times. So for, once not even the most Ultra-Liberal or
Radical journal was in advance of the Times. The Pall Mall
Gazette was so astonished that it thought the Jupiter must have been
hoaxed, and sent an Interviewer post haste to Lord RANDoIPH.
But the ex-Chancellor was too wary a bird to be caught, and the
P.M.G. Young Man had to be content with interviewing Lord
RANDOLPH's Secretary. Who gave the Times the private and con-
fidential tip?. Was it RANDOLPH himself? Anyhow the Times, was
not hoaxed, though it was “taken in" everywhere and by everybody
that morning.
To Lovers of a Good Dinner.
“CivilisED man cannot live without dining,” sings Lord LYTTON.
Still less can half-civilised children. If, however, any bon-vivant,
who happens to have a good heart as well as a good digestion, wishes
to know what pleasure can be got out of dining, let him take a turn at
the Mission Room in Clerkenwell Close, where Mr.J.A.G.Room, Super-
intendent of the Flower Girls' Mission and Brigade, on Wednesdays
and Thursdays º halfpenny hot meat dinners to hundreds of
r children. A Halfpenny Hot Meat Dinner! If that is not a
‘good” dinner, what is? Failing a personal visit, the next best
thing the bon-vivant can do is to send a representative—in the shape
of a handsome contribution to the Mission's funds. A guinea will
give a dinner, to 504, poor children I Spare as many guineas as
; send some to Nazareth House for the poor old folks at
ome there, and you will have done something wort Y. of the title of
the real Bon-Virant, with an emphasis on the “bon.”
“DAYs witH SIR. Roger DE CoverIEY” (MACMILLAN).-In our
notice of this charmingly got-up and most seasonable book we omit-
ted to mention the name of the Artist, Mr. HUGH THoMson, whose
work does so much to enhance the value of the selections. But wh
did we omit it? Because we could not find it, where, as we contend,
it ought to have been, on the title-page facing the frontispiece,
which, by the way, is not at all a fair specimen of his work through-
out the volume. After careful search right through the book, we
discovered it at last where we might have looked at first, modestly
recorded on a sort of fly-page at the commencement. Quite an
unexpected pleasure, and delighted to meet him anywhere. It is
also emblazoned on the cover, but the cover of our copy was itself

says, to the change of weather. Lord GRAN VILLE hums an accompani-

All º: chorus). We won't go home till morning!
Lord Cross (enthusiastically waving his spectacles). We won't go
home at all!
Everybody (with enthusiastic unanimity turning to Mr. Punch,
and uplifting glasses and voices):—For he's a jolly goodfellow! And
so say all of us!
[After this the sitting partook of a strictly private character, and
called for no further remark.
WORTH CONSIDERATION.
ALTHOUGH the voice of Kensington on the subject of the supple-
mental charter to Albert Hall is to be heard by means of a BRAYE–
which has an unfortunate sound—yet, like the utterance of BALAAM's
inspired animal, it speaks the words of wise warning. Shall the
º: Hall and the Gardens become a Cremorneries? this is the
question. With Olympia at Addison Road, with Buffalo BILL's Show
at Earl's Court (about, Easter-time), and the Exhibition re-opened,
the Kensingtonians will not have to complain of lack of amusement,
whatever else they may have to grumble about. - -
Now, be it understood that, if a Cremorne be a necessity, Mr. Punch
is not opposed to it, as long as it does not pretend to be a scientific
exhibition, and so sneak in under a disguise. His Royal Highness's
Councillors having settled their scheme for the Imperial Institute, a
scheme on which Mr. Punch can congratulate H.R.H., the Kensington
site will no longer be required for a Cremorneries. So Mr. Punch
ventures to point out that there isº of space, and to spare
for Cremorneries in the interior of Hyde Park, Regent's Park, an
St. James's Park. Why should not central spaces in these localities
be put up to the highest bidder, who could sub-let the ground to
showmen and Restaurateurs, so that we should have a kind of Champs
Elysées in Hyde Park with a Café des Ambassadeurs, and such like
º: open in the summer for dining, and for concerts, and music-
all performances afterwards, and in the day-time for luncheon?
The same sort of fair could be arranged in Regent's. Park. The
£º. Çaterer would undertake the amusements in Battersea
Park; and there would be bands playing throughout the day in all
the Cremorneries. . . -
Place all the details under the capable management of Sir SoMERs
WINE and Mr. John HollingsHEAp;, call the Shows collectively the
“Summer Wineries,” and start with the Spring: the better the spring
the better the start. Such a scheme as this would enliven London,
relieve Kensington from a plethora of amusements, and fairly dis-
tribute the pleasure-seeking crowd.

Wonderland at the Prince of Wales's. More anon.

ay might

with that of

but it is the
town itself
that is un-

terest. The
Guide -book
has little to
say about it,
and tourists
are rarely
seen within
its ancient
gates. It is
very old, was

- - share in the
wars of the period, (Sorry the Doge is dead; should like to have
interviewed him and recruited him with therest. But he is no more.)
Çan only walk about the streets he once passed through in splendour.
Such streets! about the width of an ordinary dining-table, flanked
on either side by lofty houses budding into balconies at all kinds
of unexpected places. For the ten centuries these streets have
existed, the sun has never touched the payement. There is all about
a genial green mouldiness, which must be very refreshing when, in
July or August, the sun is beating down upon the rock round which
Gaeta has twined itself.
º: Saturday.—The voyage from Civita Vecchia to Gaeta
was, by reason of fine weather, enchanting, That from Gaeta to
Naples was even better—a *...; day, with the blue Mediterranean
just rippled with a breath of wind, and all the his that entinei the
mainland standing clear out under the cloudless sky. Yet another
beautiful day, and we crossed the Bay in the steam-launch, landed at
Torre del Annunziata, and drove through the narrow, crowded streets
to peaceful Pompeii. Worth a long journey to stand for awhile in the
streets of this silent city; could almost imagine that the inhabitants
had quitted it but yesterday. Some of them, however, we saw
lying in the Museum by the entrance gate, prone as they fell
sighteen hundred years ago. Strangely human they look, their
faces so well preserved that, doubtless, if the Wandering Jew were
about, and had personally known them in Pompeii, he would be able
to identify them. Evidently a luxurious race the Pompeiians, with a
shrewd notion of making themselves comfortable, Barring the little
#. to accident, the site of the city is one of the most beautiful in
the world, with its peep of the sea, and its amphitheatre of hills,
prominent amongst them, Vesuvius, smoking with a deliberate air
of unconcern, in passive denial of having had anything to do with
the present roofless state of the city: -
Naples, a busy place, with no footpaths to speak of. The prin-
cipal thoroughfares densely crowded; have to walk in the roadway;
rather awkward, owing to peculiar method cabmen have of invit-
ing custom. If they see anyone walking in the roadway who looks
as if he had a franc in his pocket, they drive down upon him full
speed, skilfully bringing the horse's head oyer his shoulder, and the
near shaft into the small of his back. If he wants, a cab, you
know, there it is; if he don’t, the man turns off in search of business
elsewhere. This has its conveniences, but&. º, the
time you have walked the full length of the *iaja, or the Via di Roma
One other street habit I notice, more desirable for importation to
London. The morning and afternoon milk is brought to the door of
the customers, by the animals themselves. The milkman drives his
goats their daily round, the customer produces a jug, and not only
pays for his milk, but, to quote a familiar injunction, “sees that he
gets it.” To-day we saw a number of turkeys being driven up a
street. The šiº says they are worked upon the same
principle. The proprietor knocks at the door, inquires if eggs are
wante he gets an order for two, or half a dozen, the turkeys
lay them, and pass on their round. I did not see this done myself.
AETA, Satur-
~
Have seen QHAPLIN and HARTINGTON, and arranged for them an in-
terview with the Prince of MonAco. Rather a picturesquerendezvous.
Have to be very careful, since we are constantly watched by the
reporters. Our Chief has assumed the name of “ #. BISHOP,” and
lºoks very well in pair of blue spectacles. Wears a long cloak, after
the Italian manner. HARTINgrox, who travels as “Mr. CAVENDISH,”
wears his hat on the back of his head, keeps his hand out of his
trouserº assumes a jerky walk, and is conseqmently thoroughly
disguised. We met at the foot of Vesuvius on the stroke of midnight.
Mr. CAVENDISH said it was “bosh!” but our Chief, #; the flap
of his cloak over rightshoulder (as he has seen the Italian officers do),
said mustn't omit any precaution. Chief seems certain that he has
º: HARTINGTON. Professes not to care about CHAMBERLAIN or
OSCHEN.
To-morrow we set off for Messina, Palermo, thence to Wenice, and
eastward through the Isles of Greece to the Golden Horn. If I suc-
ceed in my endeavour to see the Doge of Venice, I’ll write again.
“THE CROCODILE.”
FROM what I have read in the Daily News,
Of this new piece of Mister SARDou's,
I think The Crocodile is, sans doute,
Adapted from the Orerland Route.
What! adapt from English! that can't be true
Of any French author, eh? SARDou ?
But it seems very like it, unless we say,
That both had worked from an older play.
And this suspicion won't be removed,
Until the contrary be proved.
A GOOD BUTLER IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
MR.PUNCH congratulates Mr. TooDE upon his new situation at his
own Theatre, which suits him to a tea. . Naturally it must, because
it comes between his early dinner and his late supper. Mr. and Mrs.
N MERIVALE call their play alſ)omestic Comedy, and they have
not chosen this description *...* as assuredly the
“Domestic” is the feature of the cast, Good, however, as Mr. Tool, E
certainly is, hereceives admirable support from the clever and versatile
Miss IE LINDEN, the thoroughly conscientious Miss EMILY
THORNE, the intelligent and piquante Miss WIOLET WANBRUGH (a
valuable recruit), the useful Mr. E. D. WARD, and the evergreen Mr.
BILLINGTON, The Company work together with a will that quickly
finds a way to the hearts of the audience. Judging from the houses
that have been seen since the production of the new piece, The
Butler during the present season will have a constant supply of

The Land of Little People, (HILDESHEIMER & Co.,) will also be
vastly popular with little people and big.
Poems done by WEATHERLY, sparkling and featherly,
Miss DEALY's judicious, with pencil dealycious !
And so we sum it all up. But here is another book which children
will clamour for. ... The Queen of the Pirate Isle (CHATTo AND
WINDUs). It is full of hearty fun, or rather Bret Hartey fun, and
the illustrations by Miss KATE GREENAWAY are excellent. A capital
sea-story—quite a first-floor-fronter—is The Cruise of the Black
Prince, by Commander LovETT CAMERON. Older boys will delightin
The Chronicle of the Coach, by J. D. CHAMPLIN, Junr. A rapid
#. with gº of wheel and very little wo, from London to
racombe. E. L. CHICHESTER’s clever cuts—not with the whip,
but with the pencil–add materially to the pleasure of the trip. Glad
IIours (WARD AND LOCK), by Miss MURIEL EVELYN, is an attractive
volume... This version of “Evelyn's Diary,” and all the pictures illus-
trating it, will be a favourite amongst the Tinymite Party. The
Babes in the Wood, (RAPHAEL Tuck). The old, old story with
capital new wood-cuts by WIEGAND. ght to be called The Babes
on the Wood. But suppºsing they are not wood-cuts P º:
they are some “process,”-copper? zinc P “Of what is the old man
zincing?” This is frivolous-let us inspect. The Knight and the
Lady (EYRE AND sº Tom HooD's capital_ancient
ballad with a number of admirable new illustrations by EDWARD
JEssop. The Theatre Annual, is a capital one, this year, and con-
tains a wonderful variety in prose and verse. Among the principal
contributors beside the editor CLEMENT Scott, are E. L. BLANCHARD,
GoDFREY TURNER, H. SAVILE CLARKE, W. ARCHER, BRAM STOKER,
and WIoIET FANE. Unwin's Annual is a good one, with a good title
—The Witching Time. It consists of 'excellent stories well told,
under the editorship of HENRY NoHMAN.
Doubtless we get a great deal too much Christmas literature at
try a change, and give us tales of frost and snow at Midsummer,
the river, and the sea, at Christmas.
Christmas by anticipation somewhere about last August, he does not
want to hear any more about it. It is a relief to turn to Captain
HAwLEY SMART's Outsider (WHITE & Co.). This story will probably
be an ‘‘insider” during the festive season. It will be inside man
a boudoir, library, and smoking-room, and add to warmth an
geniality by its dashing spirit and cheery good humour. Romantic
Spain (WARD AND Downey) is a good book to read when the snow is
on the und, or during the intervals of water-pipes, bursting.
J. A. O'SHEA_tells of his personal experiences in perturbed Spain
from the abdication of AMADEUs to the entry of Don QARLos.
The book is full of adventure, and abounds in Fº descrip-
tion. Very little guide-book and less history, for which the reader
will be truly than Margaret Jermine (iſºcºiºs & Co.), by
FAYR MADoč, might be described, in the lº. of vintages, as “a
very fair Médoc.”. There is an excellent bouquet about the first
volume, which, had it been sustained through the remaining two,
would have supplied a novel of note. But there is scarcely sufficient
body in the story to justify its dilution into three volumes. It would
have been more successful as a big one-volume tale.
Ladies (THACKER & Co.), Mrs. Poweh, O'Donoghur (more power to
her—not that she wants it) shows no signs of “falling off.” Indeed,
the shows her readers how to become riders, and to stick on grace:
fully. She sketches her pupils “in their habits as they ride,” and
Christmas-time, and next year it is to be hoped the Publishers will º:

spurs on the spur of the moment.—We heartily welcome the initial
umber of Scribner's Magazine. The Messrs. SCRIBNER were the
ioneers of that excellence in get up, printing, illustration, and
iterary value, which have made the American periodicals of this
class famous throughout Europe. Their latest yenture shows they
have by no means forgotten their rare skill and admirable taste,in
such matters. The Number before us is well printed, capitally
illustrated, and contains a great variety of valuable literary work;
Of especial note is “Reminiscences of the Siege and Commune of
Paris,” by E. B. WASHBURNE, Ex-Minister to France. This Maga:
zine is well charged—the charge, we may note, is the harmless but
necessary shilling—and, though there is no chance of its “blowing
up,” there is every prospect of its “going off” in England in a
manner that will prove, in all respects, satisfactory to its promoters.
FATHER CHRISTMAS AND THE CHILD.
A Seasonable Colloquy, after a Celebrated Model.
“You are old, Father Christmas,” the young child said,
“Yet you're true to your time to a day, .
Though your hair is so white, and your nose is so red.
Tell me how you keep going, I pray.”
“I am yet a mere youth,” Father Christmas replied,
“Though I have such a jolly long past. -
If you’ve got a warm heart, and shun sourness and pride,
ou may keep up your youth to the last.”
“You are old, Father Christmas,” the young child remarked,
“And you do not take pills, I’ll be bound;
Yet, considering how you have gobbled and larked,
Your health seems remarkably sound.”
“As for CockLE & Co.,” Father Christmas replied,
“They’re devoid of attractions for me;
For the lots that I take won't upset my inside,
Since I give even more, don't you see l’’
“You’re a brick, Father Christmas,” the young child said,
“Yet you’re rather like Bardolph, between us.
sº why do they give you a flushed figure-head,
hatreminds one so much of Silenus?” .
“Most Artists are muffs,” Father Christmas replied,
“When true fancy, convention-clogged, slumbers;
But judge me, dear child, by my fame far and wide,
Not my pictures in cheap Christmas Numbers!”
THE OLYMPIANS.
A Won DERFUL place this Olympia. Quite handy to the Addison
Road Station. Good omen in the name of “Addison,” suggesting
zºº.ºumºn, numbers of Spectators. Nothing so
º -- pus " extensive has yet been seen in Lon-
don. A regiment of cavalry could be
º: from the stables:-cavalry
o ages, and of many nationalities;
As for infantry, there are the tiniest
ponies there to suit the requirements
| of any nursery. We happened to look
- in while two of the Elephants, were
º | rehearsing. One of them evidently
º' liked his part, but the other was
inclined to throw his up, judging by
NS the movement of his trunk. How-
. *~. ever, he was not more troublesome
- - - tº than any other Actor would have been
Going Underground to Olympia under similar circumstances; and, on
consideration of beingº: to intersperse a considerable amount
of “gag,” which he did by roaring with laughter, of course, an
trumpeting (his form of advertising himself), he consented to under-
take the part, and went through it in a manner that promised well
for its success with the public. The Olympians were in their
working dresses. The gods and goddessesseemed very tired. Æolus
was making a tremendous noise in practising the wind instruments,
and Apollo and Diana were arranging to rehearse the stag-hunt as
we were leaving. More, after our official visit.
A LIST of the guests at the New Club last week included one “M.DE
EvKRAL.” No more comprehensive name since the days of Lot.
PIAYING “THE DUEs” witH HIM.–The Coals did it. T At the last
meeting with his Chief he had been hauled over them, and, in a
mper, he resigned. They call him Lord RANDOM CHURCHILL now.

Signor Mossini. “Ow, My LovE 1 I LovED HER sow !
My LovE THAT LOVED ME YEARs AGow !”
PUNCH'S OWN ZADKIEL FOR 1887.
January.—The year ". coldly...The appearance of the Great. Bear in
conjunction with Orion's Belt denotes that persons born on a Friday will suffer
much distress of mind, caused either by a disappointment in love, or German
measles. Aged Sovereign will suffer from headache. Political complications.
Persons travelling on the 15th of the month should beware of storms. Prince
BISMARCK will create suspicion. -
February. HParliament, now open, will see many changes. The Miky Way
being in the house of Mars, there is reason to fear great pestilence in Eastern
Australia. The 17th will be an unfortunate day for travelling to persons with
red hair, and the Emperor of China. Aged Sovereign much better. Further
complications. Prince BISMARCK will cause alarm.
arch,-An event of great interest to the Royal Family will occur early in
the month, and cause much rejoicing in some quarters, while in others it will be
regarded with concealed suspicion. The appearance of Jupiter in Saturn's
belt denotes that colds will be prevalent amongst persons with blue eyes, Arab
agents, and the President of the United States. Aged Sovereign not quite so
well. Balance of power affected. Prince BISMARCK will be carefully watched,
and arouse conjectures.
April.—There will be several debates in Parliament, of very long duration.
The 3rd will be unwholesome to children having mothers born on a Friday,
tallow-chandlers, and the Queen of SPAIN. During the month, Venus governs
the Southern Cross, denoting that there will be much rain in Suffolk, and a
revolution in North America. An aged Soyereign sneezes, thus causing compli-
cations amongst the European Powers. Prince BISMARCK will conceal his policy,
and create apprehension. -
May.-Much stormy and sunshiny weather. The 9th will be unfortunate to
those who have been married on a Wednesday, Statesmen, letter-carriers, and
the King of PoETUGAL. The concord of Cancer in the house of Uranus forebodes
earthquakes in Ireland and the prevalence of influenza in Northern latitudes.
Much apprehension is felt in Venezuela. An aged Sovereign goes out for a
walk, and returns fatigued, causing European complications of a kind not easily ||
removed. Prince BISMARCK by his conduct provokes comment,
... June,—The month commences sadly with a famine in a country ill able to bear
the disaster. The 29th will be a day to be avoided by aged persons fond of
athletic exercises, mariners, and the Mikado of JAPAN. The eclipse of the
Gemini shadows forth much distress in Switzerland, especially amongst those
holding high office in the Navy. An aged Sovereign receives intelligence of a
disturbing character. Prince BISMARCK, by a stroke of
unexpected policy, promotes distrust in some influential
quarters.
July.—Rain and snow, in spite of the season of the
year, are found in Greenland and further North., Be-
tween the 14th and 22nd poulterers and the Ex-Khedive
of EGYPT should beware of playing on the German flute.
An aged Sovereign takes a bath, a fact that has to be
considered in international councils. Prince BISMARCK
attracts attention.
August-Hard times are experienced in Mexico owing
to the failure of the harvest of a vegetable closely re-
sembling the potato... The 12th is not a day to be chosen
by mariners and children under four years of age for
embarking in adventures requiring great energy and dis-
crimination. An aged Sovereign was never better in his
life. Prince BISMARCK causes a feeling of insecurity.
September.—Much storm in various parts of the world;
Neptune, crossing the orbit of Jupiter, forebodes, ill
tidings to persons with red hair, and especially the Em-
peror of BRAZIL. An aged Sovereign suffers much from
the extreme heat of the weather, and his state is regarded
with interest by neighbouring monarchs. Prince Bis-
MARCK's utterances are discredited in some quarters.
October.—The month opens with much excitement in
America, produced by the dissemination of news of an
alarming character. The 4th should be avoided by those
intending to make a bargain, and the Imperial Family of
Russia. An aged Sovereign dines half-an-hour later
than usual, which causes some uneasiness. Prince BIs-
MARCK's policy is regarded with disfavour in Southern
Europe, especially Turkey, or its dependencies:
November.—London is invaded º a dense fog, which
lasts for some time. The 9th is a fortunate day for the
adventures of shipowners, burglars, and the President of
the French Republic. An aged Sovereign is reported to
be in weak health, a rumour that has its effect in the
councils of Europe. Prince BISMARCK is regarded with
*}. by his fellow-statesmen.
ecember–The month commences sadly in the more
unhealthy parts of the West Coast of Africa. The con-
junction of the Great Bear, Jupiter, Saturn, Venus,
Mars, and Uranus, in the Milky ay denotes that some
disaster may occur to the junior branches of the family
of the Emperor of Austria. Great fires are seen in London
on or about the 24th. Ireland is threatened with com-
motion, and the potato is eaten largely as food by the
Fº of that unhappy island. An aged Monarch is said
to feel the cold intensely, and the report is received with
interest by adjacent Monarchs. Prince BISMARCK is ver
reticent in his utterances, but is still regarded wit
i. distrust, unbelief, suspicion, dislike, and appre-
enslon,

But that I wish to love her better,
'Tis well to loose the loving stress
That makes me sometimes fail to bless

A value that I deem absurd.

DRURY LANE ON BOXING-NIGHT. AUGUSTO DEURIOLANO IMPERATORE.
(Rapid Sketch by Our Lime-Lightning Artist.)
JUBILEE JOTTINGS.
“The glaring sins against taste, and the most ordinary dictates of reason,
erpetuated of late under the pretext of celebrating Her Majesty's Jubilee,
#. a sad and solemn warning.”—Times.
THE following suggestive schemes for the celebration of the coming
Royal Jubilee are among the latest that have come to hand:—
DITCHBoRough.-At a Meeting of the Town Council of this ancient
borough, held yesterday morning, it was unanimously decided to
celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Her Gracious Majesty's accession
to the Throne by the establishment of a Central Pig Market. Seeing
that the town is noted for its production of pork, sausages, and does
an active trade in this commodity, it is felt that, while #: a
delicate compliment to HER MAJESTY, the inauguration of the Market
in question will at the same time subserve usefully the interests of
local commerce. The Motion was received with great favour in the
borough, and much enthusiasm prevailed. -
WAPPINGHAM.–It has been decided that Wappingham shall mark
the event of the Royal Jubilee by the erection of a new Town-pump
and the opening of a local Cemetery. It is thought that the idea
which thus happily associates the occasion with the supply of two
ublic wants that have for some time been experienced in the
F. h, cannot fail to recommend itself favourably to HER MAJESTY's
consideration; and it has been arranged that a deputation shall visit
her at Windsor for the º: of submitting the proposition to her
judgment forthwith. F. feeling runs high on the subject, and
ill anxiously await the Royal approval.
KETTLINGTON.—The Corporation of this town have decided to
utilise the New Sewage Scheme for the purpose of celebrating the
keeping of their gracious Sovereign's year of Jubilee. . It is thought
that a handsome public subscription will be forthcoming under the
exceptional circumstances, and so enable the Corporation to complete
in a substantial manner this necessary public work, and at the same
time *Pººl. do honour to a memorable epoch in HERMAJESTY's
reign. Much local confidence is expressed that the happy idea will
meet with the Royal approbation,
BLINKSwobTH.-After a good deal of discussion over several rival
schemes for the celebration of Her Majesty's Jubilee, it has at length
been decided to commemorate the great occasion by the erection,
subject to the control of a Limited Liability Company, of a first-class
Hotel, an institution the lack of which has long been a reproach to
the borough. It is hoped too, if sufficient funds are left overfor the
purpose, to supplement the idea by the further erection of a plaster
statue of Her Most Gracious MAJESTY, on a suitable pedestal, on a
convenient site facing the coffee-room of the building, and it is con-
ceived by the Authorities, that if HER MAJESTY can be induced to
visit our loyal borough for the purpose of inaugurating the under-
taking, that the bestowal of some local honours cannot fail to follow
upon such an auspicious occasion. Altogether a most excellent
feeling has been manifested in the borough on the subject.
DAMPovR.R.—It was unanimously decided at the meeting of the
Town Council held here yesterday, that the happiest and most fitting
memorial of Her Gracious MAJESTY's fiftieth anniversary of accession
to the Throne, would be the inauguration of the New Borough Gas-
works... Steps have, therefore, already been taken to organise a
Committee for the purpose of arranging and carrying out the pre-
liminaries of the undertaking, which appears to be extremely
popular, and promises to enlist a large amount of sympathy.

[JANUARY 1, 1887.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. X. —THE OPEN-AIR RECITER.
THE scene is Hyde Park on a Sunday evening. Enthusiasts of
nearly every shade of conviction and complexion are haranguing groups
more or less numerous.
ringletted Italian is defend-
ing some peculiar doctrine
he has brought over with
him, as he sits on one of
the benches, and, hard by,
afluentbutincoherent Negro
revivalist is waving his
pinkish palms behind some
railings. Here is the Posi-
tivist who undertakes to
disprove Christianity in the
short space of ten minutes;
and there a gloomy gentle-
man exhorts to repentance
a congregation consisting of
one very small girl with an
infant in arms.
A Cockney (Atheist dis-
putes publicly against a
German Protestant amidst
the applause of a thoroughly
impartial circle; and, a few
paces on, a constant succes-
sion of pallid youths drop
their aspirates from a port-
able pulpit.
* So that when we come to
the next small cluster, and
find its nucleus is a short
sickly young man in a
highly respectable black
- frock-coat, and with a book
under his arm, it is not unnatural to expect some further exposition
of doctrine, nor is this expectation entirely dissipated by the first
words we are able to hear. - - -
The young man has a weak voice, and his manner is one of studied
self-repression, with a dash of that consciousness of intellectual supe-
riority which a course of miscellaneous reading is apt to induce. He
sees a nasty, “h” looming ahead, and generally negotiates it with
some skill, .# he seems a little shaken on landing,
“The crime of murder, my friends,” he is saying, “is one of those
events which few can be guilty of without their consciences are more
or less haunted by the memory of so awful a deed. This peculiarity
has been noted by some of our greatest poets, and by none more so
than the piece entitled The Dream of Eugene Aram, which, as
some of you may perhaps recollect”—(this with a very dubious
optimism)—“was written by the late Tox. 00hoop. With your
permission, Ishall now endeavour to recite this piece frºm memory.”
The circle of idlers are pressing close round him, and yet one and
all avoid meeting his eye, and maintain a noble British stolidity.
The young man seems to have something to say, and they may as
well stay where they are till they have had enough of it.
And #. young man gives his rendering of the famous poem—a
rendering which, it must be admitted, is consistently tame through-
out. The reek from the pipes, which are within an inch or so from
his nose, makes him cough at all the crises. When he addresses an
impudent Street Arab, who is staring up at him, as “my gentle
boy,” and reminds him that it is, nothing but a dream, the urchin
: suddenly, and plunges through the ring, shrieking with
impish laughter. The pallid youths close by strike suddenly into
i. and our reciter gives a shrug of despair. “Gentlemen,
I’m sorry to interrupt my course, but the opposition is really too
strong for me just 'ere. It's not my desire to say anything against
anyone's opinions; but so much as this I will say, that some people
might employ their spare time far better in storing their minds with
improving literature than what they are owling out ims. I must
ask you all to adjourn with me, where we shall be less disturbed.”
Hereupon he moves on, but his audience remains behind, doubtful,
apparently, whether, their interest is sufficient, or their dignity
sufficiently accommodating, to warrant any additional exertion. At
last one or two bolder spirits shuffle towards him sheepishly, with an
apologetic giggle, and most of the rest drift after them.
“When we were interrupted,” says the Reciter, who has obviously
forgotten all about it, “I had arrived at that portion of the narra-
tive when the murderer—in which the corpse—”
“You was a sayin,” says a surly man, “as you was like a Devil
of the Pit,”
“Quite right,” says the Reciter
without further mishap. When
scholastically, and continues
e leaves ARAM in the mist,
between the two stern-faced men, there is a silence—no face expresses
the slightest emotion, no voice utters a word of thanks, or even
criticism.
But the Reciter is apparently used to this, for he is not in the
least damped, “There is yet another piece by the same hand,” he
opens, “on the companion subject of suicide. Suicide, whether we
A regard it as proceeding from a disordered intellect, or as the result
of-of similar unpleasantness, is liable to serious disapproval, being
calculated to reduce the population. , Some of you, who occasionally
peruse a paper, may have remarked a case of this kind, which is
yery aptly depicted by ToM '0od, and which I shall now have the
honour of repeating by heart before you.”
So, he proceeds to recite the poem, and again there is the same
apathy in the audience; some whisper personal remarks to one
another on his appearance; others look at him with a blank surprise,
as if he was something exhibited in a tent; now and then an old
lady, who has been flitting from group to group sipping theological
honey, like a serious-minded bee, approaches and, discovering her
error, sails off with a volley of very audible sniffs.
“I don't know if I weary you,” he says on concluding, “I can, if
required, repeat passages, for two hours on end, without needing to
refer to any text. I have done as much as two hours and-a-half,
and I'm quite agreeable to going on longer now, if it is the general
wish that I should do so.”
There is another pause; there is no enthusiasm, but no dissent,
and at length a more *.*.*. member of the audience responds,
“Spºut, away if yer like, old man, no one's 'indering of yer!”
which the Reciter, perhaps not without grounds, accepts as warm
encouragement.
“Well,” he concedes, “I shall be º to oblige the company.
Some among you may have studied English Istry, as recorded in º:
learned and luminous pages of YUME and SMoELIT, and will recollect
that great writer's pathetic description of the execution of MARY, the
so-called Queen of Scots. I shall now give you a dialogue she is
supposed to have uttered a few moments before she laid her 'ead on
the fatal block.”
. It would be tedious to follow the young man through the whole of
his programme, which resembles one of those revolving fireworks
which are always about to stop, and suddenly starting again, with a
whiz, and a total change of colour and design.
On returning to his neighbourhood, after various short absences,
we find him alternately exulting over the destruction of Sennacherib,
and explaining what battle is to “Little PETERKIN,” and finally con-
ducting a reduced and exhausted party through portions of the
Deserted Village.
l Wºº the last feat is accomplished, the Reciter stops, satiated at
ength.
“I hope, Gentlemen,” he says, “my efforts to provide you with
mental entertainment of a more intellectual sort t that you get
elsewhere have not been unwelcome. It is coming on dark, and the
night air is not good for my voice, so, with your permission, I’ll
wish you good evening.”
His hearers make no response, with one exception,-a young man,
who offers him a penny, which he declines with dignity.
“You misunderstand,” says the Reciter. “I do what I have done
to-night with no idea of making money by it, only to improve the
popular taste, and lead them, if possible, to read and think for
themselves.”
*The crowd disperses, too indifferent, or, it may be, too shy, to
express any gratitude for his exertions; and the Open-Air Reciter
goes away alone, with the sense of being a public benefactor for his
sole reward.
One cannot help suspecting that, whether he is conscious of it or
not, some more personal motives have been at the bottom of his pro-
ceedings; but who will grudge him a vanity which assumes, so
harmless and well-meaning a form, and which will probably gild his
week's work for him with the recollection of the evening past on
which he had an audience all to himself, and the anticipation of the
evening to come when his innocent excitement may be pº ?
Mr. Punch rather fancies he has met amateurs of far higher
standing whose self-satisfaction and incompetence were not less pro-
nounced, whilst their taste in selection was decidedly inferior to
those exhibited by this humble specimen of the irrepressible race of
reciters, to whom, as he takes a not unkindly leave of him, he will
only wish increased lung-power, and a more demonstrative audience
on the next occasion on which it pleases him to take the field.
Two Jubilee Editions of Shakspeare are to be issued; one, we are
told, is the work of Messrs. IRVING AND MARSHALL, and the other is
brought out by Messrs. WIRTUE. We hope the names are
synonymous,

THE LETTER-BAG of ToBY, M.P.
OUR CHIEF IN A RAGE.
DEAR ToBy, MONTE CARLO, Monday.
I suPPoSE I may as well address you by your proper name. This foolery
about “BYTo” has now, doubtless, served its purpose, and we may be assumed
to have come to our senses. It was RANDoIPH began this, as he does everything
else that is bad. If there had been no “Mr. SPENCER,” there would have been
no “BYTo, M.P.,” and, I daresay you will add, no “Mr. BISHOP.” But I took
that name only for a few days, have cast it off with the cloak, and you can now
address me by my proper name, of which I have no reason to be ashamed.
Since we jº. at the foot of Mount Wesuvius a great deal has happened
for which I hold you directly responsible. If you had only been content to hold
your peace, there would have been no Ministerial Crisis. But you must needs go
writing “Memoirs,” letting cats out of the bag, and otherwise º: the doose
with me and high politics. Why will people write Diaries and Memoirs? Do
you forget what a distinguished lady said in a recent trial about the danger of
writing Diaries? But you plunge in, and bring down about our heads one of the
best built architectural constructions that has been reared formany years, though
I say it that should not. -
Up to the date of the publication of your confounded “Memoir,” everything
was going on swimmingly. Had got TINGTON out here and was gradually
bringing him round. In another week he would haye been entirely with us. The
Prince of Monaco—and though I am seriously displeased with you, I am bound
to admit you managed that business well—has left nothing to be desired. He
has entered into our scheme with an enthusiasm far beyond what might have
been expected from him. ... I daresay you have seen that, paragraph in the
newspapers about him cruising in the Mediterranean “studying the speed of
the ocean currents.” I got that circulated. Fact is, Monaco has been acting
* my emissary in negotiating the Great International Alliance that shall reduce
BISMARCK to his proper º and bring England, under my leadership
back into the place she in Élizabethan days.” In addition tº the ſay ºf
Algiers and the Nights of Malta, whose alliance you secured, Monaco has sworn-
in the Bry of Tunis, the Dogº of Venice, and the ARCHIMANDRITE.
There is no saying what other ramifications this work of statecraft might not
have reached but for your reckless meddling. Everything was working admirably

the stately figure draped in sleeveless cloak, wearing
blue spectacles and entered in the hotel books as “Mr.
BIs Hop,” the Leader of the only genuine Conservative
Party in England. As for Monaco, he was, as we have
seen, engaged in scientific pursuits in the blue Mediter-
ranean. RANDoLPH was lulled to sleep; the Markiss was
in a state of somnolence. In another fortnight or three
weeks we should have been able to throw off all dis-
guises, seize upon the helm of State, and steer the hoary
vessel on to the loftiest pinnacle of national fame. When
you, forsooth, must betray us! I do not accuse you, of
traitorous design, or of Iack of fidelity to me and the
cause. It was stupidity, my dear Toby, crass stupidity.
What followed was easily foreseen. RANDOLPH is a
man of resolution and resource: .You showed our hand;
he trumped it. Never was so fair a game . by the
maladroitness of an inconsiderate confederate. Our
coup de main must ... postponed, perhaps
indefinitely. HARTINGTON has been summoned back by
the Markiss. Monaco is tearing his, hair, and, wants, to
know whether he can get to Central Asia in his yacht.
The Dog E is dazed, the DEY despondent, the BEY baffled,
and the ARCHIMANDRITE seeks solace in strong language.
England's chance of reassuming its place among nations
is sunk in the abyss, and BISMARCK, is more blatant than
ever, And all this because you could not restrain your
too facile pen! I hope at least it will be º you.
As for me, I tarry here awhile, listening with dulled
ears to the croupier's cry, “Lejeu est fait.' On ne va

to be also, surveyed the household with gloomy dignity. .
“SIMox,” said the locksmith, gravely, “how comes it that you
return in this condition ? Give me an assurance that you have not
been among those confounded Radical associates of yours, and I am
satisfied.”
“Sir,” replied Mr. TAPPERTIT, with a contemptuous look, “I
wonder at your assurance in making such a demand.” -
.“MARTHA,” said the locksmith, turning to his wife, and shaking
his head sorrowfully, “I trust it may not turn out that this poor
lad is the victim of the fools and fanatics we have so often had
words about. If he has been at H-wºrd-n or B-rm-ngh-m—”
“He has been at neither, Sir,” cried Mr. TAPPERTIT in a loud voice,
which he suddenly dropped into a whisper as he repeated, with eyes
fixed upon the locksmith, “he has been at neither.’
“I’m glad of it with all my heart,” said the locksmith, in a serious
tone, “for if he had been, and it could be proved against him, our
Great Association would never have forgiven him.” -
“He was not at H-w-rd-n nor at B-rm-ngh—m, G. WARDEN,” said
SIMON, sternly; “but he was at Westminster. Perhaps, Sir, he
snubbed a Metropolitan Member; perhaps, Sir, he tapped a Naval
Lord. You may stare, Sir, I repeat it—perhaps he tapped a Naval
Lord. Who knows? Beware, G. Wahpes! » -
“You |. of MIggs, Sir,” ejaculated Mr. TAPPERTIT, scornfully,
“You spoke of MIggs, ah! and MIggs has spoke of me on several
occasions in a manner I shall not demean myself by describing.
MIggs be smothered l’”
“Oh, SIMMUN l’” ejaculated that lady in a faint voice. “Oh,
Mim! Oh, Sir! Oh, goodness gracious, what a turn he has give me!”
“This party may all be smothered, Sir,” returned Mr. TAPPERTIT,
after glancing at her with a smile of ineffable disdain. “Be warned
in time, G. WARDEN | * -
But here the two women threw themselves in the way—especially
Miss Miggs, who fell upon him with such fervour that, she pinned
him against the wall—and conjured him, in moving words, not to go
forth till he was sober; to listen to reason; to think of it; to take
some rest, and then determine. - - -
“I tell you,” said Mr. TAPPERTIT, “that my mind is made up.
My bleeding, o'ertaxed country calls me, and I go! MIggs, if you
don't get out of the way, I’ll pinch you!” |

[Jasuary 8, 1887.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DRAMA IN OXFORD STREET.
Mr. Punch. You have asked my opinion of Mr. Jon Es's piece—
Mr. Nibbs. Excuse me, Sir. But the author's distinguished name
should be given with the sort of flourish with which it is set off on
the programme, where it is printed thus:- [Produces it.
+. Henry • Arthur • Jones. •+
Pardon my drawing your attention to the fact, Sir, but it is so
- evident that the gentleman who
has put his name to this bill
wishes it to be understood that,
though it is only Jon Es, he is
the Onliest Jon Es, and must be
announced in the arena as
“HENRY (alarums). ARTHUR
(fanfare) Jon Es! (Grand flou-
rish of trumpets).
Mr. Punch. Surely, Mr.
NIRBs, this is a small matter,
which, if it please Mr. Jon Es,
does not hurt us. I was about
to say that the Noble Vaga-
bond, up to the end of the
Second Scene of the Third Act, is as exciting and ingeniously-
contrived a melodrama as one would wish to see. But at this point
just when a strong climax is essential, it collapses in a muádied
situation, which very º disappoints an expectant audience.
Mr. Nibbs. I am entirely of your opinion. . The Scene at the Fair
was spun out with a purposeless boxing-match, and if the Professor
who was floored had o y gºt up and sung, “Oh, what a surprise!
Two lovely black eyes!” the audience could not have been more
astonished than they were at the termination of the Act, though
they might have been more pleased.
Mr. Punch. Then in the last Act, though all that acting can do is
done to re-kindle, the excitement, yet in the scene of équivoque be-
tween the hero, the heroine, and the returned Baronet, there is such
a strong element of comedy, as there must always be in a dialogue
of cross-purposes, that the dramatic instinct of any intelligent audi-
ence is opposed to taking it seriously; and a laugh in the wrong
place is, at such a critical moment, fatal to the melodrama.
Mr. Nibbs. But, Sir, having placed your finger on the weak part
of the play, can you at all suggest how it might have been avoided ?
Mr. Punch. Only by reconstruction. The materials are all
there. The idea of impersonating a murdered man is not, of
course, new, it was done most effectively in Henry Dunbar,<-but
the motive in the Noble Vagabond gives the requisite novelty;
Mr. Nibbs. It struck me that the dialogue was terse and telling.
Mr. Punch. Undoubtedly, and we were not overwhelmed with
sermons and elocutionary essays, which threatened at one time to
become a Princess's tr itioniſi ust, when everybody wanted the
action of the piece to “get on,” and the elocutionist to get off.
Mr. Nibbs. Mr. WARNER is good.
Mr. Punch. It is fair to assume that he realises Mr. Jones's ideal
of a Noble Vagabond as nearly as possible, or he would not be playing
the part. His imitation of Old Scorier is certainly excellent.
Mr. Nibbs. Mr. GEORGE BARRETT, too, is one of our best low
comedians in a homely part like this of the Showman.
Mr. Punch. A part not strikingly º but always popular and
safe. I should like to see Mr. GEORGE BARREIT play Robson's part
in the Porter's Knot. I was delighted with Miss DoRothy DENE as
Maud Deveson; she is thoroughly in earnest.
Mr. Nibbs. She is comparatively a novice.
Mr. Punch. We only heard of her coming out last year, and by
this time she has achieved a very marked success. She is a young
actress of great ºi. and of still greater promise. She
ssesses that spark of dramatic genius which may be fanned into a
ame, not by the ...; of flatterers, which would extinguish it, L
but by the gentle breath of judicious critics. Seeing her so good as
she is—and I much doubt whether there is anybody of her youthful
standing on the stage who could have played this part half as well—I
am inclined to ask where was the stage manager, just to give her per-
formance that finishing touch, which otherwise she can only acquire
by experience, or may, as too º happens, fail to acquire at all?
Mr. Nibbs. I know exactly what you mean, Sir, and suppose that
the fault lies with a defective system of rehearsal. Of the actors I
thought Mr. CARTwRIGHT uncommonly good as the villain, and Miss
ANNIE HUGHEs very nice and sympathetic as Dinah Wimpany.
Mr. Punch. Mr. WALTER 's Scenery is most #.
and appropriate. I shall tell all my friends to go and see this piece for
the sake of Miss DoRothy DENE's performance and Mr. WARNER's
remarkable imitation of the make-up and manner of Mr. JULIAN
CRoss as Old Scorner. I shall warn them against disappointment in
the Third Act. Good evening, Mr. NIBBS. I am going to see the
Extravaganza-Pantomime at the Avenue, where I shall be pleased to
meet you; and next week, perhaps, we can discuss it. Au revoir /
HOW WARS ARE GOT UP.
(By Our Special Foreign Correspondent—but we've stopped him in time.)
VIENNA, Jan. 1st. — Just now I am sure your readers will be
thirsting for a new sensation, in place of the one provided by a recent
cause célèbre, prematurely concluded, so I hasten to wire you a most
extraordinary rumour which is circulating in the highest circles of
this Capital, in which I invariably move. It has reference to the
mental condition of the Emperor of GERMANY. I was talking to-da
to a Diplomatist, whose name, were I to give it to you, which I,
.# can't do, would in itself be a guarantee of the com-
plete credibility of every word he utters, and he assured me, as a
fact, that the German Emperor is under the impression that war
with France and Russia has already broken out, and that BISMARCK
only keeps him quiet by forging bogus telegrams from the seat of
war, describing victories for the Fatherland!. Also, in his occasional
paroxysms that Kaiser WILHELM is in the habit of takingtº:
at passers-by, from one of the windows of the Palace. Unter den
Linden, and the amount of hush-money which the Crown Prince has
º paid to relatives of persons killed in this way is enormous.
An unlucky attendant who hid the Emperor's revolver the other day,
as a measure of precaution, was actually scalped by the infuriated
monarch, and none of his †. come near him without wearin
bullet-proof armour under their Court uniforms, and being provid
with chloroformed handkerchiefs to wave in the aged Kaiser's face
in case of necessity. You can judge from these incidents on how
slender a thread the peace of Europe now hangs.
PARIs, Jan. 2nd.—I may mention, under all possible reserve, a fact
which has just come to my knowledge. General BoulangBR, acting
on a hint from his friend, a sworn ally of the CzAR, has executed a
masterly coup, which forms a Gallic º: to the kidnapping
of Prince ALEXANDER of Bulgaria. You have been informed in
§: trustworthy communications from me that the French War
inister desires an addition of one hundred million pounds sterling
to the French Budget, in order to provide a supply of new epaulettes
and tinned-meats to the Army. Finding M. GoBLET unwilling to
sanction this expenditure, he took down a couple of hundred masked
men, one dark night recently, to the country residence of the Prime
Minister, and surrounding the place so, as to prevent any of the
inmates escaping, forced that Statesman (who at the time was having
a modest supper of anchovy-toast and win ordinaire, preparatory to
retiring to bed) to sign the order to the different manufacturers and
to the Treasury. The apparition of General Boula NGER late at night,
with a sword between his teeth, and a loaded revolver in each hand,
uttering tremendous threats, is stated to have unnerved M. GoBLET,
so that you need not be surprised to hear of his resignation at any
moment, Can anybody doubt, after this, that we are on the eve of
a devastating European conflict?
VIENNA, Jan. 3rd.—I told you before that the Emperor WILLIAM
is now a raging lunatic. His last freak is to imagine himself
a Fasting Man, and to refuse to take any nourishment of any
sort. BISMARCK and MoDTKE have to stand over him, and force him
to eat at the sword's point! BISMARCK has already been twice shot
in the leg, and MoLTRE's cocked hat (which he always wears) has
been carried away by a bullet from his Royal Master, and the
Chancellor and the veteran soldier both threaten to resign in conse-
quence. This intelligence is absolutely authentic. War (against
somebody or other) may be declared at any instant 1
St. PETERSBURG, Jan. 5th.--To-day's Official Messenger has the
following passage:–
“The idea that a great European war is preparing for next spring, is chiefly
kept alive by the hysterical correspondents of certain foreign newspapers.
These journals do not perceive that º: perpetually harping on the subject,
. . themselves helping to produce the catastrophe they pretend to
eprecate.”
Your readers will be able to judge from this extract, that the
Franco-Russo-Germano-Austro-Turko-Italian war is really very
near indeed. I have been busy prophesying it, as you know, for
some time past, but this official communiqué (which, to be under-
stood, must of course, be read as meaning exactly, the contrary, of
what it states) puts the imminence of the conflict beyond a doubt.
I should advise anybody who holds foreign stocks to sell out without
a moment's delay, especially as I have just wired my London broker
to take advantage of the fall, which I trust this telegram will cause,
to buy into most of them, and look sharp about it.
VIENNA, Jan. 6th ºf have just found out that my previous
authentic information about the German Emperor was not quite so
authentic as I thought it. I now have it on unimpeachable
authority that the Kaiser WILHELM is perfectly sane, only rather
feeble from age. I hasten to send you this reassuring intelligence
all the more readily because the member of the Austrian Imperial
family who impa it to me, and who is an intimate friend of mine
seemed quite hurt at my recent statements, and, in fact, threatened
to call me out, if I did not at once retract and *: §:

shot, and practised duellist, renders this task not so much a duty as
a positive pleasure for me to perform. -
St. PETERSBURG, Jan. Tth.—Expect me in London shortly. I am
expelled from Russia by fiat of the Czap! Your readers will remem-
ber that I quoted a short extract from the Official Messenger as to
the chances of a great European War. Unfortunately, nobody here
is allowed to quote from the official journal without leave, so they
say, but I believe it is an excuse. After being chained in a dungeon
to a Nihilist for four-and-twenty hours, as a sort of “first warning
to the Press,” I have been politely told that I must choose between
leaving Russia for England or for Siberia. I don't like to say what
I think of this treatment, as this telegram will have to pass the
official Press Censor; but i reserve for your private ear my reasons
for adhering to the idea that war is absolutely certain, and at no
distant date."

aglow.with the healthy flush of the rouge-pot, and their skins
fair with the sheen of delicate bismuth, and soft with the pearliest
powder... Steel your hearts against such thieves, or they’ll steal
them. , Year after year we are saying, Neyer was there such a scene
as this! Each new Pantomime eclipsing the previous one in scenery
and costumes. Welcome again to our BEVERLEY! It is no dis-
paragement to the other talented artists that the veteran's work is
facile princeps. Long may it be so!
But the fun? Well, on the first night it was only possible to see
where the fun would be after the third or fourth performance, when
the Pantomime works closer, and when the three low comedians,
Messrs. NICHOLLs, CAMPBELL, and STEPHENs, shall be on such
familiar terms with their author as to warrant them in getting along
without his aid. Such names as theirs to a Pantomime bill speak
for themselyes. By the time these lines appear the fun will have
begun. What larks the Donkey (Mr. LAURI) and the Monkey (Mr.
MARTINETTI) will have when they are quite at home for the holidays,
it is, easy to foresee; and that they will be the delight of thousands
of children of all ages is a certainty; but let the two gymnasts
limit their animal spirits to the stage.
As to the story, “the long and short of it” was represented by
Miss EDITH BLAND-BRERETON, six feet high, as the dashing leader
of the harmonious band, with Miss Dot o, three feet nothing,
as her lieutenant. , Miss CoNSTANCE.GILCHRIST was not a very
dashing Morgiana, but Miss EDITH BRUCE, as Ganem, was lively
enough for two. Mr. PATEMAN played the avaricious brother in a
style that shows us he has a soul above pantomime.
, The energy of the Conductor, Herr WALLENstEIN, made up for
the brevity of the Overture, and anything like the enthusiasm with
which this Boxing Night audience, cheered the National Anthem
has not been heard, within the walls of Qld Drury for years. ... It
was a thorough Jubilee thrill that ran through the house. The
*. is costly and brilliant, the designs and the combinations
O it. are in exquisite taste. Augustus DRURIoI.ANUs may
well sing—
Sure such a sight was never seen on the
full of marvels, marvel-
*|in the World's coinage.
“I’m monarch of all I survey;
My right there is none to dispute.
My Pantomime's splendid and gay,
And every taste it will suit.”
True, 0 AUGUSTUs, but, when next Christmastide comes round, I
couldn't you try to give us a shorter Pantomime? couldn't yºu
contrive, to let your opening scenes be in the dark caves, with the
dear old unintelligible demons speaking an unearthly and awful
language? Couldn't you then take us to the fairies, and
genuine ballet of fays, in which the graceful AENEA could have a
É. having by that time invented some novelačrial flight of fancy? |
uldn't you arrange with a F to come and change the lovers
into Harlequin and Columbine, and with a Demon King to turn the
Wicked Baron into Clown, and the miserly old hunks of a father
into Pantaloon? Throw in the swell and the policeman, and there's
your real Christmas party.
AUGUSTUs DRURIoIANUs! There will be—there must be—a reaction
in favour of King Clown, deposed by cabal and not by the voice of
the People. But at the same time one word in the ear of the last of
the great PAYNE-tomime Family, Mr. HARRY PAYNE, whom, to our
j regret, the lateness of the hour prevented us from seeing on
oxing Night; let him prepare during the F. four genuinely
good comic scenes, with new tricks and plenty of irresistible drollery,
so that when his chance comes he may be ready to assert his position
and be himself again. At present C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est
pas le Pantomime.

noon is at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, where Alice in Wonderland

they’ll recognise all Mr. TENNIEI's pictures walking about.” The
Dormouse is delightful, she adds, and the Oysters, charming.
Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee are very funny, and Alice's introduc.
tion to the Mutton and the Plum Pudding—illustrated with “cuts”
—is one of the best things in Messrs. SAVILE CLARKE and EDGAR
BRUCE's entertainment.
MR. C. F. KEARY, we are told, has written an essay, for private
circulation, on the Evolution of Money, and Heredity and Variation
- If he wants, a good Darwinian-sounding
title for his book, he might surely call it “The Origin of Specie.”
“FARJEON SMILES UPON US!”
ORIGINALITY of design, considerable humour and consistent
development of character, combine to make Mr. [FARJEON's The
-- ºt. Tragedy of Featherstone, one of the best
- romances he has written, perhaps the
best from a literary point of view.
But admiring readers of Mr. FARJEoN's
novels, as of Boisgobey's, grudge every
bit of superfluous work, no matter how
good, which distracts their attention from
# the story in which, from the very first
E line of the very first chapter (a great
int with both authors) they have become
º interested. Mr. FARJEoN doubt-
Nº less has frequently sacrificed his own
&4 likings for the sake of his readers, but
\º when he stops in his narrative to depict
§ wº ºt a humorous scene, which is only remotely,
<= sº if at all, connected with the main issue,
--> or when he pauses to give a little extra
local colouring, or to bring into prominence the eccentricities of a
character to whom readers are only friendly as long as he is kept
within his proper limits in the º he forgets his rule of self-
Sacrifice, and tries the patience of his many friends, who resent
being compelled to skip and jump-alighting sometimes in the wrong
places, and having to try back—in order to get on with the tale.
Much of the Cheap Philanthropist, Mr. º: in this story
could well be º, including the school treat; but the revenge of
Tommy Mayple on Thrifty Miller is genuinely humorous, and we
serves its purpose as a “carpenter's scene” in a melodrama., But
Mr. FARJEON's mission, we contend, is not to cause laughter, but to
“make our flesh creep,” which was the Fat Boy's sole aim in
narrating the story of Mr. Tupman and Miss Wardle to the Old
Lady. e must not break off in the midst of unravelling a thrilling
mystery to tell us a good joke. We may laugh at it, if it is a really
good one, but we #. it over as quickly as politeness will allow, and
say, earnestly, “Proceed! Your story interests us much.” The
Tragedy of Featherstone is exciting, humorous, pathetic, and
always interesting.

OFFICIAL MINUTES.
WE have received the following particulars
from the Admiralty and War Office regarding
the British War Preparations. It will be at
once seen that these are of a character
calculated to alarm the British Tax-
payer:-
THE NAVY.
1. Seven men and a boy will be immediately
added to the strength of the Royal Navy, to
assist in washing up the crockery on the Royal
Yachts.
2. Aº Jubilee violin will be
º to our Royal Admiral as his rosin
'étre.
3. The purchase of two of the river
steamboats to relieve the Channel Fleet in
the event of foreign complications. These
will be armed with a new telescopic gun—
which can be discharged at both ends at once,
—and manned by the Unemployed.
4. The construction of a two-thousand-ton
gun will be commenced immediately, with a
breech action of such elaborate and delicate
construction that it is thought that nobody
will care to go within half-a-mile of it, should
it ever be loaded.
5. H.M.'s ships, Incapable, Unsteerable,
Harmless, Blunderer, and Unmanageable,
will be at once pressed forward, and will pro-
ceed to sea without either guns or ammunition,
THE ARMY.
1. New cocked hat for the Duke, warranted
to go off.
2. New Rule for Line Regiments. – “Chil-
dren in arms not admitted.”
3. The sending out of a complete Foodless
Battery of Artillery for the defence of the
North-West frontier of India.
4. The purchase of six cab-horses for
remounts in the heavy cavalry regiments.
GENERALLY.
A new button-hole is now º:
attention of the Military Authorities. ell
approved, it will be sent to Aldershot for
trial with the old buttons.
It is under consideration to enter into a
contract with the Universal Provider, on ad-
vantageous terms, for the supply of two
regiments—one infantry and one cavalry—
complete, and warranted ready for active
Service.

IN THE FIRST OLYMPIAD.
TheRE has not been seen in London, within the recollection of
anyone under thirty, anything equal to the Hippodrome perform-
ances now daily and nightly going on at Olympia. It does not enter
into rivalry with a circus entertainment.
The comic business is confined to the acrobatic and pantomimic
actions of two twin Drolls, who may be termed the Hippodromios,
and then the donkey and his master, are highly amusing. The race
of unridden steeds is a very pretty thing to see, and as regards all
these races, if the same horses always run, it is highl §.
that the result is invariable, and a sharp frequenter of Olympia
might do a good bit of business with casual visitors.
The Roman Games are a feature, though the Roman Feature it-
self is conspicuous by its absence. The chariot-racing is very
exciting.
During an interval of twenty minutes, which might be shortened
with advantage, the servants set up an extensive country scene,
composed of pieces *...i a mill, capable of holding a full-
grown family of six, a bridge that would bear a regiment, a stream
of painted canvas, trees, hedges, gates, a forge, tables and chairs,
all suggestive of having come out of a box of Christmas toys for
Giant's children, and of their having been laid out here in this
picturesque fashion-quite a hamlet—for the Brobdingnagian infants
to come and play with them. No Giants appear, but there is a ballet
of action, from which it appears that a young peasant is deeply
enamoured of the Maid of the Mill, and persists, in his demonstra-
tions of affection in spite of being warned off by the maiden's mother,
an elderly lady of peculiar habits and vulgar manners, who slides
down the mill-stairs, displaying more underclothing than is
ordinarily consistent with good breeding, and who, when speciall
aggravated by things going contrary, expresses her disgust, wit
everybody by throwing sommersaults and behaving generally in
such a way as we should have thought would have disgusted any
youthful aspirant for her daughter's hand, with the prospect
of saddling himself for life with so undesirable and extraordinary a
mother-in-law. However, he is madly in love, and the ...i
gentleman pleads his cause and he is married, and everyone connec
with the Hippodrome drives to the wedding and witnesses a dance
between the newly married couple. In these festivities there is a
wonderful doll, well worth seeing... “Oh, what a surprise!”
Then comes the stag-hunt; ladies and gentlemen, well mounted,
jump the i. and hedges, race over the bridge, one lady clearing a
table and bottles, and, the do having gone after the stag, the stag at
. apparently, goes to the dogs. Capital afternoon ente ent
or
ys home from the Classics during the present Olympiad.
TURNING OVER NEW LEAVES.
(By Our Own Paper-Knifer.)
SPIDERs of Society (F. W. WHITE & Co.), according to Miss FLO-
RENCE MARRYAT, are mostly women, and men are the flies that are
victimised in the webs they weave around them. The writer of this
novel being of the fair sex, it is absolutely impossible that she could
say anything unfair of her sisters. A woman's thoughts about
women are always refreshing; and though Miss MARRYAT does nºt
make the mistake of putting too much bitters in her sherry, she adds
just enough to give piquancy to an amusing story. Randolph Calde-

the time he was in the bank at Whitchurch, to 1879. To his “pic-
ture-book career” this volume is especially dedicated. It has over one

tion of Mr. Punch—and by the study of these we are able to appreciate
the wonderfully graphic power and versatility of the artist, to see what
marvellous work he did, though dying before the zenith of his powers

He writes in a popular style, but at the same time he conveys a large
amount, of , information in a palatable, form. The illustrations,
although phototype reproductions of photographic negatives, are
also, on account of their artistic merit, of distinctly “pallette-able”
form. Among them visitors to the Zoo will recognise capital por-

[JANUARY 8, 1887.
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. XI.-SEPTIMUs Swallum, THE ConFIRMED HypochoNDRIAc.
IT is now quite ten years ago since SEPTIMUs Swall UM may be
said, to use his own graphic language, fairly to have “broken up.”
Yet he is still about. Any
afternoon you may meet him
being dragged towards the
Park in a Bath-chair, wear-
ing on his face that expression
of aggressive scowl that
seems characteristic of the
blighted fraternity who usu-
ally patronise those invalid
vehicles; yet if š. stop him,
and tell him, which is prob-
ably a fact, that you think
him looking much better, he
will resent it almost as an
insult, and reply, with a
smile of sickly sarcasm, “Am
I? Well, I wish I felt so,”
that leaves you no courteous
alternative but to express a
regretful ... sympathy, an
inquire after his symptoms.
These he will catalogue to
you, dwelling on their worst
features almost with relish,
and they certainly are suffi-
ciently appalling. . Indeed,
as he is jolted out of sight in
his conveyance amidst the
crowd, you look after him with a feeling of wonder how, taking him
at his own account, he can manage to hold together at all. Yet
SEPTIMUs Swallum was not always thus. Ten years ago, before his
“break-up,” he was what he called a regular liver.
“I can't put my finger on anything in my present mode of life,”
he said, addressing the eminent practitioner whom he first consulted
as to his state of health at the time, “to account in the least for my
existing symptoms.” He had been describing an overwhelming
sense of lassitude that oppressed him in the morning, coupled with a
sensation as if the . Were . under his feet as he walked
home at night, together with a ten º to see two of everything—
two doors, two windows, two shaving-glasses, two sets of fire-irons,
and two newspapers, accompanied by a sharp Pang something between
a kick and a stab in his back. “And yet,” he continued, “I’m a
moderate man, and very careful about my food. I, dine out a good
deal, and am what you may call a hearty feeder, and I mix my wines
pretty freely, and I’m fond of nuts, but I don't overdo it. . Then in
the course of the day I may take an occasional “nip’ as a pick-me-up,
and I generally finish up with a ‘nightcap' when I go to bed, but I’m
confident I don't do anything to put me out of order in this fashion.”
The eminent practitioner listened attentively, and giving his
patient a prescription, in which the chief ingredient was a combina-
tion of potassium, and enjoining on him a daily diet of two under-
done mutton-chops, and half a wine-glass of claret, took his two-
guinea fee, and smilingly bowed him out.
SEPTIMUs Swall UM tried his diet of underdone mutton-chops for
three days, but finding, at the expiration of that period, that the
ground swayed about under, his feet more than ever, resumed his
nuts, his nips, and his nightcap, and, making up his mind that
something must be the matter with his head, determined to consult
a famous specialist, noted for his success in treatment of obscure
diseases of the brain. The interview took place, and the famous
specialist, shaking his head blandly over the eminent practitioner's
prescription, wrote out another, in which this time phosphorus, an
not potassium, figured º: Moreover, he removed all re-
strictions in the matter of diet, advising a “generous table,” and
SEPTIMUs Swallum left him, hopeful and satisfied. -
But neither his hope nor his satisfaction were destined to be of
long duration. Not only was there no abatement, in the old
symptoms, but on the third day of the new treatment fresh and
| alarming ones, of a novel character, developed themselves, , and
SEPTIMUs SwalluM, when sitting down, or rising from his chair,
suddenly saw sundry luminous balls and stars floating, about the
room before his eyes. This frightened him. He expressed his opinion
“that something must be very wrong with him,” and the very next
morning he put his case into the hands of a celebrated nerve doctor.
The celebrated nerve doctor was equal to the occasion. He
quietly discontinued the phosphorus, but gave him instead a powerful
acid tonic that, after a dose or two, bound an iron, band round
SEPTIMUs Swaii, UM's head, and set up a singing in his ears that
inearly deafened him and robbed him entirely ºf all sleep.
Then he grew desperate, and beat about wildly in search of fresh
advice. He consulted another specialist—this time fixing on one
noted for his, success in dealing with spinal mischief—and was
treated liberally with nux vomica and strychnine, with the result
that his facial muscles began to twitch convulsively, while a sudden,
everpowering constriction set up simultaneously in his hands, arms,
back, and legs. Then he decided that the doctors were killing him;
and determined to take his case, as he put it, “into his own hands.’
This he did by having recourse to Patent Medicines. ... It was a
sombre and severe experience, for in turns he tried them all! Indeed
those who came across him during the progress of the experiment
describe his condition at the time as apparently “much shattered.”
He lost flesh visibly, and by the end of a twelvemonth had come to
the conclusion that drugs were even more, deadly than doctors, and,
in this frame of mind, stretching out his hands for succour, he had
it thrust into them in the shape of an advertising pamphlet on the
...}}. of Galvanism. He turned to it with the alacrity of despair,
and forthwith invested in all the known appliances of the hidden
recuperative force. He now walked about incased in belts, chain-
bands and batteries. He went even further.
Those who called upon him when in the full flood of this phase of
his therapeutic career, would find him frequently seated on a
metallic plate, holding in his right and left hand, respectively the
positive and negative pole of a seventeen-guinea battery that was
simmering on a table before him. Three months of this, however,
“took it out” of him, and he became hysterical, and in this condi-
d|tion he fell into the willing hands of the proprietor of a great Hydro-
pathic Sanitorium.
“You are poisoned with drugs, Sir,” remarked the enterprising
º heartily, “but we must eliminate them from the system,”
and so saying he instantly “packed” SEPTIMUs Swall UM up in a
damp sheet. The result of this “treatment” was, that after three
months of it, he found himself so feeble that it was with a positive
effort he broke away from it, scarcely able to hobble to the fly that
took him to the station.
“Eliminate poison from the system, indeed!” he cried, threatening
the proprietor of the establishment with exposure as he left; “why
you have eliminated nothing but my strength; but you have add
chronic rheumatism to my other symptoms with your confounded
cold water. You ought to be prosecuted.” And so fuming, he
dragged himself up to town, where he sought relief from the mischief
induced at the Sanatorium, for a short time, in a system of Scandi-
navian Massage, that he however soon abandoned, declaring that it
only aggravated his pains, and made matters ten times worse, and
from this period he may be said slowly but surely to have descended
the remedial ladder, clutching wildly at and giving a temporary trial
first to this nostrum then to that, suggested in turn by officiously
advising friends.
. A broken-down, battered, nervous, dyspeptic individual—such
is SEPTIMUs Swallum at present; and it is not easy to say what
possible further downward developments await his shattered con-
stitution. It is true he still has the experience of the famous
German, and other Continental Spas open to him; but such is his
terror of damp beds and draughts, and so strong is his disinolination
to move out of his own arm-chair, and away from his own fireside,
that he is not likely, except in a state of coma, to try the experiment,
and be found whisking away in some foreign express, even though
propped up by india-rubber hot-water bottles, and supported by
continuous “nips” of brandy from a medicine glass., For when he
is persuaded to leave his home to pay a short visit, he carries into
the house of his temporary host all the discipline and paraphernalia
of a hospital, and both breakfasts and lunches in bed, sleeps in a
flannel bag, and when he does appear in the drawing-room, sits apart,
wrapped up in a blanket, gazing at the fire in a settled gloom, which
no conyersational powers of those present, be they practised with ever
such skill, are able not only not to dispel but even to penetrate.
But if you manage º any change to draw SEPTIMUs Swall UM out
of that inner contemplation of himself which is now his habitual
d|mood, and get him to hold forth, for a few minutes on any subject
whatever, you will quickly find him relapse into the one congenial
topic that is ever *. in his thoughts—his symptoms, upon
which dilating for a few moments with nervous, insistance, he how-
ever soon relapses into his settled and familiar gloom.
“What I go through with º knows,” he complains, with a
melancholy wail. “I don't sleep. don't eat. I scarcely live. I
can hardly see you where you stand, or hear what you say...That
has come on only lately. But it gets worse every day. ! if
you had only to go through half that I have, you’d precious soon cry
out, I can tell you!” - - -
Very likely! Poor SEPTIMUs Swall UM! A victim P. Yes—but a
victim to himself. For it seems with all his aches, and his pains, his
experiences, and his treatments, he has never got out of certain old
§ habits. He still sticks to his nuts, his nips, and his nightcaps, and
as, whatever else he may do, to the end he will never relinquish these,
he is destined, to the close of his mournful mortal days, to be known
among men, to the sport of his foes, to the terror of his friends,
as that recognised social incubus, a confirmed hypochondriac!

THE CLOWN’S LAMENT.
* WHAT has become of your fun and frivolity?
Where is the laughter that lifted the roof?
Gone are the highest of jinks and of fºliº,
Holiday spirits are under the proof! . . .
Where is the merriment blue devils banishing,
Sending a thrill through the heart of the town
Gone with old friends .# vanishing–
This is the weary Lament of the Clown!
Pantomime past, can we never recover it,
See it º, in its glory alive? .. -
If under down-trodden grass we discover it,
Who will have faithin the past to revive?
Is there no magic once more to restore to us
Laughter of little ones?, childhood of man?'.
Can it be true that sweet fancy’s a bore to us?
Who placed the fairy tales under a ban?
Ah! for the days when the curtain unclosed to us
Regions of mystery, demon and sprite!
Who can forget how all Fairyland posed to us,
Some in pink tarlatane, others in white!
Those were the times when the giant's voice stormed to us
Out of a mask of Dykwynkyn renown;
Happy the hour when the fairy transformed to us
Silly young farmer to jolly old Clown
Then came a voice pealing out from the gallery,
“Give us, old friend, of ‘PIot Codlins’ a taste.
‘Tippitivitchet l'—it's all in your salary-
Tip us a stave, you old rascal! make haste!”
Who could be weary when slides were a-buttering P
Days of hot poker and sausage galore! -
Out, neck and crop, they’d have turned a fool muttering,
“Don’t you think Harlequinades are a bore ?”
If it be true that mutantur our tempora,
That nos et mutamur in illis as well,
Far better to call for a halter of hemp or a
Gallows to strangle the past as a sell! .
Tradition lies dead, with a pall for a covering
Of satins and silks and fantastic brocade;
But over its §§ bier there are *ś
Ghosts of delight that new fashion has laid!
Where is the end to this jewelled magnificence,
Gorgeous processions, and money in heaps?
Cannot a pantomime fairy's beneficence
Change it as quick as a Harlequin leaps?
Is there no hope that, remote as a star away,
A dynasty banished will rule us again?
Recalling our vanished companions from far away,
That innocent laughter may ring through the Lane !
One cheer for the past, when its perfume is tost to us!
GRIMALDI and FLEXMoRE, their spirits are free;
But the soul of pure Pantomime never is lost to us,
When merry Tom MATTHEws lives down by the sea!
So in bumpers of port that is nutty and nourishing,
Let us toast to their names and their deathless renown,
And in days when the last of the PAYNEs is still flourishing,
Let us claim a reprieve for the Jolly Old Clown!
BUMBLE AT BAY.
SIR,--Your Correspondents, who complain of the “apathy and imbecility of
all the London Westries in dealing with the snow nuisance,” can hardly be aware
of the facts with regard to the parish which I have the honour to represent. The
recent heavy snow-fall took place between eight and ten on a Sunday evening,
and in the incredibly short space of thirty-six hours from that time my Westry
had not only met to consider what should be done, but actually exhausted them-
selves so much in discussing the subject that refreshments of a rather expensive
character had to be supplied to them at the cost of the ratepayers! What, Sir,
was the result of this public-spirited action? Why, in the course of the very
next day fifteen infirm old men and an orphan lad were engaged as scavengers,
attracted by the promise of the really munificent wages of *ś.
pence for aday's work of twelve hours. Isitfair to blame the Westry if these men
proved so hopelessly inefficient that a deputation of indignant ratepayers called
at the Westry Hall, and threatened to lynch the office-boy—the only official then
on the premises? Is it just to point out that ten times the number of men ought
to have been hired, or to make unfeeling allusions to the fact that all the fifteen
were found drunk in the gutter, and that the orphan lad most ungratefully ran
away with the wheelbarrow and spade that were supplied to him, and has not
been seen since P Certainly not, at least in the opinion of
Yours obediently, SIMON SLowcoACH,
Clerk to the Guzzlington Vestry.
SIR,-The Westry which I belong to can hardly be accused of slackness in the
matter of using snow-ploughs. A timber-merchant, whose brother is on the
Westry, kindly consented to construct twenty at the low price of one hundred
pounds a-piece, and the Chairman, who is himself an eminent Contractor,
generously offered to supply teams of four horses for each plough, at the
moderate rate of ten pounds a team per diem! Not only has all the snow in our
parish been cleared away (at the cost to the ratepayers of a mere bagatelle of
three thousand pounds, so far), but the ploughs were of such a powerful nature
that, through some trifling error in their construction, a good deal of the wood
pavement in our main thoroughfares has also been scraped up, and rendered
totally unfit for traffic. The relaying of the wood will give employment to
hundreds of workmen for some time to come, under the able superintendence of
one of the Westry, who happens to be Managin g Director of the “Patent Com-
pressed Sawdust Paving Company, Limited.” The publication of these facts
ought to put a stop to the croakings of penurious ratepayers, and show the
Westry, besides, what an admirable (and insufficiently remunerated) Surveyor
they possessin Yours, TIMOTHY TAXEM.
For the Vestry of the Parish of St. Jobbery's,
IIanwell Square.
SIR-Nobody can regret more than my Westry does the fact that the method
of stacking the mingled snow and refuse of the streets in front of private houses,
and leaving it there for weeks, should be a source of annoyance to the various
residents in different parts, of London who haye, written to complain on the
subject. But I can assure them that in course of time they will learn to regard
the snow-heaps, as quite picturesque, and when the summer comes they will

said to have been enjoying the society of Douglas JERRoll, TENNIEL (who
wasn't there), and so forth, was about eight years old. Perhaps, being very
recocious, he stole out of the nursery. Lastly, SHIRLEY BRooks was not a

“Many people like to pose as ‘hosts,” but not in the sense of

TRUE, genial Doctor! Curious use of terms,
To call him "host” who’s feasted on by germs!
With horror it must fill us,
To think that hospitality's New Years' guests
May be nought else than parasitic pests,
Bacterium or Bacillus.

'Tis hardly nice to picture their poor lungs
A field for germ-contention.
Latinised parasites perchance to yºu
Have many charms; we feel we'd rather do
ithout their intervention.
Still, if to such strange guests we must be “hosts,”
We trust you'll justify CANTANI's boasts,
And make them few, not many,
Nay, rather that Bacteria and Bacill;
May kill each other out, Sir, willy-nilly,
Like cats of famed Kilkenny.

A WINTER GARDEN.
FAT children, and food-stuffs, and holly,
The tributes of Art to his sway,
And the struggle all round to be jolly,
Have vanished with Christmas away.
But, true to the season, the weather
Has banded again with the Parks,
To start on the war-path together
For a glacial epoch of larks.
When pale snows on ice-levels glinter,
What cheer for the sun-loving souls
Who seek to escape from the winter
Unaided by skating or coals?
Though frost the broadgravel-path hardens,
The glasses are beaded with dew;
Though it’s desolate out in the gardens,
There's life in the greenhouse at Kew.
Good-bye to the reign of December,
To boughs that are leafless and wet;
From the fires of the summer an ember
Keeps warm the chrysanthemums yet.
Narcissus and tulip and lil
The siege of the season abide,
While the fog-demons chubby and chilly
Throng thriftless and baffled outside.
They stand the dull atmosphere scorning,
Like beautiful captives arow,
As white as the mists of the morning, |
Or flushing like sunset on snow.—
The dress of a fairy of fashion
So much of the fugitive Summer
Is caught in the crystalline cage,
That the thought of sweet Spring, the new-
Whose skirt a wet rainbow has swept;
The cheek of a pearl in a passion
Whº a moonbeam has kiss'd while she
slept.
Fast-frozen the grey grass beseeches
A token of hope for the lawn
From the high-tow'ring poplars and beeches,
The wind-whisper'd watchtow’rs of dawn.
But we turn from the climate of Sweden
To breathe the perennial balm,
Where aisles like the alleys of Eden
Are arch'd by the fronds of the palm.
And silvered, unyex'd by the raw gust,
Benignant, and happy and hot,
Is lull'd by that music of August,
The clank of the watering-pot.
Where gardeners, passive and pensive,
Their leisurely labours pursue,
And tropical trunks, comprehensive,
In charity hide them from view.
Though man, more and more, with his crass
works
Profanes this sweet Goshen of trees,
Though Brentford, with whistles and gas-
works,
Claims more than its share of the breeze,
comer,
Makes mirth of Jack Frost and his rage.
The River, again, in the twilight
Gleams silvery grey like a dove,
And birds twitter clear in the shy light
That dawns upon April and love.

A SHILLINGPS-WORTH OF OLD MASTERS.
MR. PUNCH presents his com-
liments to that Old Master,
. C. HoRSLEY, R.A., and Trea-
surer to the Royal Academy.
Never has this energetic Acade-
mical Official discharged his office
with greater ability than on this
occasion, when he has collected
these invaluable treasures, and
stored them, for the winter, under
the roof of Burlington House.
The very man to do this sort of
thing capitally is JoHN CLOTHES
HoRSLEY, and well he “knew'd”
it. Ahem!
The arrangements are excel-
lent, and we may say thoroughly
carried out, as on our arrival
under the portico we were con-
fronted by two splendid Con-
stables in an excellent state of
preservation. Their colour was
as good as could be expected con-
sidering the atmosphere in which
they were exhibited, and their tone left nothing to be desired.
After confiding our gold-stick-in-waiting to the custody of the
Charon below, who has the entire control of the Styx,--a wise pre-
caution, as so many umbrellas, canes, and crutches, if carelessly
carried up-stairs, would be used as “maul-sticks”-we, after receiv-
ing a Catalogue from an Art-Commissioner in uniform, upon whom
we bestowed a small silver medal, ascended the staircase, preceded
by several people in full dress (it was uncommonly cold), and were
received by the working Models, the presiding, Genii of the place,
who lead, what appears to our ted mortal intelligence, a monoto-
nous existence, with “No change” from, day to day, and ever
attracting the notice of visitors with much the same enticement that
is offered by the photographer's touts to the passers-by-"This stile
one shilling.”
Need we say that our loyal instincts at once led us to the Third
Gallery, where inspired by a happy thought for the Jubilee Year,
the Providential Treasurer has º: 117, The First Council of
Her Majesty the Queen, painted Sir DAVID WILKIE, R. A.—needless
to say a most interesting picture—showing the youthful QUEEN looking
rather pale and nervous, the Marquis, of LANSDown E, with a very
comic expression on his face, not unlike the portrait of LISTON as
Paul Pry, and next to him the Lord CHANCE Lonfrowning severely
on such untimely levity, the Duke of WELLINGTON blushing and
the burly Duke of Sussex, with his black skull-cap on, a blank
F. of paper before him, and a pen in his hand, looking as though
e were going to pronounce sentence and sign a death-warrant; and
No. 118, The Queen's Coronation, where the Duke of WELLINGTox
with a drawn sword stands over'the kneeling QUEEN, with all the
air of a Lord High Executioner awaiting the signal. This is painted
by C. R. LESLIE, R. A.—No. 119, Portrait of Her Majesty, by Sir
MARTIN ARCHER SHEE, P. R. A.—portrait of “ º * Shee”–
and No. 120, “Christening of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales,” where
the royal infant is indeed”. bonnyboy,” and the Duke of WELºng-
ToN again appears as the executioner, quite enough to frighten any
child if he stepped forward, but once more blushing, -he is blushing

No. 115. “Pan and Syrina.” By RUBENs. Ahem! Next to
this we should expect to see “The Treasurer, R.A., rubens.”
And last, but perhaps greatest, is No. 93. “Portrait of Martin
Looten.” By REMBRANDT. What superb painting ! But someone
else had a hand in this besides Old Master REMBRANDT, and that is Old
Father Time, the softener, the mellowist. Father Time is a wonderful
colourist. Ślow, but, very sure is his method, where he has good
material to work upon. And this
picture, does it not tell its own
story? Why, certainly. . Regard
it. 'Look at that wonderful right
hand in that marvellously uncom-
fortable attitude. It is ...;
i fingers are lost in the pleats of
: the coat. What does this indicate
but pain.” A sharp stitch in his
side, perhaps one of those power-
ful ones which, coming in time

twinge?_Glance at his left
hand? What do you see ? A
writing signed. Yes: it is a pre-
scription. Now, cast your eye up
to his face. It expresses con-
temptuous incredulity. . He is
evidently saying to his physician
--- - - “I feel my pain here (indicating
tº) just as bad as ever: this prescription hasn't done me any good!”
And the title? Epigrammatic and expressive, “No Fees.”
This is all we have time for to-day. Perhaps we may visit the
place º perhaps we mayn't. A good deal depends on any
j ing made about a beautiful agate-headed, gold-mounted
umbrella, which, in a moment of abstraction, we took out of the
hands of the Guardian of the Styx, who mistook our ticket, No. 66,
for No. 99...But we're an Old Master, and know what a real work of
Art is. “Burlington House, adoo!” we cried, as we hurried down
the steps, for we were late for tea, and we always go home to tea.
At, the last moment we fancy, in the distance, we hear some one
calling out after us, hoarsely. But, as we are not HoRSLEY, we don't
stop. Once more, Old Masters, adoo!

AND SNUFFED ouT AT PARIs,

THOUGH BARELY SURVIVING THE HORRORS OF THE

ARRIVED ExPECTANT AND HoPEFUL IN THIs Country;
WHERE,
WELCOMED on THE BACK-STAIRs of THE FoREIGN OFFICE BY
LoRD IDDESLEIGH,
ENTERTAINED AT LUNCHEoN BY THE LORD MAYOR,
AND INSPECTED BY THE PREMIER AT HATFIELD,
THEY LEARNT RAPIDLY TO APPRECIATE AT ITS FULL WALUE THE
DEPTH of THE SYMPATHY FELT BY THE BRITISH PUBLIC
FOR THEIR CAUSE, THEIR COUNTRY, AND THEMSELVES.
DRAGGED BY SoMEONE DURING THE LAST Hours of THEIR STAY
DOWN TO BRIGHTON, To VISIT THE AQUARIUM,
THEY FINALLY QUITTED THESE SHOREs on FRIDAY LAST,

AND HAVE NOW RETURNED TO THE MIDST OF THAT DOMESTIC CHAOS

FROM WHICH THEY MAY PERHAPS REFLECT
THAT, ON THE WHOLE, THEY MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE DONE BETTER

“OH, Poor ROBINSON CRUSOE 1 "
. As some evidence that the legitimate Harlequinade is still attraº-
tive, we can point to the one comic scene that follows the three Acts
of the ºft. Extravaganza Robinson Crusoe, which we believe
was to have been called Arthur
Roberts on , Crusoe, -at the
Avenue Theatre, and which, for
practical is better than
anyone of them, or the whole
three combined. True that Mr.
WILKINson, as Clown, is not
remarkably humorous, nor is
Mr. AsHLEY exceptionally comic
as Pantaloon; Mr. FRED
STOREY, though very nimble, is
a storey too high for Harlequin;
but . ARTHUR RoBERTs is
inimitablydroll as the Policeman,
and Miss §. BROUGHTON is
the sweetest Columbine since the
first one we ever.saw, with whom
we fell head over ears in love,
and for whose beauz yewar we
would have sacrificed oranges,
toffy, and weekly allowance.

she dances a pas it is grand.

chose; and, after Miss CATHERINE WAUGHAN, she has not her equal
on the stage for a style which, as something between the finished
performance of the highly-trained première danseuse of the ballet
and that of the burlesque actress, has a charm peculiarly its own.
The piece is too long, and unfortunately the best of it is in the
First Act and the comic scene which follows the Third Act. Mr.
STOREY and Mr. ATKINs, not our old former “WILL ATKINS,” but a
very comic dwarf, are capital as the two acrobatic bailiffs., Miss
WADMAN has §. to sing, but nothing worth hearing; and even
Mr. ARTHUR Roberts' songs, in spite of his mirth-provoking
business, are not particularly good. But he himself is i.
droll, and so genuinely popular, that his admiring audience laug
not only at any nonsense he says or does, but they laugh in
anticipation of what it is probable he may be going to say or do.
In fact, so distinctly is the success due to Mr. ARTHUR ROBERTS,
that a first-night audience, instead of crying out, “Authorl Author.”
would have been justified in calling loudly, “ARTHUR / ARTHUR.'
The sole vocal and musical success is achieved by Miss
“Sally in Our Alley”, so charm-
LYDIA YEAMANs, who sings -
f our visit at all events, to obtain a
ingly as, on the night 9 -
triple encore, so genuine, hearty, and unanimous, that it seemed as
if the audience were delighted to have an opportunity of showing
how thoroughly they ...; appreciate anything º good. There
was a ring about the encores #. this j very different from the
polite and mechanical rapture exhibited on other occasions, when the
singers, thinking that half “a hand” was better than no applause,
had smirkingly bowed their acknowledgments and had lost no time
in recommencing their ditties.
There is a show of girls of the accepted extravaganza pattern, who
deliver the author's jº. in that clear, crisp and telling manner
for which the LottſEs, ToTTIES, CoNNIEs, Wiggies, and Georgies,
are jº. We say “witty lines,” as they are the produc-
tion of Mr. REECE, and though we unfortunately could not catch
much that was being uttered, yet, as the young ladies appeared
§ ighted with what they were saying, we felt sure that what
had elicited a laugh from them must be highly diverting, and so we
smiled, tºº.º.
Mrs. MACINToSH, as the Queen, looks, to quote a popular classic,
“very fine and large,” and is ably seconded by Jam Jam, one of the
sweetest of the suite, gracefully played by Miss JANE STEER.
When the public is tired of the quaint drolleries of Mr. ARTHUR
ROBERTS, the grace of Miss PHYLLIs as Columbine, and the “Sall
in Our Alley” as sung, by Miss YEAMANs, it will be tired of this
piece at the Avenue, and they’ll 'ave a new piece.
MANY thoughtless Peºple, on seeing the title Persia as it Is, would
be inclined to say, “Shah!”—but no one who looks within, Dr.
WILLs's book will say “Pshawl?” to its contents. The author from
his long residence in the country, and his position as hakim, or
É. had special opportunities for observation of which he has
ly availed himself. You get the
- - fºur article in this volume-
indeed a gutta-persia of the best quali
ty.
LoRD Rowton is very busy just now. He has been “repeatedly
calling” on everybody concerned in the recent double-shuffle, and
would never take “Not at home” as an answer to his knock. He
should have an addition to his title—“Lord RowTON-'EM-UP.”

“THERE's a friend of mine waiting outside,” said the portly per-
sonage on the round table, “I’ll call in, with your leave.”
j this he stepped to the door, and looking down the street
beckoned several times to some unseen person, who, to judge from
the air of impatience with which these signals were accompanied,
required a great quantity of persuasion to induce him to advance. At
length there sauntered up, on the opposite side of the way—with a
d pretence of passing by accident—a figure conspicuous for a cer-
tainobvious attemptatsmartness, which, after a good manyfrowns and
jerks of the head, in resistance º of the ºlimately
crossed the road, and was brought into the Council Chamber... . .
. “There! It's Dick SwrvKLLER,” said the portly one, pushing him
in with an air of swelling satisfaction, which sat naturally upon his
sleek and complacent countenance. “Sit down, SwivKLLER.”.
*But is the old Min agreeable?” said "Mr. swivenee in an
undertone. -
.“Sit down,” repeated his companion, sotto voce, “have a talk with
, and see how he takes it.”
Mr. SwiveLIER complied, and looking about him with a complacent
smile, observed that it had been fine weather for ducklings—especially
daring ones—but that just now there was a deal of dust flying; he
also remarked that judging from the appearance and demeanour of
an Irish pig, which come under his observation, dirty weather
would probably ensue. -
“But what,” said Mr. SwrvKLLER with a sigh, “what is the odds
so long as the bonds of Union are tightened by mutual understand-
ing, and, the wing, of party friendship never moults, a feather!
What is the odds so long as kindred spirits are brought together by
means of a modus rivendi, and the present moment is the most
dissentient of our existence 1”
“You needn't
here,” suggested
pant of the chair.
“FRED!” cried Mr. SwrvKLLER, º his nose, “a word to the
wise is sufficient for them. We may good and ha º without
being cocks o' the walk or even Perpetual Grand Old Presidents.
Say not another syllable. I know my cue; smart is the word. Only
one little whisper, FRED–is the Old Min friendly?” ..
“Don’t ask too many questions—yet,” replied his friend.
“Right again—quite right,” said Mr. SwivKLIER... “Caution is
the word, and caution is the act.” With that he winked with a
vigour which nearly dislodged his eye-glass, and then readjusted it
with solicitous care and profound gravity.
The Old Man sat in his chair apart, and, with folded hands, which
retained tight hold of an official-looking document, glanced sometimes
at the portly one, and sometimes at his smart companion, as if he
were entirely neutral, and intended, for the present, to leave them
to do pretty much as they pleased. The portly one reclined against
the table, atno great distance from his friend, looking the very incar-
nation of combined self-complacency, and diplomatic astuteness.
The silence was not of long duration, for Mr. SwiveLLER, after
favouring the party with several melodious assurances, that, though
reasons of one sort or another had lately, taken him to Istamboul
England, even in preference to Athens, held his heart and soul, an
that he desired but to resume, on his own terms, his seat at the Table
Round, “the goodliest fellowship of noble Nobs, whereof this world
holds record,” as a preliminary to the achievement of great feats of
valour and loyalty. After these poetic prolusions, Mr. SwivKLLER
removed his eyes from the ceiling, and subsided into prose again.
“FRED,”, said he, stopping short, as if the idea had suddenly
occurred to him, and speaking in the same audible whisper as before,
“is the Old Min friendly?”
“Oh, don't bother about that—at present,” returned the portly
one, pleasantly,
“No, but is he?” said DICK. - -
“Why, of course,” whispered his friend, with a wink of portentous
significance.

Grand Young Min # away at each other with mutual wiolence when all might

“That’s the talk,” cried the portly one, jovially. -
“Sir,” replied Mr. SwiveLLER, “don’t you interrupt the Chair. Gentlemen,
how does the case stand upon the present occasion ? Here’s a hoighty Grand
Qld Min-I say it with the utmost respect—and here's a sperrity Grand Young

you have bolted a little out of the course, as young fellows often do; and you

makes answer to this and says, *You're as uppish as uppish can be, you want
everything all your own way, you haven't done half as much for me, as I’ve

out with that cheerful readiness which is always so agreeable and pleasant in a

LESLIE is on the stage, no matter how
he may be disguised, or what he may
be doing, or saying, the audience
shouts with laughter; that is, during
the First Act, for the laughter is only
occasional and spasmodic in the other

From first to last, we did not catch

rhyme, of which, in the absence of any positive evidence, we have our
doubts. When the audience laughed, it was more often at what was

The authors, who, as we have been informed, are two single gentle-
men rolled into one “Mr. RICHARD HENRY,” are most fortunate in
their actors, in their clever stage-manager, Mr. CHARLEs HARRIs,
and in Mr. EdwarDEs, the present lessee of the Gaiety, who has put
their piece on the stage with a liberality recalling the best days of
the Hollingsheadian era, though it cannot revive the combined fun of
such a company as NELLIE FARREN, KATE WAUGHAN, Royce, ELTON,
and TERRY, all playing together, unequalled since the still earlier
combination at the Strand, when MARIE WILTON, FANNY Josephs,
CHARLoTTE SAUNDERs, JAMEs BLAND, JoHN CLARKE, and JAMEs
RogFRs, genuine actors every one of them, played H. J. ByRoN's
admirably-written five-scene *... which were over in an hour
and a quarter. In those days we laughed at the couplets, greeted
the bad puns with an “Oh!” as if they had been rockets, and en-
joyed the acting which was in the true spirit of burlesque.
We are no laudatores temporis acti, and willingly admit that Mr.
LESLIE is an actor equal to any eccentric comedian, past or present,
and superior to most of them as a singer and accomplished musician;
but subtract him, with NELLIE FARREN, and what would become o
such a piece as Monte Cristof . Even as a dramatic entertainment,
Monte Cristo is not “in it "with its ſº. Little Jack Shep-
pard. Will Mr. LESLIE devote himself henceforth entirely to this
eccentric line, firing off crackers, striking angular attitudes, depend-
ing for some of his humorous effects upon noises made at the wing,
on deep notes of the trombone, and on any nonsense that may come
into his head to say at the minute P Where is the playgoer who, re-
membering him in the Opera of ºp Van Winkle, does not hope that
he may soon find a part worthy of his histrionic and vocal talents,
and ſº up being the mere “Droll,” which, by strict attention to
this line of business, he will infallibly become.
At the same time we recommend anyone who is not particularly
enthusiastic about “the Drama,” but who loves the healthy after-
dinner exercise of laughing even at utterly idiotic absurdity, and who
may like a brilliant show and some cleverish dancing, to visit the
Gaiety and see Mr. FRED LESLIE, Miss FARREN, the brilliant costumes,
the pretty faces, and sparkling mise-en-scène of Monte Cristo Junior.

[JANUARY 15, 1887.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. XII.-CAPTAIN HORSELIE GoweR.
CAPTAIN HORSELIE Gower is the raciest man in all London, that is
to say, there is no such theoretical authority on horse-racing about
- the West End of Town; practi-
cally the Captain is not to be
quite soimplicitly relied on, and
even those wont to listen with
reverence to the words of the
} oracle seem a little shy of
backing his “good things.”
Still to listen to HoRSELIE
GoweR laying down the law
about a forthcoming event in
the smoking-room of the “Flag
and Flourish,” is to feel you are
indeed behind the scenes and
being initiated into the inner-
most secrets of the turf, and
when dropping his voice he
informs you that he “had it
straight,” you are conscious of
being on the verge of attainin
importantinformation. “I j
it straight,” reiterates the Cap-
tain, “I was told it by BILL
Dobson, who’s a great friend
of LARKINs whose cousin trains
- in JoHNDAwson's stable. Cock-
amaroo, Sir, must win–tried
with Brown Brandy at 211b., Here the Captain's voice sinks lower
and lower till nothing is audible but such snatches as, “10lb beating
a ton in hand,” “best thing out,” and as you stroll homewards, you
decide that no time is to be lost in getting a few, pounds on
Cockamaroo. You do so the next morning, and are still more im-
#: with the rather liberal odds that you obtain about that
istinguished animal. From that out Cockamaroo fades gradually
out of the betting, and is heard of no more, when you appeal plain-
tively to the Captain, he replies, “Yes, I believe they did rather
fancy him, but they’re always making mistakes in that stable,” and
i.; ignores that he had ever mentioned Cockamaroo, as a “good
thing.
That is HoRSELIE GoweR's way. It is no use reminding him that he
told you such a horse would win a race. He invariably replies, with
a lofty smile at your ignorance, “I told you that the stable fancied
it; my own opinion was another matter.”
The Captain in his vaticinations, deals chiefly in outsiders, there is
something much too common-place for his vivid imagination in pre-
dicting the success of a horse whose antecedents point to his winning
again. When you venture to suggest that you think the favourite
will win the Leger, he replies, “Do you really now P’’ with that
pitying smile of #. which says clearly, Well, if you believe that, you
will believe anything! ... “He’s safe, my boy, in the pockets of the
book-makers. Wait till we meet on Doncaster Town Moor, and tell
me what you think of his chance then.” . .
This does not commit the Captain to much, as you are as little likely
to meet him at Doncaster as a red deer. He invariably talks as if he
attended all such festivals, but except on rare occasions, at Ascot and
Epsom, HoRSELIE Gower is never encountered on a race-course.
Still, HoRSELIE Goweb is a sportsman all round, in his way, and it is
uite possible that it is merely narrowness of means that prevents
§. developing into what he aims at being thought. He occupies a
couple of rooms in the purlieus of St. James's, wears trousers rather
tight in the leg, and a horse-shoe pin... His speech is garnished with
the shibboleth of the turf. He tell Y. that he's going to the
Park, if he can get the course. If you ask him if he's going to his
Regimental dinner, he will tell you that he is “a bit off, and struck
out of allengagements,”—and was once heard to describe an acquain-
#. * * good sort, but he can't stay; two brandies and sodas are
ength.
To hear HorsRLIEGowerhold forthat the “Flag and Flourish,” you
would º that his betting transactions were on a somewhat ex-
tensive scale.
He is given to talk about “having had a good race,”
“having got a nasty one over the Stakes,” &c., but his relatives have
no cause to be anxious about him on that score, as he is a consistent
man and his º nearly as theoretical as his knowledge of
racing generally. He is great at the drawing of club lotteries, and
given to offering tº: under their value for the prominent
favourites. He is busy with a pencil and a piece of a paper on such
occasions, calculating the exact value of every horse in the betting,
in relation to the lottery, and to do him justice he was
taught arithmetic in his youth, and has a notable knowledge of
fractions. - -
“Up in Scotland, this year, Gower P' inquires young MoRRISON,
who lives solely for shooting and fishing, and is equally deadly with
fly and trigger. -
“No ; deuced unlucky. Was to have shot in Perthshire with old
JACK BELPER, but he wrote me word it wasn't worth my while.”
“Not worth your while ! Well, I don't know where JAcK
BELPER's Moor may be, but we’d lots of birds in Perthshire.”
“Dare say,” replied the Captain, “but JACK said he’d been done.
Qnly hired it this season, you know, and the people who had it last,
shot it down shamefully.”
HoRSELIE Gower has never been seen with a gun in his hand by any
of his . and where he spends August and September is a
sore puzzle to his intimates. He is usually off to the Moors to stay
with somebody, but something always intervenes. Old JACK BELPER
figures in many of HoRSELIE Gower's sporting narratives, and appa-
rently came into the world for the express purpose of being rescued
from all sorts of unpleasant animals and positions {{ the gallant
Captain; a nominis umbra, who has never yet been visible in the flesh.
In like manner with regard to hunting, HoRSELIE Gower is singularly
unfortunate. To inquiries as to where he means to betake himself for
that diversion, he unhesitatingly replies that he intends giving the
Cotswold or the Atherstone a furn, and if any one expresses sur-
prise at finding him lingering about the Club smoking-room during
the winter months, his answer comes glibly as ever—
“How is it I’m not down in the Cotswold country? By Jove,
old man, there's not much hunting for you when you get such a
facer as I did over the Leger; s to win a cracker on Roderick
Random, and”—here the %. voice drops, and he becomes
*::: confidential—“I don't believe he tried a yard.”
en who witnessed the race, would tell you that whether Roderick
Random tried or did not try to win, made little difference in the
188tle.
But to see HoRSELIE Gower in all his glory, is to see him in the hall
of the “Flag and Flourish,” on the afternoon that a big handicap is to
be decided, say the Cambridgeshire, when the tape is coming in, and
being put up on the telegraph, board about every twenty minutes.
The Captain upon this occasion has stumbled on a horse at long odds
and backed it with the tobacconist round the corner, with whom he
usually does business, for a couple of sovereigns. The horse stands
now at about half the price he got about it, and is considered by good
judges as very likely indeed to be hailed the winner. HoRSELIE Gowee,
always very positive in his opinions, is demonstrating to the little
knot around the telegraph board who are awaiting the issue of the
big race that Cockchafer, bar accidents, must win.
“I picked him out directly I saw the weights,” cries the Captain,
“no one who knows anything about racing, could help seeing he was
#.ini, , Look at the way he gave Tycoon 10lb and a beating at
empton.
Ha!, here comes the tape–Cambridgeshire result—Tantalus 1,
Mary Anne 2, Dolphin 3. .
Captain HoRSELIEGowerindulges in a big big D. and strides silentl
off to the coffee-room bar to wash down that disappointment. #.
really had discounted that fifty or sixty pounds in his sanguine
imagination, and was a little dashed at Cockchafer's ignominious
performance.
. There is a little disposition to poke fun at the Captain that night
in the smoking-room, but he rises to the occasion.
“Chucked away, Sir, the race was literally chucked away. Saw
old JACK BELPERjust before dinner, who told me all about it. The
§ got flurried, and just rode his horse's head off. Cockchafer ought
to have won; don't tell me, he’d a stone in hand.”
It is a very harmless amusement; Captain HoRSELIEGower rarely
leaves London, . He has no other aim in life, and if his racing does
cost him a certain small sum every year, it cannot be said that he
does not have his fun for his money.

bargain reprint, by Messrs. CHAPMAN & HALL, of this,
as well as the four other Christmas stories by DICKENs,
SHOCKING OUTRAGE UPON AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN.
(Important Letter lately received by Mr. Punch.)
SIR,-In writing to . in your columns the unseemly treatment to which
I have recently been subjected, I am not, I humbly trust, actuated by .
feelings of revenge. I merely wish to give some idea of the extent to whic
young people of the present day are º by a spirit of irreverence towards
those, who in my early days, would have been listened to with respectful atten-
tion. I may pause here to remark that I am a man who throughout a long and
prosperous commercial career, has been accustomed to a marked deference in
those circles in which he moves, which I attribute in a great measure to my
inyariable practice of discountenancing any undue flippancy in my presence.
Well, Sir, some short time since, I, in company with my dear wife, spent a few
days at a certain Hydropathic £ºtablishment in the vicinity of the Metropolis,
A large proportion of our fellow-visitors had not attained years of discretion,
and you would doubtless expect that they would refrain from obtruding them-
selyes at all upon the notice of their elders, without some ºl encouragement.
What will you say, Sir, when I tell you that—so far from that—they attempted,
under the guise of a “Committee of Amusements,” to dictate to us the manner
in which we were to T. our evenings! - - -
I do not say that I found much to object to on the first evening of my visit,
though some of the recitations struck me as unnecessarily frivolous, but, before
the second, it reached my ears that the Committee contemplated the performance
of a Charade to be followed by a dancel. Now, neither Inor my dear wife dance,
while we hold all entertainments of a theatrical nature in the †"; disap-
proval, carrying consistency so far indeed, as to have repeatedly declined to
take part in, or even witness, “Dumb Crambo” performed by near relatives,
some of whom were well advanced in years. We do not judge those who think
differently—it is a matter, for the conscience, of each-but such are our views,
and so we were naturally disgusted by the selfishness of proposing an amusement
in which all could not participate. , Short as the time I spent in the Establish-
ment was, I had even then attained a certain influence over those of a similar
way of thinking, and, amongst us, we brought a pressure to bear which led to
the Charade . Dance being abandoned, although I fear in no very good or
proper frame of mind. -
proposed games as an alternative, for I am no foe to harmless merriment—
far from it, Sir, old as I am, I enjoy a romp with a p of dear young friends,
as much as #. a younger man. But on this occasion, my dear wife being
present, I confined my suggestions to sports which are almost purely intellectual
in their nature, and demand nothing but a ready wit, a sheet of tº. and a
lead pencil. My proposition was received with the utmost hostility by all the
younger members of the company, with one single exception—a young lady,
whose appearance struck me, I must confess, as distinctly prepossessing at the
time—though my dear wife (with that true woman's instinct, which, in these
matters, I have often been compelled to admit, is keener than my own) at once
detected the levity and love of admiration that marred an otherwise attractive
exterior. This young lady (for a strong sense of duty compels me to give her
name in full) was a Miss LARKIN, and while affecting to welcome m
suggestions with enthusiasm, she offered to introduce us to a new game whic
she described as being at the same time rational and exceedingly provocative of
mirth. I consented readily, only stipulating that none of the dissentients should
be F. to join our party.
. The gravest and most important amongst us were easily induced to take part
in the new game of “Rabbits,” for by this somewhat unmeaning appellation it
seemed to be known, and so Miss TRIXIE marshalled us all into the centre of the
drawing-room, where we were directed to kneel down in a circle, and pass around
the questions she, as leader, might originate. I placed myself on her left, m
dear wife being at her right, and awaited the sequel with some amusement an
anticipation. The first inquiry put was whether my wife was acquainted with
the game, and she replying in a decided negative, was directed to pass on the
question, which, after being asked and answered alike by all in succession, came
at length to my turn. Not unpleased that it should be reserved to me to receive
initiation, and concluding all that had passed to have been a piece of mock
formality, I said, with a smile, “Well, my dear Miss TRIXIE, as it seems to be
m # ºt the question, I ask you, then-do you know the game of, ah—
adolts
Whereupon, Sir, that shameless minx (my dear wife's exact expression up in
our bedroom afterwards) had the impertinence to look me straight in the eyes
and say, “No, I don't, indeed!” and leave us there, º to the ribald
laughter of all who had been spectators of this most pointless piece of buffoonery!
We made a firm and dignified protest by leaving the room in a compact body
on the spot; and I am willing to hope that the mirth and music which later
assailed our ears were assumed to conceal the shame and mortification caused by
our withdrawal. º - -
But that such irreverence, such almost inconceivable levity, can be possible at
all, appears to me to throw a lurid light upon the deterioration of the young

REEPING UP THE CLASSICS.
“Yes, certainly. The study of the Classics must be
maintained at all costs at our Universities and Public
Schools,” said Paterfamilias, decidedly. “I’ll set ToMMY
some Latin verses to do. GRAY wrote an ode “On a Dis-
tant Prospect of Eton College.” ToMMY's holidays are
nearly, over; he shall write one on a near Fº of
returning to the same ancient seminary. It will show
me how the lad has progressed.”
. ToMMY's progress may be estimated from the following
es.

tively. at the end.
“Oh, I could have finished them ever so long ago, if
I'd known that was what you wanted,” replied the un-

TURNING OVER NEW LEAVES.
(By Our Own Paper-Knifer.)
High Life and the Towers of Silence, (SAMPSON Low
& Co.), might from its title be a Society Novel, only in
such a connection a torrent of talk would be a more
*...* accompaniment to high life than towers of
silence. However, it does not happen to be a society
novel at all, but a delightful book of travels in Switzer-
land, by Mrs. MAIN. What makes it all the more inter-
esting is, that it is entirely guiltless of the “regular
Swiss round,” and the beaten track of summer, tourists,
It gives graphic accounts of Switzerland in winter, and
spring, and the stories of climbing adventures are capitally
told. Those who remember this lady's High Alps in
Winter, can fancy what a pleasant and amusing book
this must be. There is no special domain for Man left
CONTUMACY.
“How STUPID You ARE To-DAY, Eval"
‘‘I’M NOT STUPID ! I'M INATTENTIVE!”
nowadays. Women are not only expert climbers, but intrepid travellers.
Before long, doubtless, ladies will be eligible for the Travellers' Club. In such
a case probably among the first to be elected will be Mrs. HoRE. Those who
read the title of her book, To Lake Tanganyika in a Bath-chair, will Fº
think it a joke—nothing more adventurous than the Brighton invalid is ever
associated with Bath-chairs. They will, however, find that the journey was any:
thing but a joke; but that this undaunted lady, accompanied by her husband and
her little son JACK and others—not all in one conveyance by the way—accom-
plished the greater part of the distance between Zanzibar and Tanganyika—over
eight hundred miles, in a Bath-chair. What the traveller—or should we º
travelless?—saw on the road, and the adventures she met with, are well wort
reading. The fair sex are imitative: they are apt to follow a good lead. Pro-
bably we shall shortly see announced, Through Honduras in a Hansom, To
Bagdad on a Bicycle, and other kindred works.
he Lady Drusilla (WARD AND Down Ey), by THOMAS PURNELL, is certainly
a new departure in romance. The author has abandoned all the usual machinery
of the ordinary novelist. It is refreshing to find a writer in the present day who
can strikeout a line for himself, and produce a work full of thought and ºftº:
Playing with Fire has nothing to do with hose or engines or escape-drill, but is
a story of the Soudan War, by JAMEs GRANT. , You may take it for grant-ed
that it is full of bustle and incident. The veteran author of the Romance of
War has §: means forgotten his art, and in the present work again unites
romance with war successfully. , St. Nicholas commences the year with a capital
number. It is full of good things in the way of *. and poems, and the
illustrations are excellent. There are two articles on Eton. In one, the writer,
speaking of the conclusion of the procession of boats on the Fourth of June,
says he boys, are reviewed, and then they toss oars, and away they go
amidst great applause, and up the river as far as Henley, where they have a
supper of duck and green peas.” I doubt very much, on the evening of the
Fourth of June, whether the most enthusiastic ‘wet bob” would ever be induced
to row as far as Henley, even with duck and green peas in prospect. I am
inclined to think Surley Hall would be a far more likely place for the suppering.
A Half-and-Half Plea for some Porter.
THE Guardian of the Wicket-gate says, “Find you may some fitter
Than me for Workhouse Porter. Porter P-ah, some calls me “bitter.' ..
Lots knocks and mocks...And often, when a thunderin' knock there's bin,
I’ve hopened, and myself’s the only one that’s ‘taken in.'”

First Man (lighting up). “SEE Those THREE GIRLs over THERE, JACK ? EACH of 'EM HAs THIRTY THou. 1"
(Jack Hardup thinks he remembers having heard that some Bishop was in favour of tolerating Polygamy, and wishes it would become fashionable.)
* MERRY IN HALL.”
THE Hall is St. §§. Langham Place, which might by this
time be called German d-gent Street. Do they still the
place of entertainment “The Gallery of Illustration?”. We think
not, though the book continues to the characters “Illustrations.”
The other afternoon we contrived to squeeze in-this place, is
always crammed at holiday-time—and hear The Friar, a One-Act
Operetta written by CoMYNs CARB, and its music by CAIDICQTT. A
very pretty scene, and picturesque costumes, and as I listened to the
dialogue which, it gradually dawned upon me, was in blank verse, I
said to myself, remembering the Laureate's Falcon at the St. James's,
“If J. CoMYNs CARR goes on like this, TENNYSON isn't in it with
him.” And I am glad to º that, as the piece progressed, TENNyson
was not in it with him. To hear them talk in Elizabethan fashion,
and to see the good folk right merrie, forsooth, at many of the japes
and jests, and quips and quirks, by my halidame and marry come
up but I wish that Joseph CoMYNs CARR-such a Jo-Karr, he is—
had collaborated with WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE in such comic rustic
scenes as those of As You Like It and Love's Labour's Lost.
Beshrew me, but Master CARB doth show a marvellous pretty wit.
An the ladies FANNY Hon.I.AND and MARION WARDROPER do not act
and sing charmingly, call me Door-post, for your door-post, mark
you, can neither hear, see, nor sing. The song-words too are of a
sort that you shall not buy from every scurvy ballad-monger.
And the quality of Master. NoFTH HOME-sweet, sweet, Home,
mark ye, maidens all, when he sang—as Hubert, was indeed goodly
both for eyes and ears. Master SANT MATTHEws bore himself as a
most reverent Abbot; and as for Master ALFRED REED– sooth,
but he is a merry man and a full-grown one to boot, and if he have
not as the players say, “all the fat of the piece,” pluck me for a
four-boy-cockroach. (Shakspearian Note. y not this as well as
a “three-man-beetle?”) -
And then, to bring us from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth,
incomes Mr. CoRNEY GRAIN and sings, “Qh, That Boy!” the refrain
of which everybody is humming on leaving the Hall. Capital ºn;
that of his, “Be always kind to Animals, wherever you may be.
Very funny idea, and we fancy, if our memory serve us well, not
absolutely unknown to Mr. Punch and his “Lazy Minstrel.” The
Lowther Arcade Concert is excellently m ed, in a duet for piano
and CoRNEY. All good. As SHAKSPEARE, he known the Gallery
of Illustration, would have made Hamlet say to Ophelia, “Go to the
Gallery, go!”
“FROM MOZART TO MARIO.”
THIS title does not mean that you will find in these two volumes
musical notes from the great Composer to the great Tenor, for a very
sufficient reason, but it does mean
that you will here read personal re-
collections of many Composers, Per-
formers, and Singers, from the time of
MozART to that of Mario, written by
Mr. Louis ENGEL, who may be des-
cribed, with mathematical precision,
as “an acute ENGEL.” It is an
amusing, gossiping, readable, take-it-
º <º up-at-any-time sort of work, by a
Sº º writer who, being composer, journal:
*Nº| f % #. #: pianist, been “in it” all
*N. **** ... º his life.
*N A fº/ Every chapter is like a theme with
TN º ºs so many variations, and all of them so
*
&al erratic, that the original air on which
they are founded would be entirely
to it now and again, just to keep up
There is something about WERDI, DELSSOHN
BERLIoz, WAGNER, AUBER, PATTI, NILsson, also about MozART and
MARIO too, and a considerable amount about Mr. LOUIS ENGEL. As
the Yankee song has it, “'Tis Engel-ish, you know! . So Engel-ish
you know!” And the nom-de-plume of the musical author o
these reminiscences might well *: “The Wandering Minstrel.”
But, from this portfolio of oddities, three scenes stand out vividly,
and impress themselves on the reader's memory. The first is the
interview of Mr. Louis ENGEL with the Pope; the second, his evening
at the Duchess's; and the third, his bounding dance with Mme. PATTI.

ULTIMA THULE; OR, TOOLE'S LATEST.
Mr. Nibbs. I hear, Sir, that one night
last week, you witnessed Mr. and -
MERIVALE's}*. The Butler.
~, = Mr. Punch. Yes, and I trust the piece be-
tween husband andwife being by this time
well established, º be a lasting one. It
is most amusing, and it is capitally acted.
Mr. Nibbs. Miss KATE PHILLIPs is so
uncommonly good in it.
Mr. Punch. She is exactly the style of
low-comedy soubrette that Mr. ToolE
wanted to share with him the comic busi-
ness of his farcical pieces. She makes
s every point in the dialogue tell, she keeps
§ her place (which is a great thing as cook
§ - in such an establishment) in the picture,
Sº without anything approaching unneces-
sary or obtrusive vulgarity.
Mr. Nibbs. And in fact, Sir, she is as
- one may say, “one of the lifes and souls”
of the piece.
. Mr. Punch. How pretty Miss MARIELINDEN looks, and how charm-
ingly she acts as Alice Marshall, with just that slight tremolo in her
voice which is so sympathetic. Let me see, who played Lady Anne?
Mr. Nibbs. Mr. Toole's “novice,” Miss WANBRUGH, and it suits
her to a nicety, With a little more experience and “by careful
attention, to business,” she will, I think, prove an acquisition to the
stage. And then, how well Miss THoRNE plays the Provincial
Mayor's comfortable wife, with her good heart and her bad
grammar. In fact the ladies of Mr. Toole's Theatre would be hard
to beat anywhere.
Mr. Punch. Sir! Nobody would be so barbarous and ungentle-
manly as to ºw Talking of beating, how did the plot strike you?
Mr. Nibbs. Well, Sir, I was not knocked down by it. Granting
the farcical element as essential, the plot is simple, and ingeniously
g. The dialogue is good. The action drags a little in the
not AC
. Mr. Punch. And in one important situation the stage-management
is decidedly faulty. This can be easily rectified.
Mr. Nibbs. Sir, you haven't said a word about the Actors.
Mr. Punch. Place auz dames / Let us come to “the Spear Side.”
Mr. BILLINGTON is more the ſº. Old-English-Gentleman kind of
parent of the standard farces and comedies, than the modern provincial
monied snob, knighted for something or other—I didn't catch what—
of this piece. Mr. WARD and Mr. LowNE do their best to mark a
contrast between two very ordinary Hº-with which the collabo-
rateurs ought to have taken more trouble— -
Mr. Wibbs. Certainly; and Mr. SHELTON's bit of character,<
Lord Babicombe, most artistically made up, belongs to too ancient
an aristocratic stage-family to be of much benefit to Actor or Author.
Mr. BRUNTON's deaf flyman, ve . impersonated, would bear
toning down just a little. And, lastly, Mr. Tool.E as David Trot—a
Dickensian name, the Butler. Excellent, eh?
Mr. Punch. Yes, the part affords him considerable opportunities,
of which he makes the most. His performance is, throughout, con-
sistent, and he never, once loses that air of respectful familiarity
which would be the characteristic of an old and somewhat eccentric
servant in a mosttº. household. Not having seen the ve
commencement of the play, I am not aware in what capacity he h
started in life with his employers, who, when they are not bullying
him, or dismissing him from their service, are constantly addressing
him as “old friend,” or asking him to sit down and chat. The
young lady-companion gushes at him, and, on one, or two separate
occasions, nothing will satisfy her but º him. In such a
Colney-Hatch family no Butler could possibly behave in any other
way than as Mr. Tool.E. does; and thus it is that this clever actor
ves an air of probability to the strange scenes in which his lot has
een cast by the Domestic Dramatists. -
Mr. Nibbs. I see, Sir. If Mr. Tools were once extravagant or
farcical in the midst of such fantastical surroundings, the interest
would be immediately at an end, and the sooner the dramatis personae
joined in a wild chorus, and danced a break-down, the better.
. Mr. Punch. That is so... I have º #. for Mr. TooDE
in this part. His fascinating bride, the Cook, who is most appropri-
ately attired, ought to protest against the absurd costume in which
the Butler thinks it becoming to array himself for the wedding.
Altogether, it is really most amusing; and if you don't “roar” and
“sgream,” at all events you laugh frequently and heartily, and the
night I was there it was thoroughly appreciated by a very full
House. Au revoir /

Sinner.” Of course “in a Pickwickian sense.”
A TRIPLET.
Sº -> K_Lºº. - º
IAM, I really think, the most unlucky man on earth; .
A triple sorrow haunts me, and has done so from my birth.
My lot in life’s a gloomy one, I think you will agree:
'Tis bad enough to be a twin–but I am one of threel
No sooner were we born than Pa and Ma the Bounty claimed;
I scarce can bear to think they did—it makes me feel ashamed.
They got it, too, within a week, and spent it, I’ll be bound,
Upon themselves—at least, I know I never had my pound.
Our childhood's days in ignorance were lamentably spent,
Although I think we more than paid the taxes and the rent;
For we were shown as marvels, and—unless I'm much deceived—
The smallest contributions were most thankfully received.
We grew up hale and hearty—would we never had been born 1–
As É. to one another as three peas, or ears of corn.
Between my brothers ICHABop, ABIMELECH and me
No difference existed which the human eye could see.
This likeness was the cause of dreadful suffering and pain
To me in early life—it nearly broke my heart in twain;
For while my conduct as a youth was fervently admired,
That of my }. eft a deal to be desired.
I was amiable, and pious, too, good deeds were my delight;
I practised all the virtues—some by day, and some by night;
hilst IcBABoD imbrued himself in crime, and, sad to say,
ABIMELECH, when quite a lad, would rather swear than pray.
Think of my horror and dismay when, in the Park at noon,
An obvious burglar greeted me with, “Hullo! IKE, old coon!”
He vanished. Suddenly my wrists were gripped by Pºliceman X.-
“Young man, you are my pris'ner on a charge of forgin' cheques.”
He ran me in, and locked me up, to moulder in a cell.
The reason why he used me thus, alas! I knew too well. -
He took me for ABIMELECH, my erring brother dear, cashier.
Who was “wanted” by the Bank of which he’d been the chief
Next morn the Magistrate remarked, “This is a sad mistake,
Though natural enough. I much regretit for your sake.
But, ifÉ. will permit me to advise you, I should say
Leave England for some other country, very far away.
“For, if you go on living in this happy sea-girt isle,
Although your conduct (like my own) be pure and free from guile,
Your likeness to those sinful men, your brothers twain, will lead,
I fear, to very serious inconveniences indeed.”
I took the hint, and sailed next day for distant Owhyhee,_
As might have been expected, I was cast away at sea.
A Pirate Lugger picked me up, and—dreadful to relate—
ABIMELECH her Captain was, and ICHABOD her Mate.
I loved them, and they tempted me. To join them I agreed,
Forsook the path of virtue, and did many a ghastly deed.
For seven years I wallowed in my fellow-creatures' gore,
And then—gave up the business, to settle down on shore.
My brothers, on retiring from the buccaneering trade,
In which, I’m bound to say, colossal fortunes they had made,
Renounced their wicked courses, married young and lovely wives,
Went to church three times on Sundays, and led sanctimonious lives.
As for me, I somehow drifted into vileness past belief,
Earned unsavoury distinction as a drunkard and a thief;
E’en in crime, ill-luck º me. I became extremely poor,
And was finally compelled to beg my bread from door to door.
I’m deep down in the social scale; no lower can I sink.
Upon the whole, experience induces me to think
That virtue is not lucrative, and honesty's all fudge, H.
For ICHABoD's a Bishop-and ABIMELECH's a Judge!

“VELVET AND IRON 1"
OH, pleasant sight! A Titan, mightier none,
Of valour fiercer, or of thews immenser-
Bending before a martial Amazon,
And in her honour swinging flattery's
censer!

A radiant subject for romantic trºl
It makes one think of TAsso and of SPENSER,

Where brave Sir Artegall bows to beauteous
Britomart.
“What iron courage ever could endure
To work such outrage on so fair acreature?”
Sings gentle EDMUND. Truly, to be sure!

Of such a martial masterpiece of Nature.
She is as great, as proud, as brave as he, .
Though not precisely of such towering

stature
With that at least the lady must agree, .
For valour is not proof’gainst natural vanity.
He beat her once, but that was by a fluke,
Ande'en Sir Artegall, “the salvage knight,”
Might from fair Britomart receive rebuke
being vanquished in a second fight.

Why should the martial maid not soften now,

SIR John LUBBoCK, lecturing on “Savages,”
said, “Kissing is unknown to Australians
New Zealanders, Papuans, Esquimaux, and
other races.” Who will argue against the
absolute necessity for an Imperial Educa-

nighted tribes let us send out Missionaries,

OUR Royal “HAMLET,”—The day before
the meetings at St. James's Palace and the
Mansion House infurtherance of the proposed
scheme, the Times said:—“It is understood
that no element whatever will be introduced
that will risk the conversion of the Imperial
Institute into a mere Tea-garden.” If it did
become a Tea-garden, the element of hot
water would soon be provided for everybody
connected with it. But this risk seems to be
getting more remote, as H.R.H. has carefully
noted Mr. Punch's pen and º argu-
ments, and has profited by the judicious
leaders on the subject in the Times, to which
journal he is evidently saying, as did the
Prince of Denmark to the beckoning Ghost,
“Lead on 1 I follow !” And the Spirit that
H.R.H., is well and wisely following is “The
Spirit of the ‘Times.’”

BORN, OCT. 27TH, 1818. DIED, JAN. 12TH, 1887.
As on a calm and genial Autumn day
The sun-glow's softened sheen we scarce remember,
Until from mead and mount 'tis swept away
º some swift-shaping cloud-wrack of September,
So there are lives which shine so mildly on
Their radiance scarce is marked till it is gone.
Such his who by so swift and sad a stroke,
'Midst selfish strife and the base fume of faction,
Which round him, worn but selfless, raged and broke,
From well-loved fields of patriot thought and action,
Like a clear light was suddenly withdrawn,
Darkening the young year at its earliest dawn.
Disparaged and dispraised, 'midst foolish fires
Of showier lustre but less steady flaming,
The patience high that generous souls inspires,
The calm magnanimous, meaner spirits shaming,
Held him above detraction's clamorous cry,
Pattern of proud but gentle chivalry.
The gifts of the arena, brass and blare,
Sly craft of fence, trick of impressive posing,
Were little his ; the sophist's wordy snare,
The casuist's subtle shift and artful glosing
He shunned. A knightly sword he'd wield or whet,
But stooped not to the trident and the net.
So the arena's coarser heroes mocked
This antique fighter. And his place was rathe
Where ARTHUR's knights in generous tourney shocked,
Than where swashbucklers meet or histrions gather:
Yet—yet his death has touched the land with gloom;
All England honours Chivalry at his tomb.

decided that PLANTAGENET should appear in that character. Strange
to say, we have not º: in our family traditions any details of
our great ancestor, the Portreve's costume.
...Qf course,” said I, “as he was ‘something in the City,' they
will know at Guildhall.” -
My first visit was to the Guildhall Library, where I was received
by a most courteous official (I may remark that all the City officials
with which it was my pleasure to come in contact, were courteous),
and fixplained, in a light-hearted way, that I wanted “a rough
sketch-I didn't mind, how rough—of a Portreve of London at the
time of the Conquest.”
“well,” º ied the courteous official, “no doubt there were
Portrayes in those days, but it is not very easy to say what they
Wore.
“I suppose a gown, or a cloak, or something,” I suggested.
-- º: the courteous official, but with some hesitation,
-- º it was a gown, or a cloak, or some other robe. But
am afraid we don't know the colour or the shape.”
“No P’’ I said, in a tone of bitter disappointment—“not know
that! Well, did he wear a chain?”
“Well”–and the courteous official appeared to be buried in the
deepest thought—“Yes. At least I think so.”
Upon this I was shown into the Guildhall Library, and supplied
with a number of books about the City's history. Alas! it was all
modern 1 I could trace the º, sartorially back to HENRY
THE EIGHTH with comfort, and even, by a little straining, catch a
5. of King John, but beyond all was mystery. However, I got
e addresses of one or two City Companies where it seemed likely
I should strike the trail. e rest I found on my notes
Amongst
Barbers' Hall, where an old picture, showing the shape of livery
gowns, was preserved. I went there, the door was opened by a
courteous official, who assumed that of course I had come to see the
icture.
piº It is rather dark, Sir,” he said, “but I will get a candle.”
The light was produced, and then I was taken into a large apart-
ment and shown a Holbein of almost priceless value. , Ifancy to the
surprise of the custodian, instead of going into raptures over the
merits of the painting, all fäid was "to scrutimise the cut of the
livery gowns. This was the first of many similar visits. I rushed
from Hall to Hall, and this is a summary of what I discovered:—
1. That the Portreve came from the Romans, and the Lord Mayor
from the Portreve. - -
2. That the Portreve wore a chain, but the rest of his costume
was uncertain. -
3. That the Lord Mayor is next to the Sovereign in the City, and
may walk about with his sword and mace, with the precedence of an
Earl everywhere else.
I hunted high and low, consulting PLANCHá and even “Mrs.
MARKHAM.” At length, wearied with the fatigue of hurried re-
search, I was seated in the library of my Qlub, surrounded by books
of costume, and began once again to look up “hoods” and livery-
gowns. Everybody's friend, WAGSTAFF, saw my difficulty in a
I|second.
“My dear fellow,” he said, “go to old MESHACH's, the costumier.
He'll tell you.” And he did too. He knew “how a Portreve wath
dreth'd, blethyer.” I was on the point of accepting his authority,
when RoNALD Row LAND, the well-known antiquarian and actor, set
me right. For all that, i have a sneaking respect for MESHACH as a
historian. Yours, out of his troubles,
THE FATHER OF THE PortREVE OF WILLIAM THE FIRST,
MEM. BY A GALWAY MAN.
“THE QUEEN's Writ” appears like an infant ungrown,
For—in Ireland at least—it can't yet “run” alone.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ROUND-TABLE CONFERENCE.
ThE importance of
the atherin On
Hºuri, and Frida
at Sir W. HARCOURT's
house, led us to take
extraordin In eans
to ascertain the course
of theinterview. That
some kind of report
would beforthcoming
was not to be doubted.
In fact, as our readers
know, several reports have been published, affording a wide choice to
the public. What we desired to provide for the civilised world was a
precise, we may say, a stenographic report of what took place within
the jealously closed doors of 7. Grafton Street. The task was
full of difficulty, but one undertaken in similar circumstances, had
at no remote date been brilliantly accomplished. Qur esteemed gon-
temporary the Puddle Muddle Gazette, had supplied in its earliest
ition a report, almost verbatim, of proceedings in the first Cabinet
Council hi.after the resignation of Lord RANDolph CHURCHILI.
If we could only borrow the Puddle Muddle Gazette's young man
our task would be easy. . We entered upon negotiations which prov
successful, and at an early hour on ay morning, what we may
call for the occasion, our Young Man set out for Grafton Street, and
has since sent in his report. -
What seems to have struck him most forcibly at the outset, was
the fact that the Round-Table was square. hat was more to the
purpose was to find it covered with a cloth, whose amplefolds almost
swept the ground. Scarcely had our Young Man taken seat (on
the floor) than Lord HERscHELL entered, looked round the room,
pulled the curtains a little closer, and poked the fire with the butt
end of the telescope which, from family associations, he always
carries with him. Presently. Mr. John MoRLEY, who had walked
over from the Athenaeum Club, arrived and shook hands with Lord
HERSCHELL. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN and Sir GeoRGE TREVELYAN drove
up in a 'bus to the corner of the street. º; they walked
thence arm-in-arm to No. 7. It was observed that Mr. CHAMBER-
LAIN, whose coat was closely buttoned, swung an umbrella in his
right hand. Latest to arrive was the host himself, Sir WILLIAM
IARCOURT, who drove up in a Hansom cab, having been to pay a
visit to one of his Royal connections. - -
“Hi! hi! what’s this?” said the cabman, holding out his hand,
and looking scornfully at a coin which the Right Honourable Gentle-
man had deposited there. -
“That’s a shilling,” said Sir WILLIAM HARcount, blandly; “and
what is more, I am the late Home Secretary, and if our work goes
well to-day and to-morrow, I may be so again.” - - - -
With remarkable alacrity the cabman thrust the coin in his pocket
and drove off. Sir WILLIAM, softly smiling to himself and caressing
with thumb and forefinger his abundant chin, strode into the house.
“Well, Gentlemen,” said Lord ELL, “I think we are all
here, and may get to business. I am quite sorry to bring you out in
such inclement weather.”
“It’s yery bad for the pictures,” said Sir GEORGE TREyELYAN.
“I have been to the Grosvenor two or three times, and hardly know
what the pictures are like.”
-- “The roads are intolerable,” Sir WILLIAM HARcourt chimed in.
If I’d stayed in office and passed a Government of London Bill,
ºf: would have been very different.”
“It's anxious times with hothouse culture,” said Mr. CHAMBER-
LAIN. “You might have everything ruined in one night, if the fires
should by any chance go down.”
“By the *}. said Sir W. HARcourt, “strange thing happened
just before I left home a T. of an hour ago. A messenger
arrived with a letter in a large envelope addressed to me, marked
Immediate. The man, brought it up, leaving the messenger in the
hall. I opened it, and it contained nºthing but a back number of the
Puddle Muddle Gazette; nothing marked in it. I sent the man
down to ask the messenger what it meant, but he had gone. Well,
where shall we .# and how shall we go about it?”
“I have thought,” said Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, “that perhaps you
would like to hear what I have to say. I have therefore drawn up
my views on this sheet of pa »
“I beg pardon,” said Sir
of me.” -
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN (looking across the table with air of surprise)
continued—“on this sheet of paper, which I will read if you like.”
: Perhaps, Lord HERscHELL would read it?” said Mr. MoRLEY.
“Certainly,” said Lord HERSCHELL, “it seems nicely written.”
(Began reading.) “‘Much misunderstanding has existed with refer-
ence to the position I have taken up on the question of Irish Home
Rule. Being myself of noncombative disposition, I have submissivel
borne the misrepresentations that have envelo me. But I thi
the time has come when a common understanding should be arrived
at between myself and my old colleagues. To that end I-”
. Sir WILLIAM HARcourt: “I beg your pardon, that's the second
time I’ve kicked you.”
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN (laughing): “You really haven't touched me
once.’
“Then, it must have been you. I kicked,” said Sir WILLIAM,
looking across at Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's partner.
Sir GEORGE TREyELYAN: “Not at all.”
Sir WILLIAM HARcourt (lifting up the table-cloth and looking
underneath): “Then who is it?”
It was ºur Young Man / -
r–
'Wºw HARcourt; “very awkward
This is as far as the report goes. Our Young Man explained
that he had brought it home rather in a hurry to be in time for the
Fourth Edition. That's all very well; but there is about the report
an obvious absence of completeness. In that famous account of what
took place in the Cabinet Council, the narrative finished with the
statement that Ministers were “still sitting when we went to
press.” Couldn't we have something like that to wind up this
report P. Suppose we concluded the report with the observation “left
sitting P” But our Young Man (who limps a little) demurred to
the accuracy of this description. It seems they are anxious, above
all things, for accuracy at the Puddle Muddle Gazette Office. Four
of the gentlemen in conference might have been sitting when Our
Young Man left; but he has the strongest conviction that Sir
WILLIAM HARcourt was standing on one leg, his †. footextended.
We wanted Our Young Man to return and complete the narrative
with an account of Friday's proceedings. But he seems to have lost
all interest in the affair, and offers to do us a bombardment instead.
We will think about this. In the meantime we have the satisfaction
of knowing that the morning papers will be green with envy at our
enterprise in furnishing even this fragmentary verbatim account of
the proceedings at the Conference.
“OUR NOTES AND QUERIES.”
Put and Answered in “Queen's” English.
BRITANNY.—There are,"we should say, few places now in Britanny
where one can be comfortably boarded and lodged on threepence a
*#, “Hope on Hope EvKR’s” best plan would be to go and try it.
RGATE.-There is no stag-hunting to be had here in the months
of January, Febru and March. It is unlikely that Mr. SANGER
would let the Wild Elk from his Collection at the Hall-by-the-Sea
out on hire for the purpose, as “DAMocLEs” suggests. He had
better apply to some respectable proprietor in the Black Forest.
PEKIN.—Can anyone tell me the most economical way of getting to
the above place. We are a family of fifteen, and five of us are dip-
somaniacs. We should therefore prefer an hotel with iron gratings
to the windows. Do you know of any such, and also can you inform
me whether there is a resident English beadle, and any public insti-
tution where Backgammon can be played gratis.-INQUIRING
CHERRYBLossOM.
WAPPING.-Can anyone tell me what sort of place I should find
Wapping as a winter residence? Also, what of the society P. as I
have six unmarried daughters, I should like to know that it is
select. I should be glad, moreover, if any of 3. readers could
furnish me with the names of one or two of the best-regulated and
most fashionable pensions.—GLAss SLIPPER.
RoME AND THE NEWLY-CANoNISED.— “Saints enough in the
Calendar, and to spare,” some may say. “I don't profess to be a
saint myself,” observes Mr. Punch; but however many there may
be, no true Énglishman can object to MoRE.”

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. XIII.--THE SYMPATHETIC FLIRT.
THE sun set, and the southern darkness fell swiftly on the muddy
puddle that a few adventurous Boers know as “Böster's Pan.”
-- lºglu lººk Under the ºne tree that
º: would be reflected in the

capable of reflecting any-

pipeful of tobacco, after

biltung. Not one of them
had a cartridge left in his
$ pouch, nor a button on his

case. Silent they sat there;
from opposite quarters each
had travelled that day to
the scanty springs of
Böster's Pan. Each had
lost all his Bushmen guides;

over the rolling veldt, one looking southwards to the sea, one north-
wards to the Suleiman Range, one westwards to the sunset.
Then each took from his pocket a worn letter, carefully unfolded
its frayed creases, and began to pore over lines which were obviously
dear, though they must long have been perfectly familiar.
Suddenly, splendid in silver, beamed the glorious African moon in
the high amber zenith.

The last comer, whose keen features wore the pale cast of the

Then each looked on his neighbour suspiciously, and each felt for
his revolver and º:
“Gentlemen,” said the eldest of the three, “I am a stranger to
you, May I ask if your imitation of my conduct, for which I am
perfectly ready to offer you every satisfaction, is an intentional
mockery P’” -
“We were both going to put the same question to you, and to
each other,” said his companions.
“Our last night has obviously come,” murmured the eldest of the
three, “Let us pass it—'tis our hearty English fashion—in dis-
coursing of our first loves . . She who can never be mine, at our latest
meeting, bade me, when I looked on the rising moon, to remember
her, and an affection and sympathy which, she declared, would be
deathless, though, as for love, that was beyond her power to give.
And really she always was most kind and sympathetic. Of course
you know,” drawing his dusty sleeve across his eyes, where glistened
a purer §rop than any in Böster's Pan, “of course she is not to blame
for a fellow's falling in love with her. Is she now?” -
“Your words,” replied the second Englishman, “remind me
strangely of my own, fortune. I, too, loved, a MARGARET; the

“How can the coincidence be accounted for? She whom I loved

“Willowy!” exclaimed the student, enthusiastically.

“A sistor—”
“A guardian angel!”
“She asked me always to write to her—”
“And tell her what I was doing, and how my heart's sorrow
schooled me to help others to bear their yoke—”
“And to be sure to forward any verses I might write,” said the
youngest, coming in like a chorus.
“Dear girl!—all sympathy and generous tenderness!—she asked
me to speak of her to-"
“My mother l’” whispered the second.
“My elder brother,” murmured the third, “the Duke of PETERs-
FIELD. She asked me who was my dearest friend, and I mentioned
old JACK–Heaven bless him!”
“Why, you are Lord ARTHUR WAvAsoUR!” said the eldest man.
“I am,” replied the stranger; “but what are titles—above all,
courtesy titles—at a moment like this?”
“Would that we three men, met here to die, and each for love of
a different woman, could show each other the face of our dearest!”
exclaimed the second traveller.
As at the word of command each drew from his breast a diamond-
studded locket. . Each opened his own reliquary, each gazed at his
neighbour's, each exclaimed, “By George! MARGARET MERRYToN l’”
At that moment, through the darkness and the silence, whirred
the noise of flying wheels. They listened, they doubted, they hoped,
then came certainty. It was the Kimberley mail-cart on its way to
Kukuanaland.
“Hi! Stop!, Woh! Oop-trek, Baas 1” shouted three, manly
yoices, and the driver, seeing three revolvers within an inch of his
breast, drew up his smoking horses.
“Gentlemen, spare me!” he said. “Don't rob the diamond-bags!
My bread depends on my getting them through. It’s as much as
my place is worth.”
“Bother the diamonds!”, exclaimed each wayfarer, with all an
Englishman's eagerness..." Hare you got the newspapers?”
“Oh, if that's all,” said the driver, “I can wait while you read
them by the light of the mail-eart's lamps.”
Each seized his favourite journal like a starving man. For months
these Englishmen had not seen a Pall Mall Gazette!. Each turned
to the page that bears the tidings of home and friends sorely
longed for, to Britain's wandering sons, on the reldt, the moun-
tain, the wave, and in the Arctic Circle and elsewhere. Then from
each manly breast came a groan, and these words followed—
“She’s married a Duke!” “She's run in old JACK!”
“At St. George's, Hanover Square, to His Grace the Duke of
Petersfield, Miss Mangºr Merryton.” - - -
“By Jove!” they all exclaimed, with unanimous decision, “she
was a confounded Sympathetic Flirt!”
They then insisted on driving back to Kimberley, where eve
comfort awaited them, and dinner was served in mine host's usu
style at the “Star and Garter.”
A PROPHET IN HIS OWN COUNTRY.
PRINCE BISMARCK in his speech delivered on Thursday, declared
that he did not expect to live three years longer. No doubt the
eminent Statesman has calculated the effect of the actions he pro-
poses to perform, and, therefore, is in a position to foretell accurately
the date of his decease... We should not be surprised if his “plan
of campaign” ran as follows:— -
1887. 2nd Quarter. Cession of Bulgaria to Russia, and threatened
bombardment of Vienna.
3rd Quarter. , Letter of congratulation to Her Majesty the QUEEN
of ENGLAND, and attempt to seize the British Australian Colonies.
4th Quarter. Fraternal greeting to the PRESIDENT of the FRENCE
REPUBLIC and partially successful effort to destroy Paris by dynamite.
1888. 1st Quarter. Cession of Spain to Italy, Belgium and Hol-
land to Norway, and Switzerland to Austria, on the conditions that
Germany is allowed to do what she pleases with France.
2nd Quarter. Germany seizes New Zealand, Borneo, and Bombay.
On remonstrances being offered to Prince BISMARCK, he apologises,
and says he is forced to recognise the situation.
3rd Quarter. Bombardment of Rome, and destruction of
Brighton. Investment of St. Petersburg, and burning of Vienna.
Prince BISMARCK explains that all this is done in the cause of peace,
4th Quarter. Occupation of Ireland, and Marseilles converted
ermanently into a German port. . At a grand banquet, Prince Won
}. assures his audience that it is ridiculous to talk of war.
1889, 1st Quarter. Further . Planting of the German
flag on the soil of Australia, which causes annoyance to England.
2nd Quarter. Persecution of Jews. Worrying Christians. Quarrels
fostered everywhere. Prince BISMARCK sings the praises of peace.
3rd Quarter. Europe plunged into a suicidal war. Everything
conquered or crippled. Prince BISMARCK is more assured of peace
an ever.
4th Quarter. Indignation Meeting of all Nationalities. Discovery
of treachery, and sudden decease of Prince BISMARCK.

WENI, VERDI, WICII
(From Our Correspondent in advance.)
- MILAN, January 25th.
WERDI remains_dumb, Borro continues mute, FACCIo
keeps silent, and RICORDI refuses to say a word. Critics
are excluded from the rehearsals, and the leading singers
are bound under heavy penalties not, outside the theatre,
to sing one note of their leading motives. Nevertheless
I can give you, about Otello, information which you
would scarcely get from anyone else. In the first place,
let me note, by way of memorandum, that I have had to
pay rather a large price for my stall. But it is worth a
couple of fivers to hear such a tenor, as TAMAGNo. He
impersonates Othello; and, with a view to appropriate-
ness of colour,VERDI has, in the pianoforte score, written
the part entirely for the black keys. In one part of the
opera the terrible moor of Venice is represented by what
I may term a musical landscape composed of airs culled
from the Wenetian lagunes.
The character of the heroine is admirably painted
especially in the last scene, when the dying moan o
Desdemona is accompanied by a genuine Cremona
—manufactured, without regard to cost or time, expressly for the occasion.
The Willow Song will be illustrated in the printed libretto by plates of the
same pattern. Desdemona's dying sigh is reproduced in a series of echoes,
which, however feeble, will be heard throughout the famous theatre. It is
proposed to call these remarkable passages, “Scala's Echoes of the Weak.” The
representative of Desdemona is Signora PANTALEONE, who excels in pantomime.
But PANTALEONE is not a pretty name for a lady, is it? Why not have changed
it to Colom BINAP
As regards the setting of some of the most celebrated Shakspearian passages,
the words “There’s magic in the web of it,” are accompanied by well-
knitted chords which are positively enchanting. In the speech to the Senate,
the “spirit-stirring drum”...will be beaten with a wooden-spoon, which the
performer will use between the strokes for stirring up a glass of spirits-and-
water. Equally happy is the Composer's treatment of another phrase in the
same scene. Hearing, that among the eminent Composers who had taken places
for the first performance, were §. MAssENET, DfIIBES, TOSTI, GoRING
THOMAs, and others, he, with delicate flattery, set the words “My very worthy
and approved good masters,” to a combination of melodies borrowed from the
works of these maestri.
With reference to the orchestration, WERDI hating, as every great Composer
must do, the country of MozART, BEETHoven, SCHUBERT, WEBER, EER
MENDELssoRN, WAGNER, and so many other musical impostors, has banished
from his score the German flute. Bearing in mind the adage on the subject of
two strings to a bow, he has introduced a magnificent adagio for violins; to
be played with bows each of which has been furnished with two strings. The
cornets will be without pistons, the trombones without slides, and the clarinets
(those, I mean, which have been specially constructed for playing in Knaturl)a
without mouthpieces. After the first performance the Composer of Otello will be
serenaded—not, as many still expect by Signor FACCIO's magnificent orchestra,
but (with an appropriateness on which it is unnecessary for me, to dwell) by
a band of Ethiopian serenaders. WAGNER may have composed Music of the
Future. But never mind the Future. Give me VERDI, whose beautiful melodies
entitle him to be considered our First Aorist. Viva Verdi / Vive Milan /
And to you I will add: Vivez mille ans !
BROUGHT To Book.-MR. ARTHUR H. D. ACKLAND complains that “Govern-
ment Literature,” by which he means the Blue Books, is not brought out; either
in style or price, in a manner to attract the general reading public. Why not,
then, start a Shilling Series, on the following lines? Here is a suggestive pre-
liminary list:—Saved / or, the Eleventh Hour. A Cabinet Romance. By the
PRIME MINISTER; Cutlasses and Contracts. A Story of the Sea. #. the FIRST

WHO’S TO HAVE IT?
THE announcement that Russia will not insist on the candidature
of the Prince of MINGRELIA for the Bulgarian Throne, has at onceled
to active “inquiry” on the part of the Regents, at Sofia. The
following few replies taken at random from a British Letter-Bag,
may be regarded as a sample of the innumerable answers of a confi-
dential character received by them in the course of the last few days.
MY DEAR SIRs, -
BELIEVE me, I am deeply sensible of the honour you do me,
in offering me the Bulgarian crown, and though, I, assure you m
heart goes out to you in response, I am compelled to decline it:
could not interfere, with our present magnificent business. But
could you not send the Sobranje and your Constitution over here?, I
might place it in the hands of WILLs and possibly produce it. the
season after next. Think this over, and believe me, with all artistic
sympathy, Yours devo HENRY IRWING.

DEAR SIR8, - -
NorwiTHSTANDING your flattering assurance, which I fully
believe, that my acceptance of the thronewould befayourably viewed
at St. Petersburg, I must nevertheless beg you to hold me excused if
I say “No,” to your tempting offer. My energies are at the present
moment concentrated on the acquisition of a far more important
leadership nearer home. I am, Dear Sirs, Yours sincerely,
W. E. GLADSTONE.
MR. J. L. ToolE presents his compliments to the Regents at Sofia
and begs to inform those gentlemen that as his present wºnd
engagement as Butler, suits him uncommonly well, he has no idea of
throwing it up to take that of a mere East-End Monarch, the per-
quisites of whose place are not even mentioned. Mr. J. i. Toore
would inform the Regents that if they wanted showy

substantial middle-aged potentate, who would look the part
thoroughly, they could not do better thanfallbackupon Mr. BILLING-
ToN, though Mr. J. L.T. much doubts whether that gentleman will
see his way to entertaining the idea himself.
GENTLEMEN, - - -
I Must confess myself overwhelmed by the distinction you
have done me the favour to confer on me. , But you surely cannot be
acquainted with my principles. Why, I should be cutting down my
own Civil List, and in a week should not be left with a single princely
prerogative. Try Epmunp. I am, Gentlemen,
Yours faithfully, HENRY LABouch-ERE.

it comes upon me as a pleasant surprise, finds, me so occupied in

must ask you to excuse me if I do little more than acknowledge it.

genius, RICHARD BRINSLEY himself; but there neverywas much really
“new” about him, as he made, anything worth taking his own, re-
producing it worked up and polished to perfection, so that it looked
"as good as new,” and was, in fact, much better. As to the story
about the actors receiving their parts in the last Act of Pizarro
within half an hour of their playing its and then playing it success-
fully, we only wonder that anyone with Mr. FITZGERALD's practical
experience of the Stage could accept and repeat it as literally true.

A LITTLE PROPHECY ABOUT A BIG THING.
“AND what is this place?” asked the civilised New-Zealander,
who, tired of sitting on the ruins of London Bridge (which, truth to
tell, were not very safe), had journeyed further West.
“Well,” said the
mournfully, “it has a very sad history! It was commenced nearly
a hundred years ago, when I was quite a child, and it has never
been completely finished.” - -
“Dear me!” observed the intelligent foreigner, putting up, his
electric pince-nez; “and yet it seems to be sadly out of repair ſ”
“It does, it does!” sobbed the emotional veteran. “I can scarcely
bear to look at it. So full of promise too when originated l’’
“Was it ever a theatre P” asked the New-Zealander.
‘‘I fancy it was at one time,” replied his informant... “I am not
uite sure, because it has had gaps in its history which no one has
the memory to fill in ; but I rather think that it was used once for a
Shakspearian festival on the occasion of the four-hundredth anni-
versary of the poet's birth. Ifancy they§§ Hamlet in it.”
“But how did it begin?” again queried the New-Zealander.
“Well, there was a great flourish of trumpets, but (so tradition
says) not much money. The Public did not care to invest in an
unknown quantity.” . And the Oldest Inhabitant wiped his eyes
with a German cotton handkerchief.
“I am not surprised. But how did it begin?”
“It took several years building, and then was opened either as a
Technical College or a Circus—I forget which, but I knowit has been
both. I fancy it must have been first a Circus, as I have some recol-
lection of the loose boxes being turned into studies, which I imagine
were used subsequently for the Technical College.”
“Well, what became of it next?”
“Then, I think just about the time of the burning of St. Paul's,
it was used as a substitute for that cathedral. When the old church
was rebuilt, it became empty again.”

“Then there was one of those periodical panics about the Lunacy
Laws, and Hanwell being abruptly abolished, it became an excellent
substitute for Colney Hatch. It was rather a success as an asylum.”
“Did it continue to be used for that purpose?”
“Not for very long; because the inmates, becoming convalescent,
formed themselves into a Committee, and, with the permission of the
Lunacy Commissioners º took a very lively interest in the
scheme), converted the place into a Swimming Bath and Garden of
Acclimatisation, affiliated to the Newspaper Department of the
fibrary of the British Museum.
“And how did it succeed in its new character?”
“I am afraid not quite as well as its best friends could have
ldest Inhabitant, shaking his snowy locks||
wished. Somehow or other the Swimming Bath and Garden of
Acclimatisation affiliated to the Newspaper Department of the
British Museum, although boasting some most illustrious names on
the management, never entirely secured the absolute confidence of
the British Public. It was then used by the Government for testing
their new invention—their non-explosive gunpowder and innocuous
. “And then, . al . miscalculation on the part of the
inventor (a most excellent officer in the Commissariat), the building
was blown into atoms, and left as you see it now.”
“Most interesting!” murmured the New-Zealander. “But what
was it called P’” -
“It was called originally—that is to say in 1887—the Imperial

A PROTEST.
WE lately came across an advertisement of Mr. Jon Es's Noble
Vagabond, at the Princess's, and here it is:—
UNCH says: “I shall certainly advise all my friends to go and see
The Noble Vagabond.”
Mr. Punch objects to being misquoted. What he did say, in con-
yersation with Mr. NIBBs, was, “I shall tell”—the advertisement
has been amended in this respect—“all my friends to go and see
this piece for the sake of Miss DoRothy DENE's performance and
Mr. WARNER's remarkable imitation of the make-up and manner of
Mr.JULIAN CRoss as Qld Scorier.”
This is what Mr. Punch,--who was disappointed with the play,
which he thinks utterly collapses in the Third Act, said, and it is not
fair to place this Managerial gloss on Mr. Punch's words by*::::
a full stop in the line where #. was no stop at all. The Manage-
ment having inserted a full stop in the wrong place, Mr. Punch
makes this protest in order to put a final stop in the right place to
such misquotations. He can't permit it, even to a Jones and his
Noble Vagabond.

ARRIs hisself, who I saw agazing at, it in perfound estonishment,

all the Kings and Queens of England being acted by most butifool
children, and all drest in the most lovely sattin and welwet dresses
as countless suvvering could procure. Some on 'em was that perfeck
in every respek as made you, think as proberbly most of our great
Kings and Queens was werry little uns.
I declares as I was in that state of egscitement at the site, that I
can ardly remember none on 'em seperately, but jest a few lingers in
fond mem'ry. MARY, Queen of Scotch was purfekly lovely, and
didn’t at all mind being so close to Queen ELIZABETH, who went
sailing by with her choler up, with all the dignerty of a reel Lady
Maress. ºf HENERY THE 8TH, axshally brought all his six wives
with him, and insted of looking jest a little bit ashamed of hisself,
before sich a company too, went along a larfing away as if he was
quite proud of 'em. The two poor little Princes who was a bein
taken to the Tower, close by, and who was drest in most butifoo
black sattin, was the hobserwed of all hobserwers, and if their good
mother append to be present, as she *. was, she must have
been a prowd and happy woman. I did hear as they was descended
from the grate Abbot A'BECKETT, but I ain't werry well up in my
Conchology. ...CHARIES THE 2ND, who I allers understood was one of
the wust of the old lot, went strutting along like the best on 'em.
CHARLEs THE 1st looked jest a littel melancolly, as one wood
natrally expeck, under his rayther uncumfortabel circumstances.
Well, after this wunderfool site was all over, lots of their madjesty's
and their attendants came a rushing into the refreshment room as if
suddenly seized with a parching thirst, so I hadn't muchoppertunity
for seeing what emediately follered, which I was told wº"the Feº.
forming Dogs, and Punch and Judy, which seemed rayther a slite on
the Royal personidges as had jest finished. I noticed, later on in the
evening, as many of the †: and Queens looked remarkable tired.
If it be so for a few hours what must it be for ãº. long ears!
One of the most remarkablest effects of the hole evening was
caused, I was told, by the sudden change of weather. BRowN was
the first to come and enounce it to us, which he did by rushing in
and saying, “Here's a pretty go!, all the stattys in the All is a
busting out into a perfuse perspirashun!” And so they was l And
a wunderful site it was to see, they looked for all the world as if
they’d all bin a bathing, and had all forgot their towels, and sum-
body had stole all their clothes. I saw the nex Lord Mare and Lady
Maress a looking on at the percesshun, as if they was a saying to
theirselves, we shall have to do our best to beat this, but we’ll try,
and them as knows 'em best, says, whatever they makes up their
minds to you may consider it dun.
With my usual good fortin I got behind the scenes at the Punch
and Judy show, and I hardly expecks to be beleeved when I says that
the hole of the orchester for that most intresting performance was
performed by one wery jewvenile performer. He played the drum
with one hand, and a large number of mewsical pipes with the other,
and with a sperrit and energy as was quite wunderfool considering as
it was all done on two cups of coffee and one lemonade.
The new Governor of the Tower was there, Lord MAGDALEN, I
think they called him, I don't know whether he came to look after|D
the two young Princes who had managed to get out, posserbly not.
But I herd a Common Councilman say to him, as he was taking acup
of coffee, “I assures you, my Lord, we all sleeps much more cum-
fertable in our beds since your Lordship has been apinted Governer
of the Tower.” His Lordship didn't say nothing in reply, but there
was a twinkle in his keen gray eye, as spoke wollums. fºe had a
rather long experiense in warious kinds of gammon, naturally so,
from my special wocashun, but I says without a shadow of a dowt,
that for a perfeck º of that great gift, and said º:
and with Tewery semblance of sincerity, commend me to a well-
seesoned Common Counci -
How one touch of natur makes us all kings and queens ! No
sooner had a most butifool young lady, named ALICE, begun for to
show us all she had seen in Wunderland, which I º is somewhere
in Monseer JULES WERNER's country, that myson WILLIAM reads to us
about sumtimes, than all the kings, and queens, and princes, and their
atendants, and even jockeys, and ploughboys, and niggers, and
charity children, and sailors, all rushed, into the Egyptian All,
which was turned into a Theater, with fields and trees jest like life,
and sat down and laughed, and clapped their hands at all the *
little things they saw and heard, jest as if they was all alike. An

TURNING OVER NEW LEAVES.
THE Hon. Mrs. CHErwynd's Sara (F. W. WHITE & Co.), though
somewhat dull at the beginning, increases in interest as the story
- proceeds. The misunder-
standing is cleverly worked
out; and if the story is
somewhat too long, it is the
fault rather of the absurd
three-voluminous system
than the author. The best
work has been expended on
the heroine: “ Che sard,
*— sarà.” Undoubtedly, Sara
is the main attraction of the
novel. Love and Liking-
“For loving and liking he
little did care!” sang the
Jolly Young Waterman.
* We will not be so incon-
siderate to apply the line
to Miss M. E. SMITH's novel
but undoubtedly we should
have liked it better had it
been shorter. Authors are not to be blamed for this so much as
the libraries. Years ago novels, were published in four volumes,
sometimes in six. We are gradually improving, and shortly the
one-volume story will carry all before it. Belcaro (WHATCHELL
& Co.) is a book of essays on, sundry aesthetical quºtions, º
clever lady who writes under the nom de plume of “WERNoN LEE.”
AEstheticism has been so associated with Mrs. Cimabue Brown and
AMaudle, and the rest of the long-haired unhealthy lot, that it would
be well to warn mere f". at the title-page that there is ºf
whatever of pinchbeck aestheticism about this volume. They
find ten essays on Art, and all of them well worth reading. The
Making of New England (J. FISHER UN wºn), by SAMUEL ADAMs
RAKE, is a gompact little volume, full of information well indexed.

“HERE WE ARE AGAIN 1..?"
THE new eccentric burlesque opera Ruddygore, an idiotic but ap-
§. title, by Messrs. GILBERT and SULLIVAN, was produced last
aturday night. Nothing that excellent scenery, exquisite costumes,
pretty faces, thorough drilling, good singing, and plenty of dancing,
and a gushingly enthusiastic audience, could do to achieve a first
night's success was omitted, and yet, somehow, Ruddygore wasn't
happy. There were three distinct hits, firstly Mr. LELY's song and
hornpipe, secondly Mr. BARRINGTON and Miss Bond in their serious
duet; and dance,—reminding us of “The Quakers,” once so popular
at the Music Halls and in a Gaiety burle ue-and thirdly §. sur-
prise (which is the essence of wit) caused by Sir ARTHUR Surrºn,
who, when the scene was in total darkness, conducted his orchestra
with what at first sight appeared to be the familiar red hot poker of
antomime, but which was in reality a béton illuminated by electric
ight. The idea of the burlesque is y to start with, but not to go
on with. The development of the scene from Mr. GILBERT's Ages Ago
at the GERMAN REED's is not as effective as it might and ought to have
been. The first Act is bright, the second isn't. At any other Theatre
the same piece, with different names attached to its production, would
have had a bad time of it, but who will venture to say this of the
Great Twin Brethren of the Savoy, who are always treated on the
“most favoured Theatre’ terms by the critics? e speak only of
it as we found it on the first night; perhaps, after some excision, it
may be considerably improved; but, “taking one consideration with
another,” Ruddygore is not even up to the mark of The Princess or
Iolanthe, and not within measurable distance of The Mikado, which,
by the way, might be successfully revived.

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. XIV.-THE SMALLEST ANONYMOUs AUTHOR IN ExISTENCE,
THOSE industrious persons who devote their best energies to solving
riddles in weekly papers for the dazzling guerdon of a divided guinea
might employ their ingenuity
to worse purpose than in the
endeavour to ascertain the par-
ticular kind of author who
forms the subject of this study,
and a prize of sensational value
might be offered with perfect
security to the successful com-
petitor.
Of course a great many
whose delight is in the Retort
Obvious, would write to connect
this somewhat dubious distinc-
tion with the writer of this
paper, but in that case he
wºuld, as the awarder of the
prize, feel it, his duty to ad-
judge all such answers, incor-
rect. However, he, thinks it
advisable to §. an
GEdipus among his readers wit
what he believes are
“additional lights.”
This obscure, but not wholly
uninteresting literary pheno-
menon, then, is a compound of
aradoxes. Unknown, even under so much as a nom de guerre or
inverted initials, his works occupy the same shelves as the most
popular novels of the *{i, He is as much read as anyone, yet
there are none to praise his style or recommend him. Endowed
with a conceit which approaches the sublime, he yet remains of his
own free will a modest abstraction, and never gives the slightest clue
to his identity. He is the most egotistic of altruists, a cynic with a
flow of sloppy sentiment, a Puritan whose expressions verge at times
upon the Aristophanic, an ardent grammarian and a º speller,
and through these and countless other incompatible phases, he
remains the same One and Indivisible, Fool, and preserves unstained
his escutcheon as a manysided but still unmistakable ass.
Are more lights wanted? They shall be given. The covers which
enshrine some of his best productions, bear titles which convulsed all
literary London in their day, and at Jon Es's Esplanade Library or
BROWN's Pump-Room Bazaar, are even now occasionally inquired
for on wet afternoons. Yet it will be scarcely credited that he never
received a single penny from a publisher for anything he has written,
and that in . of the circulation he has attained, a grateful country
will never place his effigy upon a pedestal, or his name upon its
Civil List l He does not even expect this himself.
Does the reader give it up? No, of course he º; it long ago—
but Mr. Punch at alleyents will not condemn him to pass a week
upon tenterhooks. He hastens to announce that the form of anony-
mous small-authorship which it is intended to study here, is that
exhibited by the versatile and, indefatigable, being who scribbles
upon the margins of books which do not belong to him, remarks
which are of no general interest.
Mr. Punch of course, is not unaware that many of our greatest
writers have govered the, books they have borrowed with marginal
annotations that render them priceless for all time, but he considers
it unnecessary to draw distinctions which are so obvious.
The Marginal Annotator of the baser sortis remarkable for his omni-
yorousness, he will annotate anything from Mr. Sponge's Sporting
Tour, to haniel Deronda, THACKERAY to Uncle Tom's Cabin, Miss
BROUGHTON to John Inglesant—it is all the same to him, and the
stumpy lead pencil which seems to lend itself more readily to the
flow of his ideas.
In his more reserved moods he #. confines himself to recording
whether the author has or has not filled his intellectual void. If this
has been accomplished, he writes º: or underlines passages
here and there, while in case of a failure, he inscribes upon the
title-page the crushing condemnation, “Rot!”
..But this terseness of his will expand at times, often into auto-
biographical fragments of incalculable value and interest, as where
after some vivid word-painting by Mr. BLACK or Mr. BLACKMORE,
our Annotator good-naturedly informs us that he was in the neigh-
bourhood himself some time ago, and stopped at the best hotel, but
iconsiders the description of scenery in the text rather exaggerated.
He is great too on Ethics: “The authoris wrong here,” he remarks,
opposite one of the § passages of GEORGE ELIOT, “see
article in this week's Family Heraldon similar subject.” Or, “why
didn't she tell the Vicar at once that she was secretly married to the
Baronet's foster-brother?” Etiquette, too, is a strong point of his.
known as
“No lady would have said this!” and “Not the act of agentleman /*
he comments severely at intervals.
£, He will often bitterly resent the behaviour of certain characters:
“Why does the author make Mrs. Proudie so disagreeable?”. “I
think. Becky Sharp was a wretch!” “I hate Count Fosco 1" he
records on various margins.
Then we meet him in his captious and carping mood; when, for
example, he sneers, “The author appears to think partridge are shot
with a breechloader" or, “I was not aware you caught salmon with a
worm /* Indeed he is always industrious in detecting and removing
blemishes, and has been known to change “Oxbridge” to Cambridge,
and “Camford” to Oxford, wherever he comes upon these palpable
slips. It is sad to find from internal evidence that the Marginal
Annotator's life has not been all sunshine, that he, too, has
fulfilled the common doom—has loved and been betravedi' For
how else can we explain such Byronic ejaculations as, “How like a
woman!” “A lie! no woman is ever, sincere—they are all hypo-
crites!” or such a passage as this, “The author must have known
what it is to waste his affection upon a mere heartless doll, or he could
not have described it so accurately l’’
But the Marginal Annotator is full of contradictions, which if not
, are so glaring at times as to force upon us an uneasyim-
ression that there may be two or more of him—worse still, that a
emale Annotator is not an utter impossibility. For some of the
utterances are suspiciously feminine, while others are hº uncom-
plimentary criticisms, not of the printed, texts, but of foregoing
marginal comments, which, unless the writer, like Mr. RusKIN, is
correcting the extravagance of his cruder youth, it seems difficult to
accept as the work of the same hand.
However, there are solemn mysteries which we shall never be
accounted worthy to penetrate in this lower life; the Marginal
Annotator will never raise his mask, never inform us why or for
whom he undertakes his supererogatory labours.
And it may be that, in some future stage of the world's progress,
when posterity evolves the power to read the myriad characters which
have so long sparkled undeciphered upon the scroll of Heaven, there
too amongst those dread secrets will be discerned scribbled in
asteroids or dotted down in fixed stars, some such brilliant observa-
tion as, “How true!” or, “What Bosh!” But evenin apotheosis the
Marginal Annotator will probably remain anonymous.

Of a girl from a London rookery.

In modest wise she *::: her eyes,
But never drops her H's.

And that is the London flow'r-girl's form
As seen in a melodrama.

I curl myself up in SPEAKER's Chair. Looks cautiously round.

“And how do you think I'll get on, Toby ? Do you suppose I'll

“Not at all,” I said, taking the opportunity, in the absence of the

THE CHILDRENPS CHOICE.
ALICE in Wonderland will continue to delight children as long as
there are any left in town to visit the Prince of Wales's, the home
of the BRUCE, which is crowded every after-
noon. We suppose that all children over
eight years of age must have read LEwis
CARRoll's book, so thoroughly conversant
are they with its scenes and characters.
It’s a º: re-advertisement for the
book, and the Christmas CARRo1.L. ought to
be grateful to Mr. SAVILE CLARKE, the
dramatiser of this work. But, mind you, it
is not a work to please the elder. at
delights the little ones will not suit their
parents and guardians, who must be con-
tent with taking a back seat, and bein
enchanted to see a theatre filled wit
children thoroughly enjoying themselves.
It is all very well, for anyone, say over
thirty, to take up the book, look at Mr.
TENNIEL's wonderfully fancy pictures, and
to 'select here and there some nonsensical
prose and funny verse. But to sit out
nearly three hours of inconsequent dialogue and utterly idiotic songs,
given with only one rest, of ten minutes, between the two Acts,
strikes us as an uncommonly f; E.P.": for being entered on
the books of Colney Hatch. d then from the experienced play-
goer's point of view—for whom it, was never, written, and never
intended, so he'd better not go and see it, what effective chances
have been lost! and, with the exception of the Gryphon, the Mock
Turtle, the Hatter, the March Hare, and Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-
dee, how unsatisfactory are the realisations of Mr. TENNIEI's ideals!
Why, the Chess Queens look like bottles of salad mixture, and the
Pawns like overgrown fungil Then the song of the jabberwok-
—oh dear, oh dear!—utterly lost. It ought to have been declaimed
to music by a good reciter, and the fight with the Monster should
have been shown by means of a magic lantern and electric light, or
some such device.
However, it was written for the children, and not for their seniors,
and the children could go and see it over and over again, and never
be tired. We recommend the Papas and Uncles who take them, to
see a little bit of the beginning, then to retire to their Club, and, if
they indulge in such a habit, smoke, or read, the papers, and return
in time to see Tweedle-dim and Tweedle-dee in the second Act.
For which tip they'll thank us.

MUCH IN POINT.
IN the now historical case of Brett v. The Holborn
Festaurant, the Plaintiff alleged that a needle and thread
had been served up with his spinach and quail, and that
he had swallowed and suffered. “One swallow makes one
suffer” sometimes, and the unfortunate Mr. BRETT had
been undoubtedly a sufferer.
There is a slang phrase, “getting the needle,” meaning,
“being angry,” often used by 'ARRY. Well, might a
man “get the needle,” who had indeed actually swallowed
one. There is a dinner called “potatoes and point,”
which sounds the nearest thing to “spinach and needles;”
but the Holborn never professed to serve either of them.
But as far as the Holborn Restaurant was concerned in
the matter of the needle, the Jury, though they followed
the thread of the argument about the needle, were unable
to see the point, and the Chief Justice shutting up the
needle-case, observed in effect, that “it was needles—he
should say needless—to proceed any further,” except to
the Holborn Restaurant, where, as he had heard from his
Brother PUNCH, and as was pretty clear from the evidence
i.Court, they served very many and uncommonly good
ners.
Mr. Justice PUNCH concurred, and added, that had the
Restaurant been situated in Threadneedle Street, this
accidental circumstance might have had its weight.
Quail was not, to his mind, associated with Needles—they
were not a sea-bird; nor was it of the Pin-tail family.
It was true that the French for spinach was €pinards,
and here, undoubtedly, there was a “pin” in the middle.
But a pin was not a needle, and this made, not a mere
pin's point of difference, but an essential and vital dis-
tinction between this and such a possible case. When
he (Mr. Justice PUNCH) went to the Holborn he should
.# ask, at the right season of the year, with the
poet HoRACE—a great gourmet, by the way—
“Qualem commendes?”
And if the Manager did recommend the bird, he should
certainly eat it, even though it had been shot with a
needle-gun, without fear of it or its surrounding
“spinach.” The Jury yº, properly gave a verdict for
the Holborn Restaurant. Had it been for the Plaintiff,
it would have been recorded as Needles and Spinach;
|Yah!
but, as it is, the Jury's opinion of the case might º
have been less politely expressed by Gammon and Spinach.
*ARRY IN THE WITNESS-BOX.
DEARCHARLIE, -
DESSAY you’ll remember I told you a good bit ago,
'Ow I served on a Jury. Well, chummy, they nailed me agen, dontcher know.
Not quite on the same little lay, though; they 'ooked me as Witness this round,
In the case of McSlobber v. Muggins; you’ve 'eard of that case, I’ll be bound.
It was pasted all over the place, and the name of Yours Truly, dear boy,
Has bin printed in all the dashed papers, a barney * 'd think I'd enjoy.
Not a bit on it, CHARLIE, believe me! f don't minia 'ealthy trot out,
But this bizness has bloomin'well broke me, and jolly nigh give me the gout.
Poppylarity’s pleasant, my pippin, and “ARRY” ain't one o' them sort
As is frightened to spread theirselves out; quite contrairy, it's proper’igh sport.
When I got the soopeener, I tellyer, Ichi-iked and chortled with glee,
And if ever a feller stood up and shook 'ands with hisself, it was me.
Thinks #: º then 'ARRY, my sparkler, you want to strike one,—here’s yer
onance
The brocoli-wigs must jest watch it; way-oh! won't I lead 'em a dancel
Them Kew Seas is wonderful clever, and dabs at a snack or a joke,
But if 'ARRY don't romp round the lot on 'em—well, I'll go home and eat coke.
Qh, CHARLIE!!! Wot swivel-eyed jossers the best on us is, mate, at times'
Owsomever I’d better look slippy, and rumble along with my rhymes.
I got myself up a rare buster, tan kids and a brown Hinverness,
With j; lack Hastrykan collar; you know I’m a whale at smart dress.
Can't say as I made the sensation I'oped. The old mivvy called Law
Is a sawdusty kind of a sell, with no soul above parchment and jaw.
I'd to 'ang round that Court for three days, CHARLIE, elbered, drove here and
shoved there.
A Witness must be a job-lot if he ain't wuth a stool or a chair.
The Beak and the Barristers—dash 'em!—sat snug as old china on shelves,
A-passin' smart compliments round, and a-crackin' bad jokes to theirselves.
When the Bench or the Bar made a wheeze, they all roared, the Beak wagged
his white pow,
And * . of a Husher cried “Horder!” as though hus poor coves made
e roW
There wos close on a score of hus witnesses, such a rum regiment, dear pal,
There wos parsons, and potboys, a cabman, two toffs, and a nervous old gal.
The old mivvy went orf in highstericks, the toffs lost their 'eds and talked
stuff,
And the parson got awfully mixed and flung out of the box in a huff.
The º hisself wos so flummoxed, he seemed to go slap orf 'is chump,
And leaked orkurd facts like a sieve when the Counseljest put on the pump.
He couldn't keep cool at the “nasty ones,” spluttered, went red in the face,
And jolly nigh mucked the whole game in his fear of not making a case.
Thinks I, well it all 'angs on me, that’s a moral... I’ll make 'em sit up!
They won't put the kibosh on me, that's St. Paul's to my tarrier pup.
Well, %. called me; I twirled my moustachers, and tipped a sly wink round the
urt,
As much as to say, “That rot's over, and now, rorty pals, you’ll see sport.”
They did, CHARLIE, oh! yus they did, mate; but I wos the wictim, wus luck!
A rat in a pit wos a king to me. Not that I shied or lost pluck;
No fear, that is not 'ARRY's form. But oh, scissors! that bloomin' old Beak!
He boshed all my patter to putty, and snubbed all my snideness as cheek.
He'adn't no eye for a “Star,” CHARLIE; that's where it wos, dontcher see?
I believe the “Big Bounce” at his best, in his patter-song, “Sparks on the
Spree.”
Would }. haſ bin clean chucked away on 'im. Jibbed when I put on the pace,
And “cut” all my cackle, dear boy, till I felt I could sit on his face.
Disgustin' !—“Jest answer my question,” the Counsel sez, “straight !” “Oh,

But I give up that speshal conundrum. You ask me another!”, sez I.
Then, Oh wasn't the fat in the fire, CHARLIE * Wigging P. That isn't the word.
If I’adn't dried up, they'd 'ave offed me to gaol for “Contempt” like a bird.
That mucked me, took all the romp out of me somehow. I fair lost my tip,
And went slopping all over the shop, letting all sorts o' secrets let slip.

64 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 5, 1887.
PICKING UP THE PIECES.
Mr. Punch. I am glad to hear they are going to revive ToM
TAYLOR's play of Clancarty at the Haymarket.
Mr. Nibbs. Yes. Mrs. KEN- cº-
DAL ought to be an admir- fºly
able Lady Clancarty.
Mr. Punch. No better. It
was a stirring play, as I
recollect it.
. Mr. Wibbs. ToM TAYLOR
did good work for the stage.
Mr. Punch. Yes, he was a
thorough dramatist.
Mr. Nibbs. But not always
original.
Mr. Punch. Seldom, I
should say. But what does that
matter?" The greatest dra-
matists and the greatest com-
posers have all cribbed the
materials on which their
enius has exercised itself. 7 zºw
is dialogue was telling, sturdy and frequently humorous. There
was a “go,” too, even about his rough blank verse which served his
dramatic purpose. - - - - --
Mr. Nibbs. What set you thinking of this, Sir?
Mr. Punch. Partly the announcement about Clancarty at the
St. James's, and partly having recently seen Mr. HENRY AUTHOR
Jon Es’s Hard Hit at the Haymarket.
Mr. Nibbs. I have seen it also. It struck me that Hard Hit was
no hit at all. -
Mr. Punch. It has this one unpardonable fault-it is dull. If it
were bad, there might be some question as to its degree of badness,
or some discussion as to which Act were the worst... But there is no
room for discussion or for dispute where a play is simply and unde-
niably dull. - - - -
Mr. Nibbs. There is one effective situation in the Fourth Act,
where the husband hides behind a curtain.
Mr. Punch. Yes, but nothing comes of it, as he disappears only to
meet somebody in the passage who clears up the difficulty. As to
the situation in the Third Act, it is the Screen Scene spoiled, just
as Mr. BEERRoHM TREE's, character is a compound of Captain
Bawksley and Joseph Surface, both spoiled, and Mrs. Ashby, is a
commonplace adaptation of Lady Sneerwell.
Mr. Nibbs. I see exactly what you mean, Sir. I thought the
actors very good in it altogether.
Mr. Punch. So good, that I would rather have seen them out of
it altogether, though had an actress like Miss SoPHIE EYRE been
cast for Mrs. Ashby, the piece might perhaps have gained by it.
Mr. TREE's make up is admirable; a trifle trop chargé, perhaps.
Mr. Nibbs. I thought Mr. KEMBLE capital as the garrulous Major.
Mr. Punch. And Mr. CouTTs, a name unknown to me on the
stage scored most decidedly as the little used-up... masher the
Honourable Effingham Nangle. . But why on earth did Mr. Jones
make the host introduce this ſpersonage to his guests as “the
Honourable?” Is it a new fashion in society?..
Mr. Nibbs. Perhaps Mr. Jones wishes to start it; but as the piece
has been out barely for three weeks, “Society” has not yet had
time to adopt the novelty. And perhaps you noticed, Sir, that to in-
tensify the absurdity, the gentleman described as “The Honour-
able” was being introduced to a real Baronet.
Mr. Punch. Impersonated by Mr. ARCHER who looked as if he had
stepped out of an illustration to a story in Revnolds's Miscellany...I
liked Mr. WILLARD, he was excellently made-upand actedremarkabl
well; but though it sounds paradoxical, he is best when he is bad.
Once let an actor acquire a reputation on the stage for being a villain
and the public will never believe in his conversion. Mr. DACRE is
another paradoxical person.
Mr. Nibbs. How so? -
Mr. Punch. He is physically a “slantingdicular”, actor, who
with a bias to the right “can’t go straight.” He was better suited as
Jim the Penman.
Mr. Nibbs. And Jim suited the public better than Hard Hit is
ever likely to do. - - -
Mr. Punch. It was hard on Hard Hit to follow Jim, just as the
enormous success of the Private Secretary told against The Pick-
pocket, and the Pickpocket, in its degree, * Lodgers, which is
or stuff, though at all events one can have two or three goo
earty laughs at Messrs. PENLEY and HILL. -
1 † Nibbs. No such luck at the Haymarket, where you can neither
augh nor Cry.
Mr. Punch. No. and an audience neither amused nor harrowed
becomes mildly indifferent or *...}. bored. Mr. Jones left
to himself, without any of his former collaborateurs, like the last
rose of Summer blooming alone, fails in construction. That is, as far
WNº.
d|he jumpe
as I can judge, as I have never yet seen one of his pieces where he
was sole author. His dialogue is plain and straightforward enough
for a melodrama like the Noble Vagabond, and in that only up to
the middle of the Third Act, when the muddle begins. But compare
Hard Hit with ToM TAYLoR's Still Waters, and then you’ll see
what might have been done in dialogue and construction with even
such old materials as Mr. Jon Es has got together.
Mr. Nibbs. Oddly enough, Sir, throughout Hard Hit they are
aly. talking about a “Still Waters ‘...ºf Limited.”
Mr. Punch. Perhaps that is what recalled the old piece to my
mind. However, it is sufficiently well-known nowadays among
play-going amateurs for them to appreciate the force of my observa-
tions. I have yet to see Mr. PINERO's new piece at the Court.
Mr. Nibbs. And the latest at the Royalty.
Mr. Punch. Both very amusing as I am told. I hear that our
friend AUGUSTUs DRURIolanus is to rule over Covent Garden as well
as Drury Lane. More worlds to conquer!... He has shown himself
ºnly clever at Old Drury, and we all wish him success. Au
platsir.
* HIS HIGHNESS I ?”
Robson as the Showman in the farce of Catching a Mermaid, used
to call out, “Walk up and see the Giant!, Alive! alive! alive!
He's eight foot, high, he's nine foot high, he's ten foot high!.
... Why, father,” said a boy, “the carawan ain't ten foot high!”
“He’s a sittin' down, stoopid! - Walk up ! Walk up!” and here at
the Pavilion, every night may be seen this tremendously tall man,
eight feet nine inches high, so they say, not ungainly for a Giant,
and looking as amiable as Giants always do outside books of fairy
tales, and apart from Pantomimic tradition. If anyone were justified
in preserving a lofty demeanour it would be HERR WINKELMEIER;
but he is polite to all, and affable with the lowliest. -
Mr. WILLIERs, Junior, showed us the great man's suite of apart-
ments, and they certainly have “done him,” very well at the
Pavilion. His Highness—doesn't he deserve the title which
Mr. Punch hereby bestows on him?—contrives to amuse himself
in the day-time by playing at draughts, and trying to make Mr.
EDWARD Swan Borough, the Acting Manager, understand what
he means. The Giant only speaks German, and Mr. Swan Borough
is limited to English.
..The Payilion Management are not averse to letting him out, though
if they “let him out” much, they would have to raise theroof. They
may loan him to some exhibition, but at present they are quite content
with his height, and don't want him to be higher'd anywhere else.
The Acrobats at the Pavilion are marvellous, and if a few of the
feats—arms and legs as well—of the LETINE and somarººn Troupes,
were introduced into a burlesque, and performed by some of the
regular actors, the novelty would draw the town. e have lately
seen how a tenor, Mr. LELY, can overcome all difficulties and dance a
horn-pipe, and it is a § that Mr. GrossMITH, or Mr. BARRINGTON,
as the first and second Bad Baronets, did not bestow some time on
acquiring one or two of the tricks of the KATsNosh IN Awata, which
would have lightened up their parts in the Second Act, amazingly;
but perhaps they’ll keep it for the Indian burlesque Opera, when
they can appear as the Bounding India-Rubber Brothers. In the
meantime a visit to the Pavilion will astonish the idler, interest the
anatomist, and amuse the Democritical observer.
“WHO SHALL DECIDE WHEN DOCTORS DISAGREE?”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
I HAVE not been very well lately, so I thought I would con-
sult that eminent physician Dr. A. The first thing he said to me
was, “What do you drink?” (if he had said what don't you drink,
it would perhaps have been more to the purpºse.) “Oh,” I said,
“things in general, anything that’s handy.” “The very worst
thing you can do; you should take nothing but a couple of glasses of
dry Sherry with your dinner.”. I followed his prescription for some
time, and getting no better, I resolved to see that distinguished
practitioner Dr. He immediately asked me what I drank—you
would think from their questions I was an habitual drunkard—I said
“only a little dry jº. “What!” exclaimed Dr. B., “dry
Sherry? That accounts for it... .You must take nothing but a pint
of dry Champagne.” I tried this for a week, and, finding myself
still out of sorts, I called upon the distinguished Dr. C. Of course
the usual question, And when Ireplied “a pint of dry Champagne!”
§ “Poison, my dear Sir, poison l No wonder you’re
out of sorts. Now, if you take nothing but a pint of Léoville—
the very best Léoville mind you, - we shall soon put you on your
legs again!”. I tried this remedy for a fortnight—for I rather
liked it—but found no improvement whatever in my health.
So on the recommendation of an old friend, I called on the fashion-
able Dr. D. The usual question, and then Dr. D. exclaimed, “You
should never taste a drop of wine of any description. Take the best

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Scotch whiskey and soda in moderation, and you will be well in a
week. I tried this, but became rapidly worse. ...And then?—then I
consulted º; Who shall decide when Doctors disagree?. I
will! I prescribe for myself. Dry. Sherry with soup and fish, a pint
of dry Champagne, with the rest of my dinner, a pint of Léoville
after it, and Scotch whiskey and soda with my cigar in the evening:
I have tried º own prescription—which combines, the wisdom ºf
four distinguished Doctors with my own-for a month, and you will
be glad to hear I never felt better in my life.
Yours, better-than-everly,
Tollollington Park, Tuesday. THE LAZY MINSTREL.
A FAIR START.
THERE may be many a slip between the cup and the lip, but there
is one most important “slip” between London and Ramsgate, in the
shape of a carriage, to be attached to the Dover Boat Express 11 A.M.,
which on Sunday mornings, will be a boon to the jaded London toiler.
. The first Sunday in February, Mr. Punch has the greatest pleasure
in announcing the fact, will see this new slipplanted at the L.C. & D.
line, Wictoria Station, which will, he hopes, takeroute and prosperfor
many a year. What more delightful for the fatigued Londoner, who
does not want the tohu-bohu of town renewed at the sea-side, than
to start at an easy-going hour on Sunday morning—is not 11 A.M.,
the very hour for a §: Service, specially when the rule as to a vast
number of Church Servicesis “short and early?”—and to breathe the
vital airs of the Kent coast ere yet the luncheon-bell hath sounded ?
This slip-carriage will be attached—so strongly attached, that the
attachment will be something touching to behold,—to the Dover Boat
Express, and will be taken off at Faversham. A slip-carriage, like
an individual, resents being “taken off,” and therefore at this point
it parts company with the Express, which pursues its rapid course
to Dover, and is taken up by a friendly local at Faversham, which
will convey it safely to Herne Bay, Westgate, Margate, Broadstairs
and Ramsgate, which last-named place, its ultimate destination, it is
timed to reach at 1'5. Mr. QUATREMAINE EAST of the Granville
Hotel on the East Cliff, has only to make his table d'hôte lunch at
1:30, and advertise it, to insure a number of visitors who would be glad
of the opportunity. Let Mr. Q. E. try it, and if the result will be
what we anticipate—Q.E.D.
Then for the Line Regiment, after the Faversham detachment is
*. the Herne Bays will arrive about 12:25, the Westgaters
in their peculiar uniform, simple “west” and “gaiters,” will be at
St. Mildred's or wherever they may be quartered, long before one,
and the Birchington Division will have easily reached their Bunga-
lows ere the gong sounds for tiffin.
This is a move, an excellent move, in the right direction, and we
trust that this “slip of a train” will grow into something perma-
nent and substantial. At all events this arrangement for Sundays at
Faver-sham is not a Sham favour, but a real benefit, of which
the weary of working ought to be eager to avail themselves; and
the § student who travels through the Kentish scenery, as his
eye lights up with Kentish fire, will exclaim that not in all the poets
from UCER to TENNYson, is there one line so true to nature as the
L. C. & D. line from Victoria to Ramsgate. If these movements in the
right direction continue, Mr. Punch will reward Mr. JAMES STAAT
Foºes and the Directors, Managers, and Superintendents of the
L. C. & D., with a P.O. (Punch Order) for Distinguished Railway
Services, to be worn on State occasions, when the costume will con-
sist of a magnificent train hanging from the shoulders, and carried by
three of BRADSHAw's Pages.

No. XW.—THE BLIND MAN's Dog,
MR. PUNCH desires to explain that he has included this particular
subject among his Studies upon the urgent recommendation of a
certain faithful attendant
of his own, who declares
that, with the single ex-
ception of himself, he is
acquainted with no quad-
ruped which presents a
more remarkable combi-
nation of devotion and
intelligence.
The first experiences of
the Blind Man's Dog must
contain a continual disen-
chantment. In early youth
he finds himself called
upon to lead an existence
nearly monastic, to re-
nounce the World, the
Flesh – and whatever in
Canine Ethics answers to
the Devil. He dare not
linger to inspect the most
alluring garbage; he may -
not run between the legs of a crowd, and yelp; he must not bark at
the heels of nervous horses; a dog he could roll over and worry to
shreds, may insult him grossly, and he must keep his tempºr; no
sticks or india-rubber balls are ever thrown for him to run after, as
for more privileged animals of his acquaintance; he scarcely knows
what a good wild scamper is, and has to walk ever soberly and dis-
j a uniform pace, neither allowing pleasure nor panic to
drive him to heel.
It is no wonder, then, that the Blind Man's Dog is distinguished
by a gravity, beyond his ears, or that the constant necessity of
...; the advances of other dogs should isolate him to a great
extent, and force him to occupy his mind with undoggish matters.
. Mr. Punch believes that his leisure moments are largely employed
in abstruse calculation, and that he amuses himself by reducing, the
*::: earnings to shillings, and comparing them with past receipts:
. He has certain compensations, no, doubt. Wherever he gºes, he
is almost as popular a character as the itinerant Toby himself. All
make way for him; and few stop to put their coin into the little tin
cup he carries, without giving him a friendly pat of approval.
This does not turn his head, though it does undoubtedly tend, to
develope in him an air of conscious dignity. But he remains affable
all, and never neglects a courteous welcome to the regular.client,
while, with the Blind Man himself he is on a footing of cordial fel-
lowship—never obtruding himself, yet always responding to advances
with warmth and cheerfulness. - - - -
He very sooncomes to take a keen interest in the business in which
he is the working F. not infrequently insisting on all moneys
passing º, is own mouth before being placed to the joint
account; but this precaution is probably due rather to the desire of
maintaining his Pºtion, than to any suspicion that the profits are
irregularly divided. -
So the pair prosper, and the regular client looks out for the Blind
Man's Dog at the accustomed spot day after day, and, if he is a soft-
hearted, sentimental kind of person, may even feel himself the better
somehow, for having seen this humble servant of the poor and
afflicted doing his duty almost as well as if he had ever heard of the
Church Catechism, until one day, perhaps, as he approaches the
}. after a short absence, he discovers that his shaggy, honest-
aced acquaintance is not at his usual post; and stopping casually,
to hear the explanation, learns that the junior and more energetic
member of the firm has become a sleeping-parter.

Taxes were high and prices low.
Between two fires a Chancellor tires,
For SMITH, says, ay, when he says no.

“Pledged to the lips waste to withstand.”
Then SMITH in horror shook his head,
And HAMILTON lifted a pleading hand:
“Help us from splitting,

OVERSIGHT IN THE QUEEN's SPEECH,-It
was not discovered till too late on Thursday
last that throughout the Queen's Speech no
mention or allusion has been made to Mr.
and Mrs. KENDAL having been royally com-
manded to play at Osborne in THEYRESMITH's
—(a compliment to Rt. Hon. W. H. SMITH)–
comedietta, Uncle's Will. However, in spite
of this injudicious omission, Bank Rate re-
mained unaltered, and, by diplomatic inter-
vention all round, all chance of panic in the
City was averted. Subsequently, on Mon-
day, J.'; of Uncle's Will (in which Mr.
and . KENDAL have the largest interests)
was taken at Osborne, where Uncle's Will
was proved—to be a success. This is the first
occasion, since the time of the Prince Consort,
of a performance “by command” at Her
Majesty's Osborne; but the first theatrical
performance the QUEEN witnessed was a few
ears ago when Her MAJESTY went to the
rince of Wales's (Scotland) to see Mr. BRUCE's
company in The Colonel.
A PINT IN. PORT.
One of the pint pots lately used at the defunct
“Cock” Tavern has been sent to the Laureate as a

Nay, Time all links doth sever,
Nor e'en the Cock “WILL’” sang of yore
Could keep his perch “for ever.”.
If, like the Phoenix, Fleet Street's bird
Anon were resurrected,
Why then—but there, the thing's absurd,
And not to be expectedl
Yet may it have a life as long
As the strange fowl of fable;
A fame enshrined in deathless song
Is something sound and stable.
This Cock, though driven from its post
Above the Tavern's portal,
Shrined in the Laureate's lines may boast
A destiny immortal.
No more “libations to the Muse,”
The plump-cropp'd fowl may witness';
But die 'twill not, and who'll refuse.
To see poetic fitness
In mellow-voiced “WILL WATERPRoof,”

Beneath his lordly later roof,
That “pint-pot neatly graven?”
WHo says “Young King CoAL.” is not
consistent? Why, it seems from Lord RAN-
poLPH's Apologia that his hostility to the
Coal Duties extends to the Coaling Duties-
which latter most Englishmen consider to
consist in provisions for the proper defence
of our Coaling Stations.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ONLY A ROOSE.
THERE's a nice cheerful paper by Dr. RoBSON. Roose in the Fort-
wightly for February, all about SS- -
Infection and Disinfection, and N
what Mrs. RAM would call “con- N
tiguous diseases.” He says that N
the word Disinfection was not N
known in literature till the end R
of the last century. If they
hadn't the word, they had the
thing. “All the infections,”
are what Caliban wants to pour
out on Prospero’s devoted head.
And hadn't Prospero disinfect-
ants? Of course, or where was
the use of his art, or of SHAKs-
PEARE's invention?
But the Doctor has got a
“bacterium” in pickle for the
healthiest of us. To think that
we have minute organisms—.
which means germs and nasty little ſ
creatures, telescopic-rod-shaped, in
our mouths— alive all alive!—but-
º won't bear thinking of. To
whatever nationality wenay belong,
the doctrine a la Roose describes us
as simply Germ'uns. Please, Doctor,
as you’ve given us physic in this
number, give us the sugar-plum to
take after it as soon as possible.
And don't go on being a nasty Germ,
but return to your old practical form about the Wear and Tear.
That’s the style preferred by Mr. Punch. and everybody else. Try
backterium.

INTERVIEWING A LA MODE.
A CHAT WITH THE PRIME MINISTER.
FEELING that at the opening of the Session, some direct hints from
the Marquis of SALISBURY would be appreciated by our readers, we
sent the other day one of our Representatives to Downing Street, and
have much pleasure in publishing his report:-
On reaching the official residence of the Premier and Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, I was immediately admitted and ushered
into the working-room of the noble Lord. In the centre of the
apartment was a pile of pºwer. five feet high, from which the
†. laughingly emerged.
“You are . ?” I queried, noticing that Lord SALISBURY had a
pen stuck behind each of his ears, and carried one in his mouth and
another in his hand.
“Not at all,” he replied shaking me heartily by the hand, and
moving a luxurious arm-chair towards me...“I was only knocking
off a little thing in º: settling some bother about the Afghan
frontier, and reading a despatch that had been just received from
ISMARCK.
“I am afraid I disturbed you?”
“Qh, no. I am heartily pleased to see you—all the matters I have
mentioned can wait—it is not often that one has a visit from you.”
... I propose to make my yisits more numerous.”
“I hope you will,” cried the Marquis, with the utmost cordiality,
and he again shook hands with me. “But, pardon me one moment,
—what is it, MANNERs?”
“The Ambassadors of France, Russia, Italy, Germany, Austria,
Hungary, and Turkey, are below, awaiting interviews, my Lord.”
“Oh, feam't be bothered with them.” exclaimed ford ALISBURY,
"...# . “Tell them I am busy. Ask them to call another day.”
The Private Secretary bowed, and left the room.
“And now, my dear fellow, what can I do for you? But first let
me give you a really good glass of port and a cigar. Although I
say it who ought not, you don't get wine like this every day. It was
given to me, by poor, old MUsuRUs PASHA, who, although he repre-
sented the Porte in this country, was not a port-drinker.”
And the Marquis filled two glasses from a black bottle covered
with cobwebs. e touched goblets, nodded, and drank.
.“I hope you have brought a large note-book, as I am anxious to
give lº the fullest particulars. You see I assume that you have
i. ? ºpon me for information. Well, what do you want to
OW
. “Well, can you tell me, Marquis, the true story of the negotia-
tions which culminated in the loss of poor Lord IDDESLEIGH º'
“Oh, certainly. Well, it came about like this. I will dictate to
you-stop me if I speak too rapidly for you to follow me.” And then
the PREMIER told the whole story without reservation.
When he had finished, luncheon was served, and we spent the next
quarter-of-an-hour in discussing a most recherché meal. When the
trºy had been removed, the noble Lord rang the bell for a messenger.
“Call in a tº: of porters, and take those papers, with my com-
Fº to the Under-Secretary, and ask him to settle them for me.
leave them entirely to his discretion. Tell him I would see to
them myself, only I am very busy to-day.”
“Oh, no!” I politely interposed.
“He will do them just as well as I would,” said the noble Lord, as
the messenger and porters disappeared with the heap of #.
“As Mr. Eccles used to say in Robertson's Caste, “I like to
see the young 'uns work—it does them £: and does me good.’
And now have another cigar while you drink your coffee. Which
do yºu take as a chasse, Cognac or Kümmel?”
“Can you tell me anything about our position with the Foreign
PoWers?”
“Why, º Here, take this note-book—yours, I see, is
full—and I will tell you all about it.”
Again my noble friend unbosomed himself, laughing heartily
when I occasionally uttered an exclamation of surprise on discover-
ing a State secret. We were still busy, when five-o'clock tea was
brought in.
“I really must go,” I said at last, “as I have another appoint-
ment. I have to attend on the first night of a new piece at the
Elephant and Castle Theatre.”
“Let me tell you one more story about BISMARCK–he was so
awfully clever in that colonial matter, which you will remember,
caused some excitement a little while ago?”
“Certainly—but this really must be the last.”
“Well, you must know—” and the Marquis told me one of the
most interesting histories I have ever heard.
On taking Imy leave I thanked my host for his great kindness.
“Not at all,” he replied, “I am always delighted to see you, and
hºp; you will look in upon me often.”
said I would, and moved towards the door.
“Oh, by the way,” the Marquis added, as an after-thought;
“Perhaps it would be as well not to put into type what I have told
you until I have spoken to my ºff. that they will mind.
It is only the etiquette of the thing, don't you see.”
“Oh, certainly—the publication of the information is not of the
slightest consequence. Our readers don't care a pin for that sort of
thing, but they would like to know that you wear a seal-skin waist-
coat. May I mention it?” -
“Certainly—and you shall have permission to do what you like
with what I’ve told you. ... I’ll mention the matter at the next
Cabinet. Only wait.” " " " " I am waiting.
RE-ASSURING; OR, QUITE PACIFIC.
St. PETERSBURG. —Though it is now admitted here, in official
circles, that within the last few days 70,000 men have actually been
massed on the Polish frontiers, it is explained that the incident has
occurred entirely owing to the misunderstanding of an order issued
by the War Department. As, however, it is assumed that no possible
importance can, under the circumstances, be attached by the European
Cabinets to the presence of the force in the locality indicated, it is
not proposed to withdraw it at present. -
WiFNNA.—The rumour that all the wool in the market had been
bought up by the Government for the manufacture of uniforms, and
that an order had been given for the immediate purchase of one
million pairs of military boots, is now denied. It is said to have had
its origin in the fact that a well-known Viennese firm has been
securing large quantities of the commodity with a view to the pro-
duction of red flannel petticoats, that are said to be likely to be much
the fashion during the course of the ensuing season. The canard as
to the military boots is referable to the receipt of an unusually heavy
order for dancing-pumps from a shoemaking firm at Buda-Pesth,
BERLIN.—The purchase, by the military authorities, of all the
available tinned meats in the country is, says the National Zeitung,
easily accounted for. The relish expressed by the aged EMPEROR for
this dainty delicacy is well known, and it has been to ensure a supply
of it for the Imperial table during the coming summer months, that
the authorities have taken the precaution in question. The order
relative to the export of horses, is now said, to have been limited to
that of “circus horses” only, and may, therefore, be regarded as
void of all significance.
PARIs.-The rumour that 72,000 shells have already been filled
with General BouTANGER's new explosive compound is not denied,
but it is pointed out that they are prepared solely with a view to the
firing of a feu de joie on the occasion of the forthcoming Republican
ëte to be held in July next. The story of the * required for the
uts on the Eastern frontier, is also explained. . It appears that, on
the contrary, they are to be employed in the construction of bathing-
machines on the Western Coasts, and that several dozens of them
have already been shipped to Dieppe.

DEAR OLD CHAPPIE, (To a Friend.)
I’ve been writing such a heap of Latin lately, that I can't send you much of a
letter. Here I am back at Eton again, and awfully sorry the holidays are over. I suppose
you are the same. My Governor has gone half cracked over what he calls “keeping up the
Classics,” and has made me promise to send him a real Latin letter once a month, with some
well-known H. of English poetry turned into Latin verses!!! It's a jolly shame, isn't it?
Only I am to have five bob a-piece when I do it well. Also I’ve got a Gradus, and allickjohn

you won't sneak about it, will you?—I’ve got a Book of Latin Proverbs, most of 'em in verse,
and when I run dry, I shove one in, and they sound splendid, and I don't think the
Governor will twig, do you? and in case you have to do the same thing, I send you a copy
of my last Latin letter and verses, and now good-bye, and I remain, believe me,
Your sincere young friend,

THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, JANUARY 27TH, 1887.
Lord Randolph Churchill. Design for Fresco. The Great Scene—
Churchill's Erplanation.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Thursday, January 27,--Thought I'd make my way down early
to the House this morning. Well to get a good seat on Opening Day;
these new Members are so eager; necessary to be up early in
order to circumvent them. Eleven o’Clock hadn't struck when
I crossed Palace Yard, but evidently wasn't first. Familiar figure
disappearing under gateway leading to entrance to House of Com-
mons. It was oLPH, who, hearing the patter of feet, waited
for me with his usual urbanity.
“Ah, Toby, old man,” he said, “going to get a seat, I suppose?
So am I. Might have corner seat behind Treasury Bench, but that
too common place for me. Everyone goes there after leaving a
Ministry. I mean to get old corner seat below the Gangway, sacred
to the memory of GoRST and Wolfry. Fancy I'll make W
squirm when he comes, and finds me sitting there. Nuisance to have
to be down so early, but well to be on safe side.”
Entered House together. RANDoIPH made straight for corner seat
below Gangway. “Hallo!” he cried, halting midway, and pointing,
with startled expression, towards corner seat. “What’s that?”
No mistake on this point. . It was a hat. RANDOLPH advanced
cautiously, but firmly, and taking up the intrusive object, anxiously
examined the lining.
“‘H. C.,’” he read out.
CoBB P He daren't do it. , CHAPLIN, by Jove!”
Our Chief!, Couldn't help glow of pride suffusing this mortal
frame when I discovered this proof of our Chief's presence of mind,
“Can't be CHILDERs. Of course not.
All Our Special Artist saw of Lord Randolph Churchill's Explanation
in a fog.
- : fertility of resource. That trip to Monaco evidently brightened
“I wonder, now,” said RANDolph, reflectively, “if I were to sit
on it, and have it removed by one of the attendants, how that would
work. But then CHAPLIN would come, find me here, and guess at
once. No, I must leave it, and go into old quarters.” ...
Strode up the Gangway to corner seat, in which Ex-Ministers sit,
and take benevolent interest in procedure of old colleagues. Expected
to see him deposit his hat. Instead, took off his gloves, and, with
haughty gesture, flung them on the Bench. Then he wrote on a card
these lines,
“Who dares this pair of gloves displace
Must meet R. CHURCHILL face to face.”
Pinned the cartel to the gauntlet, and, turning, left the House.
Pleasant, after this, stormy scene, to come upon, Joseph G.ILL.Is.
Hardly knew him at first. Has been growing beard and moustache.
“I’m agin repression anywhere,” said Joseph G.ILL.Is. “Why
should an Irishman every morning, razor in hand, put in practice a
Coercion Act, levelling and evicting the honest attempt of whiskers
to establish themselves, and refusing to put in a moustache as
caretaker ? I’m a man of º and carry it into practice into
things big or little. Besides,...I don't see why RANDOLPH should
have the only moustache talked of in the House; and, since
MACFARLANE left, there hasn't been a beard on any Bench worth
looking at. I mean to grow one.” -
House, crowded later to hear RANDOLPH's speech, Cunningly
conceived, and admirably delivered. Like most speeches from thiſ
particular corner seat, vociferously cheered by Opposition. Con-
H. Not much yet, but full of hope.

tinuing narrative of events that led to his resignation, RANDOLPH
fell into trick of saying, - - - -
“I am sure my Right Hon. Friend, and my Noble Friend, will bear
me out when I say—” - - - -
All very well once. But repetition of invitation grew maddening.
-- Pretty to see SMITH furtively turn-
ing up sleeves, and feeling his biceps,
whilst Lord GeoRGE HAMILTON
wrestled with his knee. What
would the SPEAKER say if they,
yielding to temptation, rose together,
made a rush at the corner seat, and
justified RANDoIPH's confidence by
“bearing him out.”
Full success of speech rather
marred by strategic movement of
our Chief. Turned on fog just before
RANDolph rose. Increased in inten-
sity, throughout speech, Figures
fºllº lost to view, till not much
eft of RANDoIPH save the red rose
in button-hole, which gleamed
through the fog like a danger-signal
on a railway-track. Now’s the time
for “My Right Hon. and my Noble
Friends!”
“I’m agin repression anywhere.”
“I’m sure,” said the voice near the red rose, “my Right Hon.
Friend and my Noble Friend will bear me out when I say—”
Would they?. SMITH glanced nervously at Lord GeoRGE: Lord
GEORGE, finally throwing his knee, began nervously to tear a copy of
the Orders to pieces. It was a critical moment. But hesitation was
fatal. A few more sentences and the voice ceased; the red rose was
observed to drop a foot or two. RANDOLPH had resumed his seat, and
opportunity had fled.
IBusiness done.—Address moved.
Friday.-Colonel SAUNDERSON delivered lively address, on what he
called “the crisises in Ireland.”
“Why?” asked new Member, “does he call it crisises?”
“Because,” said CAMPBELL BANNERMAN, “he naturally wants to
make the most of it.”
Not many Members present, and after SAUNDERSON, things rather
dull. Hicks-BEACH stirred up Irish Members with long pole and

“THE REVENGE.”
A Ballad of the Ordnance.
I'LL tell you the story, my Masters, for I was one of the crew,
Who mann'd the Revenge in the Roossian, war of eighteen-ninety-
I’m one of the seven heroes—you can put it so if you like, [two,

The last of the seven survivors. And . years ago,
A score and more sat down to dine in public all of a row, -
But the annual banquet thinn'd us, and the Music Halls tell at last,
And the Charity Organisers make history very fast.

But they sold the ship and the foreigner too, in Britain's trial hour;

could make her,
And if it hadn't been for her guns, no vessel afloat could take her.
But they used to serve self-acting guns to the Navy of that day,

For We * to our guns and cheered like mad, but never returned a

But ours was the fastest ship afloat, and armed with a terrible beak,

One brilliant summer morning a squadron hove in sight;
Lor', how we cheered, for all our chaps were spoiling for a fight,
And down, full-speed, upon the fleet ourfº. vessel bore
With a mighty rift in the sea behind, and a pillar of foam before.
And snowy fleeces slowly round the Russian war-ships grew,
And vivid flashes lit the way as monster bolts tore through;
But she ducked and dodged like a playful dog as higher the smoke
arose,
And quivered and shook with the joy of battle, hurling upon her

And the deadly space grew shorter, till plain the foe we saw,
And the fluº. in their faces changed suddenly to awe:
“Hi! Hi! You've crossed a dozen mines!” the Russian Captain
cried,
“You’re out of action, you lubbers!” And we crashed through his
iron side.
Ship after ship with foaming jaws the thirsty ocean drank
As fast before our deadly prow they shuddered and reeled and sank;
But still with floating pall of smoke fresh war-ships round us drew,
And still, as fast as one was sunk, we had to tackle two.
Our vessel reeled and staggered, too; in swathes her heroes fell,
As round and through and over us came tons of shot and shell;
And her plates like sheets were flapping, and cheerly above the din
Whenever they gave a loud rat-tat, our Captain cried, “Come in l’”
The still sea-floor was strewn with wrecks and guns and gallant dead,
Whose stony eyes stared up to mock the tumult overhead ;
And fiercer still the fight went on, till, when the sun was low,
Our shatter'dship could neither stand nor deal another blow.
And then º Captain called us round; the fight grew slack, it

As through the rolling mounds of smoke the muffled sunset beam'd;

We’ve kept all day a fleet at bay—we won't give in at night.

We cannot win—we will not strike—now, lads, to fire the guns!”
Unwitting of that stern resolve the Russians closer drew,
While still in triumph at the peak the British ensign flew ;
But vultures wheel, and sea-birds scream, when through the vessel

AUTOMATA-SUPER-SPRINGS.
(By Our Own Investigator.)
BEFoRE entering the town I had to cross a stile, against
which was leaning a gentleman of a most engaging
appearance. .** my hat, I asked him politely to
*H. me to pass. He made no reply, when I found from
a placard on his back, which asked me to call his attention
by “pressing the top button of his frock-coat,” that no
doubt he was deaf. Complying with the direction, the
gentleman at once bowed and made room for me.
“You wish, I suppose,” said he, with rather a strange
smile, “to see all that is to be seen.”
He spoke a little jerkily, and there was a curious kind
of tone in his voice, which made me fear he was a martyr
to bronchitis.
“Yes,” I answered, “is there anything worth looking
at before we actually enter Automata?”
“Not much. You notice that that cow milks itself,
and by placing the produce into the dairy, produces
cheese and butter. The whole farm is carried ºn on the
same principle.”
My friend walked on and I followed him. I was
concerned to notice that he seemed rather unsteady on
his legs, and to have a tendency to run up unconsciously
against lamp-posts. The place I found perfectly deserted
—we did not meet a soul.
“Automata appears to be rather empty?” I observed.
“Well, yes. The fact is everything is done by machi-
nery—steam or clockwork. . Now here we are before a
fishmonger's, You notice that slit in the box, drop in
sixpence and see what will come of it.”
I did so, and immediately a drawer flew out lined with
marble, upon which was resting a whiting.
“Were you to place appropriate sums (you could take
that list hanging yonder as a guide) in those other slits,
you could secure all sorts of fish—soles, skate, mackerel,
and even oysters.”
“Most remarkable,” I observed. “And I suppose
these other shops are on the same principle?”
“Certainly,” replied my guide. “It is really very
well managed. In this slit (which belongs to the butcher)
were we to place half a º an enormous joint of
beef would be at our service. Place three sovereigns in
this hole and await the result.”
As my instructions had been to spare no expense in
conducting my investigation, I dropped the sum named
through the aperture, and immediately drew out a mys-
terious something of wire, gauze, and ribbon, the intrinsic
value of which seemed to me well under a couple of
shillings.
“A lady's bonnet!” explained my guide, with a
metallic chuckle. “But not only have we the system of
automatic shopping, but other conveniences are at our
command. Pardon me—coming through the fields you
have managed to dirty your boots. Place your foot on
this box and watch what follows.
in a penny.”
I, followed my guide's directions, and in a moment a pair of brushes were
busily at work, assisted by a blacking-bottle and a couple of polishers. My boots
were capitally cleaned by artificial hands attached to wires and piston-rods.
... Perhaps you would like something to eat?” queried my guide.
... Certainly,” I answered, and we entered a restaurant.
“This is rather well managed. You see you select your own meal, drop in the
necessary sum, and take a seat. The pressure of a spring in the chair supplies
the rest.” I sat down, and in a moment a serviette was tied round my neck, and
a knife, fork, and spoon were placed before me. Soup, fish, and a fillet followed.
Then came some cheese, and a hand politely handed me a salver, upon which
rested the receipted bill. I noticed that my guide ate nothing; and he explained
that he did not require anything—he was not hungry. Upon leaving, the
restaurant we came to the residence of a doctor, with the usual brass door-plate.
“We don't show this to ladies or children, because they are so nervous.
But, really, it is rather clever, Just slip in ten guineas.”
“Rather a large sum,” I remonstrated.
“But well worth the money.”
Thus urged, I dropped a cheque into the box. Immediately a prescription
was thrown out.
“Is that all?” I exclaimed.
“Oh, no!” he replied. “We set our faces against high prices.

...Don't you think so?” I asked, sharply.
My guide, with one foot lifted as if to take another step, and his mouth open
as if to speak, §. perfectly still...To attract his attention, I gave him a gentle
push. He tumbled over like a doll, and then, by the disarrangement of his coat
which revealed some complicated wheels, I found that he was an Automaton!
He had run down!. As I could not find a key to wind him up again, I obtained
no further information.
THE OXONIAN’S WEEK.
(After the Establishment of the proposed “School of Agriculture.”)
Monday.—In morning, attended lecture by Regius Professor of Top-dressing.
After that, an in-College lecture on “Theory and Practice of Cucumber-
raising.” Afternoon devoted to practical experiments in that portion of the
College Quadrangle which has been allotted to me for agricultural purposes.
Afraid there’s something defective in my way of treating mangel-wurzels.
Dean acts as bailiff, and blew me up tremendously about it.
Tuesday.—My silo coming on nicely. Inspected it after morning chapel, and
so pleased with result that I offered some of the compressed hay to the Master.
Master angry. Wanted to know “if I took him for a horse?” . A donkey more
likely—don't say this, however, Bad beginning of day. Goes on still worse.
Sent for by Dean, who says, “he’s sorry to notice that my beetroots are looking
very sickly, and if this continues he will be compelled to gate me for a week.”
Depressed. Attend lectures on “practical Laundry work,” and . “Cottage
Cookery.” Intended to fit us, as Master says, for “being useful to our
parishioners when we become country parsons.” Don't mean to be a country
parson, myself; chosen this school because ever so much easier to get honours in
it in Classics or Philosophy. -
Wednesday.—Put on white tie, gown, and corduroys, and go off to the
“Schools.” First day of examination for a class. Flatter myself I’ve floored
the morning paper, anyhow, on “connection between agriculture and morals.”
§. to ancient systems of ploughing most erudite. Wonder if examiners
will show me modern system of ploughing P. Don't think so, as far as exam. has
gone at present. In afternoon, rivá voce on Domestic Button-sewing, with
practical illustrations. Ran a needle into my finger early, and couldn't stitch at
all. Brute of an Examiner told me, “I had entirely ruined two shirt-cuffs, and
I’d better be careful.” Go away feeling quite miserable.
Thursday.—Miscellaneous agricultural questions. “What evidence is there
to show that CICERo knew of the rotation of crops?” None, that I know of.
“Who introduced Swedes into England?” King of Swed EN, probably; or,
was it SwedENBoRG F Put down the latter. On the whole encouraged by day';
work. Another vivá roce, this time on Laundry. Asked what, I should do “if
I sent five shirts to the wash, and only two came home?” . Examiner seemed
pleased with my answer. Rather a dab at the Laundry. If it were Cambridge,
suppose I should be called “Senior Mangler.” Return to rooms exhilarated,
and find that some sportive undergrads, have been “making hay” there; wish
they’d do it in their own silos instead.
* Friday.—Day of rest. Hoe turnips. -
Saturday.—Result of exam. to come out to-day. Go early to Schools to
see. Horror! My name is not on the List at all ! Sent for by Master. Says
“Examiners' report is, that my views on Potato-culture are most erroneous
and unorthodox ; also that I don't seem, even, to have heard of the new
system of planting Standard rose-trees, with their roots in the air, invented
by the Vice-Chancellor; and that they're reluctantly compelled to refuse me
my Testamur !” Agriculture ends in my being rusticated Go down same
evening, and wish to goodness I’d stuck to Latin and Greek.

MARIA says I ought to go to church this morning with her and the
children. But, as, I tell her, my paper upon “The New Method of
Obtaining Flayaniline from Orthoamidoacetophenone” is a work of
necessity, and I cannot do full justice to the importance of my subject
except on a day when all ordinary traffic has ceased, Afraid MARIA
thinks I’m shirking—women have no sympathy with science.
Get out my rough notes, and begin. Fortunately for me this
secluded neighbourhood is comparatively free from church bells; I
ought to get my work done before luncheon. Now then:—“It will

afraid they don't strike the popular imagination as much as the poke-
bonnets and tambourines; but they mean well, no doubt. Still, they
do interrupt. Let me proceed:—“ that, taking the higher homo-
logue—” Cheering this time! Are those Salvation or Church
cheers, I wonder ? don't disapprove of heartiness myself; but
where was I going to take my homologue P Can't remember.
Never mind—pass on:-" Now, I need hardly remind §." that pico-
line is methylpyridine.”...But how can I fix my thoughts on picoline

Politics. Some one is holding a large open-air meeting at the street
corner. I have always understood that the right of free speech and
meeting in public is the proudest privilege of a Briton; but why yell
over it? There, it’s no use—I am confusing Triamidotriphenyl-
methane with Blamido-phenylaerûne now! My thoughts are no
longer under control—I must ſº it up. . After all, this is a Day of
Rest. It is wiser to lay aside all secular labour, and attend my
Parish, Church as usual. There, at least, I shall be soothed aná
quieted into forgetfulness of this world—yes, I will go . . . .
Never appreciated the calming influence o ºfmusic so much.
What a mercy it is the Choir don't use tambourines! Howrest-
ful are the decency and order that reign here undisturbed. Murmurs
Qutside . . ; sensation in congregation . . . A band of Socialists
have arrived to assist in our devotions! There, there, as I whisper
to Maria, there is plenty of room for us all. If they wish to join us,
let us welcome them. I say—it's a good sym i.
They come tramping down the aisle . . . *...; wish, as a seat-
holder of some standing, that they would not leave a banner with
“Bread or Blood!” on it in a corner of my pew—it frightens the
Qor, children so! The Werger remonstrates with Head Socialist.
Head Socialist says Church belongs to the People, and they have a
right to know what goes on in it, especially as they mean to do away
with it by-and-by. There's something in that, no doubt, but then
they seem to have come here chiefly to read their newspapers.
Interruption in first lesson; Democrat attempting to prove to the
Curate that the Egyptians were all capitalists—Curate naturally
rather nervous at being told he is a liar.
If I dared, I should like just to, hint to that stalwart. Socialist in
front that it is a little out of order to hiss the Prayer for the High
Court of Parliament.
It is rather rude of the Democrat who is sitting next to me to call
me a “Pampered Pharisee” merely for finding the hymn for him,
and I should perhaps be better able to attend to the sermon, if there
were not...twenty or thirty patriots, all round me whistling the
“Marseillaise.” Still, as they say, this a free country, and a man's
opinions are his own. . . . . Another ten minutes of this, and I’m
very much afraid º poor MARIA will be in hysterics; the children
are crying already, because they say the Socialists are making ugly
faces at them. At last, thank Heaven! it is over. They have taken
their banner, and marched out, cheering for the Coming Revolution.
Now we can go away in peace.

FRANCE AND SAVOY.
MEssRs. GILBERT AND SULLIVAN actually wrote to the French Figaro
explaining, in very excellent French—(the compilation of the letter must have
given them considerable trouble, but whatever they undertake they do
thoroughly-with the best grammars and conversation books on the table, Mr.
GILBERT pacing up and down dictating, D'Oyly CARTE looking out the words
in a dictionary, and Sir ARTHUR writing out the rough copy in his neatest
hand), -that the song of their “Marin pour rire” (some relation to a “rear-
admiral”) was not intended as an insult to the French flag, and that, therefore,
... La Marine d'une nation aussi brave que chevaleresque’’-(Bravo, Sir ARTHUR!
If this wasn't a touch of your special polish, and if D'Oyly CARTE didn't
chuckle over it mightily, then are we mistaken in our men)—needn't take
umbrage at what was merely, a kind of joke, about on a par, i.e., “ayant
précisement autant de sens que “Rosbifº et ‘Goddam’ employés pour ridiculer les
Anglais dans une comádie-burlesque Fançaise.”
And so, in spite of the irate “T. Johnson,” the distinguished correspondent
of the Figaro-more distinguished than ever now by his apparent inability to
understand Mr. GILBERT's peculiar humour—the funds will recover, the war
scare will not be intensified, and the peace of Europe will be undisturbed.
Evidently the two Savoyards consider the “Comédie-burlesque” anglaise at the
Savoy as the Piece of Europe. This has not been undisturbed, as we hear that
most of the first-night jokes have been taken out of the Second Act, which now
ought to go capitally. But what a lesson is here !—that after the most careful
rehearsal, after days and nights of work and elaboration, and after a dress
rehearsal in the presence of critics, it is only after the public performance, and
this in the presence of a most friendly and enthusiastic audience, that the
*::::::: are found out which ought to have been discovered and rectified at
renearsal.
THE ALLCARD-CASE.-Where the plaintiff wanted to get back money she had
given away, what an unfortunate combination of names were those whom the
demand affected—“SKINNER and NIHILL.” Of course, nought could be got out
of NIHILL–a name which is º of “Noughty,” but of course “nice.” The
Skinners' Guild must have felt much relieved after the decision of Mr. Justice
KEKEwich, who seems to have talked a considerable amount of nonsense while
arriving at a fair and just verdict. In future, over the doors of all conventual
establishments, Protestant or not, will be written, “No Money RETURNED.”
JUST IN TIME.
IN the new edition of Men of the Time, the Editor, in
a pleasant preface declares that his object has been to
preserve, as far as possible the laws of proportion, and
announces that “could he publish his experience with
regard to the communications that he has received from
the different subjects of the biographies, he could cer-
tainly produce a volumenoless instructive than amusing.”
This no doubt is the case, but as Mr. Punch is less scru-
pulous, he uses his gift of divination to guess at the
nature of some of the autobiographical notes that have
been sent to the amiable compiler.
Gl-dst-ne, The Right Hon., W. E.-Great hand at
felling trees. Very fond of comic songs. Can play the
banjo. Knows how to dance a breakdown. Hates
olitics, can't bear power. Is a Scotchman, also a
Wiśa. also an Irishman. Fond of liver and bacon.
Liked TENNYson very much years ago, but thinks, he
has recently sadly fallen off. Has written a piece but
can get neither Mr. IRVING nor Mr. ToolE to play in it,
although they both say it is the best they ever read.
Does not know whether the piece is a Comedy or a
Tragedy, Mr. IRVING considers it the former, Mr. Toole
the latter. Is a great collector of penny postage-stamps.
Never lost his temper in his life.
Br-dl-gh, C.—Descended from the earliest of the
Crusaders. Is conscientious, honest and chivalrous.
From his childhood's days objected to swearing. Par-
ticularly fond of Church architecture. Takes great
delight in playing with tin soldiers.
H-re-rt, Right Hon. Sir. W. V.-Rightful heir to
several of the European thrones. Some day when he has
time will claim the best of them. Knows nothing of law.
Fond of toffy. Hates people who pull at their beards and
have similar habits.
T-le. Mr. J. L.-Great Shakspearian Actor. Prefers
the rôles of Hamlet, Macbeth, Cardinal Wolsey, and
Richard the Third, but, if desired, can play Romeo.
Always comes home to tea. Devotes all his energies to
the world behind the scenes, and thinks nothing of the
front of the house. Objects to additions being made by
actors to their author's words. Is extremely particular
about points of etiquette, and never shakes handin kid
without apologising for wearing his glove.
Ch-rch-ll, Rt. Hon. Lord R.—A little modest flower.
Hates sensation, and loathes advertisement. Cannot bear
to be talked about. The best fellow in the world to get
on with. Is certainly rather partial to practical jokes,
but means no harm. Fond of tripping.
De Sn-ks M-ntm-r-ncy H-w-rd, Esq.-A scion of an
ancient Surrey family. A DE SNoggues came over with
the Conqueror, and the family is next heard of in the
character of Mr. DE SN-Ks's father, who was a merchant
in Liverpool about the middle of the present century.
The land upon which Mr. DE SN-Ks has settled is thou-
sands of years old. The premises include a baronial hall,
a chapel, and a family vault—all quite new. A cousin of
Mr. DE SN-Ks is an officer in a West India Regiment,
and several of his friends are Captains in the Volunteers.

and ill-bred too—who, smoking short-pipes, march to
Church and hiss the Prayer for the QUEEN, and Royal
Family, and certain portions of the (to them) highly objec-
tionable and tyrannical decalogue, is somewhat akin to
reckless, wreckers of pieces who visit, our theatres on
first nights, determined to damn everything in a general
way, especially if they are actuated by some spite against
actor, author, or manager. Such loafers as these might
now call themselves the “New Church and Stage Guild.”
since, not satisfied with disturbing the people in the full
pit of a theatre, they will now disturb the Parson in the
pulpit. If they are roughs “put up to it,” let them be

his young ooman a thistle he has plucked for her. Number Two, the
same 'Ighlander settin' out for the wars, partin' from his young
ooman, the same young ooman (as you can see from her plaid petti-
coats) at the cottage-door, with a colley-dog and a waterfall in the
immeiit background.
“Number Three depicts the 'Ighlander as he is in battle, firing on
the henemy with his claymore. Now, I guarantee that as a correck
repperesentation of the scene; while in Number Four you 'ave the
return of the 'Ighlander to the young ooman, wounded, with cottage,
colley-dog, and waterfall, as beforel
“Now, who'll give me ten shillings for the lot complete?”
Apparently nobody, though a woman, who hardly looks as if she
had ten pence to devote to the encouragement of Art, examines the
cottage scene with the air of a connoisseur.
“No one give me ten shillin' for this suit of subjects, drawn and
coloured from life? Well, it's throwin' money into the gutter; but
I dessay, in these 'ard times, money ain't exackly F. with you,
so I don’t mind if I meet you arf way. Nine-and-ninepence buys
the lot—nine-and-ninepence!” -
But nine-and-ninepence has not this privilege, and the auctioneer
grows more pessimistic. “You don't know a work of hart when it's
showed you, and that’s the fact! Why, the gilt on the frames
alone is worth all the money. Nine-and-six, then. Nine shillin'!
Come, will eight shillin' temptyer? It ain't only two bob an’Igh-
lander... Seven-and-sixpe “Look 'ere—it’s not m
nce!
Still the crowd is not impressed. way to
bargin. You shall’ave 'em at five bob. No one say five bob? I’m
ashamed of you, callin'yerselves intelligent workin' men, and lettin'
such a chance go by yer. Four-and-six l’”
“Now, don't you make no mistake—this is the last orfer I can
afford to make to yer, if I’m struck dead this very minute! It's
the last lot left on 'and, or I wouldn't do what I’m goin' to do,
though it's robbin' myself. I’ll stick to my next orfer-three-and-
sixpence. That's my last word, so make up your minds. I’m
about to put 'em back where I took 'em from. I shall sell 'em for
double at some other pitch, where there is more taste and money.
Three-and-sixpence!”
The audience remains calm, even at this, and the auctioneer
proceeds:–
“If it warn’t that I was in such an 'urry to go’ome to my tea, I
shouldn't let the lot remain up another instant; but I’ll give yer
just one more chance, and, after that, I shall know what to think ºf
er. Arf a crown—two shillin' and sixpence? Look at 'em-'andle
em, if you like. There's the rings all ready to 'ang'em up directly
#. get ’em ’ome—real plate-glass fronts, all sound workmanship,
one in five distinct colours, 2 feet by 18 inches in diameter, for two-
and-sixpence! Why, I paid more’n that in the stoodio ! If it was
known what I was askin’ for 'em now, I shouldn't be allowed to sell
no more. Two-and-sixpence! Well, I'm darned if ever I see sech
a poor lot as you are l I’ll try yer once more—two shillin'. What,
even that don't make yer open yer mouths? P'rhaps you expect me
to wrap 'em Rp in silver paper, and pay you for takin' 'em of my
'ands? That's the sort you are! Two shillin'. Well, eighteen
pence—eighteen pence, an they change 'ands! Just think it over,
afore I put 'em aside. If there’s any young couple is keepin’ com-
}.º. and thinkin' of settin' up 'ouse, they won't get no fairer value
or their money than this. It’s an article of this style as makes a
'appy 'ome—so don't deceive yourselves!”
pon this a young artisan comes forward, shame-faced, and
grinning, and produces the necessary coins, unable to resist domestic
felicity on such easy terms.
“Thank you, Sir—I kingratulate you on sech a bargin'. There
won't be none others as 'll get me at a similar disadvantage, so don't
you make no mistake. There you are, Sir—and don't go tellin'
nobody what you gave for 'em, or you’ll be accused of bein’ a liar.
And now we’ll go to somethink else.”
And here Mr. Punch proposes to follow his example.
JACK'S REJOINDER.
Addressed—to Whom it Particularly Concerns,
Now, when the last big ten-inch gun has burst,
And we’re a waiting, eager for the order,
A longing each of us to be the first
To jº. somehow up her sides, and board her,
And down upon the furrin Mounseers swoop,
With every blesséd cutlass bared, and gleaming,"
If they bends like a bit of iron hoop,
Think you we’ll find the fun precisely “screaming?”
“In course,” you’ll say, and so your fun you’ll poke,
And have, at JACK's expense, your little jokel
But if the country doesn't see the fun,
Of paying down good cash, while getting treated
To rotten stuff in cutlass and in gun, -
Supplied by swindling hands by whom it's cheated;
And rising in its wrath, with accents grave,
The mischief to its source succinctly traces,
And gibbets first, then punishes the knave,
No matter what his station or his place is,
Then p'raps you’ll own, º your fun you poke,
That JACK as well will have his little joke.
HOW MUCH MORE OF IT?
OR, whAT IT MAY come To BY AUGUST.
IN the House of Commons yesterday the adjourned debate on the
Address was again resumed. This being the 129th day of this, now
protracted discussion, the attendance was somewhat thin, and it was
understood that all the Members of the Government were absent at
their country seats, and at present had nointention of returning. The
preliminary notices of questions, however, showed no signs of abate-
ment, lasting fully three hours and-a-half, during which the SPEAKER,
who looked still jaded and irritable, dozed off several times, and had
to be awakened, much to his apparent annoyance, on each occasion by
one of the Clerks of the House. The adjourned debate was then
continued by Mr. McBLATHER, TALKsworthy, CHATTERBY, FROTH-
ING, MAUNDER and MoUTHER, the discussion, which has now dealt
in turn exhaustively with every Home and Continental Social,
Political, Scientific, Literary, Agricultural, and Artistic question,
turning principally during the course of the evening on the prospects
of the fly-catching interests in the Malay Peninsula, the free im-
portation by rail of stuffed animals to South Kensington, the alleged
*. of inferior Scandinavian butterine to Provincial Lunatic
Asylums, and the recent scandalous revelations in the affairs of the
South Patagonian Invalid Bath Chair Company.
On the motion of Mr. JAwl.EY the debate was adjourned at twenty
minutes to four, the SPEAKER on leaving the House being sofatigued
that he had to be fanned for some minutes in the Lobby, with the
cover of a Blue Book before proceeding to his residence. It is calcu-
lated that at the present rate of progress, the division may possibly
be taken at the close of the ensuing month. The business of the
Session might then, it is hoped, at once commence.

CHURCHILLIUS.
Fragments of a Lay sung in the Forum, showing how M. Curtius Church-
illius made an Alarming Sacrifice of himself, and got into a rather
big hole—and out again.
YE good Men of the Commons, with sturdy souls and true
Who stand a lot from smart young men that make good sport for
you,
Come, make a circle round me, and mark my tale with care,
A tale of what you once have borne, and yet may have to bear,
This is no common fable—'tis worthy of the Nine,
Of the great rhetor's flowing phrase and loud-resounding line.
Here, in this very Forum, under the noonday sun,
In sight of all the Parties, the daring deed was done;
Nay, there be those among you who saw it, I dare say,
But none the less you'll lend an ear to my heroic lay.
His “lay,” too was heroic ; the slangy phrase excuse;
There's nothing voted duller than a too punctilious Muse. ..
Just ask BRET HARTE–or BROWNING; the latter bard, at times,
Will lick the former hollow for larky words and rhymes.
The “lay” then of CHURCHILLIUS was most heroic; yes,
And heroism rather pays if managed with success.
That gap which in the Forum had opened gaped so wide,
Black Auster, ARCHER up, had failed to take it in his stride.
It yawned like any Churchyard, the muzzle of a Krupp,
Or the tired Member late at night when CoNYBEARE is up;
It yawned and kept on yawning, insatiate as Sin
Or Death, no matter who was Out, no matter who was In.
Taxation would not fill it, though like a Danaë shower
Poured into it by day and night with ten-Niagara power; . .
Een Blue Books failed to brim it; nay, there were those who swore
The speeches of GLADSTONIUS, like the sands on Ocean's shore
For multitude unnumbered, and like MUNDELLA's nose,
Or the Commercial Road, for length, which one might well suppose
Would block the Wast Inane itself, were as one pinch of snuff
In THobold Rogers's mighty beak, not nearly quantum suff.
Then up and spake CHURCHILLIUs; unto himself spake he:
“In this same all-devouring gulf I rather think I see
An opening for a smart young man. I'm young and I am smart.
I see my rôle’s to fill that hole; I’m game to play the part.”
CHURCHILLIUS was Chancellor; for that he cared no jot.
“This is,” said he, “the sort of place where rubbish may be shot
For ever and for ever with none effect at all.
A Sacrifice is needed here! A leap is not a fall.
I take the jump but as a step toward my destined goal,
And the result will tell us who is ‘left in the hole.’”
Then up and spake CHURCHILLIUs, unto the House he spake:
“Commons, too long this gaping gulf hath made you gasp and quake.
As to the Curtius Lacus the oracle of old
Announcement made which I'll apply, if I may be so bold.
Whatever was most precious the Romans had to throw,
A sacrifice, into that hole; this is a similar go.
Therefore I'm clearly singled out by a sagacious Fate
To play the sacrificial part, and so to save the State.
Oh, don't be flabberghasted ; the voice of destiny
Declares that ere this gulf is closed a Chancellor must die.
And how can one die better than facing a big cropper,
On it, and eightpence in the pound, to put a final stopper ?
CHURCHILLIUS gaily mounted upon his gallant steed,
His ligneous horse (spotted of course) of the famed Hobby breed.
“Retrenchment” was the charger's name, from the Gladstonian stud,
É. ''Vigilance” out of “Wectigal,” higher in bone than blood.
e donned his helm and buckler, he bared his trenchant blade,
§. time below on the Q. T. the feather bed they laid),
ff from the gulf's grim marge he shot like stone from catapult,
And A later lay some later day may tell you the result.
Exit CHURCHILLIUs! Quite so. But actors have a way
Of dying hard one night, to live—and die—another day.
Gone from our gaze, young hero! But such a splendid feat,
Is a performance that a “star” will probably repeat.
And lest the public bosom with anguish should be riven,
Of our Star's “reappearance” due notice will be given.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GOING COURTING.
Mr. Wibbs. I lost sight of you, Sir, in the crowd at the Court the
other night. . How did you like Dandy Dick #
Mr. Punch. Immensely. I haven't seen anything that has made
me laugh so much—laugh till I cried—since The Private Secretary.
Mr. Nibbs. The notion of making Mr. CLAYTON a Dean in a farce,
—the very ideal figure for it, is in itself humorous, Sir, do you
not think so P -
Mr. Punch. No, honestly, I do not. , Mr. CLAYTON's name is
chiefly associated with serious drama, and he is essentially an earnest
and most conscientious actor. By natural dramatic selection he
would be cast for a Dean, or a Bishop, in a tragedy, a comedy, or a
drama, and he would then be the right man in the right place. But
here, as a real Dean in a farce, Mr. CLAYTON's wish to throw himself
heart and soul into the humour of the situation, which he intensely
º
“Tidd's Court Plactice.”
appreciates, is too evident. Imagine Mr. J. W. HILL as the Dean
with Mrs. JoHN WooD as the sporting Georgina Tidman.'
Mr. Nibbs. But as Mr. HILL is not here—
Mr. Punch. Quite so. I am only “supposing.” As it is I do not
understand why Mr. ARTHUR CECIL was not cast for the Dean—un-
less it is that he is looking forward to a holiday—as any ordinary
careful actor could play Blore the butler, and Mr. CECIL might join
Lord RANDoIPH CHURCHILL in his Continental trip while the Govern-
ment of the Court and the Country would be carried on successfully
in their absence. -
Mr. Nibbs. The dialogue struck me as smart.
Mr. Punch. It is capital dialogue, capitally delivered by almost
everybody. What especially pleases me, is that Mr. PINERo boldly
describes his piece as an “original farce in three Acts.” Now, as
almost anything is F. in farce, an audience is rendered
supremely happy with the minimum of probability and the maximum
of absurdity, as long as it does not become, either in action or
dialogue, extravagant burlesque. And here as an Old Dramatic
Hand, I would warn Mr. PINERo against his tendency to imitate a
method which is Mr. GILBERT's patent, and of which he ought to
enjoy the º: Mr. PINERo is bubbling over with fun, and
can well afford to do without some of Miss Sheba's speeches—a
part far too strongly accentuated by Miss NoHREYs, whose self-con-
sciousness and very apparent anxiety to make every line tell, mar
the charm of her otherwise clever performance,—and without some
of the mechanical action given to her and her sister Salome—very
nicely played by Miss Lewes—which suggests the idea of the
author's having borrowed the Savoy mechanism for use at the Court.
These two young ladies, with their sudden jerkings, floppings, lying
backwards on the table, and other eccentricities, all evidently done
to order, run the risk of becoming, mere marionettes. There is
nothing spontaneous in their individual movements. This is the
fault with the part that Mrs. TREE plays in Mr. PINERo's curious
mixture called the Hobby Horse at the St. James's. But having
said this, I have little else but praise for Dandy Dick.
Mr. Nibbs. Yet, first-rate as the farce is, would it have achieved
such a success but for Mrs. WooD F
Mr. Punch. Recollect that when an author writes for a particular
company, the actors or actresses become part and parcel of such
piece. Mr. PINERO, who, to my thinking, has suited neither Mr.
CLAYTON nor Mr. CECIL in this piece, has fitted Mrs. John Wood
with a part as perfectly as the best tailor would with a riding-habit.
To see her square, her elbows, put her head on one side, thrust out
her hand, and walk forward in a knowing sort of way, to welcome
her old racing friend, Sir Tristram, is something never to be forgotten.
It is a joy for ever ! But remember that Mr. PINERo must have
calculated on this in writing the part, and doubtless Mrs. WooD has
exceeded his most sanguine expectations.
*; Nibbs, And is not Mr. EDMUND MAURICE good as Sir Tris-
tram
Mr. Punch. He is so true to nature that he might have been in a
comedy, and yet he fits exactly into his place in this farce. This is
because the original model is highly coloured in actual life; and so
his boisterous manner and his countrified awkwardness are familiar
notes of the type. Whether by accident or design—for this actor's
name is new to me—Mr. MAURICE's Sir Tristram is simply perfect.
I can say no more.
Mr. Nibbs. The two officers, M. KERR and EVERSFIELD, were
good, especially the former, as the Major with a liver. He was not
% bit overdone—for farce, I mean. But, dear me, remembering
aste—
Mr. Punch. Yes, I know what you are going to say,+" how you
would like to have seen Mr. BANCROFT as Major Tarver.” What a
shout would have gone up at the line, “I shall sing him off his
legs,” and at every effort of his to give, “Come into the Garden,
Maud.” Well, there is a suggestion of Mr. BANCROFT as Captain
Hawtree in Messrs. PINERo and KERR's Major Tarver. By the
way, the scene at home, “An Evening in an English Family
Household,” is very cleverly stage-managed.
Mr. Nibbs. Mr. DENNY's Policeman is a good bit.
Mr. Punch, Very; quite a study, and, in its degree of import-
ance, so is Miss LAURA LINDEN's Hannah Topping.
iſ... Niñº. Did you notice the dramatic music that Mr. CARL
ARMBRUSTER has composed, by way of illustrative accompaniment to
the scene where the Dean and the Butler are mixing the bolus.
Mr. Punch. Of course I did. It was like a bit of WEBER, and
one expected to see Zamiel appear out of the fire-place. I should say
that Mr. ARMBRUSTER must have revelled in it. But—it is an utter
mistake. This is another example of what I was saying about
bringing burlesque into farce. That this scene, played with an
evident consciousness of its burlesque character by Mr. CLAYTON,
and, with mock horror by Mr. Cecil, amid, thunder, lightning,
wind, and rain, should be ridiculously intensified by melodramatic
music in the orchestra, with blows on the muffled drum burlesquing
and showing up the conventional mechanism of a serious melodramatic
situation, is out of keeping with the character of farce, and is, I
have no hesitation in saying, a distinct mistake. It distracts an
audience and puzzles them, and might discount the success by at
least fifty nights out the three hundred to which the piece will
probably go. The storm of wind and rain would have been quite
sufficient without the thunder, the tremolo, the muffled drum, and
the parody of an incantation scene.
}}. Nibbs. I am inclined to agree with you. The music in this
situation is superfluous. It struck me, Sir, that the Second Act was
not so strong as the two others.
Mr. Punch. Partially on account of this particular scene we have
been discussing. Still, it is a great point when the Dramatist pro-
duces a Third Act which is as fresh as his successful First. The
Third Act of Dandy Dick, with its lock-up and stolid policeman,
reminded me of the Third Act of that capital farce, Le Reveillon, in
which LAssouche played the stupid, loutish gaoler. Mr. DENNY's
rural constable is its worthy companion portrait. It is an eccentric
character part, and presents no difficulties to an actor in this line of
business. As to Mrs. Wood as “George Tid”—well, I must see
her again, and I believe I shall enjoy her performance just as much
as I did the first time.
Mr. Nibbs. Why on earth did Mr. PINERo make her marry Sir
Tristram *
Mr. Punch. It's a weakness with Dramatic Authors. They’re
like match-making 'mothers. , Sir Tristram and “George Tid”
were much better apart. You're quite right—it is an error of judg-
ment; immaterial, of course, as their union affects nobody in the
F. But the audience would be so much better satisfied if they
ew that their eccentric “George Tid” was not going to run again
in double harness after the loss of her first stable companion. No
matter, bless her heart! and may she be happy as Lady Mardon,
though she can rarely, if ever, be so “happy” as she is as Georgina
Tidman, alias “George Tid.” Qne word more for the yery small
part of the groom—Hatcham, a sketch every line of which is full of
character. It is º played by Mr. Lugg. I thank everybody
at the Court for a very pleasant evening. Au revoir.

You AND Edwin NoT BEEN
TERRIFIC STRUGGLE WITH A GRAND PIANO!
A CASE which recently came before Mr. Justice. GROVE and a Common Jury in the Queen's
Bench Division, has hardly in Mr. Punch's opinion, attracted the attention it deserved from
the sensational nature of its chief incident. It appears that it had become necessary, for
certain reasons, to seize a grand piano which was in the plaintiff's house, and that two men
entered it with that object. An attempt would seem to have been made to deter the gallant
fellows from their desperate purpose, and they accordingly waited to be reinforced by some
seven or eight others of equally fearless disposition, whereupon, to quote from the Times
report, “picking the lock of the dining-room door, where the pianolay impounded, they
ly, after a struggle of some four hours, removed the piano in triumph in a van.” -
y, why have we no English WICTOR Hugoto paint the fierce picturesqueness, the lurid
horror of this four hours' contest with an impounded piano? It is a scene, Mr. Punch
ventures to say, unparalleled H anything in recent fiction. Think of it, sensation novelists;
the piano, lurking d, and, grim in its lair, the entry of the intrepid little band of
assailants–the awful combat that ensued l. Can you not picture the piano at bay, lashing
out with its stout *.*. legs, snapping its lid, gnashing its ivory keys (which probably
had been untuned for weeks)? One holds one's breath in admiration, in wonder that an
of the devoted nine or ten left that dining-room alive to tell the tale, and that the infuriate
instrument did not roll its crimsoned castors over their collective corpses. -
But courage and intelligence prevailed at length, as they always do, against mere blind
brute force; the piano, worn out, reduced far below concert-pitch, was eventually overpowered,
and removed ignominiously, like a captive menagerie lion.—in a vanl
Most justly was it observed by the plaintiff's Counsel during the trial, that “no one could
tell the annoyance of such a scene in a house, except those who had gone through it, or
witnessed it,” and Mr. Punch feels proud to commemorate here a deed which deserves to be
inscribed high in the record-roll of British heroism.
“Why do they go on for weeks in Parliament discussing how they shall address the
QUEEN ?” asked Mrs. RAM.. “Surely some one among them must know that the QUEEN's
Address is simply “Windsor.’”

By an Appressionist.
As on my º threadbare way
Through life Ijog,
There is one thing that makes me gay-
A London fog.
I love to wake an hour too late,
n calm seraphic,
Unruffled by the noise I hate,
Of constant traffic.
And find the genial evening hour,
Meridian scorning,
Assert its humanising pow'r,
At early morning.
Without there reigns a hushing spell
O'er #. land, g
And even 'bus conductors dwell
Awhile in cloudland.
And common objects through the fog
Come looming large,
And lamp-posts up against you jog
In jocund charge.
And streets impervious before,
For fiscal reasons,
Become a safe resort oncernore,
In foggy seasons.
At thaumaturgic mist's command
The .#real
Melts in the boundless wonderland
Of the ideal.
My well-brushed hat, my muffler white,
My coat of blue, -
Disguise the fact that they’re not quite
As good as new.
Streets where young bards their unsung
Verse
In third-floor roomsbury—
(The nascent Muse is not averse
To sombre Bloomsbury)—
Become to wandering fancy's view,
While vision slumbers,
The weird old cities DoR£ drew
In shilling numbers.
And Station roofs for once may change
Their wonted frowns,
And blend majestic in a range
Of mystic downs.
From cloud-clad tow’rs the hours are spelt,
Whose turrets fair, - -
Less blest than Prospero's visions, melt
Into thick air.
But lo! the swathing vapours fleet
Like darkness sifted,
And from the rather shamefaced street
The fog has lifted.
Again, amid its leafless planes,
I see the Abbey; -
Unchanged, like it, the fact remains
That I am shabby.

THERE have lately been reports of some
lunatic threatening Lord Rothschild's life,
but Mr. B. S. MARKS has been most success:
ful in taking his Lordship from life, and
exhibiting him in a picture, as he appeared
when taking his solemn oath in the House
of Lords. As his Lordship is not represented
as bare-headed,—his title, we remarked at
the time, ought to have been “Lord HAT-

of swearing was almost overpowering, the

Bouse of Commons, Monday Night, January 31,–A little tragedy
unnoted by the ºf. crowd befel under Gallery this evening.
Sheriffs of City of London came down, dressed all in their best, to
present petition. Business *...* took their seats under the
Gallery as usual, and began to think what they should have for
dinner. With legs crossed, hands folded, and scarlet gown draped
around them, mused on modifications of the menu; when a sudden
disturbance arose from the House. Bells .# Members crowded in,
and attendant, with peremptory gesture, bun led Sheriffs of the City
of London into the outer Hall, upsetting as it were the soup, sliding
the fish off the dish, and making the entrées ereunt.
All WILFRID LAwson's joke." AKERs-Douglas had moved New

Business done,—Further debate on Address. -
Tuesday.—A great and proud day for us, the Coming Party, the
Chaplinites, the Dissentient Unionists. Our Great Chief has seized
his opportunity, and made mince-meat of the adversary. All very
well for RANDoLPH to occupy two, evenings of the Session, for
GEORGE HAMILTON to orate, and for CoNYBEARE to discuss the
question, “Why are the Tory Party so lºgº at me?” Our Chief's
appearance on the scene dwarfs them all. Its effect, before a word
was uttered, remarkable. , GLADSTONE, unnecessarily apprehensive
as it turned out, had invented necessity for adjourning to the Fens.
RANDOLPH, with more occasion, had hurried out of the House, when
certain movements on the part of Our Chief indicated preparation

well for him to be out of range, for the firing was terrific. Mr.
DISRAELI, in his most pompous moments, never equalled Our Chief
in the profundity of his emotion, the impressiveness of his gestures,
or the range of his emphasis.
“The noble Lord,” he said, in one of the finest passages, “has not
the shadow of a leg to stand upon.” -
I suppose that, as indicating absolute helplessness, the English
language does not contain a more striking metaphor. ..

BEARE fell a little flat. A new Member, one GRAHAM, gave it a fillip
in a quaint maiden speech, with something of a touch of Carlylese
in it. House thankful for anything out
of the ordinary rut, and encouraged new
Member with much laughter and cheer-
ing. Debate drifted on till midnight,
when adjournment moved. W. H. SMITH,
rising in ordinary Leader-of-the-House
fashion, expressed hope that a little
further use of the night might be made.
Front Opposition Bench practically
deserted; PARNELL absent; apparently
no one to lead the Opposition in resisting
this attack on its privileges. Seemed that all
was lost, when a familiar voice heard below
the Gangway. It was Joseph GILLIS, with one
thumb in the armhole of his waistcoat, the other
hand disengaged what time he caressed his
incipient moustache. In genial bantering man-
ner, the hand of steel gleaming, beneath the
velvet glove, JoEY B. withstood the Leader of
the House. He was gracious, even benignant;
but no mistaking his purpose. John MANNERs

Wednesday.—“Still harping on me country,” said O'Hea, in voice
of deep melancholy.
Was standing at the Bar looking at the almost empty. House of
Commons, which CRILLY was vehemently addressing. O'HEA never
been the same man since O'SHEA left. “I’m a poor widow man,”
he says, with a tear in his voice. -
Particularly downcast to-day, and not without reason. Here we
are at the end of first week of Session, and absolutely no forrader.
Supposed to be debating the Address. Cloud of Amendments on the
paper. Haven't yet, after six days, reached the first one. , Amend:
ments touch all subjects, stretching from Egypt to Ireland, vid
Scotland. Each will have its two or three sittings—that relating to
Ireland probably a week. Yet here we are to-day, as we have been
every day, talking about Ireland. All the speeches to be delivered
over again, with others, when PARNELL's Amendment comes on...Well
may the tears trickle down the face of the widowed O'HEA: Happy
in #. out of it is the errant O'SHEA. Business done.-None.
Thursday.—Profound sensation in House to night. RANDOLPH has
disappeared, and Sir J. McGAREI, Hogg, by
strategic movement, has secured his corner
seat. RANDoIPH has made for Algiers.
Report is, he has gone there on account of
his health. Robson Roose says so, and he
it ought to know. But Robson Roose, though
--- unapproachable in his own
line, a mere chicken in the
hands of a political Rooseter
like RANDoIPH. Public doubt-

how an honourable Member,
acting as agent for the Chief
of the Dissentient Unionists,
visited the Dey of ALGIERs,
Bey of TUNIs, Prince of Mo-
NAco, Doge of WENICE, and
other potentates; how he was
followed to Monaco by the
Chief himself with HARTING-

when the projected alliance
had made considerable ad-
vance, RANDOLPH upset every-
thing by resigning office and
bringing about chaos. RAN-

he should just now have started for Algiers. . Should he go on to

us will begin to see a hole through the ladder.
Meanwhile Hogg's manoeuvring led to much conjecture, and on
Treasury Bench to some perturbation. What did it portend ?
Chairman of Metropolitan Board of Works usually regarded as
steady-going Conservative. amenable to discipline, and with rooted
reverence for authority. What did he do in the seat of the scorner P

More interminable speech-making, with remote
reference to the Address.
Business done,—None.
Friday.—At last reached Amendments to Ad-
dress. CREMER moved one calling for withdrawal
of troops from Egypt. WILFRID LAwson gave
what he called “a bird's-eye view of how things
had gone on in Egypt for the last eleven
years.” Principal figure in the landscape was
GoscHEN, assisting the KHEDIVE to put ZADIK
PASHA in a chest, nailing him up alive, and
dropping him to the bottom of the Nile. Sir
CHARLEs Foster, who has already lost his hat,
sat and shuddered at graphic picture.
REDMoND gave account of his visit to Egypt
and how he was ashamed to be there. feeling
the glances of hatred of the people were
merited. SAUNDERson created painful sensa-
tion by suggesting that REDMonD had been
mistaken for an Englishman. REDMOND, how-
ever, hastened to assure the House that this was . not so, and
equanimity restored.
Business done.—CREMER's Amendment rejected by 263 votes
against 97.
A. S. Cr-m-r.
TELLINGS OF THE TELEPHONE.
THE account of the conversation recently held between the King
of the BELGIANs and President GRávy, coupled with the announce-
ment that the Queen had at Bruxelles been listening to a rehearsal
at the Paris Opera, has soon led the way to other Continental
experiences of a like character. The following comes from a Berlin
correspondent:—
The new telephonic apparatus was yesterday submitted to the
Chancellor, who, taking much apparent interest in the invention,
at once requested that he might be put into communication with the
eastern frontier of France. This was immediately done, with the
result that his §º distinctly heard the sawing of the planks
now being utilised for the construction of the new French military
huts in process of extensive erection in that quarter. This appeared
to amuse the Prince, who laughingly suggested that the other end of
the machine should be ſaid on tº General Boulanº's private
apartment; and, on being assured that the connection had been
effected, he forthwith proceeded to dictate, in a loud and resounding
voice, a further threatening article to the Reporter of the Berlin
Post, who was in attendance for the purpose. This was attentively
listened to, though with some, astonishment, by the French War
Minister, and was followed, in the course of the afternoon, by another
characteristic panic on the Rourse.
The subjoined is from Vienna. The EMPEROR expressing much
satisfaction with the apparatus, said he shouldlike to test it in a little
private conversation with the CzAR, where, on communication being
established with the Winter Palace, his Majesty was startled by
hearing distinctly the report of a gun. He, however, immediately
made the humorous, inquiry, “What are you about? Shooting a
Secretary f' to which came the prompt reply, “No, Trying a new
Repeating Rifle in my bed-room.” ter the interchange of a little
good-natured badinage of the same character, the CzAR suddenly
asked “How about the Landsturm * I fancy, you’re having them
drilled. Can hear the continuous tramp.” To this the EMPERoR,
after a few moments' reflection, as if struck with a happy thought,
responded, “Bless you ! It's only the goose step;” an explanation
which seemed to occasion the CzAR considerable £iº, as he could
be distinctly heard laughing immoderately on receiving it. On the
whole the relations between the two Courts may be regarded as
excellent, and the prospect may be said to be visibly brightening.
Communication has also quite recently been established between
the Foreign Office and Her Majesty's representative at Constan-
tinople, and was put to the test yesterday by the despatch of the
laconic inquiry, “Well, what are you up to now ** To which, after
a brief interval, was vouchsafed the reply, “Nothing in particular.”
To this Lord SALISBURY bade his Secretary rejoin, “All right; stick
to it,” and the conversation, which seemed to indicate a resolution on
the part of Her Majesty's Government to assume a somewhat neutral
attitude in any possibly impending conflict, abruptly closed.

A SONNET OF WALENTINES.
WHEN February's lingering light reveals .
The patient earth, still pallid with the weight
Of Winter's darkness, and the dazzling freight
Of snow, which Summer's wealth in trust upseals,
And heavenward turns th’ unwary walker's heels,
And lends to dauntless Infancy a straight
And aggravating missile for the pate
Of musing stranger, who astonied feels
The concrete cloud upon his collar burst;-
Now, when the birds make their engagements known,
And early baas are on the thin winds blown,
There are who send—I can't tell why, I’m sure—
To strangers, who have ne'er with them convers'd,
Rude painted daubs of vilest portraiture.
HERE is an advertisement that might suit an ambitious
conjuror out of place :-
CA. any Clergyman RECOMMEND a thoroughly respectable
useful Man as INDOOR SERVANT and GARDENERP
Some knowledge of house decorating desirable; age about 35;
Church of England; principal duties gardening and drawing
bath chair; parlour-maid does indoor work while thus engaged;
dress as indoor servant after one; no beer; no clothes; bond
Jide non-smoker.
Note the wonders of this mysterious household! There
is an ubiquitous parlour-maid, who, while engaged in
“gardening and drawing a bath chair” at the very same
moment apparently “does indoor work.” But no lesser
marvel is expected of the applicant. He is to dress as an
indoor servant after one, and yet he is to do it without
any clothes. After this it seems immaterial that he
should have some knowledge of house decorating and be
a bond fide non-smoker. The advertiser had better apply
direct to M. WERBECK.
MR. SANTLEY has been recently made a Knight of St.
Gregory by LEO THE THIRTEENTH. Why not have
beatified him at once, on account of his being so Santley?
He was in excellent voice when he sang in Spohr's great
Oratorio, which, by the way, is a subject that does not
ind itself to any Spohr-tive remarks.

A PROTEST FROM THE PEDESTAL.
THE, adjourned meeting of the Public Thoroughfare Protection Association
was held, after midnight, yesterday at Charing Cross, Lord NELsoN, who
descended from his column for the purpose, being again voted unanimously in
the Chair. The assemblage which was rather select than large, was, however,
well attended by Statues occupying various prominent sites, in other parts of the
º: and who, therefore, took a lively interest in the matter under
scussion.
On the hour of One sounding on the clock of the Westminster Palace, the
CHAIRMAN rose. He said, he need not detain the meeting by dwelling on what
had brought them together. They were met to º: against, an intolerable
nuisance &#. ! hear !”) need he say he alluded to the utilisation, attempted
and threatened, of the open space that surrounded them, for the purposes of
public meeting. Though when a mob crowded the Square, he, perched up on
the º of his lofty pedestal, might personally consider himself out of it, still
he could see what was going on at his feet, and he had #. seen the base
of his column invaded by a noisy rabble, who even clambered on to the backs
of the four noble beasts who protected him. (“Shame /?”) It is true they
had been dislodged ultimately { the Police, but only after an unseemly scuffle,
that he considered degrading to him as a public monument. (“IHear ! hear!”
He had on one memorable occasion reminded his fellow-countrymen how Englan
expected every man to do his duty, and he would just throw the hint agross to
the Authorities at Scotland Yard opposite, by expressing a hope that, when the
time should arrive, they would befound equal to the task of doing theirs. (Cheers.)
GENERAL SIR CHARLEs NAPIER said he entirely concurred in every word that
had dropped from the illustrious naval hero who occupied the chair. (“Hear!”)
Speaking from his own experience, and in his forward, position, he was able
conveniently to note the passage of the vehicular traffic.; he could only say
that on the last occasion, about a year ago, when the Square was invaded, it
came to a dead stand-still. This was a disgrace. Besides, in the turmoil, the
public did not even notice him, and he considered he had been placed on the
“finest site in Europe” to be stared at. , (Laughter.). Instead of that, he onl
had a mob of angry ruffians turning their backs on him. (Renewed #.
Honourable Statues might laugh, but he could tell them that to be placed on
a pedestal by a grateful country, and then treated no, better than a lamp-post,
was not a pleasant experience. 'He protested against this. He certainly should
vote that the Square be restricted to its proper uses, and not turned into a bear
garden...(Cheers.), And he felt he could say this not only for himself, but also
on behalf of his gallant brother-in-arms, facing the omnibuses on the other side.
General HAVELock (with warmth)...I believe you! (Roars ºf laughter.)
GEORGE THE FourTH said; that situated as he was, he might by some, be
regarded as the “corner man” in any assemblage that might take place in that
locality. Still, he believed, he was still known as the First Gentleman in
Europe—(“Oh! oh”)—and, under these circumstances, he considered it ver
derogatory to his dignity to have a crew of ragamuffins climbing about his horse's
legs, and waving ared flag under his very nose. He would be bound his illus-
trious predecessor, the Royal Martyr, would agree with him. -
CHARLEs THE FIRST, who, on rising, was enthusiastically greeted, said, that
having lost his head in one popular movement, he was likely to know what he
was saying when dealing with another. (“Bear ! hear!”) He could only say
to suffer the traffic of a great centre, to be interrupted for hours by a set #
brawlers under any pretext whatever, that it would be an interference with the
right of public meeting to stop it, was to sanction a scandal to which the mere
levying of ship-money was a comparative trifle. (Cheers.) . He had been once
brought to the block, but if this was allowed, he should have the block perpetually
being brought to him... (Laughters). If people wanted to talk, let them do it on
Clapham Common or at Wormwood Scrubs. He trusted Sir CHARLEs WARREN
would set his foot down firmly in the matter, and protect the peace and well-
being of the neighbourhood. (“Plear!”) - - -
The discussion was then continued with much animation by several Statues
from the Embankment, who spoke to the same effect, some merriment being
caused by the arrival of GEORGE THE THIRD from Cockspur Street, who rode
round to give his general support to the meeting, the four Lions eventually
rising and expressing their º of the proceedings by a sympathetic roar.
The approach of dawn having been announced by the whistle of an early train
entering the neighbouring . station, the assemblage gradually withdrew, and
the local Statues re-seeking their respective places, the Square once more
assumed its wonted aspect.
HAD it proved true that, as the P.M.G. informed the F. Sir CHARLEs
DILKE on coming into a #". would have had to change his name to SNookE,
then those persons who did not wish to speak to the ex-Member for Chelsea
when encountering him in the street would have had the pleasure of “Cutting a
Snooke” without any rude action.
THERE was *ś. enough for the vast assemblage of Brethren who met
to assist at the installation of AUGUSTUs DRURIOLANUs. Whereupon the New
Worshipful Master might have exclaimed, with a sigh, “O for a Lodge in some
vast wilderness!”. By the way, at the ceremony there was an Anglican Bishop
present. Will this Episcopal Mason, in his apron, lay the foundations of a
Church House?
THE AMERICAN FISHERIEs' DISPUTE.-What the Canadians say to the
Americans,—“Pas sea Bait.”. Directly the bait is not used to catch votes, an
amicable settlement will be arrived at-and the sooner the baiter.

for an order for the committal of sundry poor women, for the
crime of not assuring the regular attendance of their little ones
at the Board School.
PRIson or fine? Poor souls' A Mother's weakness
Brings a new Nemesis in our Christian day.
But Law is Law; let Nature bow in meekness
To an enlightened State's paternal sway.
And * the still small voice of human kindness
Hide-bound legality cannot hush or quench;
Yet the heart tells cold Law that callous blindness
Is blind and callous—even on the Bench.
Here, where in flesh and blood, want-pinched and pallid,
Their smugly-settled problems take a guise.
That makes the reasonings pedants find so valid
Hollow as dream-world's spectral phantasies.
Poor flesh and blood! How apt they are to shatter
The neatest formula of prig or prude,
The dogmatist's phrase-fortresses to batter,
And prove the bigot's schemings harsh and crude.
Educate! Educate! The cry rings round us;
There's reason in the late-raised plea for light.
But shouters shirk the problems that confound us,
Hustling the uglier questions out of sight.
They’ll not be hustled, they will not stay hidden;
arsh facts, complacent to no soft appeal,
Jut forth in naked horror unforbidden,
And the raw follies of rash haste reveal.
Educate! Educate!. A popular chorus,
Swelled both by voice o e and shriek of fool.
But still unsolved the problem stands before us, -
How justly to put Poverty to school.
- - - - -
Justly! Wills the wise world that Education
Shall to pinched women and pale children come
The happy herald of emancipation,
Light to the blind, and language to the dumb?
Or that to sordid slum and crowded hovel
As tyrant and tormentor it shall go;
Taskmaster at whose threatenings they must grovel,
Armed with a goad to aggravate their woe?
No querulous questionings these of dull reaction-
No peevish promptings of sectarian spite! ..
Harsh facts inspire them, not the heat of faction;
Shall justice not make answer in their light?
- - - - -
One six-year-old pale shoeless poor defaulter
Shrinks from a chilling six-mile daily trudge,
Daring with rigid School-Board law to palter,
From fear of frozen feet and soaking sludge!
Bad case of course! Prompt prison for the mother
Of so mature a truant seems so fit!
Impatient at the Inspector's pompous pother?
ay, halting Rhadamanthus, wait a bit.

Deserted by her husband, left to labour,
For three small children, helpless and alone,
Toil for sole friend, famine for nearest neighbour,
Another erring mother makes her moan.
SALLY, age twelve, the eldest child, and skilful
At ; kept from school to keep .
The tinier bairns from mischief. Wrong so wilful
Will surely make the School-Board Draco weep.
Mothers must toil, leave home intent on forage,
Like parent-birds from an untended nest.
But check compassion's promptings; these encourage
All sorts of ills, home-love amongst the rest.
Committal asked for Mothers thus neglectful
Of the Three R.'s for the mere sake of food
Must learn, from fine or cell, to be respectful
To Law which loves—and starves—their hungry brood.

Another? Ah, these Mothers! They embarrass
Cut-and-dried schemes confoundedly, And yet
These poor maternal hearts to hunt and harass
Is work at which the Public's prone to fret.

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. XVII.-ThE PROFESSOR OF ELocuTION,
IT is more than arguable whether DEMosTHENEs might not have
made himself an even finer orator than he undoubtedly became, if,
instead of wasting time in declaim- ta. º
ing to the ocean with his mouthfull -
ofshingle, or running up-hill repeat-
ing select passages of poetry, he had
laid out a few minae in private
tuition with some practical rhe-
torician of the period.
Indeed, PLUTARCH implies that he
did actually adopt so obviously
prudent a course, and he would
scarcely have acquired his reputation
by unassisted effort; but, without
pronouncing any opinion upon a
int of some obscurity, we should
eel sincerely thankful that we live
in an age when every man -
may be endowed with as
much eloquence as he re-
uires in a series of profes-
sional lessons on moderate
terms. -
The philanthropist who
accomplishes this, and alters
his client into an oratorina
miraculously brief #:
time, does not style himself
a necromancer, but, with a
modesty which is almost -
excessive, is content.to be º
known as an “Elocution Professor.” He is big and bland, with a
booming voice, which he has under admirable control. Long inter-
course with Čurates has imparted an ecclesiastical tone to his
conversation, though he will undertake, with equal readiness, to
prepare candidates for the Church, the Bar, Parliament, or the Stage.
course a pupil should be explicit concerning the particular
career he intends to adopt, otherwise there might be a danger of his
importing into his pulpit the blandishments of the Common Law
Bar, addressing a British Jury as his “dear Brethren,” or
intoning the parts of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Let us suppose, reader, that you require preparation for some more
º purpose than a profession.
ou have to go before the Radical Three Hundred of the Mid-
Hecklingham District, and you want tº learn to speak up; or, you
are asked to a public function, in which you have reason to believe
that some appropriate remarks will be expected from you, while you
are too conscious that, even if you could contrive to manufacture a
few coherent commonplaces, you cannot undertake to deliver them
beyond a certain radius without breakage.
So you naturally rush to that convenient vehicle for all modern
incompetents, the “coach.” The Professor's mode of reception will
remind you equally of consultations with your solicitor and your
#. he listens gravely to your needs, and makes a rapid
iagnosis of your case. -
Perhaps, after hearing you read a passage from the E.
he informs you that your accent is affected by a provincial burr,
which he has no doubt of being able to extract eventually; or it ma
be that early privation has led you to adopt a rigid economy, whic
still causes you to §: indulgence in an occasional aspirate,
and he has an infallible system for curing any deficiencies of this
kind. So he invites you to follow him to his Class-Room, a room with
blank walls, and furnished with a black-board on an easel, and a
long table laid out with volumes of exercises for elocutionists: .
ere his first act is to test the compass of your voice, which he
does by retiring to some station near the top of the house, and
requesting you to remain where you are, and shout your sentiments
on things in general. A leaflet which some benevolent person in
the street has lately bestowed on you, will provide you with the
requisite ideas. You declaim your tract till you are hoarse, and in
ten minutes your instructor returns with the information that he did
not catch your observations distinctly until he had actually turned
the door-handle. A little practice, however, reveals that you are the
possessor of a latent bellow which, with a moderate amount of effort,
can be successfully produced.
But to shine in oratory, more than this is needed. You must work
hard at acquiring the nuances, the inflections proper to all the vary-
ing m , so, under your instructor's superintendence, you invoke
ruin on a ruthless King with the fire of inspiration; lament, with
only the suspicion of a sneer, that you are “no orator as BRUTUsis,”
and throw a note of infinite tenderness into your recollections of the
last occasion on which you saw the Queen of FRANCE.
You may not feel immediately at home with these new acquire-
ments, especially in the . affairs of life. The Mark Antony
sneer may cost you a º of dear friends, and the note of infinite
tenderness will assert itself unbidden when you are asking your fish-
monger the price of a pair of soles, or requesting to be furnished with
a second-class return-ticket to Gower Street.
Still, you are really advancing, and you go on until you only need
the finishing touches of a ker—the readiness and fluency, which
can be gained by practice i.
is practice your Professor supplies. He outlines speeches on the
black-board, and you fill them up from your own internal re-
sources; he attacks your policy in bitter invective, and you make as
withering a reply as you can command at short notice; he jº.
your health in flattering terms, and you rise to acknowledge the
compliment; he presents you with one of the pewter inkstandson the
table, and you express the emotion and gratitude that fill your
breast; then you present the inkstand to him, with an eloquent
panegyric, and he "finds it impossible to convey to you any adequate
idea of the ğ. to which he is affected by a testimonialso splendid,
so unexpected, and by eulogies so out of proportion to his me
merits.” . After a few exercises of this #. ou feel impatient for
an opportunity of exhibiting your new accomplishment, and rehearse
with enthusiasm, the little impromptu speech which you foresee will
. be required of you, but which no longer fills your breast with
rror.
Your Elocution Professor teaches you a useful exordium, which
robably begins: “My Lord SoANso, Gentlemen, No one here could
ave entered the Hall this º; with less expectation of being
called upon for a speech than the humble individual who now ad-
dresses you. . But, at the risk of seeming tedious, I venture, however
unworthily, to crave your kind indulgence for the few crude and
ill-digested reflections which have been suggested to me by the very
able and eloquent address of the ...f speaker who has just
resumed his seat, and whom Iregret, for some reasons, that Is
have to follow.”
With this opening committed to memory, and glycerine jujubes in
a pocket where you can get at them, you go to your meeting or your
#. dinner with a calm conviction that you are not i.ely to
tinguish yourself.
You will deliver your exordium with a few inevitable excisions
and alterations due to circumstances and quite natural agitation, but
upon the whole the passages which are variations of the original text
are positive improvements upon it, as will appear from the following
shorthand note:—
“Gentlemen, and my Lord SoANso, -No one could have entered
this Hall with less expectations than i did. fimust however, crave
your crude and ill-digested indulgence for the very able and eloquent
address which I have practised for this evening, though I have to
follow the humble individual who, at the risk of seeming tedious
and however unworthily, has, 1 regret for some reasons, just resumed
his remarks.” And when you sit down at the close of your oration,
flushed with *; and deafened by applause, do not forget that
you are indebted for some little portion of your success to the
untiring devotion of your Professor of Elocution.

Lord Chancellor loquitur –
OH, come, my dear PEEL, this is getting too dreadfull
Not yet through that farce which you dub “the Address”?
On twaddle and trash all these nights you have fed full,
And still you are stuck in the midst of the mess.
An awful example your practice affords
To those you are apt to pooh-pooh-us poor Lords!
Dear! dear! Half the bores in your Chamber have blathered,
And still you're “no forrader.” Tell me, my friend,
One sparklet of wisdom or withave you gathered,
Or cast any light on one politic end?
That yawn is an answer. I’m sure you have not.
I should say—if big-wigs might talk slang—it's all rot.
True, RANDOLPH has tipped you his two explanations,
And GRAHAM cut many a music-hall joke;
But, eugh l what Saharas are Howorth's orations!

Too bad, my dear PEEL!. If your House doesn't quicken,

Ha! haſ 'Tis the Peer at this moment who scores.
When the Public find out that yºur game 's all my eye,

with blast like one from
º
when,
Open º: I flung the doorway,
orway,
In there ºd brisk DUNRAVEN, whom I'd often seen before.
Nottheleast obeisance made he ; for no greeting stopped or stayed he,
But with solemn mien and shady, perched above my office-door.
On a bust of RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, just above my office-door–
Perched and sat, and nothing more,
Then this pompous bird beguiling my tired fancy into smiling,
#º: proud pragmatic aspect of the countenance it wore,
-- at’s your little game, DUNRAVEN ? Surely you have not turned
craven.
“Back of late to a home-haven fresh from many a foreign shore—
“Say if travelling your small game is, are you off to some far shore?”
Quoth DUNRAVEN, “Nevermore!”
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its parrot stock and store
“Caught from Woodcock, its pet master, who so sold me. Sure
disaster
: Follows fast and follows faster. Well, it is a beastly bore..
“But I’ll tune my harp to Hope, stout Hºrngron, at least, is sure;
He will leave me—Nevermore.”
But DUNRAVEN still sat smiling in a manner rather riling;
So I wheeled my office-chair in front of bird, and bust and door,
And upon its cushion sinking straight I tackled him like winking,
And I cried, “What are you thinking, croaking, croaking, as of
yore?
What the dickens do you, ghastly gloomy and funereal bore.
Mean by croaking ‘Nevermore l’”
“Prophet,” said I, of things evil!—this will play the very devil
With the Union of the Unionists—a thing we both adore.
Tell me are you too afraid, in view of an Exchequer laden?
Can't you see Retrenchment's Aidenn, won’t be reached till scares
are o'er
Then we’ll seek that distant Aidenn, then together seek its shore,”—
uoth DUNRAVEN, “ Revermºre?”
“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I cried,
upstarting,
“Hook it with the wanton Woodcock to Algiers, to Afric's shore.
Make no speeches as a token that our party ties are broken.
Twice already Woodcock's spoken, -don't you burst into a roar,
Take your hook, if you must go, but spare us on the House's floor.”
Quoth DUNRAVEN, “Nevermore!”
And DUNRAVEN, spite his flitting, still seems sitting, still seems
sitting
On that plaster bust of CHURCHILL, just above my office-door;

And the º within me gleaming in the good old days of yore,
Ereyoung RAND9LPH cameor STAFFywent-bravebeacon-lightofyore,

A STOREY OF A HOUSE.
MR. Joseph HATTon's new Novel. The Old House at Sandwich—
but stay—we will *..." a sample of the introduction, to our
customers, which, if not a fac-simile, is the best we can produce
from memory.
PART I. CHAPTER I.-"Inquire Within.”
I AM giving my tradesmen in London a little holiday, and for this
reason I am lounging about a remarkably quiet corner of pastoral
Kent, the old-fashioned port of Sandwich. The climate is most
appetising and †† the name being so suggestive of ham,
beef, bread, and fine old crusted. Having deposited my bag
at the ancient Inn, I am wandering about the old town. I must
not wander too much or I shall never get to my story. I am con-
sidering where I am likely to findsomeone in this out-of-the-way spot
who will stand me a dinner. As a rule a Sandwich man is always
well provided, as no matter where he lodges he carries his board
about with him. But there are no Sandwich men about to-day. I
see a notice up, “This House to Let.” Evidently no dinner there.
In a shaded corner of a #. I see amiddle-aged man trimming a
rass-plot. Strange that this grass-plotshould †: another plot as
lean overtherailings and affably bid him."good day,” and then going
through the Fºtº, I add, like Paul Pry, “I hope I don't intrude.”
“Hoe, no!” he says, laying aside this garden implement. He
tells me he is not a gardener, whereupon I reply that I am sure he is
a man of great cultivation. This is safe, after what I’ve seen of
him among his flowers and vegetables, with his hoe, rake and
spade. He has been cutting capers to warm himself, and gathering
salad, evidently for dinner. I show considerable interest in Sand-
wich:. I ask questions about places to let. . He tells me that he is
the Vicar, and having nothing to do, he is in the garden taking his
“otium cum dig.” It is many years since I heard this joke, and I
welcome it with much laughter. The Vicar likes appreciation, and
tells me that there is no one now left in Sandwich who will either
listen to his sermons or laugh at his jokes, ...
“I shall not preach to you,” he says, “as it is not Sunday;” but
like the genial philosopher he is, he asks me to hear some more jokes
at dinner. It is an excellent dinner. He goes on telling jokes, but
as he pushes the decanter of old Madeira towards me, and contents
himself with tapping his snuff-boxinstead of the wine, I am delighted
to listen, drink, and smile. Before leaving, I get him well into an
old joke about the House to Let, which he can't quite remember, but
on my saying that he may possibly do so by dinner-time to-morrow,
he repeats his hospitable invitation, and so the next day I dine with
him again. On the strength of being on dining terms with the old
Vicar, my landlord is prepared to give me credit to any extent.
“I like old-fashioned ways,” says the Vicar, producing hot whiskey
and water, and long churchwarden pipes.
“Your tastes are mine,” I reply, and then he tells me Porson's
old Greek joke about oude toddy oude tallo, and I enjoy it in this old-
world out-of-the-way º heartily.
On my road back to the Inn, the wind coming across the garden
seems to do me a deal of good. As I hold on to the railings I hum
a lullably, while at the same time I feel full of a collection of tender
sentiments, and am recalling faint memories of happy days. A bat
whizzes by my head. Who threw it? The Vicar? Genial old
philosopher! }linger in the doorway of the Inn, and there seems to be
neither bell nor knocker. A solitary night-bird going home salutes
me with a shrill cry. The night-bird is drunk and disorderly. Where
are the police of Sandwich P I shall sleep on the door-step.
CHAPTER II.
THE next day I call on the old Vicar. He is not up, to anything,
except snuff, to-day. I too have a headache, but I will wait till he
is down, to know whether he asked me to dinner to-night or not.
He did, the genial old philosopher, and here I am. We dine again.
He remarks that my not remembering the dinner invitation, shows I
must be a Scotchman, as my motto evidently is “ dinna forget.”
Dear old-world, ancient, and well-known, joke! Qnce more I laugh
º and drink to its long life and prosperity in a bumper of
the fine old Madeira-" motºfort of Sandwich,” says my host,
(whereat I have convulsions of risibility and more Madeira) and then
we adjourn to whiskey and churchwardens. It will not do to impose
on his hospitality too long. I intimate that I want to know all about
the “House to Let,” and that I wish to change a small cheque with
my own signature to it for ten pounds. He produces an old-world
leather purse. He is fond of collecting curiosities and rarities of all
sorts. ell the rarest gem in all his cºllection will be—my cheque.
It is many years since my holiday visit to that, corner of Kent.
[Here the story really begins, and we will not anticipate the reader's
pleasure by giving any clue as to Mr. Joseph HATTON's well-told
story of The Old House at Sandwich. Order it at MUDIE's, or get it
at SAMPson Low & Co's., and read it with delight.]

RIDDLE'S DICTIONARY.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, Dr. Buzzer's, Strikeholm, Finchley.
- I MADE up these two riddles last April, and I have deter-
mined to have them published. The fellows think them awfully
good. You may wish to know why I made them up. I was making
some mountains with a candle on the º º when young Jones
came, bothering, so I didn't notice that I was burning a hole in the
middle of Russia. Old BUZZER not only made me pay for a new map,
but I had to clean the Steppes of Tartary as well, which inly
were in a beastly mess from the smoke of the candle, so I had to give
young Jones a licking, and anyhow I owed him one from last term.
I remain Yours never-havinº,
Joseph MERCAtoR MILLER. (M.)
P.S.—I have forgotten to send the riddles. Perhaps I had better
put in the answers, as the fellows say they are very hard.
(a) What is the difference between a Baronet making butter, and
ai. on fire?—One is a churning Bart., and the other is a burning

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FRom.
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Commons, Monday, February 7.-"As for cooing you
lonel SAUNDERSON, said just now, as he gazed with
softened glance upon PARNELL, “a sucking dove is a perfect screech-
owl to him.”
Strange indeed, the tone and attitude of the Irish Leader, especially
for those who remember his earliest appearances. He and JoséPH
BIGGAR worked º: then, now some ten years ago. Sat below
the Gangway in close .# Joseph used to pair out on
Blue Books; PARNELL depended on his own store of invective which
was iſlimitable. A sight to make the sººn shudder to see Fº
NELL with hands clenched, teeth set, hissing forth his hatred of the
Saxon, whilst Joseph GILLIS, sitting near him, watched the effect
with broadening grin. , JoEY B. is now a staid Parliamentary man,
with a high manner, based upon close observation of GLADSTONE,
BRIGHT, and DAVID PLUNKET. And this is PARNELL–occasionally
almost inaudible by reason of excessive 5. conspicuous for
his deference to the Chair, and remarkable for his courtesy to oppo-
nents. In these days of grace, refrains even from startling nervous
Members by personal transformation scenes. Once, when obstruction
was at its height, and all-night sittings had become monotonous, PAR-
NELL used to shake the Government of the day by suddenly appear-
ing with the crown of his head shaved; sometimes his hair hung low
over his coat-collar, the next night it was cro close. He had,
moreover, a suit of muddy yellow hue with which, when the Chief
Secretary did not prove amenable, he was wont to sear the eyeballs

of the House. All these things put away now, and here we have the
tºº." spoken man that ever bearded the Śrºken, or bullied a
1nister,
Only once to-night did PARNELL return to oldermanner. This was
when he observed, “I should like to ask the Government why Mr.
John DEVINE’s skull was cracked?” -
A solemn pause followed the º of this conundrum.
HIcks BEACH, who had just arrived from Ireland, silently pro-
tested against things being put in this way. W. H. SMITH moved
uneasily in place of Leader; HENRY MATTHEws, pretended to be
asleep; and É. DE WoRMs putting on his hat walked out behind
the §º: Chair, winking at Right Hon. Gentleman, as who
should say, “The Board of Trade has nothing to do with this.” .
Pity PARNELL momentarily lost his temper here. House soterrified
and cowed that no answer was forthcoming, and darkness and night
still broods over the question, “Why was Wir. John Dºvnºsºnii
cracked P’” Business done.—Debate on Address.
Tuesday.—Always believed that, before the world was much
older, Grand CRoss would electrify the House of Lords. Since he
took º seat there he has, with characteristic modesty, kept in back-
ground. -
“No hurry, Toby,” he said, when I ventured to remonstrate with
him upon this loss to the nation. “My time will come. . Meanwhile
I sit here, bite my nails, adjust my spectacles, and look on. That
has moral effect not recorded in Parliamentary reports. GRANVILLE
knows my eye is upon him, and is careful accordingly. Often seen
SHERBRooke move, with evident intention of rising, and attacking
the Government. I fix him with my eye, and he keeps his seat. As
for speaking, I’ll do that by-and-by.”

96 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. [FEBRUARY 19, 1887.
By-and-by befel to-night. Effect volcanic. Came about this way. In Com-
mons a Member may, and often does, explain a Bill on moving for leave to intro-
duce it, a stage which precedes printing. The Lords invariably wait for speech
till second reading stage, when the Bill is printed and circulated. That has been
their habit for centuries. But Grand CRoss is above centuries. Having pre-
ared a Bill dealing with Glebe Lands, he made a § speech to the amazed
}. In Commons, in view of similar breach of established rule, the SPEAKER
would have interfered, or the House would have shouted down the bold innovator.
The Lords simply sat and stared frigidly at Grand CRoss, who accepted this
attitude as natural and ordinary testimony to the interest of his speech. When
he had finished, GRANVILLE, in his sweetestand most seductive manner, reproyed
the young Wiscount's temerity. The Markiss came to the support of his protégé,
and there was quite a little storm in the teacup. . . -
“Of course I stood up for him,” said the Markiss, talking the matter over
afterwards. “I was obliged to, when GRAN VILLE attacked him. But, he must
be looked after. He is too versatile, too emotional, too spirituel to be left with-
out a guiding hand.” Business done.—In Commons, further debate on Address.
Wednesday.—Still doddering along in speech-making on Address. ...No one
s any particular attention. SPEAKER takes the Chair at usual hour. Members
}. ... other, and, being Wednesday afternoon, when the clock points. to
quarter to six, the proceedings shut up like a telescope. More interest in election
going on in St. George's, Hanover Square(Gosch EN calls HAYSMAN, “the School-
master abroad”), and in the news from Ireland. TIM HEALY is coming back
in, and W. O'BRIEN, “will never come back no more.” He has had enough
of the House of Commons. Not sure that the feeling of repletion isn't mutual.
However it be, O'BRIEN turns his back on House of Commons, and wenust geton
as best we can. Business done.—None.
Thursday. — “Such larks!” said JoEY B.,
coming upon me suddenly round Lord ARTHUR
HILL i. a mischievous urchin darting upon an
elderly gentleman round the Monument. “Such
larks, Tobyl You stand by, keep your eye on me,
and you’ll see something.”
It was a quarter-past four. Discussion on
Brixton Market Bill drawing to a close. Presently
group gathered at the Bar; prominent in the
midst was GoscHEN, supported on one side by
CRAIG-SELLAR, and the other by the Member for
Mid Surrey., . - - -
“Wainly trying to add a Cubitt to his political
stature,” said a familiar voice close by... It was
TIM HEALY, come back to us after brief
but g. separation. -
“So you’ve come back again?” I
asked, perhaps unconsciously.
“Yes—bringing my sheaves with
me,” said TIM, pointing to two other
newly-elected Irish Members, round
whom JoEY B. was hovering like a
maternal eagle.
Amerry group this, in strong contrast
to Gosch EN, fresh from his triumph in
St., George's, Hanover Square. “He
looks quite ghashly—eh, don't he?”
\º said GENT DAVIs, in an awed whisper.
“Such Larks!” “Why, when I was returned for #.
- - nington, I came in quite cock-a-whoop.”
Gosch EN didn't improve during moments of waiting. Wrung his hands
piteously, fumbled with his eyeglass, and looked unutterably miserable.
to -- '..." said PLUNKET, “looks as if we had come to bury him, instead of
applaud.
At signal from SPEAKER new Member advanced, amid storm of cheers from
Conservatives and hurricane of howls from Irish Members. Joseph GILLIs, his
face illumined with a strange weird #. yelled, “Yah! yah!” Then the
scene changed. GoscHEN took seat on Treasury Bench, º TIM HEALY, per-
sonally conducted by Joseph GILLIS, advanced to the table amid thunderous
cheers from the Irish Camp, and mocking laughter from the Conservatives. The
“Sheaves” came after, amid, renewed counter-demonstration, after which the
House quietly set itself to putting and answering questions, as if nothing par-
ticular had happened. Business done.—More talk on the Address.
. Friday-The long course of º on the Address flashed up to-night
in momentary flame. At outset Wind-Bag SExton nearly put it out altogether.
Began soon, after five and talked the House empty into the dinner hour. This
a little hard on Home Secretary, who followed. ough House otherwise .
Irish Members remained, and kept #. running commentary through his speech.
Getting on to midnight when HARcourt rose. Scene chang Members,
having leisurely dined, back †. ready to be amused or interested. HARcourt
in good form. Usual effect of irritating gentlemen opposite, who treated him
something after fashion Parnellites comport themselves during speech of Irish
Secretary. Howled and jeered, and more than once maliciously broke in upon
carefully constructed sentence. HARcourt had with great care, prepared im:
F. impromptu for peroration. Speaking of Conservative Policy in Ireland
e was to have said—“You are going the old way. It is a road strewn with
the carcases of many defeated administrations, and my belief is that your bones,
too, will whiten it.” This an echo of BRIGHT's style. BRIGHT might have
spoken it, and created a profound impression. House
would not have it from Hancount. Broºin with shout of
ribald laughter, and the carefully written-outimpromptu
on the notes not recited farther than the word “bones.”
Business done. — PARNELL's Amendment to Address
rejected by 352 votes against 246.
THE WOMAN AND THE LAW
(A True Story told before Mr. Justice Hawkins at the recent
Liverpool Assizes—vide Daily Telegraph, Feb. 8.)
In the criminal dock stood a woman alone
To be judged for her crime, her one fault to repair,
And the man who gave evidence sat like a stone,
With a look of contempt for the woman's despair!
For the man was a husband, who’d ruined a life,
And broken a heart he had found without flaw;
He demanded the punishment due from the wife
Who was only a Woman! whilst his was the Lawl
A terrible silence then reigned in the Court,
And the eyes of humanity turned to the dock,
Her head was bent down, and her sobbing came short,
And the gaoler stood ready, with hand on the lock
Of the gate of despair, that would open no more
When this wreckage of beauty was hurried away !
“Let me speak,” moan'd the woman, “my Lord, I
implore!” [say!”
“Yes, speak,” said the Judge. “I will hear what you
“I was only a girl when he stole me away
From the home and the mother who loved me too well;
But the shame, and the pain, I have borne since that day,
Not a pitying soul who now listens can tell!
There was never a promise he made but he broke;
The bruises he gave I have covered with shame;
Not a tear, not a pray’r, but he scorn’d as a joke!
He cursed at my chi dren, and sneered at my fame!
“The money I’d slav'd for and hoarded, he’d rob;
I have borne his reproaches when maddened with drink:
For a man there is pleasure, for woman a sob;
It is he who may slander, but she who must think!
But at last came the day when the Law gave release,
Just a moment of respite from merciless fate,
For they took him to prison, and purchased me peace
Till I welcomed him home like a wife—at the gated
“Was it wrong in repentance of Man to believe?.
It is hard to forget, it is right to forgive!
But he struck me again, and he left me to grieve
For the love I . lost, for the life I must live!
So I silently stole from the depths of despair
And slunk from dark destiny's chastening rod,
And I crept to the light, and the life, and the air,
From the town of the man, to the country of God!
“'Twas in solitude then that there came, to my soul,
The halo of comfort that sympathy casts—
He was strong. he was brave, and, though centuries roll,
I shall love that one man whilst *...* lasts!
Oh, my Lord, I was weak, I was wrong, I was poor!
I had suffered so much, through my journey of life.
Hear! the worst of the crime that is laid at my door–
I said I was widow, when really a wife!
“Here Istand to be judg’d, in the sight of the man
Who from purity took afrailwoman away.
Let him lookin my face, if he dare, if he can!
Let him stand up on oath, to deny what I say!
'Tis a story that many a wife can repeat,
From the day that the old curse of Eden began;
In the dread name of Justice, look down from your seat,
Come! sentence the Woman, and shelter the Man!”
A silence more terrible reigned than before
For the lip of the coward was cruelly curled ;
But the hand of the gaoler slipped down from the door
Made to shut this sad wanderer out from the world!
Said the Judge, “My poor woman, now listen to me!
Not one hour you shall stray from humanity's heart!
When thirty swift minutes have sped, you are free!
In the name of the Law—which is Mercy—depart!”
SINCE Lord RANDoIPH's retirement many of his ex-
friends have been “raising the cry, of “WoLFF.” . U
till now the High Commissioner to the SULTAN has st:
it like a “like a Lamb.” Will he return ?

CHAPTER I.-The Pot of Pomatum.
It was in this very month something over twenty years ago, that I,
BIGwig LoRRELL TREE, was sitting one night in my rooms at Cam-
bridge, grinding away at some mathematical work; I forget what.
Short, thick-set, and deep-chested, almost to deformity, with
--- sline arms longer than my
legs, heavy features, deep set
grey eyes, a low brow, covered
to my wide lips with a mop of
thick black hair —such was my
appearance nearly a quarter of
a century ago, and such, with
some modifications, is it to this
day. Ihave but one fault, I am
too fond of practical jokes.
Once I loved a girl very dearly,
and we were engaged. She
wished me to name the day of our
marriage. By way of answer I
took her to the glass and stood
side by side with her, and looked
into it. “Now,” I said, “if I
am the Beauty, who are you?”
That was when I was only
twenty, and I am much funnier
now. There was a knock at my
door. I had but one friend in
the world—I am good at guess-

he was, descended from an early gyptian priest of Isis. “Not
Cambridge man, but Oxford-hio–Isis,” he explained. He was the
sixty-sixth or six hundred and sixty-sixth (he did not seem sure as
to which) lineal descendant of this gentleman, who it appeared had some
quarrel with a lady of theatrical tastes. The name ºf the priest was
(so I understood) KILLIRRANKIE. .The theatrical lady seemed to have
made him º in some peculiar manner, and his son thereupon
took the name of WINDEX, which, as my friend reminded me, was
“Latin for 'venger.” He then became almost unintelligible about his
family in the time of “ChamPAGNE” (“ole German sportsman,” he
suggested), and CHARLEs THE Second, and ended by saying his father
made a fortune in beer. They had called themselves WINKLE, from
time immemorial, because, as he explained, they were descended from
“Chap at Isis—hic l–priest, you know, at Gunter's 1” He declared
that he had the whole blessed thing in the box, which I was to open
when his son was five-and-twenty. Then he burst into tears, told
me he had made a will leaving me that boy and his entire fortune,
and staggered out. -
The next morning my gyp informed me that he had found WINKLE
dead and incapable on the stairs. I attended the funeral, and twenty
years afterwards opened that box. It contained a letter addressed “To
my son Pongo, shºuld he live to open this casket,” a scroll of paper,
and what appeared to be the piece of a pot of pomatum. The letter
told his son to go in quest of the theatrical lady, who some thousand
ears before had made his ancestor disappear, and who was said to
ive for ever. The scroll of lº alſ in Greek and black-letter,
and is too long for transcription, but I may say it seemed to be thé
same incoherent story that poor WINKLE had tried to tell me with
his head, resting in the coal-scuttle so many years before. I think
he must have written it himself. The piece of the pot of pomatum
was self-explanatory. I give a sketch of it.
“Well, I suppose we must go,” said Bob-he had been a stable-
help, and in that character I had engaged him as Pongo's nurse—“I
suppose we must go.”
Bob, you are not worth a shilling,” I replied.
That day, three months we were on the water of the sea of Batter,
bound for Aquariumbar.
CHAPTER II.-The Halls of M'dme Too Sör.
How different are the scenes that I now have to tell, from that
which has just been told! Gone are the quiet College Rooms with
their picturesque et-Ceteras, and in their place rise several useful
visions. Were I writing this for a weekly pictorial newspaper, such
A tall man of abºut thirty, with remains of great personal ||
as the Illustrated or the Graphic, I might here describe a number of
incidents to give the artist a chance. For instance, I would go in
for a squall, and tell how a vast wave came with a wild rush of
boiling foam and made me cling for my life to the shroud, *: and
swept mestraight out from it like a flag in a gale. Then I could dabble
in some hunting sketches, and describe how two lions tried to eat
us, and how one was eaten himself for his pains. Would not this bean
...i. scene? I might tell how one of the lions managed to
get well on the bank with a crocodile in pursuit of him, half standing
and half swimming, and nipping, his hind leg. , I might add that
the lion roared till the air quivered with the sound, and then, with a
savage shrieking snarl, turned round and clawed hold of the croco-
dile's head. The crocodile with one of his º: torn out, shifted his
grip and the lion roaring with agony, laid his great hind claws in
the crocodile's comparatively soft throat and ripped it open as one
would rip up a glove. That ought to illustrate pretty well, ought
it not? Then, with the same end in view, Imight have a great deal
to say about the savages belonging to the early Egyptian sorceress-
how the girls kissed the men, how the men tortured strangers by
putting ared-hot soup tureen on their heads, and many othermatters
equally picturesque. "I admit the soup-tureen incident would have
had a peculiar charm for me, had I used it, as I could then have
described the victims as “going to pot.”
But, as this story will not be illustrated save by the sketch to
which I have already alluded, I need not go into all this, but may as
well come to my first interview with HEE-HEE-THE-DoNKEY-
THAT-will-HAve–HER-way. For short she was always called HEE.
Another name she had was AYESHAISH, pronounced Ass-Ish. Shelived
in the land of M'dme Tor-Sör, amongst the ºff. (the people
who deceive). I was introduced by an old man called BILLESTICKINGS
(Pongo's nurse, Bob, a gentleman scarcely worth a couple of six-
pences—always amusingly spoke of him as BILLY) to her presence.
HEE was seated, robed in a sort of peignoir. She was attended
by deaf mutes.
“There,” said HEE, as BILLY left us, “he has gone, the white-
headed old fool! Ah! how little does a man acquire in life. He
athereth it up like water, but like water it runneth through his
fingers; and yet, if his hands be but wet as though with dew, behold
a generation of fools call out, ‘See, is he not a wise man!’”
rom this I saw at once that the lady was a constant reader of the
works of MARTIN FARQUBARTUPPER; and, on further investigation,
discovered she had for several, years kept a commonplace-book.
Under these circumstances, I will not repeat my conversations with
her on various occasions, as they might become tedious. However,
it is only right to say that, having heard her repeat, with a somewhat
foreign accent, “IRara aris in terris nigroque simillima cygno,” and
“Turra, rurrets, Turret,” I became convinced that she was also a
proficient in the dead languages, and quite qualified to be the Head
of Girton or Lady Margaret's. Evidently to impress me, she showed
me some reflections on a table in a darkened corner of the room. I
saw, as distinctly as ever I saw anything in my life, Pongolying on a
bench in another apartment. A young lady was watching over him
with a look of infinite tenderness, and with her chesnut locks falling
on to her right shoulder. -
.." This is called the Kam-Orrers-Kurrer!” HEE cried, with a bell-
like laugh. “Hast thou aught to ask of me, O YEw TREE?”
“Aye, one thing, O Ass-ish ' " I said, boldly. “I would gaze
upon thy form.”
“Thou shalt, my PLANETREE.”
She lifted her white and rounded arms—never had I seen such
arms before—and slowly, very slowly, withdrew some fastener
beneath her hair. Then all of a sudden the long bath-like wrappin
fell to the ground. I gazed at her and I do not exaggerate-shran
back blinded and amazed. I had heard of the beauty of circus, acro-
batic beings, and now I saw it. She was a mass of splendid spangles,
with a deep broad coat of gold which fitted tightly to the figure
from the neck to the knees. Though the face beforeme was that of
a young woman of certainly not more than thirty years, in perfect
health and with the improving flush of rouge upon her cheeks, yet
it had stamped upon it a look of intense experience. I felt instinct-
ively that, given a trapeze, she would jump for several miles.
“Now,” said HEE, after she had resumed her covering, “wouldstthou
see some of the wonders of this place, O, SHERRY and Port TREE?”
I bowed, and in a moment followed her to some side passages
where were some figures covered with sheets.
“Uplift the cloths, O my CHRISTMAs TREE,” said Ass-Ish, but when
Iput out my hand to do so I drew it back again. It seemed like
sacrilege, and to speak the truth I was awed by the solemnity of the
place and the presences before me. Then, with a little laugh at my
fears, she drew them herself, discovering the life-like presentment
of the most eminent personages. There were monarchs and heroes
of all ages, and in the quaintest costumes...They stood like ghosts
in their calm, if somewhat eccentric attitudes. , Nearly all the
figures—so masterly was the art, with which they had been treated
—were as perfect as the day on which they had been erected, in some
cases, no doubt, years and years before.

“Behold the mysteries of M'dmeToo Sör,” she exclaimed. “Look
not so frighted, Q my TREE-Goose. I tell thee Ideal not in magic—
there is no such thing. And now for some more light. Thou wilt
presently understand.”
In a moment some of the mutes seized the oldest of the figures,
and made them flame. . They burned like warworks /
“I promised thee a strange sight, my Good-As-BEERBoHM TREE,”
laughed Ass–ISH, whose nerves did not seem to be affected, and
immediately joined in a wild can-can with the mutes.
Qverwhelmed at the extraordinary spectacle, I fell into a swoon,
and saw no more!
CHAPTER III.-The House made of Glass.
WHEN I came to myself I found that HEE had made arrangements
with Pongo and Bob (rather twelve pence-sive) toyisit a new place not
many miles from the land of M'dmeToo Sör, and that we were even
then threading the streets of houses of those long since dead. And here
my pen fails me. To give a story of measurements and details of the
various courts would only be wearisome. . It is enough to say I saw
where ancient Romans, and ancient Greeks, and ancient Egyptians,
had dwelt, leaving records on the walls thousands of years ; Never
had I seen anything more marvellous. There were statues too hewn
from marbles so pure and white, that I could not name them without a
catalogue. Suddenly she called upon us to ascend, what seemed to
be a huge spiral staircase. We followed, clinging for dear life to the
steps until we had reached a hideous height.
'Come!” cried HEE, once more discarding her peignoir, and seizing
a huge, pole, that Bob (who said he was “as #; as a couple of
tizzies”) had carried for her, trod lightly and firmly across the frail
bridge, and in another second was standing safe upon a heaving rope!
Oh, the horror of the sight! I have always hated a great É.
but never before did I fully realise the dread horrors of which such a
position is capable. Oh, the sickening sensation of that yieldin
rope–-I grew dizzy, and thought I must fall. My spirit crept, but
passed over in º Then came Pongo's turn, and though he
looked rather queer, he came across like a rope-dancer, and I heard
her say, “Bravely done, my love, bravely done! The old Greek
spirit lives in thee yet!”
And, now only poor. Bob (better than a clown, as he was worth
three “Joeys”), remained, but he was so quaintly comic in his
hideous terror that the fun of the thing proved a welcome relief to
the varying humours of the unconventional entertainment.
Shortly afterwards we descended in safety on the other side, and
º ourselves in some park-like grounds. It had now grown quite
ark.
...Where are we now?” asked Pongo.
“This place, with its grºunds, my KILLIKRANKLE, people name the
House of Glass. Listen!”
We heard a grinding or crushing noise—a noise so awe-inspiring,
that we all trembled, and Bop (with a Robert-like jerk) sank to his
knees—and then there flamed out an awful cloud or pillar of fire,
like a rainbow, many-coloured, and like the lightning bright.
“O-oh '' we exclaimed, astounded at the wonderful sight. This
magnificent display was several times repeated. Now we saw green,
now blue, now red coloured light.
“The works of fire are over,” said HEE, at length, “and the time
has come for my last feat.”
She sank upon a seat, and covered herself from head to foot in the
pergnour.
“Qh, look!-look?—look ''” shrieked Bob (white as silyer), in a
shrill falsetto of terror, his eyes nearly º: out of his head, and
- foam upon his lips. “Look.'—look 1–
look / She’s disappearing !”
I never saw anything like it! When
we removed the peignoir, only the seat
remained. HEET had completely dis-
appeared.
*The Wanishing Lady!” shouted
Pongo.
And overcome with the extremity of
horror, we too fell on the sandy floor of
that dread place and swooned away.

We got back safely to Cambridge,
and that is the end of this history, so
/|far as it concerns science and the outside
world. But I feel that the other end is
not reached yet. A story that began

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 105
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
No. XVIII.-AN AMATEUR LADY COMPOSER.
THE Lady Composer is usually born in, affluent circumstances.
Displaying early a taste for music, she quickly outshines the young
ladies of her acquaintance in
the dexterous manipulation
of the pianoforte. Fondos,
brilliant morceaux, almost
anything in the shape of a
moto perpetuo, are easily
caught º her when yet
quite a child, and executed
to the undisguised admiration
of her friends. Her addic-
tion to the keyboard is a
matter of surprise to her
#.; Whereas most girls
ad their music lessons, and
scamper through their hours
of practice, the embryo Lady
Composer will, on the con-
\ trary, take a delight in
reading difficult sonatas, and
is never so happy as when
rooted to the music-stool.
Musicians will, however, re-
mark that she rarely masters
a single piece ºl;
while º: h a
dozen, and when asked their
opinion of her playing,
refrain only out of politeness
- from embodying in so many
words the irresistible conviction that aſliberal use of the loud pedal
covers a multitude of short-comings.
As she grows up her ear begins to be tickled by what seem to her
to be unusual harmonies in the music of modern composers. Having
been accustomed to play the works of the Great Masters mechani-
cally, it does not occur to her that what happens to captivate her
fancy in a German “Album,” or a A. English ballad, has
been presented over and overjºi. generally in a better form
—by classical writers. She will fix upon some passage that has
enchanted her in the accompaniment—for instance—of a song, and
dwell lovingly upon it. Probably she need not scruple to reiterate it
to her heart's content, as the parents of the Lady Composer, even if
listening, will often be incapable of discriminating between one
musical sound and another. By degrees her little circle begins to
regard her as a connoisseur in musical matters, for she can tell you
by ear what key you are playing in, and passes judgment on the
‘‘ originality” or the reverse of contemporary music. So transcen-
dant is the scientific aspect of her genius (in the opinion of her
friends) that not uncommonly she will be asked to play harmonies,
as contradistinguished from melodies. -
“Give us some of those lovely chords !” her admirers cry: and
then the gifted one will either imply that she does not feel equal to
so much exertion, or (if in a good humour) will simper and say that
what she proposes to play is merely a little scrap from Schum ANN,
BRAHMs, or $. that had struck her as rather quaint /
Gradually she learns to introduce and round off these precious
harmonies—plucked ruthlessly from their context—with little im-
provisations of her own, and, as the last are always of the simplest,
they are invariably the most applauded. So that it is not surprising
that she conceives at last the idea of “composing ” something on her
own account. To the evolution of a waltz she first directs her
attention. . She does indeed produce something, on the lines of that
approved form of dance-music, insomuch as it consists of several
numbers in 3-4 time and a coda.
Her friends are delighted. But, to do her justice, she is not satis-
fied. She cannot help feeling that her principal motif is perilously
like one of WALDTEUFEL's best known melodies. She therefore tries
again; and this time her heart tells her she is successful. In her
second effort, she has merely }. upon one of WALDTEUFEL's
least-known melodies. . When her father and mother drive down in
their carriage and pair to the publishers', the Lady Composer and
her MS. occupy the back seat. On emerging from the shop, for,
after all, it is a shop and not a Temple of Art, where an arrangement
for the publication of her waltz has been made with, the courteous
music-seller, who may have pleasantly, condescended to accept, an
invitation to dinner to meet a titled amateur musician, she feels that
neither she, nor her “works,” ought ever to take a back seat again.
- * + * * # *
Even Lady Composers marry; do they not indeed bring extra
attraction to fortify the spell of mere beauty, worth, and position?
She weds in due course a “substantial” man, not brilliant it
may beg, but, one “clever person” is generally supposed to be a |
respectable allowance in any family. A wedding eventually takes
place, and it is somehow impressed on the bridegroom that he
is a very fortunate fellow. By this time his wife's music commands
a large sale; for side by side with the indulgence of her artistic
Wº. she has learnt to develope useful business capabilities.
Although ignorant of thorough-bass, she has nevertheless an acute
ear which seldom allows her to be betrayed into very glaring faults.
The programme of a ball, given in the fashionable world, is not com-
plete without contributions from her pen, and humbler writers are
invited by the publishers to adapt the refrains of her ballads for
dancing purposes. The “‘Kiss me To-night !” Polka”, being, as
the title-page announces, “transcribed by HANs WURST" from her
successful song, is, strange to say, even more popular than the
original. If the modest Herr WURST does not make a fortune by it
he does not complain; and indeed this, humble, musician is content
to take a trifling honorarium for his share in the work, the glory of
which he leaves to original genius.
. In order to be beyond the reach of malicious tongues, and imper-
vious to sneers which envy embittered by failure might level at her,
she even dares to challenge criticism in the higher walks of her
beloved Art. “If I can produce, and cause to be performed an
orchestral piece, who is there but will recognise that, while generally
content to tread the more flowery paths of light composition, I am
nevertheless as capable of serious and concentrated effort as my more
pretentious rivals?” Such may be the substance of her reflections
.#she reads one morning a somewhat slighting notice of her latest
eIIusion.
. Fired by ambition, and #. by an unpleasant criticism that is
in itself nevertheless more flattering than the cursorily polite reviews
that she has hitherto been favoured with—e.g., “This is a very
pretty song,” “A dainty melody,” and the like, under the heading
“New Music”—the Lady Composer now begins in earnest to compile
an orchestral work. It is produced at a large concert, and the
talented authoress is “At home” afterwards. It is discussed in
quite a friendly way * the experts, and who among the professional
critics present at this festivity can have the heart to say lºng of
a mere amateur but what is encouraging and complimentary P. She
is a lady too, whom they all like so much, and about whom the good-
natured fellows, agree there is really no necessity to express any
unfavourable opinion. Next morning the piece is described as em-
bodying “considerable inventive .#. The leading theme is
“gracious,” though the mode of its treatment “betrays technical
inexperience.” On the whole the notices are decidedly laudatºry;
and yet, oddly enough, the publishers allege “depression in trade,’
“bad season,” “no sale for this kind of work,” as sufficient reasons
for their being compelled, greatly to their regret, to decline under-
taking the publication of a work which the Lady–Composer feels sure
would make the fortune of any Musical Firm. However, she is not ||
without tact, and in a short time the great work is forgotten by all
except herself and her musical friends, who are frequently expressing
their sorrow at her not having brought it out, words and score com-
plete, in one volume.
Her husband is a remarkably sensible man. He does not shine
dazzlingly, but he gives a very clear and steady light, which ulti-

DEAR MR. PUNCH,
I Notige that Mr. Dixon, a Senior Wrangler, has written
a letter to the Jurist giving hints on “the Art of being Examined.”
Now I’ve never wrangled myself, but I flatter myself I have been
through double as many'examinations in; the course of my career as
Mr. Dixon has, and I can add a lot of particulars which will be
found tremendously useful by candidates for scholarships or honours
at the Universities, for the Army, Civil Service, and so on. .
The very first thing to do, when #. are going to be examined, is
to eat a particularly hearty breakfast. This gives you confidence.
On arriving at the examination hall, try and secure a place between
two clever-looking (and if possible short-sighted) candidates, from
whom you will be able to copy freely. Also remember, if you see
the Examiner himself anywhere about, to smile at him in a genial
way, and, if you get near enough, **i. agreeable by asking
him what he thinks of the question of Home Rule, or the condition
of Europe, or something brilliant of that sort. He is sure to be
gratified, and as Examiners are “always human,” sometimes even
painfully so, it is not a bad thing to gratify them. . Recollect that
every Examiner has a “personal equation,” which it is your business
to find out. There are some who lº relish being slapped on the
back º and asked “how t º were the day after to-
morrow?”. On the only occasion, when I have personally adopted
this system, it did not succeed; in fact, it ended in my being ex-
pelled from the room forcibly, and summoned at the Police Court for
an unprovoked assault. This, however, is a mere detail. The plan
is an admirable one, if you get hold of the sort of man who likes it.
From various incidents in my own experience I should not be in-
clined to recommend the plan of scribbling lists of the Jewish Kings
or the “Furies and Fates,” on one's shirt-cuffs, or taking in a
LIDDELL and Scott's Greek Lexicon, wrapped up in a brown-paper
arcel, on the pretext that it, contains your lunch. It is a much
etter plan to plead illness at the beginning of the examination, then
take the paper out with you, and go home and write out the correct
answers your books, and slip in at the last moment and deposit
your answers among all the others. It no doubt requires some
adroitness and “sang froid” to execute this manoeuvre properly,
Shortly after trying it º in an important examination at Oxford
I was politely requested to quit the University, and migrated to
Durham, but I consider that this was entirely due to the Oxford
authorities envying my superior abilities., They are, you know, yery
Conservative there, and dislike genius and originality of all kinds.
“Virá Voce '' is an ordeal which is always very embarrassing.
There is, I am afraid, absolutely no way of getting through it satis-
factorily except the clumsy old plan of really acquiring the know-
ledge which enables one to answer the questions asked. I have
sometimes thought it would be a good idea, when one sits down at
the table gº the Examiner, to take a º note out of
1n
one's pocket (in mistake for a handkerchief), and wave it gently to
and fro, as a hint to the Examiner of the reward which * #.

never tried it myself, chiefly because I have never had a ten-pound
note to wave. But I can i. recommend it to anybody who
likes experimenting, and is in search of novel sensations.
At the examination “In Sanctis Theologis” at Cambridge (at
which University I entered under an assumed name, after a some-
what hurried departure from º I was “vivá voced” by a
spectacled and †. innocent-looking Examiner, so that I
thought it would be quite safe to pin a paper containing the chief
eventsin Ecclesiastical History on my hat, and place it infront of me on
the table. My answers were admirable. The innocent-looking
Examiner, at the end seemed quite pleased, and said, “You have
answered so well, Mr. —, that you almost seem to have learned
the subject by heart.” I #. a modest, yet winning smile in #P.
“Are you quite sure you have not learned it by art instead?” he
went on, and made a sudden grab across the table at my hat, with
results which it, is needless to go into, Suffice it to say that I
shortly afterwards entered as a student at Göttingen, where I now
am, and that I am sure these few hints, if received in a proper
irit, will be of much service to those about to submit themselves to
the ordeal of examination—the curse of the present century.
Yours, knowingly, A. DoDGKINs.

THE SPEAKER SLAYING THE JABBER-TALK. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17.
House of Commons, Monday, Night, February 14,-Came upon
the Markiss just now in a retired corner of the robing-room mopping
his eyes with cambric handkerchief, whilst his stalwart form was
shaken with sobs. A piteous thing to see a grown man in tears.
“What’s the matter, Markiss?” I asked softly. “Has AsHMEAD-
BARTLETT resigned, or is RANDOLPH coming back?”
“Neither,” he answered, * down his emotion. “You are
on the wrong tack altogether. These are tears of proud satisfaction.
You weren't in the House just now, or you would have heard BRA-
BournE's noble words. “I confess,’ he said, “my confidence in
Her Majesty's Government is not yet exhausted.’ here's a high-
souled feeling,” sniffed the Markiss, having recourse to his handker-
chief, and glancing askance at DERBY, who passed by determinedly
not seeing his noble friend. “As long as BRABourne stands by us
we are safe and strong. RANDoIPH may go, DUNRAVEN may follow
him; but secure in the unexhausted confidence of BRABOURNE, we
will withstand GLADsroNE and all his works.”
The Markiss, straightening his bowed shoulders, thrust the hand-
kerchief in his pocket, shook his coal-black crest, and strode back to
the House of Lords another man.
In the Commons a miscellaneous sort of a night, with Scotch Home
Rule on by way of change. At question time HARcourt interposing
with lofty sarcasm in veiled criticism of SPEAKER's management of
business, Right Hon. Gentleman suddenly turned, and snapped at
him to the uncontrollable delight of Conservatives. Later, HALDANE, a
new Member, introduced thin edge of the wedge of new system of
closure. EssLEMONT, dº propos of boots and the Address, proposed
to raise discussion on question of Scotch leases. One or two Scotch
Members having joined in the entertainment, HALDANE rose, pro-
tested against waste of time, declared he would be no. F. to it,
and j out of the House. This demonstration did not affect
course of affairs. Members having prepared their speeches, deter-
mined to deliver them, though the House nearly ...; BARCLAY,
finding his opportunity, also, found himself, provided , with an
audience numbering eleven, all told. That evidently inadequate to
importance of speech. Accordingly prefaced his address by calling
attention of SPEAKER to numbers present. A Count called. Members
dropped in, and, finding that it was “only BARCLAY,” swarmed out
again. And this is how we do business in the House of Commons!
Business done.—None. -
Tuesday.—Towards eight o'clock the monotony of a sitting ex-
ceptionally dull even in these times, broken by hue and cry. The
Lord Advocate was wanted. Where was the Lord Advocate F. Till
he appeared on the scene the business of the nation must stand still,
“like Joshua's Sun at Jerusalem,” as GENT-DAVIs quoted. Through
the sitting things had gone badly for business. Fifty questions on
the paper, and before they were reached, two discussions and one
division on private bills. Then CAMERON resumed debate on Address,
endeavouring to give matters a turn, aside from Ireland by intro:

on rising had been met by an attempt to Count Out... Members came
in to make House, and straightway went off to finish their dinner.
Amongst absentees was the Lord Advocate, and MAHONEY, fixing
fiery eye on vacant seat demanded his head on a charger. “The
article,” as JoEY B. would call it, not being forthcoming, he moved
the adjournment of the debate, J. G. B. seconding the motion. What
the Irish Members had to do with the Scotch business not quite
clear; but here they were, and where was the Lord Advocate? ºr
Ministerial emissaries flying all over the House found him at last
sitting in the dining-room, eating soup, whilst the House of Com-
mons was ablaze with excitement. Pale as death and trembling in
every limb, the Lord Advocate was haled along the passages into the
House. Leaning for support upon the table, he explained how it was
“all the fault of the waiter.” He had, in the interests of Scotland,
ordered a modest refection. The waiter had gone away and forgotten
- He, meanwhile unconscious of the storm-clouds gathering in
the House, had sat drumming his fingers on the dinner-table, wish-
ing that night or the waiter would come. Upon him burst the panting
emissaries, and just when the waiter had remembered him, and was
bringing in the soup, he was summoned to the bar of angry House of
Commons.
A pitiful sight! a dinnerless and apologetic Lord Advocate snatch-
ing at the straw of a forgetful waiter in order to save a drowning
reputation. House would not accept the waiter theory. Divided on
motion for adjournment, and only thereafter the Lord Advocate, still
dinnerless and increasingly apologetic, stated his case.
Business done.—None.
Thursday.--When I saw CAVENDISH BENTINCK speaking from
corner seat below º at hour of private business, was certain
that something would happen. BENTINck usually reserves himself
till after dinner. Towards midnight, when he has had the oppor-
tunity of rumpling his hair and crumpling his shirt-front, then’s
his time for addressing the House. This afternoon, as early as half-
ast four, introduced himself to House as “an old Cumberland
W.A. and talked about Ambleside Railway Bill. This looked
ominous. But when, half-an hour later, whilst daylight still fell
softly on Palace Yard, ADDIson, Q.C., with a seraphic smile on his
face and a flower in his button-hole, leisurely walked up the floor
arrayed in full evening dress, the portents were complete. House
cheered uproariously, startling the smile from ADDIsoN's face, and
almost shaking the flower out of his button-hole. Could not make
out in the least what it was all about... Was going out to dinner at
eight o'clock; thought it would save time and candles if he dressed
in the cool of the afternoon. Why should House think it funny?
Can't say. Perhaps it was the wondrous width and whiteness of
the shirt-front; possibly it was a sense of incongruity between the
blameless flower and the learned Q.C.; probably it was the smile of
deep content which illumined his countenance. However, it be,
cheers and laughter filled the House till ADDIsoN, Q.C., blushing like
a peony, with hastened steps made for a back Bench.
After this, DII.LwyN rose to move the Adjournment, meaning to
raise debate on Jury Packing in Dublin. John DILLON, mysteriously
escaped from the Dock, appeared with speech. SPEAKER spoiled
- fun by ruling DILLwyN out of order. . H.
SMITH, who had been sitting on edge of Bench,
ready for emergencies, jumped up, and moved to
take all time of the House for Procedure Rules.
HENRY RICHARD pleaded for exception of Tues-
day, so that DILLWYN might disestablish Church
in Wales. SMITH tenderly refused. Long de-
bate. House divided. Ministerial Motion carried.
PARNELL next moved to except Wednesday.
Another division. Original Resolution agreed to.
Then excitement broke out in fresh place.
John DILLoN proposed to make his speech pre-
pared for DILLwyN's motion on resuming debate
on the Address. SPEAKER ruled him out of order.
More squabbling. Another division, after which
Cox blandly proposed to discuss the general dis-
tress among working-men. Three speeches, then
SPEAKER put on extinguisher. The Closure at
last! the Parnellites fought it tooth and nail;
Divisions taken at every turn. But Closure car-
ried and Address agreed to.
Business done.—Deliverance by Closure.
Friday.—Been noticed through the week with
p. apprehension that familiar figure absent

terial side. It was thence that “old Cumberland
Member” CAvendish BENTINck spokeyesterday.
From day to day an eager succession of Members
have struggled for the place.

early to get the seat, “that there mayn't be some virtue in it. Read

talked himself out, Our Chief would stride in and smite the listening
senate with admiring wonder.
Finished the oration yesterday. Was to have delivered it to-night;
when lo, an important Radical playing tit for tat with the SPEAKER's
prohibition of DILLwyn's motion of Thursday, places on paper notice
of motion dealing with subject. According to SPEAKER's ruling,
Our Chief's opportunity is snatched from him, and his speech worth-
less. He comes down to-night to learn the worst from the SPEAKER's
lips, and having heard it, now sits with arms folded, headbent, a

MR. PUNCH'S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.
NorBING, as is well known, renders a young man (or for the matter of that,
a young woman) so deservedly beloved as the practice of repeating in public, a
poem of respectable proportions. Unfortunately
the dearth of really effective pieces for recitation
obliges many Reciters to repeat themselves as
often as their poems, and it is with a desire to
remedy this inconvenience, that Mr. Punch has
commissioned one of his stud of poets (who has
been eating his head off for months). to knock
him off a few sweet little things, which would
be likely to “tell” in a drawing-room. -
One of these productions, is given here, with
a few simple directions by the author, for which
there will be no addition º:
It is a fine example in the Infantine Pathos
vein, and is calculated to moisten the temperature
of almost any room, provided that the instructions
- are religiously followed. It is particularly recom-
mended to unmarried ladies under forty with
tears in their voices, and to small children with any genius for sentiment.
The Reciter is supposed, then, to be on the hearth-rug, facing the audience.
You wait for the buzz to subside with your eyes modestly cast down, and then,
as if it had just occurred to you; you raise them, suddenly and say, distinctly
but somewhat apologetically, “Filial little Frank!” . That is the title, of course,
and now, after a short, pause, you're off, remembering to counterfeit the
accents of a very young child in the first line:—
“Mummy, where's Pupsy gone to?... I want him so!” said the child,
With his angel-face. and his clustering curls; and his eyes so blue and so mild.
(This is the description of the child—not of “Pupsy,” and should be spoken in
your natural tone.)
“For many a day, has he been away, and the very last time he was seen,
Was % Mºss, when he left in the van, that was sent for him by the
UEEN
(Raise your voice at “Queen” with a touch of innocent delight at the condescen-
sion. ... For the next Stanza you should adopt a passionate tremolo.)
Can the Mother inform her darling, that the parent he thus deplores,
Has been charged with pocketing pickles at the Army and Navy Stores?
He was somewhat inclined to absence of mind—which might have accounted for
that, (Change again here to a grieved solemnity.) -
But not for the jar of preserved caviare, and the collared brawn in his hat! .
(Now you are to personate the Mother and her suppressed emotion—you can do
this either by rolling your eyes, or twisting your handkerchief.)
“Oh, hush, my own little FRANKIEl Pupsy's Her Mºjº. Guest,
And, while she desires his attendance, he's bound to obey her behest.”
(Now the child again; with a slow smile of dawning intelligence—you may find
- this difficult—practise it.
“Then, if I do as he, will the QUEEN invite me, to go to Papa and her Palace
see?” Bend your head here in choked resignation.)
And the Mother sighs, “’Yes,”—for she dare not confess the assumption is based
on a fallacyl
Slight pause; continue in brisker vein as narrator.)
But mystified FRANKIE pondered—What had his father done
To deserve such an invitation ? he questioned many a one;
And from all he heard, the child inferred—if he stoned a suburban train,
Or did anything naughty, then, if he was caught, he would soon see his Pupsy
again! (Brisker still for neart Stanza.)
So he wandered down to the railway, and there, on the platform, he came
To a curious kind of contrivance—I can't remember its name.

ut there is a slit in the middle of it, and when you’ve inserted your coin,
Some toffee you get, or a mild cigarette—whiche'er you experience joy in.
Work up the nert Stanza to climax of earcitement.)
Here was the means before him of rejoining his parent at last!
And tº: thought made his eyes shine brighter, and his breath come thick and
ast:
'Twas a desperate feat such an engine to cheat, but the prize l he had centred
his soul in it.
He’d a long piece of string, and—most fortunate thing—a penny possessing a
hole in it! - (Here you go back to your quieter style.)
Well; he fastened the string to his penny, and again and again it dropped,
Till the toffee was all exhausted—and then the machinery stopped.
And the fraud was perceived—but the child was relieved, having never intended
to cadge his treat.
But B. 32, said, “I’d recommend you to reserveyour remarks for the Magistrit!”
(Now comes your great chance; raise your right fore-finger and lower. vour
- voice. Speuk rather in sorrow than in anger.
Alas, for his childish fancies 1 the Bench was cruel and cold,
It did not believe little FRANKLE and the artless tale that he told!
His highminded deed was put down to the greed of a little unprincipled urchin,
And a certain official, directed to swish all, was ordered to bring a new birch in 1
(You finish with a rapterpression—as of one who sees a vision in the chandelier.)
So FRANKIE failed, for they sent him home—but will it be always thus?
Ah, no! he, too, will be fetched one day in the royal omnibus:
And a cry of joy from the radiant boy will echo in
Holloway yard,
(Child's voice again, with a tender exaltation.)
“Oh, Pupsy see . . . it is really me! I am in for a
fortnight’s ‘hard l’”
If a young lady of even moderate talent does not sit
down in a sea of congratulation after this, Mr. Punch's
É. is not the great pathetic writer he fondly imagines
imself—which is absurd.
WHAT with the hideous public-house left standing at
an adjacent corner, the steps at St. Martin's Church un-
removed, and the unsightly blank displayed at the rear
of the National Gallery, the Authorities seem inclined to
make, a pretty §. of patchwork of Hemming's Row;
but it is to be hoped Mr. WHITMORE will not º: go the
thread of the discussion he introduced on Thursday last.
Dealing with such, a central and suggestive locality as
Hemming's Row, the First Commissioner should be re-

Each squeezing a cluster of grapes down his throttle.
Of course we were ne'er such a couple of noddies.

Until by fermenting, for tippling made good,
And a life of long years in the goatskin or wood;
But these Iowa topers have hit on a plan
Which I think you will own is a topper, old man.
To dodge the harsh law that prohibits strong drink,
They make grapes—indiarubber—and what do you think?
Why they fill them, oh, not with crude juice of the vine,
But with genuine full-bodied, odorous Wine !
They sell these in bunches and boxes, you see,
And a bibulous soul, on the strictest Q. T.,
Can take them about like his weed or his grub,
And so be independent of wine-shop or pub."
That’s something like grape-sucking. I propose—”
But already the god of the rubicund nose
Was off to the West, followed close by SILENUs.
They’ve not dropped a line, but I fancy, between us,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February, 21.-GLADSTQNR back
again to-day after strategic absence during inconvenient debate on
Address. Full of life and health and
spirits. Met HENEAGE cruising about
the Lobby, looking more indefinite than
ever as to his age. Found HARTINGTON
and CBAMBERLAIN on the Front Bench.
Came up so briskly a moment's apprehen-
sion that he meant to chevy them off.
On the contrary, shook hands with them
cordially. In fact beaming with benevo-
lence all round. So affected GosCHEN
that, making his first speech from Tory
Treasury Bench, he was full of tender
allusions to “my Right Hon. friend the
Member for Midlothian.” Not since poor
NoFTHcote was here has the House
heard this style of address bandied across
the table, GLADSTONEhimself didn't use
it with reference to GoscBEN; but Gos-
CHEN made up the average of
frequency.
In the seraphic humour which
enveloped his spirit, GLADSTONE
would not say a hard thing of
the Ministry. At the same time
(certainly en parenthèse) he
brought out curious position of
affairs. Last time Closure before
the House, Conservatives opposed
it tooth and nail. It was the
end of freedom of speech. It was
the gagging of Parliament; and

the Conservatives as a Government were bringing it forward.
“After to-day's meeting at the Foreign Office,” HARCOURT said
“I believe they have convinced themselves they were the authors o
the proposal.”
Should GLADSTONE, as Leader of the Opposition, dwell upon this
embarrassing fact? . Should he adopt the tactics of the Conservative
Opposition in 1882?, Perish the thought! “He would do every-
thing he could to help the Government to make the New Rules of
Procedure effective.”
W. H. SMITH deeply affected. A sob passed along the Treasury
Bench, and died away in a remote corner below Gangway, where

half-dozen look in casually, sit five or ten minutes, and so home.
To those assembled, DERby opened his Budget. Appears that India,
thrice blessed with stars, and gun-firing, and banquets, on account
of Jubilee, is to have 25,000 criminals let loose upon it, in further
recognition of the joyful event. DERBy thinks honest people won't
like this. GRAND CRoss assures him nothing would please them
better. So says Lytton. Ditto says RIPON, and DERBY goes home,
musing on these things. Fancy matter will not rest here.
“Why should England wait?” DERby asks. “We have our
Jubilee; why not have our Criminals?”
DERby tells me he was led to take up matter by the receipt of
petition signed “Missis SIREs.” Son BILL, in trouble again, with
many other family connections and acquaintances. Missis SIKES
wants to know why Oriental custom shouldn't be extended in their
favour? Petition to that end now being extensively signed. In-

we stroll together across to House of Commons.

Friday.—No one thinking of ScLATER-Booth when he rose just
now from a backBench behind Ministers. “Here, high and dry, he has
been cast, like a piece of seaweed after a storm.” (That's OSBQRNR
MoRGAN's way of putting it. Osborne MoRGAN is, I believe, a Bard
in his own country, and sometimes drops into poetry.in ours.)
ScLATER-Booth not at all like a piece of seaweed. High, in manner
of the magisterial order, he has truly been, and always dry. True,
also, łł. is stranded as far as t e tide setting in for office is
concerned. Not the sort of man of which even Conservatives make
Ministers to-day, though highly popular at one time, RANDOLPH
has changed all that. With RANDolph's rising sun, the SCLATER:
Booth orb has gradually sunk, and is finally set. (The Bard again.)
Has accepted his fate without public complaint; ºnly to-night,
seeing his opportunity, snapped at it. Not prepared, he said, for
such betrayal of yoracious appetite for the Closure ºn part of
Ministers. Five of them sat with him on Committee last year, and
they then displayed no suchyoracity, Talking of appetite reminded
Scººter-Booth that it was dinner-time. So, having fired this shot,
he marched out of House, leaving his former colleagues voracious,
but not ashamed. Business done—Debate on Closure.

And op en-

like one who

While thus the Baronet spake on, with husky voice and low:—
“Last night you saw me point de vice, in fashion's nicest mould ;
A shrivelled husk of self-respect this morning you behold,
Who’d gladly take his leave of life, and, if you have it handy,
A dash of seltzer-water in a claret-glass of brandy.
“I told you that the wine we drank—and fast your praises ran—
Was a sort of Indian sherry from the Isles of Andaman;
I don't believe the vine would grow precisely in that zone.
The wine was made in Bermondsey—a vintage quite my own.
“Now for awhile the moral scales have fallen from my eyes,
The hot remorse of ‘coppers’ melts the adamant of lies;
And hear, FITz-JogyNS, while I sketch, succinctly as I can,
The facilis descensus of a shifty gentleman.
“Well-born, well-bred, I launched in life with dreams of a career
That need not owe to favour what it ne'er should lose by fear;
But weighted with the poet-pow'r that sways imagined scenes,
And high desires that could not brook the limit of my means.
“‘Above Suspicion' I had made the motto of my life;
With mutual credit I’d have run away with Częsa R's wife;
And shady things, as done by me, a Cato might disarm,
Their very shadiness acquired a cool and mystic charm.

But, calm in all contingencies, ’twere false to say I fell.

“Barr'd by involuntary schisms from mixing with my peers,
I found kind hearts and simple faith in friends of humbler spheres;
Andoh, be sure you’re downward bound when you begin to prize
The moral virtues of the friends whose manners you despise.
“There is a charm that lingers still about this social wreck,
Fair flow'rs of speech and courtly blooms the corpse of honour deck,
And so permissive are my ways, that, on the lowest ramp,
I half persuade myself that I am really not a scamp.
“I’ve dish'd, a high-horse Cavalier, the writter's soaring hope;
With Indian craft I’ve shot the moon on the pacific slope;
By force or fraud to one and all the destin'd moment came
To curse my charming manners and revile my ancient name.
''. As waltz-worn spinsters closer cling to waning hopes of marriage,
As baby-laden ladies steer straight for a smoking-carriage,
As authors haunt the friend in need who reads their first romance,
So round the titled carcase flock the vultures of finance.

A standing tasting-order for all sorts of curious wine,
A round of brief Directorships on Companies, where need

Where booted Lords on common ground with Belted artists meet,
Where Lion cubs of comic strain accost the shady City, -
And nothing much is known against a few of the Committee.
...But chiefly in exploiting wines I’ve shown my practis'd skill,
The Mithridates of the docks, impervious to ill,—
Yet deem not that the gentle tout can duly earn his bread
Unless above the face of brass he wear the flinty head.
“And mine, methought, were proof indeed. I've quaffed the live-

I’ve drunk Sauer Staut without a wink beside the Castled Rhine,
And whelmed the storied scene in floods of Bauelnotterwein.

THE MODERN SINTRAM AND HIS COMPANION.
A Fragment freely adapted from De la Motte Fouqué.
BUT ever in the rear, now seeming somewhat shrunken, but anon
swelling to terrible size, lurked, marked or unmarked, persistent as
a sleuth-hound on the trail, that boding figure of the diverse names, in
whom was concentred the Ruler's latest fear.
“Givethyself up to me!” screamed his fearsome follower. “What
can Blood and Iron in one stout heart, on one stalwart frame, finally
effect against Legion ?”
But the voice, though strange and threatening, as the voice of
many and troublous waters, shook not the purpose of the stern and
strong-willed Knight. It seemed to him as if Peace, secure in mailéd
majesty, were rising before him, and a world of confusion dragging
him back with a deadly grasp.
“I command thee, wild form that followest me,” he cried, “to
cease from thy people-seducing words, and to call thyself by that
name by which thou art recorded in the red pages of History, the
name of the arch-fiend Anarchy!”
A cry, more fearful than a thunderclap, burst half-despairingly,
half-threateningly from the lips of the Tempter, and he fell yet
further to the rear. -
The Knight braced himself firmly in his saddle, shouldered his
lance confidently, and lifted an undaunted brow, as one now secure of
triumph. He urged on his noble steed, which now obeyed his master
willingly and gladly, and the faithful dog also ran beside him fear-
lessly. The valley was passed, and in front of SINTRAM there floated
the bright morning cloud, herald of Light and of Victory.

MR. PUNCH2S MORAL FAIRY TALES.
In the following narratives, which differ e
considerably from the usually accepted yer- ~~~~
sions, it is hoped that the extraordinary force
of the Moral will make up for any lack of
incident and adventure. By constantly acting /
on the example offered by the characters of //
“Mr. Punch's Moral FairyTales,” the young /
may hope to attain a peaceful and prosperous
old age, after an uneventful, if undistin-
uished career. For this reason, Mr. Punch
as every confidence in recommending his
stories to be used in all nurseries and school-
rooms, and in the lower forms in our public
schools.
I.—BLUE-BEARD.
There once lived a i. of great
wealth, but remarkable alike for the strange-
ness of his appearance and the unmerited
misfortune of his domestic circumstances.
He had fine houses both in town and country
and a deal of silver and gold plate, and
embroidered furniture, and coaches gilded all
over with gold. But he had also a Blue
Beard, and he had buried, in the most lavish
style, no less than thirty-seven wives.
Such a man, you may think, did not easily
find a wife, as his beard proved unattractive
and it was considered that his town and
country houses, must be inadequately pro-
vided with sanitary appliances.
In spite of these drawbacks, BLUE-BEARD
(as the gentleman was called) was led, for
the thirty-eighth time, to the altar, by a
H.; lady of great beauty and prudence,
ut of scanty dower.
About a month after the marriage, BLUE-
BEARD said to his wife, “My dear, business

affairs call me abroad. Make good cheer in
my absence. Here are the keys of all my |
great wardrobes, my plate-chests, and my
safe-rooms' But, for this little key here, it
is the key of the closet at the end of the great
ſº on the ground floor. Open all except
that little closet, in which I forbid you to
look.” He then embraced her, and went on
his journey.
is wife now very carefully locked up the
little key of the secret closet in her jewel-
case, and passed the time of her husband's
absence in longing for his return and reading
É. books. When BLUE-BEARD came back,
fore he was expected, he asked for his
keys.
X. What!” said he, “is not the key of my
closet amºn; the rest ?”
“Indeed,” she said, “I thought it much
safer in my jewel-box.” And, immediatel
bringing it, he closely examined it, an
found it had not been used.
“Best of wives l’” said BLUE-BEARD
“with you I may hope to live long and
happily, secure in the affections of a woman
who despises curiosity. My System is at last
successful!”
Nor were BLUE-BEARD's *::: disappointed.
They lived, envied and admired, till the
extreme limit, of human existence, and it
was not till the house was being repaired,
after their death in each other's arms, that
the mortal remains of thirty-seven previous
wives were discovered in the closet at the
end of the gallery on the ground floor.
Moral.—Do as you are bid, and don't ask
questions.
HOW TO PRESERVE THE PALACE.
To the Editor of the T-m-s,
SIR,-There can be but one cause of the failure of the Crystal
Palace to attract visitors. Have you ever noticed the quality of
buns supplied at some of the refreshment-bars? Stale buns, and a
shocking paucity of currants, are the real raisins for paucity of
visitors. Yours, BUNTHORNE.
SIR,-The charges º t against the Crystal Palace buns are
most unmanly. How, I ask, can “BUNTHORNE”. expect us to ...;
a daily supply of fresh buns when there are no visitors to eat them
As to paucity of currants, this is due to the little boys º: them
off when the custodian's back is turned, a thing which it is impos-
sible wholly to £. against. In this way a bun will lose most of
its currants in the course of a few weeks; but it is most unfair to
blame Yours indignantly,
THE FourTH-CLASS REFRESHMENT-STALL KEEPER.
SIR,--I am delighted to see this correspondence about the Syden-
ham Palace. It will never do to let the glorious grounds be swal-
lowed up by the brick-and-mortar demon. What is wanted is to
have no end of military tournaments and flºº. of that kind.
Why not act Ivanhoe and the lists of A. a-Zouche in front of
the fountains? That’s joust the way to please visitors, ln order to
assist, I would propose that one or two regiments should be quartered
in Penge; and you may depenge upon it that the inhabitants would
not object to having their quarter's rent paid in this way. At the
same time let the Directors keep up the Concerts and Oratorios!
HANDEL at one end of the building—cutting off the Turk's head at
the other; there's my ideal! By introducing tent-pegging, and peg-
ging away at the music, the public is safe to be attracted.
Yours enthusiastically, HIPPODROMI0.
SIR,-There is no doubt that the Palace is a National Institution,
and as such should be supported by the nation. The plan that I
would venture to suggest for adoption is that no public entertainment
ºf any kind should for the future take place either within the build-
ing or in the grounds, but that a series of State-aided fetes be at
once organised, to which only the original financial patrons of the
place, and their families and friends, should be admitted. Then, if
the government were to guarantee a dividend at the rate of fifteen
per cent...I think that the arrangement would satisfy the claims of
justice. It would also satisfy Yours truly,

SIR,-What’s all this humbug about keeping the Palace Grounds

“WITHIN the Abbey Walls!” This certainly, as the Poet puts it,
to English ears at least, is:–
“The pregnant phrase
That tells of Fame who holds her golden bays;
And here, at length life’s battle bravely won,
Enshrines the name of each heroic son!”
The Fame, however, who has in past times given her cachet of
admission to the Abbey has to judge, from the crowd of celebrated
nobodies whose memorial tablets crowd its ancient walls, not proved
herself a very discriminating goddess in her day. On the contrary,
she seems to have let in “the butcher, the baker, and candlestick
maker,” in the shape of a heap of ephemeral notorieties, who strutted
for a little space across life's scene in their own immediate times, a
performance for which their injudicious relatives and friends have
apparently deemed them fitting objects for the admiration of their
remotest posterity. Perhaps not latterly have things been as bad,
but certainly the last century has a great deal to answer for, and the
rush made in it by second and third-rate notabilities for immortality
seems to have been #. unique. It has been boldly proposed to
make a clean sweep of these last, and turn them bodily out, and both
on artistic and historic grounds, it would seem desirable, for not only
was the taste of the period in monumental architecture execrable,
but the monuments themselves have been, in nine cases out of ten,
ised to the memory of individuals whose names in any connection
with their # annals whatever, have never even been heard of

to say what can be done with them; They can hardly be relegated

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
No. XIX.-Joseph PopLER, Esq., C.C., H.M.L.
THE office of Common Councilman of the City of London, is one of
considerable importance, and ought to obtain for its possessor a far
- larger amount of respect
than is generally the case,
and the reason is not far
- to seek. It necessitates, if
ºt º carried out, a
rge sacrifice of time,
more or less valuable, as
-
that sacrifice of time the
only reward, is the par-
taking of certain sumptu-
ous banquets, accounts of
which are duly chronicled
in the Press, and read by
the hun constituents
with aconsiderable amount
of envy... They are not too,
\ as a body, highly distin-
guished in Art, Science, or
Literature, but are an
Nº useful, harmless, and
Nº amusing race.
Mr. PopLER was an old
inhabitant of the Ward he
represented, and highly
respected by the Ward
Beadle, who almost trem-
bled before him. He was
a man of great energy and
decision, and never troubled with any feelings of what he called
ridiculous sentiment. - -
The Town Clerk himself had him in his mind when deciding upon
some knotty point of order. The Solicitor, wise man, never solicited
him. The Remembrancer never thought ºf reminding him of any-
thing. The Comptroller no more thought of controlling him than a
mouse would think of controlling a cat, and even the Recorder,
recorded his decisions with fear and trembling when Mr. PopLER
had his eye upon him.
Most punctual of Common Councilmen, his attendance upon Courts
and Committees, and Dinners, was an example to all. Always the
first to come, and the last to go, he was looked up to with respect as
a model of what a representative should be. . Even at the monthly
meetings of the Court of Lieutenancy, of which he was a Member, he
was a regular attendant, and had even been known on more than one
occasion to actually ask the meaning of some mysterious matter
connected with the great City mystery known as the Trophy Tax.
.The Pº. of the much-coveted honour of a Lieutenant of the
City of London—a distinction which he owed to the favour of a
remarkably timid Lord Mayor–conferred upon him the title of
“Esquire,” he haying been addressed by Her Most Gracious MAJESTY,
when she issued her Royal Commission, as “Our trusty and well-
beloved Joseph PopLER, .” It also entitled him to the remark-
able privilege of adding to his name the letters “H.M.L.," which
privilege was the more appreciated as probably not one in a thousand
of Her Majesty's loyal subjects knew what they meant. But, far
above all, it obtained for him a place in that book which, although
termed by some envious and disappointed persons the “ Snobs' Bible.”
is the volume, above all others, in which members of what may very
properly be termed the middling classes long to appear. Need we
say we allude to the Handbook to the Upper Ten usand /
. Upon his º a copy of the forthcoming, edition was
immediately ordered, and, on its arrival, placed on the º:
room table, and a book-marker showed to the curious reader the
º upon, which was, inscribed, among Dukes, Marquises, Bishops,
and the élite of the land, “PopLER, Joseph, one of H.M.'s, Lieu-
tenants for the City of London.” To hear Mr. PopLER in the
Court of Common Council on a regular field-day, not merely advising
this or suggesting that, but telling his hearers in plain and unmis-
takable language what they must do, and overwhelming with his
biting sarcasm any rash member who ventured to differ from him
who would have suspected that the reason for his punctual an
lengthened attendances, upon , all and every occasion, was the
thought of what awaited him in his cheerless home. Ani why?
Ah! there is generally a bit of mystery in most men's lives that they
would not like to have unravelled, even in the apparently mono-
tonous life of a Common Councilman. And so it was with that of
Joseph PopLER, Esq., C.C. and H.M.L. His wife was a small, spare
woman, with a fearfully shrillyoice, and ever since a certain discovery
of a certain document, the history of;which had never been satis-
the case may be, and for h
factorily explained, she had been devoured by gº. It
might have been said of her that from the day of the discovery,
“Not poppy, nor mandragora,
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep,
Which thou ow'dst yesterday.”
* Ah, poor fellow! it was often said of him that he deserved no pity
from others, as he never showed pity to man, woman or child when in
the performance of his public duties. But what a life was, his 1
Plenty of honour, plenty of that fierce public contest in which, his
somewhat small soul delighted, and plenty of luxury during the day,
but always with the feeling, growing hourly stronger as the night
approached, of the sort of welcome he might expect in his childless
ome. See him seated, always well placed, at one of those magnifi-
cent Banquets, of which the old and still popular City Corporation
has so well preserved the tradition, with ...? luxury that wealth
and good taste can furnish for the enjoyment of the assembled guests,
with"beautiful women and famous men to give an additional interest
to the gay scene, and with, occasionally, the sound of music with its
voluptuous swell, to make the enjoyment refined as well as perfect,
which, of the hundreds present, appears to be more thoroughly at
home and happy than Joseph PopLER, and he holds his own in the
well relished iests and brilliant repartees that flash around him. But
watch him when the festival approaches its termination, and when
the depressing thought will force itself upon him that it is nearly
time to quit this brilliant scene, and go home! Such a home! That
sleepless woman, nursing her sense of wrong, awaits him at his
threshold. There is no honest watch-dog's bark to welcome him
home; no bright eye to greet his coming and look brighter when he
comes, but the same cold unalterable look of weary waiting, that he
has known almost nightly for so many years. Let us change the
scene.
He is the Chairman of an important Committee appointed to con-
duct the proceedings on a very great occasion. He has worked as
a public man must work who voluntarily accepts such a responsible
sition, and has scarcely seen his home for the last fortnight. At
ength the important day arrives. The manifold arrangements have
all been eminently successful. The scene in the noble old Guildhall has
been brilliant as upon any previous example. The leaders of fashion at
the West End have agreed to patronise the affair, and the assembled
company has been as distinguished as numerous. . Congratulations
without end have been showered upon the successful Chairman, who,
for once in his long life, looks perfectly radiant with his success.
To crown all, he is introduced to the hero of the evening by the
LoRD MAYor, and is received with such marked cordiality as makes
him the observed of all observers, and he leaves the scene of his
triumph at a very late hour and proceeds home. His old feeling
comes over him as he opens his door, and his first look at the ghastly
face of his old domestic tells him but too surely that the cold grey
eyes that have so often awaited his return, are closed for ever. He
enters the silent chamber, locks the door, and remains there for
hours. - - - - -
Some months have flown by, during which Mr. PopLER has been
unusually quiet. But on one of those †. occasions that the
Court of Common Council dedicates to the consideration of petitions
from all sorts and conditions of people, for the relief of all the many
ills that flesh is heir to, including among them that of poverty, espe-
cially if caused by misfortune rather than fault, a poor widow
appeared at the Bar of the Court, petitioning for some small annuity
to enable her to bring up her four children, left dependent upon her
by the sudden death of her husband, who been for many years
in the service of the Corporation, when a member of the Court who had
on many occasions warmly supported Mr. PopLER in his denunciations
of these applications, as creating bad precedents, and inducing men
to forget the duty of providing for their offspring, moved that the
application be not granted; upon which Mr. PopLER started up, and
in a speech full of generous Christian charity, and delivered with an
amount of enthusiasm that electrified his audience, begged and
entreated the Court to remember the noble character for wisely-
directed benevolence they had so long enjoyed, and to treat this poºr
widow and her orphan children as they would wish that theirs should
be treated under similar sad circumstances. The utter astonishment
of the members may be easily imagined; and the poor widow went
#. calling down blessings on the head of her kind unknown
end.
From that memorable day the whole character of Mr. PopLER
became changed; and while still devoting himself heartily to his
public work, his hard heart seemed to have become softened, and his
manner friendly and even genial. He adopted two, of the orphan
children of a distant relative, and now nothing but duty keeps him
long from his happy home; and among the whole two hundred and
thirty members of the City Corporation, there is probably scarcely
one who leads a happier or more thoroughly useful life than Joseph
PopLER, Esq., C.C. and H.M.L.

(A Hint from Corsica.)
Is it really the case that Mr. DILLwyN, Mr. RICHARD, and several
other prominent Welsh Members of Parliament, feeling emulous of
the Bonapartist Barrister in Corsica, who has raised the standard of
revolt and “taken to the mountains,” have entrenched themselves on
the top of Snowdon, and refuse to come down until Lord SALISBURY

Sixteen briefless and very junior members of the Common Law
Bar, in disgust at the want of employment now prevailing in legal
circles, are reported to have stolen one of the antique guns on the
Horse-Guards Parade, and to be giving the police a lively time of it
in St. James's Park.
It is certainly rather strange to find that the LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE
has taken a couple of Gatlings and an old torpedo to the top of Prim-
rose Hill, and defies the Regent's Park Volunteers to dislodge him,
unless the Government at once increases his retiring pension by five
thousand pounds a year.
No, it is not Helvellyn, but Helm Crag, which Mr. Ruskin is at

Is it expected that Mr. W. H. SMITH will shortly “take to the
mountains,” in the neighbourhood of Henley, in order to escape from
the plague of Irish obstruction in the House of Commons?
Fancy Mr. GLADSTONE having taken up a strong natural position
on Arthur's Seat, and with a powerful body of followers, including
Canon. MACCoLL, Mr. LABouchERE, and the ex-Lord Chancellor,
declaring that he will bombard Holyrood Palace unless Irish Home

Mr. CHAMBERTAIN is perhaps hardly well advised in running off
with an ironclad, and, in company, with a large force of Liberal
Unionists, cruising about the Channel as a Bold Buccaneer, because
he is not quite satisfied with the Government's Home Policy.
Is it the Duke of ARGYLL's recent article which has induced Pro-
fessor HUXLEY to establish himself, with ammunition and provisions

harrying the Duke's deer-forests, and so convincing him that his

I suggest a few regulations that I think would be accepted at once
by a majority in both Houses of Parliament:—
1. No Collie alleged to be suffering from rabies shall be restrained
by a muzzle, or detained by a string, º to undergoing medical
treatment, unless under an order made by a Judge of County Courts,
Stipendiary Magistrate, or Justice of the Peace, having jurisdiction
in the place where the alleged afflicted Collie is. No owner of the
said Collie so alleged to be afflicted shall be capable of making such an
order or anyºne else, except under such provisions as hereafter appear;
2.The order for imposing the muzzle or applying the string shall
be obtained upon a private application by petition, accompanied by a
statement of particulars disclosing how many persons the alleged
afflicted.Collie has already bitten, and by two medical certificates on
separate sheets of paper, under the hands of two duly qualified
medical, practitioners, who have made a declaration that they are
prepared to submit to penal servitude for life, or to any heavier sen-
tence that, in recognition of their º: may be awarded them.
3. The petition shall be presented if possible by the person who
has received the largest number of bites, unless he shall be the owner
of such alleged afflicted Collie, or shall have seen the alleged afflicted
Collie within three days. If it is not so presented, it shall contain a
statement of the reasons why the petition is not so presented, and
under what circumstances anyone else presents the petition. And
anyone else presenting such petition shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
4. No person shall present a petition unless he has been bitten by
the alleged afflicted Collie, within at least fourteen days of presenting
the petition. A person presenting a petition within fourteen days,
or without fourteen days, or neither verbally nor in writing, or both
verbally and in writing, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
5. The Judge, Magistrate, or Justice to whom a petition has been
presented shall give to the alleged afflicted Collie notice thereof either
personally, or in the case where the Judge, Magistrate, or Justice, has
already been bitten, he may direct the notice to be dispensed with for
reasons to be stated by him. -
. 6. The Judge, Magistrate, or Justice, at any time before the order
is made for applying the muzzle or string, if he thinks it necessary
or desirable, and shall, if seemingly required so to do (by the alleged
afflicted Čollie sayagely barking or showing. his teeth), have a per-
sonal interview with the alleged afflicted Collie. - -
7. If any Justice thus called upon to have a personal interview
with the alleged afflicted Collie shall deem it necessary to have the
assistance of the Clerk of the Petty Sessional Division within which
he may be acting for the time being, he shall be entitled to call for
such assistance; and if any such Clerk refuse to come, then such
Clerk shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
8. When a Collie alleged to be so afflicted has been muzzled, or led
by a string, then any or every owner of such alleged afflicted Collie,
and any or every petitioner who has presented a petition, and any
and every Judge, Magistrate, or Justice of the Peace, and every duly
qualified medical practitioner who has signed two medical certificates
on two separate sheets of paper, and all the Commissioners in
Lunacy, and the Lord Chancellor for the time being, and every
Member of the House of Peers who has ever been a Lord Chancellor,
and the Chancery Visitors, and the Secretary to the Commissioners
in Lunacy for the time being, and º other person or persons
whatsoever connected or not connected with the transaction, inclusive
of the Collie alleged to be so afflicted himself, shall be guilty, col-
lectively and severally, of a misdemeanor.
Now if these regulations are embodied in an Act, we allought to
be as comfortable as the gryphon on the knife-board of the omnibus
that goes by electricity from the bottom of the crater of Wesuvius up
by Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Great Desert of Sahara to the Re.
gent's Park Kennel in the Dog's Star! But I am becoming excited!

WHAT a wonderful Mayor's Nest, the wary Truthful gentleman as
represents Northampton, that not werry harrystocratic Burrow, has
discovered, to be sure!, And how werry kind it was of his frend,
who represents Bethnal Green, to retale it all to the grinning House
of Commons at second-hand. To be sure he quite forgot to tell 'em
that several of the peeple menshuned in his statement had contra-
dicted it all point blank; but even supposing as it was all true as
Truth itself, what does it all come to? º just this; that the old
loyal Copperashun of the City of London that has for about seven
hundred years borne the battle and the breeze, being fiercely attacked
with all the strength of a powerful Government, acshally spent a lot
of their own money-left to 'em sentries ago, as I heard a werry
wenerable Deputy say the othernight, for that werry purpus, among
others—in defending theirselves, and in showing that the large
majority of senseble Londoners much prefer things as they is rayther
than things as they might be.
It seems that the Northamton Gent has got hold of some privet
apers, that was in a Burglar's Safe, and with that fine sense of
onner that so distingwishes some of the honnerable gents of the

prowdly, denownped'em as mere idle gossip! and so left 'em. .
And ewen sposing as all the charges was as true as Truth itself,
which praps ... is, what does they amount to? Why, that the
libberal Copperashun having to do sumthink as was necessary to be
done, did it ansomely, as they does everythink. They had to xplain
matters to about four million peeple, and they spent a few thowsand
pounds in a doing of it. BRowN, who is a grate calkulater, havin

... It's no doubt a great pity, but it's, nevertheless, quite true that
it takes a lot of time and a lot of money to get people to understand
publick matters except at Election time. T . won't attend publick
meetings, and lissen to long, dry speeches, and speshally on pouring
wet nights, unless you has two or three good performers to emuse
as well as conwince 'em ; and so it’s abserlutely necessary to make
nse of the Press for adwertising on 'em, for it's found by experience
that most sensible peeple prefer ...is speech quite cumferal at
home, at breakfast, to going out at nig t to lissen to one in a ot and
crouded room. And adwertising, I’m told, is werry expensive
work, sumtimes as much as £20 a page! So it soon runs into
money.
But the werry best xcuse as the Copperashun could possorbly
make for spending their money so freely, if they condescends to do
anythink so beneath their high position, is the fact that they suc-
ceeded in what they tried to accomplish, and utterly defeated the
ennemy as wanted to utterly abolish 'em, root and branch, and, at
the same time, saved the hole of London from the most owdacious,

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. XX. “OUR SECRETARY.”
WITHouT the exercise of the useful but occult art known, or
rather perhaps yaguely indicated, by the term “Wire-pulling,” it
is commonly understoo > * tº
that Political Organisa- N * N-
tion, would be...im-
ossible. And without
olitical Organisation,
where should we all be?
Ask the Member of All
Work, whose mission in
life it is to preach it
from a hundred plat-
forms and promote it
in ten thousand un-
marked ways.
And yet,...strange to
say, there is scarcely
one man in a million \
who will own that he is
a Wire-puller.
“Our Secretary,”—
as all his political as-
sociates delight to call
him —is however not
altogether as other men
are. He admits frankly,
to those with whom he
considers it safe to be
frank—that he is “a = º
Professional Politician.” | ſ //
There is no sham-dig- - >~~
nity, no Ajax-like assumption of the heroic about “Our Secretary.”
It is pleasant to hear him in one of his candid moods, when un-
bosoming himself, to some, ardent and honest, but not entirely
verdant local politician. His manner is so modest, his tolerance
so extreme, he admits so much, he pretends to so little, his candour
is so insidious, his appreciation is so soothing.
“Qur Secretary,” is a strict party-man, without being in the least
a zealot... What his own fundamental convictions really are, if he
has anything so #. as a fundamental conviction, it
would perhaps be difficult for anyone, himself included, to say. But
he is always ready to utter his party's shibboleths when they are once
fairly recognised as such. He has no idea of taking up “cries”
before the main bulk of the political pack have given tongue. That
is where young party-hounds are such a nuisance, and “Our Secre-
tary” is by no means a young Fº He is on the con
a very wary."old dog” indeed, and is often told off to soothe an
silence impetuous political puppies. He knows so well how to deal
with them. Long practice made him an expert in the art of
political, muzzling in its many branches. What droll stories he
could tell of the various canine types:—
“Both mongrel, puppy, whelp and hound,
And curs of low degree,”
upon whose indiscreet or hungry jaws he has had to experiment.
No one knows better than “Our Secretary” that the game called
Politics is not generally played with all the cards on the table. As
“Truthful JAMES,” he could, if he would, expose the hand of many
a Parliamentary “Heathen Chinee.” But he is discretion incarnate.
It is instructive to watch the play of his bland, but at times ex-
#. countenance, when he is confidentially chatting over a good
inner with his particular friend the Secre of the C. C. C.—or
Central. Conglomerate Caucus. It would probably be even more
instructive to overhear the mutual confidences which give rise to so
many nods and becks and wreathéd smiles. But, that is an instruc-
tion vouchsafed only to a very, select few, and those themselves
members of the noble army of Wire-pullers. It would not do for the
Wire-pullers to tell everything to the puppets. The puppets might
perchance rebel, and determine henceforth to dance only at their own
- leasure and to their own favourite tunes. hich would
never Clo.
There are few things in “practical politics” of which “Our Secre-
tary” is not a master. He knows how to deal with political Big-
wigs and to bring the influence of the great Panjan s of Parlia-
ment to bear locally at need. He can give political platform royers
the straight tip as to the most judicious manner of manipulating
meetings, and dealing with individuals, when they come to orate, to
dine, or socially disport, themselves, in our midst. Without his
guidance a Great Panjandrum in Little Pedlington would often feel
É. a fish out of water, or at least like a whale in a tank. Yet there
are few more ...; spectacles than a Panjandrum dealing
out personal compliments of political pºon-meat to the Pedling-
tonians under the sagacious direction of “Our Secretary.”
He is also great on Committees. A Committee is very commonly an
assemblage o º: ciphers whose main function it is to give
an appearance of what is humorously called “truly .#.
character,” to the foregone conclusions of a few le # spirits.
“Our Secretary” is sufficiently astute and . self-enacin
to be a real power upon a Committee, Sub-Committee, or Council.
The orators spout, the criticasters carp, the grumblers snarl, and the
muddle-heads vaguely meander. “Our Secretary” listens patiently,
sympathises warmly, deprecates humbly, understands completely,
and then—brings the business before the meeting to its real bearings
Ah! where would England's local
liberties be without “influential representative Committees?” Ask
“Our Secretary.” - -
But where “Our Secretary” chiefly shinesis inadroitly dealing with
local recalcitrants. These are of many sorts. It is impossible even
for an affable and open-handed Member of Parliament like Mr.
TRUMPINGTON SNIPE, backed by a genial and judicious agent like
“Our Secretary,” to please everybody. But if there is anything
which “Our Secretary” does—quietly and discreetly—pride himself
upon, it is his ability to gauge every opponent's character and
ascertain every grumbler's price. ... “Price” is not altogether, a
pleasant word, perhaps, to the ears of patriots and men of principle
and therefore “Our Secretary” never makes use of it—to men of
principle or patriots. Why should he when ºple so readily under-
stand its less startling and unsavoury synonyms? But “price” does
not always signify hard cash. It may also mean political promotion,
social patronage, personal flattery, almost anything, from a situation
of profit to a dinner at Mr. TRUMPINGTON SNIPE's Club, or Town
Mansion. . Where “Our Secretary” is so useful is in discovering
exactly what it does mean in any given case...Who so quickly as he
can measure the money value of an incorruptible Scotch antagonist's
silence, or take the length of an infuriated Irish obstructionist's foot P
Who can deal so deftly as he with the enthusiasts who have to be
soothed into acquiescence, the crotcheteers who have to be conciliated
into conformity, the burly Brutuses who have to be bought over?
It is possible that “Our Secretary's' long and varied experience
of such delicate little diplomacies may in some measure have affected
his estimate of patriots and men of principle, for he has been charged
by many with being a cold-blooded GALLIo, and by some with being,
in confidential moments, a cynical political PILATE. But it must be
owned that when he does come across a local politician who is both
sensible and incorruptible, “Our Secretary” is disposed to meet
him in a very fair, and friendly spirit. He would probably admit,
however, that this is a difficulty which he has seldom to deal with.
On the whole, “Our #: is rather a favourable specimen
of the sort of men who, in these highly “organised” days, are con-
stantly and quietly engaged in the art and mystery of political wire-
pulling. . He often has to do suit and service to men who are more
self-seeking than himself, whilst less ingenuous and above-board.
This does not seem greatly to disturb him; he smiles, and manages
while he smiles; he dines with much enjoyment, and does not let
even, the maxim in vino peritas lead him beyond, the delicate line
which divides post-prandial frankness from political indiscretion.
He never thrusts, himself forward to speak, being, always.ready
to give place to the many whom he knows to be afflicted with the
cacoğthes loquendi, but when “on his legs” he is fluent, judicious,
conciliatory, occasionally even mildly facetious, but seldom aiming at
smartness. He knows that a clever stroke of satire may wound
friends as well as enemies, and that an epigram or a repartee some-
times excites as much envy as admiration. In short, if judicious
self-effacement be as virtuous as heroic self-denial, “Our Secretary”
is among the most virtuous of mankind, -
Those who object to Wire-pullers, and all their works, will perhaps
find little to admire in “Our Secretary.” And, indeed, the division
of political mankind into puppets and those who pull them, can only
be looked upon, with modified satisfaction as being, like Party
Government itself, a very provisional form of political machinery.
It may be feared, however, that, for some time yet to come, “...the
Machine” will run, the wires will work; and among Wire-pullers
and Machine-men there are indeed many worse fellows than that
astute but faithful, if salaried, party Abdiel whom we call “Our
Secretary.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AWAKE WITH THE SLEEPING BEAUTY.
To judge from the highly satisfied attitude of the large audience
that attended NovKLLo's Oratorio Concert, given at St. James's Hall
the other evening, there was
on their parts evidently no
disposition to quarrel with
the quality of the musical
fare provided for their
delectation, by that enter-
prising firm, for as a distin-
guished German musical
critic, sitting beside Mr.
Punch, observed to him,
“Wen he likes, no vellow
can do it better.” It is
true that BEETHOVEN's
Choral Symphony can
scarcely be regarded as a
new work, and the audience
seemed a little overcome by
the “Adagio molto et canta-
bile,” that fell somewhat
flat, much º the
rise of Dr. MACKENZIE, who commenting on the fact to his first
violin, was evidently making some such remark as “H'm,--well, I
wonder why on earth they haven't taken that.'”
The rather uncomplimentary opening words of the recitative that
follows the orchestra F. “Oh, friends I nomore such sounds of
discord,” could scarcely explain matters, but the suggestion to the
Chorus, “to sing a strain more cheerful, more flowing; a strain of
jº judiciously thrown out and vigorously acted upon very
ortunately, soon brought the Symphony to a happier conclusion.
But, to turn to the pièce de résistance of the evening, Mr. Cowen's
charming and graceful Cantata, The Slee º Beauty. The “book”
which deals simply but effectively with the familiar legend, has
been brought out by the composer, in a series of the mosttuneful
numbers, among which the chorus “At Dawn of Day,” the incanta-
tion song of the “Wicked Fay,” capitally rendered by Madame
PATEY, and the piece assigned to the Prince, Mr. LLOYD, commencing
“Where am I?” at the opening of the Fourth Scene, may be
specially noted as full of striking and characteristic melody skilfully
treated... Mr. ILoyp, by the way, was quite to the fore throughout,
and all that fell to his share may be said to have been well up on
LLoyd's list. Mrs. HUTCHINson made a graceful Princess, and Mr.
WATKIN MILLs as the King, got through as much of the musical
grist as was brought to him in an efficient style.
Mr. Punch, on referring to the book, notes several “stage” direc-
tions which he fancies were not carried out the other evening. He
does not recall “A gay throng of Ladies, Lords, and Knights; some
dancing,” or recollect the Princess, “wandering dreamily from the
Banqueting Hall and entering a large º at the further end of
which is a flight of narrow steps.” . Possibly the limited space avail-
able at St. James's Hall did not admit of the introduction of these
undeniably attractive features; or it may have been that Mr. Punch
occupied, as his artist has represented him, bercé'd by the delightful
music into the enjoyment of a delicious repose, found himself, though
listening with his ears wide open to all the beauties of the charming
entertainment prepared for him, yet with his eyes shut to all possible
shortcomings.
Mr. Punch heartily congratulates his young friend, Mr. CowPN,
on the enthusiastic and well-merited call that greeted him on the
conclusion of his excellent work. It was quite clear that how-
ever soundly Mr. CowPN’s “Beauty” was sleeping, the public at any
rate were quite wideawake to her fascinations, and it gives Mr. Punch
much pleasure to be able to record the fact.

THE Gold-god sits in the market-place
With a broad-cloth suit and a brazen face,
Like a Civic Monopolist, one of the race
Whence his favourite clients are furnished;
('Tis, therefore, no doubt, he assumes their

There's a flush on his cheeks, there's a gleam
in his eyes,
And the brow he uplifteth to Babylon's skies
Seemsto glitter as though it were burnished.
The least erected of Spirits that fell,
As MILTON declared him, seems wondrously

He wº . much like a Stock Exchange

His pathway to opulence pegging.

But verily, Sense, 'tisnot nonsense orgammon,

The employment, perchance, at first glance
may seem odd,
And hardly the thing for a gentleman-god,
As Mammon of course must be reckoned;
But Mammon, no doubt, well knows what
he's about.
And what is this motley, scarcejubilant rout,
For ": close attention the god seems to

Most of them so meagre, few rosy and stout,
Some with cheeksfallingin, some with elbows
much out,
Who fº reluctantly, drawn by his shout,
And by his bold finger-tip beckoned?
Oh! tº: are the victims of “very hard

Men guilty of poverty–coarsest of crimes—
Poor women who labour whilst midnight's
dull chimes
Waft soft over Wealth as it slumbers;
Scantly fed curates and doctors ill-paid,
Soldiers, and sufferers from slackening trade,
All these round the aureate god are arrayed
In mournful but well-marshalled numbers.
“For lo!” cries the god, “’tis a Jubilee

So Mammon the Mendicant. Punch passing by
Surveyed the strange scene with a critical eye.
Quoth he, “Here’s a curious disparity
Between means and end. In this Jubilee Year,
All hearts will with loyalty beat far and near;
Our Throne is respected, our Country is dear;
But Poverty's rife, Labour suffers I fear;
Many middle-class homes are despondent and drear;
I am bound to admit it does seem rather queer,
To see Dives, the fat
First to pass round the hat;
And Mammon soliciting Charity l’”
JACOBITES AT ST. JAMES’S.
Mr. Nibbs. Well, Sir, your opinion on Clancarty
at the St. James's P
Mr. Punch. I was disappointed.
Mr. Nibbs. I cannot say I am surprised to hear it, as
I gathered from our last conversation that }. expected
a great deal from the performance. In what way were
you disappointed?
Mr. Punch. Every *f; I was disappointed at finding
the piece not so good as I had thought it, and with the
acting for not being better than the piece.
Mr. _Nibbs. At all events the scenery and costumes
were admirable.
Mr. Punch. Yes, Mr. HARFoRD and our recently full-
fledged Academician, Mr. MARCUs Stone, did their best,
no doubt; but accuracy in architecture and upholstery,
in wigs and shoebuckles, is not a substitute for dramatic
interest, or for histrionic art.
Mr. Nibbs. Was not Mrs. KENDAL all your fancy
painted her as Lady Clancarty?
Mr. Punch. No, nor half of it. But—contrary to my
custom, and quite accidentally,–I was present on the
first night, and I believe that it would not be fair to pass
a final judgment on the performance of any one of them
in Clancarty, or anything else, on such an occasion, when
they were all excessively nervous, and unable to do them-
selves justice. But, taking it for what it was, a first night
or a last rehearsal coram populo, I can only say that with
what I saw, and heard, I was disappointed. -
Mr. Nibbs. My remembrance of the piece, as origin-
ally played, is vague, but what I distinctly recollect is
Mr. Anson as Scum Goodman, and Mr. SUGDEN as
William of Orange. Mr. HENRY NEyILLE as the gay
Cavalier I can call to mind in a general way; but, as he
was always more or less the gay Cavalier on the stage,
this doesn't assist me.
Mr. Punch. Comparison, neither fair nor necessary.
Mr. KENDAL began as a light comedian, but he hasn't
become lighter. He is not ToM TAYLoR's ideal Clan-
carty, nor, I should say, was Mr. HENRY NEVILLE, but
he is a very real and concrete Clancarty. On the first
night he wanted oiling. But then he has not been playing
for some time, and absence does make the joints go rusty.
Mr. Nibbs, Mr. MACKINTosh's William was good.
... Mr. Punch. Decidedly. It was the hit of the première.
But when I saw the costume I fully appreciated Mr.
HARE's wisdom in not playing the part. His neat head
and dapper little figure would have been smothered by
the huge wig and coat, and his legs wouldn’t have had a
ehance. The results would have been all wig and no
RE.
Mr. Nibbs. True: and for the same reason this actor
must always be a Tory, as of course one Hare can never
be a Whig. But, seriously, there is no geniality in the
part.
Mr. Punch. But there are pathetic touches, too, with
which Mr. HARE, º: Dutch-English, would have
had a difficulty. It strikes me that Tom TAYLOR wrote
this play not for the sake of the CIANCARTIES, but be-
cause their story supplied him, with a frame for the
dramatic portrait of his hero, William of Orange. After
the King, in the author's mind, came “Scum Goodman,”
and when all the dramatis persona of this piece have faded
from the memory, these two will remain. At the St.
James's the acting of Scum Goodman was of the feeblest
description, as indeed was all the purely melodramatic
business of the play.

tended for the light-comedy relief, the dialogue seems thin and weak, and, I
am bound to say, it was not, helped by the acting. I dare, say poor Mrs.
BEERRoRM-TREE was frightfully nervous, and quivered—as Mr. RIDER HAsgard
would say, had he such a name to deal with—like an Aspen-Tree. -
Mr. Nibbs. A young friend of mine, who saw the play the other night for
the first time, observed that he thought the hero and heroine “uninteresting;”
and the play itself he considered “stodgy.”
Mr. Punch. Well—of course the weight of that opinion depends upon the
character of your young friend. For myself, I should like to hear that some-
thing had been cut out of the Third Act—which dragged on the first night-
that Scum Goodman had improved—(why make him a pale, scowling, black-
habited, palpable villain, on melodramatic mischief, to music, bent?)—and that
fire and energy had been infused into the piece all round, and then I own I
should very much like to see it again.

MR. Ruskin has in a recentletter described Railroads as “the loathsomestform
of #. now extant; animated and deliberate earthquakes, destructive of all wise
89cial habit or possible natural beauty, carriages of damned souls on theridges of
their own graves.” Here are a few more elegant extracts taken by anticipation
from his own Particular Common Place Book:- -
Five o’Clock Tea.—“A †. of male and female foul-mouthed
fiends met together to jabber their hell gibberish one to another with a white-
livered .g. of their own inevitable damnation.”
A Penny Steamboat Company.−" A shrieking, mud-crushing and spluttering
concern, designed by its bedevilments to churn up the filthy ink of a metro-
politan Tartarus, and carry its infernal human cargo into utter outer darkness
economically.”
The British Muffin.-"Cursed and riddled paste of Cerberus fitted to choke
the deliberate and gluttonous voluptuaries who feed on it.”
. The Three per Cents.--"A diabolical device of financial jugglery involved
in which Government and Investors clutching at each other's throats, go down to
the bottomless pit howling together.”
Army and Navy Co-operative Stores.—“A Mammoth Tophet, where blasted
and blighted Shareholders ºf le in hysterics over the cheapening of their own
coffins, in sight of the infern es that await them when the bargain is over.”
Saturday Pops.--"The yelling of º cats, and the baying of barking
hell-hounds, mingled for the satisfaction of the godless andfatuous fools who
can be cozened into listening to them.”
Riding in, an Omnibus.--"An altogether damnable method of locomotion,
destructive of all wise, social habit, or possible natural beauty, in the pauperised|S
moods of those who, as a fitting preparation for a ride in their own hearses,
have recourse to it.”
. The Qxford and Cambridge Boat Race.—“The loathsomest form of diabo-
lical athleticism extant, wherein sixteen devils, like animated and deliberate
volcanos, disport themselves in the presence of a roaring and infernal mob.
who would not care, a single brazen, farthing were they to see them slip off
their sliding-seats into the ridges of their own graves.”
A Recent Letter on Railroads.-"The silliest bit of idiocy that has §
found its way into print; a rhodomontade of violence and balderdash stuff
with phrases of “devilry’ and ‘damnation,” that ought quickly to relegate it to

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
extracted from
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 28.-Rather fought shy
of Joseph G.ILL.Is to-night. Come into a fortune, you know, includ-
ing a Castle, not in Spain, but in Ireland. Åil . well for him
to take notice of humble F. whilst he was plain Joseph G.ILL.Is.
But now that he is JoEY B., *: J.P. of Castle Butlerstown, things
are different. So I thought; but only shows how little even one
º: to exceptional degree of intimacy knows of this great man.
he princely possessor of the Castle is just the same as my old friend;
The same simple attire, the same manner, bland though shrewd, and
the same comprehensive smile:, The only alteration is that noted at
the opening of the Session, all unknowing, its purport. A distant
relative left him the Castle; Heaven sent him the beard and mous-
tache, which he assiduously cultivates in Committee of Supply and
during the long stretches of debate on Procedure.
“I felt something would be expected of me,” he said, twisting his
fingers in the locality where some day, if matters proceed in present
satisfactory way, the ends of amoustache will appear. “It’s all very
well for an ordinary man to go about with smooth upper lip. But a
man who owns a Castle should behave as such. You must come
down and spend a week with me, Toby. Let me know when the
time would suit you, and I'll tell my Seneschal to prepare the turret-
chamber for you. By my halidame, we'll fill the wassail bowl, have
the boar's-head spiced, and make a revel of it!
“‘It’s merry in hall
When beards wag all;’”
and the Castellan laughed a deep “Ho! hol”
Delightful to find him in such high spirits. TIM HEALY, who
fears the growth of aristocratic tendencies in the Party, speaks dis-
respºtful y of the Castle, and sneers at the boar's head.
“It was pig's cheek with you once, JoE BIGGAR,” he growls; “and
good enough too.” -
As for the turret-chamber, TIM says it's a little closet over the pig-
stye, and the moat is º: than a ditch. But this is doubt-
less only petty jealousy. I believe thoroughly in the Castle which I
have read of in the newspapers. In my mind's eye see JoEY B., seated
at head of his table in lofty hall, on whose oak wainscoting the light
of the yule fire fitfully plays. Hope the Government will not miss
the opportunity of doing a graceful act. If titles are flung about in
Jubilee year, why should we not have opportunity of writing to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Yes, Toby, I was happy enough in New Zealand, and needn't
have hurried home to get into this mess. Used to find much enter.
tainment among the natives; sat out with them in their boundless
pasture land; formed a ring ; I used to call out ‘Yah! yah!' as I do
in House of Commons, they used to answer with unearthly shrieking;
umpire declared which made the most noise. I generally won.
All these simple pleasures faded, and here, we are with House of
Commons meanly wanting to know how a trifle of Corporation money
was spent.”
Housefull at Question Time. Evident state of expectation; FowleR
in the corner seat behind Treasury Bench lately annexed by RAN-
DoIPH. GEORGE HAMILTON in centre of line of troubled Ministers,
fretfully tearing up a copy of the Orders into scraps a finger long.
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate, beaming with chaste joy, surveyed scene
from front Bench below Gangway opposite. -
- Questions over, Sage pulled a wire, and up
jumped. HoweLL, to move the Adjournment,
“in order to discuss matter of urgent public
importance.” Opposition rose like one man in
support of application. Then HoweLL unfolded
his }. et, and a terrible one it proved, though
“the noble Baronet,” as Rowlands called Fow-
LER, made spasmodic effort to smile a smile of
scorn, and Lord GEORGE, fancying he had got
the Sage in his grasp, tore up the Orders with
increased ferocity. Hire of speakers to address
meeting, hire of audience to listen to speaker,
hire of “Chuckers-out” to watch over proceed-
ings, all paid for out of Pº. funds in charge
of Corporation of City of London, under direc-
tion of a Committee, of which “the noble
Baronet” was a member, and an Association of
which Lord GEORGE was Chairmanſ , House
roared with laughter. GLADSTONE, leaning
forward, and turning towards HoweLL,
listened with portentous solemnity.
When HoweLL sat down all eyes turned
upon “the noble Baronet.” What would
he say? Well, not much. With one hand
in trouser pocket, with the other he
attempted to brush away the charge as
“anonymous tittle-tattle.” House would
not have that. Roared at noble Baronet in
way that must have reminded him of his
afternoons out in New Zealand.
“Let us,” the noble Baronet shouted in teeth of storm, “have the
statements on the responsibility of some one who will give his name.”
Then the Sage came to the front, in blandest manner and with most
winning tones. House had all the time seen his legs under the cur-
tains of the puppet show, and recognised his hand pulling the wires
to which HoweLL and BRADLAUGH danced.
- Now he presented himself in reply to the noble
Baronet's challenge, “I am responsible for the
statements,” he said, “and I give my name.”
Uproarious cheering; increased excitement.
Lºſ GeoRGE wrestled with it, in vain;...In the
end Government caved in, and unconditionally
agreed to inquiry. Found noble Baronetan hour
. later abstractedly looking
through the A.B.C. Guide
searching for return train
to New Zealand.
“Do you think,” he
said, in a tremulous voice,
“that they'll have me u

liking to harrow his feel-
ings; but I rather fancy
they will.

debate on Closure.
Friday, 3 A.M.--"Why
were the proceedings in
the House last night un-
like the month of March,”
RAIKE s asked LY on
PLAYFAIR just now, as,
feeling their way through
the fog, they passed the Chair on their way out.
“Never guess riddles under a £5 prize,” said PLAYFAIR.

G. H-w-ll.
Members who have Passed the Chair.
“Well, because they came in like a lamb and went out...like a
lion.”
Quite true. At Question Time House only half full, and general
air of dulness prevalent. Ominous shouts of welcome from Par-
nellites when JoHN DIILoN entered, º from the Dublin
trial...DILION took early opportunity of making impatient speech,
. after that for some hours debate jogged along in old familiar
style.
At eleven o'clock the Fog took the Chair, in absence of SPEAKER.
Members began to appear in curiously large numbers on Conservative
side; a smell of grilled bones contended with fog for possession of
the House. “Ha! hal” said ScLATER-Booth, “that's supper
getting ready.. Plenty of time to enjoy it. House to sit till Con-
stabulary vote is passed.”
At midnight a sudden shout, a roar of pain and anger, went up
from the Irish camp. The Fog, which had regularly settled in the
Chair, folded its legs, crossed its arms, and bent its head just like
the SPEAKER in view of prolonged discussion, jumped up with a
start, and slowly dispersed itself over the House. Returned, and
took the Chair again, when it discovered that it was only the Irish
Members. Complaint had been made of the use of policemen's
bâtons in Ireland. “If something worse than bātons are next used,”
said Chief Secretary, angrily glaring upon Irish Members, “I warn
Hon. Members that they are the people who will be held responsible.”
“A threat, a threat!” shouted the Irish Members in a chorus,
which rose and fell like a storm of wind. Above the uproar TIM
HEALY could be heard roaring “Murder! Murder!”
“Order! Order!” shouted the Chairman.
“Murder!. Murder!” TIM replied.
“Fire! Fire!'” shrieked Joseph GILLIs, original to the last.
This went on for several minutes. Hubbub hushed, only to break
out again. , Members constantly popping up on either side on points
of order, which completed the state of disorder. Immense business
in broiled bones down in the kitchen. At two this morning Supply
began to give out; then storm lessened, and, at a quarter-past two,
division taken.
Business done,—Constabulary Wote agreed to.
Friday.—Extraordinary scene in Palace Yard between four and
half-past this afternoon. Members streamed down, nearly every
man carrying his bed, or the equivalent thereof. Some had rugs;
some blankets; some spring mattresses. Admirable to observe the
ease and grace with which Lord ARTHUR HILL step across the
ard, with mattress under one arm, bolster under other, portion of
eather pillow sticking out of coat-tail pocket, and a pair of sheets
wrapped round his neck.
4. t’s the matter?” I asked.
“No, Toby, old man,” his lofty Lordship shouted down to me.
“But I’ve been in a fog, and don't mean to get caught again.
Weren't you here at breaking-up time this morning? Three hundred
men ºf about for cabs, finding none, and feeling their way out
of the yard, hoping to find their way home on foot. Some of them,
I believe, are walking now. Passed the night in the street myself.
Prepared for emergencies to-night. If fog comes on, shall lay my
bed in, corner of Division Lobby, and go to sleep. , Heard of
G. Q. M.'s adventures, I suppose? Stranded at midnight, in Hyde
Park. Nothing to what some others of us suffered. If fog comes on
again, and you can't do better, come and curl yourself up at the foot
of # bed.’
“Thanks—but know trickworth two of that. Wery little fog at
present; comes on later. Go straight home now, and be quite safe.

No sooner were the ceremonies of the

to show herself in her true colours. She
was determined not to be “put upon,”

“Who is that little girl out of the Grosvenor Gallery?” whereat his
partner smiled so divinely that he instantly lost his heart, and could
eat none of the fine collation for gazing on her.
To be brief, he offered his heart to the eldest of CINDERELLA's
sisters, who, blushing, accepted it. But CINDERELLA, who perceived
this bye-play, got up very angrily, and looked for her carriage, which

MR. PUNCH'S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.
THIS Manual began, it may be recollected, with a contribution to the réper-
toire of the Amateur Reciter which was of a studiously simple and domestic
nature. This week, however, the Poet has risen to a higher altitude, with the
inevitable result of prºducing a piece that will only be suitable to the more
advanced, and (in the Author's opinion) cannot be rendered, with full justice
unless the Reciter can accompany himself softly upon the piano. Even a few
scales here and there are better than nothing. The vital point is to produce a
certain expression of atmosphere... The Reciter, then, should seat himself upon
the music-stool, and improvise a few modulations. Hºwii obtain some useful
hints for these by studying the preludes (many of which are of singular beauty)
of the gentleman who comes to tune his piano.
Having thus obtained a concerned silence, you should throw your head back
and announce the name of your subject, which happens to be—“The Star and
the Moth.” Then play all the chords you know best, and begin:–
O'er the purpled pale of Heaven leaned a lonely little Star,
(Leit-motif here for the Star: “Twinkle, twinkle,” is recommended, or “Star
of the Evening,” or anything else you can pick out with one finger and con-
sider appropriate.)
Gazing down upon the great world, rolling in the distance far;
Wistfully she watched the movements of a milky-pinioned Moth,
Fluttering about a garden, purposeless as ocean-froth.
(Short scumble in treble, to express froth.)
Till she found a vent for her sentiment in a languishing little lay.
(For a star can sing, like anything, whatever astronomers say.)
(You should speak these last two lines through a waltz refrain. If you don't

...'Tis the cosiest little parlour, friend, that ever you did spy.
The way into this parlour is quite wide, as you're aware,
And, oh! we’ll do such wondrous things when once we get youthere!
Then, won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you,

Now, as I’ve heard, this little fly was young, but wary, too,

“Then, won't you,” &c.

(A Tale of the Terry-ble.)
noon when Admiral
PUNCH knocked at the
door of an office at White-
hall, which had a branch
establishment in Somerset
House. He carried with
him a report. He asked
for the First Lord. A
Messenger, who was put-
ting on an overcoat lei-
surely, informed him that
the head of the depart-
ment could not possibly
be seen until the following
morning.

! A few minutes later the
Naval Dragoon was intro-

hand an enormous packet.

Admiral had had time to notice that the large envelope was addressed
to the representative of a Foreign Government. -

The ball was at its gayest. Thousands of brightly-costumed
dancers indulged in the eccentricities of the recently revived polka,
or, the more staid, measures of the chaperon-patronised quadrille.
Pilfering PETER, the Patriot (as he was called . his intimates) was
alone dull. He still carried the packet, half-hidden beneath the long
cloak that partly concealed his uniform.
“Wal,” at length observed a masked figure standing beside him,
“haye you fixed up that there little parcel slick?”
“I have,” replied PETER. “Two ships, four torpedo boats, and
seven new guns.”
“Good,” returned the strange Masker, receiving the packet. “I
calculate it was about all we were waiting for.”
Ten days later, England was engaged in war. +
- - -
The sea was, covered with vessels., Surrounded by an almost
countless host, the only British Ironclad (the Ethelred the Unready)
in Commission, proudly crested the waves.
“Why, what is this!” exclaimed the English Commander, gazing
at the enemy through, his telescope. “Those ships!...Why every
one of them is constructed on a plan supplied from it iſ And
those guns! . They, too, have been treacherously transferred to the
exultant foe!”
At this moment there was a loud explosion. Then the sea was
deluged with smoke. When it cleared away, only H.M.S. Ethelred
the Unready was left—the foreign fleet had entirely vanished,
“Dear me!” observed the English Commander, “this is very
strange! The guns burst at the first discharge. The Ironclads, con-
structed, on plans treacherously transferred, foundered before they
could get into action! I cannot understand it! What does it mean?”
The question was answered }. a badly wounded man who, blown
up an incalculable height by the explosion, had at length descended
from the clouds on to the British deck.
“It means,” cried this poor wretch, with difficulty, “that

THE BLACK ASSIZES;
Or, what it is coming to, -a brief Judicial Tragi-comedy apparently in
active rehearsal in some of our Country Towns in this Year of Grace 1887.
The Scene is laid in the immediate neighbourhood ofa provincial Assize
Court, on the morning of the Judges' appearance on the Bench.
Prisoners awaiting trial, innocent and guilty alike, stuffed away
anyhow, in any of the various holes, nooks, corners, and recesses,
of the building that will contain them. Some three-and-twenty
of them occupy a low ill-ventilated room, fourteen feet by ten
jrom the effects of the close and reeking atmosphere of *hich
some are suffocated while all are joining in a gasping clamour for
more air. In one corner 'ORRIBLE JIMMY, a prisoner who is
about to take his trial, after several previous convictions, for
burglary coupled with murderous assault, is regaling a mired
crowd of professed thieves and first offenders, with an account of
his most infamous exploits in unrepeatable language. Oaths, im-
precations and #j. fill the air. At an opposite corner of
the room an aged father and his daughter, brought here on a
false charge of embezzlement, cower and try to hide their eyes
from the loathsome sight, and shut out the hideous sound from
their ears. In other parts of the building six other prisoners,
two of them being mere children, are locked up in dark cupboards
in which they can scarcely breathe. Four or five more are stowed
away in a damp underground cellar, lighted by a feeble jet of gas
to £º the Authorities would think twice before they consigned
a dog.
Enter First and Second Steeled Officials in passage.
First Steeled Official (after listening complacently to groans, im-
pretations and cries). Well, I calls them a lively lot this morning:
Ark at their growls. I’ll growl’em, if they won't stop. Why they
be 'eared inside o' the Court next. - - -

made. Getting his body inside the room). No-you don't. Phew!

[They lug out the fainting girl between them, and close the door on the
groaning, swearing, suffocating, struggling, and reeking crowd
within. Bringing her to with a bucket .# water, they rele-
gate her, for want of any better place, to the coal-cellar. .
First Steeled Official (listening, as he passes up corridor, to
smothered cries coming from several cupboard doors. Hammering at
them). 'Old your row, won't yer? If you give me much more of
that, you sha’n’t come out for a month. (Playfully.) Pretty full

ment to which, we have for the last three weeks been subjected,
while waiting the issue of to-day's trial. We have been forced to
share the society of devils in human shape, thrust into crowded
kennels into which it would be under such conditions sheer brutality
to force a dumb animal, and all this not as branded criminals, but as
people whose characteris as free from stain or reproach, as your Lord-
ship's own;. Surely, my Lord, it is a theory of English Justice, that
every Englishman is to be considered innocent in the eye of the law,
until pronounced Guilty by a Jury of his fellow-countrymen. . Yet,
we have been treated worse than felons consigned to penal servitude.
The Learned Judge (with warmth). And rightly too; not according
to theories of English justice, with which we in this place have
nothing to do, but in conformity with its practice, with which we are
more immediately concerned. You have, Sir, in common with your
class, got hold of that pestilent legal heresy, that the law regards
every prisoner as innocent until he is proved guilty, when the very
reverse is the case. How often shall F. to point out from my
place on this Bench, that the law, on the contrary, holds every man
charged with an offence as guilty, and punishes him as such, until he
has been acquitted by a Jury of his fellow-countrymen. Hence the
I dare say, not uncommon catastrophe, that the Court has witnessed
this morning. But, you at least, are now out of it, and have nothing
to complain of Stand down, Sir, I am ashamed of your ignorance.
[The Prisoners are assisted from the Dock, and as the Judge is
º. with with a pair of black kid gloves in honour
of the occasion, the Curtain slowly falls.
A THEATRICAL CHAT.
Mr. Nibbs. What, Sir, did you think of Modern Wives at the
Rºy ?
Mr. Punch. The First Act, in idea, in acting, in every way,
capital. Mr. EDouTN is perfect as the retired 'atter, and poor Mr.
LYTTON SoTHERN was exceptionally good in the last part he ever
º: His career was § of the brightest promise, poor fellow,
and he would evidently have been Mr. CHARLEs WYNDHAM's suc-
cessor in that peculiar bustling light-comedy line.
Mr. Nibbs. He is a distinct loss to the stage.
Mr. Punch. As to the Ladies in this piece, the three sisters are
well contrasted. Miss ATHERTON is rather too American perhaps for
an English tradesman's daughter; but in the Second Act, when his
art becomes weak, Mr. EDOUIN justifies his daughter's accent by
is own. Miss EwA WILSON is a charming ingénue, not too in-
genuous, and Miss OLGA BRANDON looks uncommonly handsome as
the second married sister, whose husband, Mr. Honeysett, is most
naturally }** by Mr. SELTON.
Mr. Nibbs. I thought Miss BENNETT, the waiting-maid, very
good; didn't you, Sir P
Mr. Punºff. Yes. The haspirates were judiciously misplaced, and
the character was not in the least overdone.
Mr. Nibbs. It struck me the Second Act hung fire.
Mr. Punch. Undoubtedly it does; it is weak and too long. The
actors seemed to be endeavouring to infuse some extra life into this
Act by boisterous fun., Bustle and swagger are not always satis-
factory substitutes for humour and dramatic interest.
Mr. Nibbs. Quite true, Sir ; but it has reached its fiftieth night.
By the way, I am told that the performance of Clancarty at the
St. James's has much improved.
Mr. Punch. I was sure it would be so. A first night is a test,
but not the fairest, nor the best. I must see it again.
Mr. Nibbs. The Pantomime of AUGUSTUs DRURIoIANUs is having
a fine time of it—in spite of the fogs.
Mr. • Punch. Yes—and sub Rosá there is to be an Opera season
after Easter, and, later on, when the CARL and MARIE Rose Show
is over, he is going in for Italian Opera.
If “not in mortals to command success,”
AUGUSTU's DRURIOLANUs will “deserve it.”

THE REAL GRIEWANCE OFFICE.
Before Mr. Commissioner PUNCH.
A Surgeon of the Medical Staff Corps was introduced.
The Commissioner. May I ask what I can do for you, Sir?
Applicant. I have to complain, Sir, that by a recent War Office
Warrant the relative rank of Medical Officers in the Army has been
abolished, and can scarcely do better than give a quotation from a
much respected organ of our profession, the British Medical Journal,
which is as follows:—
“The medical officers regard the anomalous position they are now placed in
as a matter of the gravest importance. They look upon the fact of their
being deprived of rank in the Army as a degradation, for while, only recently,
real rank has been conferred on the officers of the Commissariat and Trans.
F. and Pay Departments of the Army, the only rank the medical officers
ave ever had—relative rank—has been taken away from them.”
The Commissioner. Please explain the distinction between the
officers of the Commissariat and Transport and Pay Departments of
the Army and the Medical Officers.
Applicant. Both are non-combatants—the first have to supply the
food and transport and pay of the Army; the last the medical
assistance.
The Commissioner. Are the duties of the †: an Army
to be in the field–of a more dangerous character than those of the last?
Applicant. º not. On the contrary, as an Army Surgeon
has frequently to be close up to the fighting line, he shares all the
risks of combatants. It is true that hospitals are supposed to be
protected by the Geneva Cross in .# warfare, but not unfre-
quently the flag has been utterly ignored; and in cases of a campaign
against savages it absolutely becomes a target for the sharpest fire.
I, need scarcely remind you of the defence of Rorke's Drift, where the
Zulus made the hospital their chief point of attack.
The Commissioner. I believe that the Victoria Cross has been
frequently conferred on Medical Officers.
Applicant. Frequently... I question whether they will be able to
gain it in the future, as they will virtually sink into the position
of civil employés hired for a particular service. -
The Commissioner. Certainly there seems to be food for considera-
tion in your suggestion. Has the position hitherto, of an Army
Surgeon in a regiment, been an enviable one -
Applicant. It has depended to a great extent upon the individual
hiº ; but, as a matter of fact, in cases of discipline the Army
Surgeon has always been junior to the most recently joined subaltern.
The relative rank has given him certain advantages as to the choice
of quarters, receiving salutes, &c., which now will be presumably
.. The military idea is, that a man capable of keeping his
head clear, and giving orders to his assistants in the most delicate
surgical operations, is yet unable to command a file of men, as well
as a youngster fresh from two months of militia-training, or a
schoolboy course at Woolwich or Sandhurst. Of course such a
suggestion is not calculated to gain for an Army Surgeon the
entire respect of combatant officers in their teens. The new
order goes a step—a very long step—further, and deprives him
of even the shadow.of rank. You may imagine how painful his
position will become in a society where military rank is of the first
importance. Some time, ago Army Surgeons were removed (except
in a few favoured battalions) from the regiments with which they
had been closely associated for years, to be put upon the Staff. This
was done, so it was said, on the score of economy; but it is difficult
to find areason for this more recent departure—a departure which, I
fear, may lead to departures of another kind, and departures that
will rid the Army of every self-respecting member of our profession.
For ł. must remember, Sir, that we are not only Officers, but
Gentlemen. -
The Commissioner. It is well to remind the Authorities of that
fact. I consider your grievance a very serious one, and shall take
all necessary steps to see that it is redressed.
[The Applicant thanked the Commissioner on behalf of himself
and some seven hundred colleagues, and withdrew.

She was a White Lady, but the most gentle and retiring of her
species. Obviously she s
would never have
haunted the room of a
bachelor if she could
possibly have helped
it; it was the fault of
the housekeeper at
Schloss Schreckenstein
for putting me into the
...i where she
generally appears.
“If jºk,”
I said, in a resolute
tone, (for I had got
over my first fright)
“if you don't speak,
I'll tell you what I’ll
do. I'll get up and
dress.”
Of course this was a
brutal kind of thing to
say to a ghost of her
nervously, bashful
type, and, in calmer
moments, I have often
regretted it. But what
was a man to do? I
felt for the ghost as
much as anyone can,
but she wouldn't go away, she wouldn't speak, and she was not even
useful for scientific purposes of Psychical Research. Who would
have believed me, if I said I had seen her?
. “I’ll get up,” I said, “and º the other men. They are still
in the smoking-room, I daresay. y saying I have seen you, is no
evidence, as you must know; but if they all see you; then there will
be evidence to go to a Jury—to GURNEY and MYERs, I mean,”—and I
began to move as if I would throw off the heavy German eider-down
uilt. The Ghost fell on her knees. “For my sake, don't do that,”
she said, “Oh, is it not punishment enough to have to haunt rooms
where all sorts of strange people come, without your uttering such
unmanly threats? Oh, I never was spoken to so, since my life!”
“Then, why do you haunt them?” I asked... “This is my rºom,
not yours. It is not at all like the case of Mr. Pickwick, and the lady
in curl-papers.”
and inconsiderate of the Seneschal,” said the
“It was most wrong
Ghost, “to put you in here, if he had the feelings of a gentleman,
“You know
he would only put ladies in this wing of the Castle.”
“But the ladies refuse to be put here,” I replied. -
you have frightened them all away, and I don't wonder at it.”
“I do not know what the world is coming to,” said the Ghost,
“in % time it was very different.”
-4 en was your time?”
“Oh, about the Reformation,” she replied, evasively.
“The very early Hussite movement, then, judging from your
dress,” I remarked, on which she flushed up, and muttered some-
*** “personal remarks.”
“When I was a girl,” she said, “we would have been ashamed to
be afraid of our White Lady, BERTHAvon SCHRECKENSTEIN, to whose
place I succeeded. We always got on *. with her, and she
with us. Never a complaint on either side. No Knights were ever
put in her rooms, I warrant you. Are you a Knight?”
“My dear Madam,” I replied, “I am not in trade, nor am I a
medical man, nor a Mayor, nor a painter. I am a literary character,
I am. They don't make us Knights.”
“I see, you are a Minstrel?” she answered. -
“A lazy one,” I replied, and she quite brightened up, and said she
had read my little things (she was mistaken about that), in the
drawing-room, after the family had gone to bed. -
However, she began to become shy and self-conscious again.
“In this Schloss,” she said, “gentlemen seldom go to bed before
two in the morning, and I get the haunting over early, and have a
few hours to #. But tºe ºne up tº soon! Oh, dear!”
she exclaimed in an agony, “I hear them bouncing along from the
smoking-room, and they are just as likely as not to come in here to
‘draw' you, and then, oh dear, oh dear,” said the Ghost, “what will
the next world say of me? They are so censorious.” - - - -
Could there be a more painful position for me, and for this retiring
spectre? “Can't I get up, and make a bolt for it?” I said, but she
would not hear of it.
It was only too probable that young GRIGSBY, of the Guards, and
that young wretch Won SPICHEREN, would “draw” me—and their
own conclusions !
“Can't you disappear?” I said. -
“Impossible,” she answered, peevishly. “I can't disappear before
cock-crow.” -
It was awfully awkward. At this moment young GRIGSBY, in the
passage outside, gave, at the top of his voice, his celebrated imitation
of a cock crowing. In a second, before you could so much as wink,
the White Lady had vanished, and not a moment too . for the
door burst open, and GRIGSBy rode in on Won SPICHEREN's ba
latter going on all fours. -
“Hi, here's the Family Ghost,” shouted GRIGSBY,+but I did not
think it necessary to inform him that the Family Ghost had }. one.
I simply hit him over the head, with the bolster, bringing him down
from his charger with a crash. Next #. fieft the chloss, the
position was so dreadfully awkward, and I have often thought since,
with sympathy and regret, of the Unlucky, Shy White Lady, of
Schreckenstein. Doubtless many spectres, perhaps most, are in her
yery compromising position, a thing we reflect on too little when we
hear of haunted houses. The ghost of a retiring gentleman, for
instance,—but the subject is top painful.

Extra ACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 7.<-Dr. TANNER bustling
about the House to-night, advocating his scheme for preventing the
fog taking the Chair again in the absence of SPEAKER. As far as I
can make out, he proposes a supply of head-gear made of antiseptic
cotton-wool; to be kept in Cloak-Room, and, whenever a fog comes
on, to be served out to Members. PLUNKET objects on aesthetic
grounds. Doesn't think it would look well from the Ladies' Gallery
to see Members muffled up in masks of cotton-wool. Besides, doubts
efficacy of suggestion. “In short,” he says, “TANNER's scheme not
worth sixpence.”
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate proposes amendment. If the cotton-
wool, antiseptic or otherwise, were stuffed into the ears of Members,
on foggy nights or fine, he should support proposal. TANNER says
that won't do; and there matter stands for #. present.

first turns upon his interlocutor a scorching look of reproof. Then,
in loud voice, rapidly reads his little homily, glancing over his
eyeglass at the end of each successive sentence to see how the Hon.

of pained surprise that there can exist on this fair earth a human

the Metropolitan Board of Works,
“I am surprised that my Hon. friend,” said The M'GARELjust now
turning upon Dixon-HARTLAND a withering glance, “should have

If Dixon-HARTLAND had been a sensitive man, nothing but a spot

an uneasy smile, whilst the ribald House shook with laughter.

JOTTINGS FOR JOURNALISTS.
A “School for Journalists,” is announced, with offices in the
Strand. A gentleman of experience, Mr. DAVID ANDERSON, to wit,
of the Outer Temple, who heads his advertisement “What to do
with our Boys,” (what, all of them?) is going to “employ a staff
of expert assistant-masters,” and will instruct his pupils in writing
leading articles, paragraphs, reviews of books, dramatic criticism,
sub-editing, war correspondence, and, so on. It sounds, a trifle
sanguine to undertake in twelve months “to make any fairly well
educated young man a thoroughly, trained and expert journalist,
capable of earning from six to twenty pounds a week,” but no doubt
Mr., ANDERSON can do it if º gan irr. Punch wishes success
to the heroic venture, and adds, a sample of the sort of instruction
which may prove useful to budding editors, sub-editors, &c.
How to Write Leaders:-Beginners in this branch of Journalism
are apt to fall into the vulgar error of supposing that what the public
wants is a really good. English style. ğ, avoid this mistake.
Never write good English, and don't write English at all if possible,
but try for a style consisting of long-winded Latinisms *slangy
idioms and expressions borrowed from every language under the sun.
Avoid modesty... Never, assert that a policy seems, bad, but, say
straight out that it is bad. Never do what the Proprietor or Editor
of your paper †. but take your own “line,” and never mind if
you subsequently have to “take your hook” in consequence. This
gives an impression of manly independence, and leads to your ser-
vices, being much appreciated. Say to the Editor, when he tries to
dictate, sentiments to you, “Sir, either give me carte blanche, or
the sack!”–and he will most probably give you the latter. Make
it a habit to treat all Statesmen, on the side opposed to that which
you have (temporarily) adopted, as utter humbugs, and trans-
rent knaves. You must not say so, of course, in so many words;
ut you can let your †. be clearly seen. A good start for an
article is like this.-" Regarded as a serious contribution to the study
of the Church Disestablishment question (or whatever the actual
question mº the Prime Minister's latest speech is simply beneath
criticism, e Right Honourable G. : "... a Inall
universally respected for his integrity and matchless services to his
country, but never mind that—“is thereby convicted either of the most
amazing ignorance of the first ºl. of that political science on
which he presumes to dogmatise, or else of the most arrant hypocrisy.”
Then you go on easily and gracefully to prove your points, in the
full assurance that the Statesman in question will probably never see
your article, and that even if he does he is perfectly certain not to
take the trouble to contradict any misstatements you may have made.
This knowledge gives you a pleasing sense of security as you write.

War Correspo ce.—This is a very good line for a sickly lad
to adopt. It does not require much literary skill, but tact, in
getting out of the way of bullets and cannon-balls is essential,
By way of practice, your instructor should hire a large hall, and
fit it up with models of *: warriors in wax (also in a wax),
rushing rivers, impenetrable forests, camps, and so on. If the
savages could be made to howl, by clock-work, occasionally, sº
much the better. Every student should bring his own mechanical ||
horse, and be able to mount it withoutfalling over the other side,
which might spoil the “ensemble” of the engagement. Practise
ambushes. Also practise being caught in one by the aforesaid
savages, who might perhaps be constructed so as to throw a blunt
spear at you at the º moment. An organ accompaniment to a
battle would increase the effect. If there isn't an organ º try
fog-signals. When they explode, hold the mane firmly with one ||
hand; with the other you can get out pen, ink, and paper, and begin
a graphic description of anything you see, or don't see. , Corre- ||
spondents always do this in a battle. Revolvers, constructed on the
pop-gun principle, would be useful; only don't aim at the General, |

as to his plan of campaign. -
Reviewing Books, &c.—About the only accomplishment necessary |
for this branch of the journalistic profession is knowing how to write. I
It is as well also to know how to read, but this is not essential. It is
astonishing what a good idea can be attained, after some practice, of
a book by merely glancing at its cover and title-page. In three-
volume novels begin at the last chapter and work back a page or two.
Speak airily of the plot, and bring in the names of THACKERAY, Swift,
George ELIOT, or some other well-known writer, to show that yºu
have a general acquaintance with English literature. You might
callround at the publisher's about luncheon time, just to intimate
that you were #. of reviewing their book. Verb. sap.
A CRY FROM AMBLESIDE.
(By the Very Last of the Lake Poets.)
At Windermere a party of Excursionists alighted,
Exulting in their enterprise with pardonable pride; -
The latent poetry within their bosoms was excited, [Ambleside!”
said they, “We’re near our yearned-for beer—we've got to
“Excuse me, but you ain't there yet!” observed the Station-Master
(An excellent official, if a trifle cut and dried);
“You can reach it in an hour—though you’ll have to step outfaster.
Four mile we make it by the lake from here to Ambleside.”
“We’ve come out to enjoy ourselves. You don't ketch us a walkin'.
We ain't sech fools as that, no fear, when we’ve a chance to ride!
So put us in the train, old chap, and don't stand there a talkin'.
terminus for aii of us, d'ye see, is Amblesideſ
“There’ll be some tables there set out, as we can take our teas on,
And p'raps a public-'ouse or two where liquor ain't denied.”
“You can't be booked no further—for the very simple reason.
That there ain't no sign of any line 'twixt this and Ambleside!”
At such a blow his auditors were dismally dejected; -
They sank upon the platform faint, a number of them cried,
“If this is what you calls “The Lakes, it ain't what we expected.
This precious hole is not our goal. We're bound for Ambleside!”
“Cheer up!” the Station-Master said, “and don't give way to
lowness,
For here are lakes and mountain peaks—a Fº wide;
From Waterloo to Biscay. How, from Newby Bridge to Bowness,
I think you'll find it ain't behind the view from Ambleside.
“Our scenery is “picturesque, if not precisely eerie,
As you may see it stated in the Illustrated Guide.” [dreary !
Said they, “Them mountains blocks the view, and everythink is
There must be more to see, for sure, out there, in Ambleside.”
“Well, if this end of Windermere don't happen to content you,
Along the lake you may perceive incessant steamers glide;
Or you could hire a trap and drive-there's nothing to prevent you-
Anº § feet may tread the street they’ve christened
moles1010.
But no, these #. Excursionists would hear no consolation:
There was the risk of being drowned, if they the steamer tried;
They scorned to patronise a place which had no railway station,
Nor could they drive (and safe arrive) at distant Ambleside.
A kind Director saw their plight; it set his heart a-bleeding;
He knew no rest till Parliament some remedy applied.
And, should his philanthropic Bill survive a final reading,
The least select may book direct his seat to Ambleside!
Let sentimental Ruskinites the theory disparage,
Most scenery afoot you miss—it cannot be denied;
The Nature-lover's point of view’s a third-class smoking carriage.
'Twould be a blot if there were not a line to Amblesidel

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCHPS STUDIO.
No. XXII.--THE BANK CLERK.
THE Bank Clerks of London are a numerous and important body,
which if properly organised, as it?should be, might be of immense
Nº service in these times of
rowdyism, and possibly
worse, that seem rapidly
approaching, thanks, in
great measure, to the
impunity accorded to the
first futile attempts of
this nature by those
whom we ironically call
the Authorities.
They are a trustworthy,
painstaking class, sur-
rounded by temptations
to which they seldom or
never succumb, thanks,
in great measure, to that
esprit de corps that ani.
mates them so thorough-
ly; but they have their
little peculiarities and
idiosyncrasies, that are
perfectly harmless, but
sometimes a little amus-
ing. To see the Bank
Clerk in all his glory, he
should be seen ; -
with a confrère j
- the corridors of the Bank
- - of England, hands in
pockets, like a grown-up Etonian, affecting a dégagé style of look
and manner, as if he felt that, as the confidence of the country was
reposed in him, he must bear it all with the equanimity becoming
his high, position. His laugh is gentle, and almost timid, for fear
apparently, that it might echo through those sacred walls dedica
for so many years to the worship of Mammon, and bring forth
crowds of astonished votaries, utterly, unused to such sounds of
frivolity within that remarkably “sober dwelling.” His equa-
nimity and nerve are best shown by the supreme indifference with
which he declines to notice the many applicants for cash who seek
his assistance while engaged in the solemn duty of “casting,” and
the calm self-possession with which he subsequently shovels out the
shoals of shining sovereigns from his º exhaustless store.
He is, as a rule, well dressed, and of quiet, gentlemanly manners.
He resides in a suburb within a cheap ride of the City, travels with
his own set to Town, and discusses, on the way, the current topics of
the day with.freedom, humour, and intelligence. He sometimes
cultivates a little garden, and appears in the late spring with a
button-hole of surpassing, splendour. The expensive *. of an
Qrchid is reserved for Cashiers. They have their little jokes across
the counter with the Collecting-clerks, but quickly relapse into their
ordinary look of calm, placid indifference. They retain their almost
youthful look for more years than any other class of the community,
the result, probably, of a clear conscience, and continuous advance
of “screw,” as they occasionally condescend to term their pleasant
personal financial arrangement.
The Banks are fairly liberal to their employés, as they prefer to be
oalled, and by always treating them, as Gentlemen, and implicitly
relying on their statements, beget that same honourable feeling that
Dr. ARNOLD inspired among his pupils. . A story is told of a Cashier,
who, during his first week's experience in that exalted capacity, was
once considerably deficient in his day's balance. After nearly half
an hour of mental agony, he boldly went, to the Manager, and told
him of his misfortune, promising to pay the amount by instalments,
when, to his astonishment, the Manager said to him," as I have the
most perfect confidence in the whole of my staff, I shall recommend
that the Bank pay the loss.” To his great delight, the amount was
returned on the following day as having been received in error. It
is said to be one of their little harmless peculiarities, to like to astonish
their country cousins with accounts of the perfectly fabulous sums
that have passed through their hands and shovels on certain special
occasions, but it is a rather dangerous game, as one of the London and
Westminsters discovered when his Aunt's will was read, which
omitted him from her list of legatees, on the ground, that, by his
º * he had always more money than É. well knew what to
o Witn.
They patronise Theatres to a considerable extent, and are especially
known as diligent first-nighters, and are always' bitingly sarcastic
upon any slight error in the description of financial arrangements
that the poor unfortunate author may have fallen into, talking
pityingly upon his necessary ignorance upon such subjects from his
own personal want of experience, in the same way that the Lawyer's
Clerks have always a contemptuous laugh ready for any legal error
that a poor dramatist may occasionally be guilty of. - --
The Clerks of the leading Private Banks are somewhat inclined to
assume a certain degree of superiority, intone, or style, or form, over
the Joint Stock Bankians, but it is not generally acknowledged by
the latter. They like to tell anecdotes of the olden times, that have
descended to them from those days when Joint Stock Banks were
not, and when Bankers' profits must have been fabulous indeed;
Such as the story of the old gentleman who called one day in Lombard
Street, in the greatest possible trepidation, and trusted that his
Bankers would kindly excuse his inadvertence in having, quite
unintentionally, drawn his account below £10,000, a circumstance
for which he humbly apologised, and which he promised faithfully
should never occur again! And of the thoughtful Sailor, who, going
into GLYN's with a cheque for £25, kindly offered to take it by in-
stalments, as he did not wish to run them too hard!
A Bank Clerk is quite the oracle of his own little circle; and the
model set up by the neighbouring, Mammas, by which they fondly
hope their own rising offspring will some day profit. One prolific
Matron has been heard to say that she trusted that all her many
sons, who were equal in number to the lost tribes of Israel, and
whose names they bore, would, in process of time, all be Bank
Clerks, for they would then be models of º and be always
surrounded with heaps of ready money. Their punctuality is so
proverbial, that in some places, where there are no public clocks, the
§. set their watches by them. They are great patrons of all
inds of manly sports, which are, in some degree, necessary to their
health, as a counterpoise to their sedentary occupation... But there
is one kind of sport, if sport it can indeed now be called, having
degenerated into the very lowest and vilest form of gambling,
namely, betting on horse-racing, which is so strictly tabooed, that
any known indulgence in it would be fatal even to a Manager.
There have been some matters connected with this special form of
lunacy that are occasionally hinted at in faint whispers, but they
are, very Fº shrouded in mystery, except in some very excep-
tional case, where it is thought that some obscure allusion to them
may be of service. -- - - -
As there are considerably over a hundred Banks in the City, it is
not at all surprising that the number of Bank Clerks should amount
to very many thousands, the more especially when it is considered
what a ; are employed in the Bank of England and the
several leading Joint Stock }. The Cashiers, who of course hold
the more responsible posts in their important establishments, are
expected to set a good example to their juniors, and this they do to a
most satisfactory extent, but there is not a scintilla of truth in the
absurd rumour, most likely originated by some envious outsider, that
the Juniors have every morning to render an account of how they
spent the previous evening.
The Bank Clerks of the City are a credit to it in every respect, and
thoroughly worthy of the important position they holdin the conduct
of its enormous financial transactions.
“THE SPIDER AND THE FLY.”
(Supplementary Verses to our last week's Poem.)
WHEN off with a loud biz-wiz-wiz that little fly he flew,
There came a wobbling in the web—and there were spiders two.
“Hullo! ” cries the new-comer, “why, that fly has danced away,
As though "hº fair-spoken friend were a Ta-ran-tu-la.
e won’t then, won't then, won't then, won't then,
Wary little fly.”
Cried the Grand Old Arachne, “This game will hardly pay;
No, I must weave a finer web, and try another lay.
Stand back awhile my bulky friend, and let me have a try
To see if I can’t circumvent that very cautious fly.
Oh! won't you, won't you, won't you, won't you,
Cautious little fly?”

ROMANCE AND REALITY.
WHAT different views we take of a situation when represented on
the stage and when occurring in actual life. Englishmen as a rule
denounce the conduct of Father KELLER, as subversive of all law and
order, yet when Mr. Boucicault's Colleen Bawn, one of the best
ever written, was being performed at the Adelphi, Father
Tom, on being threatened with penal consequences, if he did not give
evidence against his parishioners—an analogous case to Father
KELLER's—used to reply solemnly and emphatically, “I should like
to see the law that can compel, a Priest to reveal the secrets of
Heaven,” which declaration, made night after night, for the many
hundred nights of its successful run at the Adelphi, was cheered voci-
ferously bycrowded English audiences, mainly composed of Londoners.
Andwhat did the Lord Mayor of jubinia tºthursdayāomore than
utter similar sentiments to those placed by Mr. Boucicault or
GERALD GRIFFIN (the author of The Collegians, from which the pla
was taken) in the mouth of Father Tomf “They (the jº
had confided to him as a Priest, and he was bound tore the state-
ments made to him in...confidence as perfectly sacred.” This was
received with “cheers” in Dublin, but in London it had been over
and over, and over again received with cheers when it was said
—on the Stage.
MR. PUNCH2S MORAL FAIRY TALES.
IV.-THE WIDEAWAKE BEAUTY.
ONCE upon a timethere lived a King and a Queen. Her Majesty had
been a Goose-girl in her youth, and in that station had acquired
much knowledge of life. When the Prince proposed to her, he
happened §. enchantment) to wear the form of a White
Cat. Many girls would have been surprised by a declaration of love
from such a suitor, but the Goose-girl did not lose her presence of
mind. “Certainly,” she replied, blushing, “just make yourself
comfortable on the dresser, while I fetch the chopper,” returnin
with which she out off the White Cat's head in the usual manner, an
turned him into the most beautiful Prince that ever was seen.
But no sooner was this transformation complete, than the Goose-
firl be to reflect on her position, and on all that it involved.
‘You have not, by any accident, a step-mother,” said she, “or a
laundress, or henwife who has determined to make you marry her
daughter, or a mother who happens to be an Ogress?”
#. Prince declared that he was free from the usual incumbrances.
“But there is another thing,” said the Goose-girl, who was of a
far-seeing disposition, “either our children, will be born when you
are at the wars, in which case a Court º will tell you the poor
little things were little animals, or there will be no young Princes at
all, which is also attended with inconveniences.”
The Prince having persuaded her that she was looking too deeply
and anxiously into the future, the marriage took F. among general
rejoicings, which were renewed on the birth of a Princess.
The christening was the most sumptuous possible, and seven
Fairies, being all that could be found in the country, were appointed
to be Godmothers, so that each might bestow a gift upon the
infant. Now, the night before the ceremony, the Queen, waking
very early, said, “My dear, did you remember to invite the Fairy
FRUTILLAP’’
“No,” said the ..
old. and blind, and deaf,
“You must get º instantly,” cried the Queen, “and ride your-
self to her cave, and insist on her coming!”
When the Queen spoke in this tone the Prince knew that he must
§ her. He rose, grumbling, saddled his own horse, and returned
with the Fairy on his pillion.
At the christening party, after each Fairy had offered her gifts, the
old Fairy rose, and there was much anxiety to hear her remarks.
“Had I been neglected,” she began, “as commonly happens, it was
my intention to have made you fall asleep for a hundred years.
But, as the King has paid me the unusual attention of bringing me
himself to his Palace, I add to the infant Princess's other attractions,
this, that she shall be the most Wideawake Princess in the world.
But, as I was invited late, I prophesy that she shall marry a Man
with a Hump.”
This terrible gift made the whole assembly tremble, and fall to
crying violently. At this instant a young Fairy stepped from behind
the curtain and said, “Do not, O ; and Queen, thus deeply
afflict yourselves; from this alliance you shallwin immortal renown.”
Whether this Fairy's º Was ..º. or not, and if so,
kow, is a narrative which must be reserved for another occasion.

(Before Mr. Commissioner PUNCH.)
A Newspaper Proprietor was introduced.
The Commissioner. I believe you have to complain of the unsatis-
factory condition of the Law relating to Libel?
Applicant. That is the case, Sir, and when I complain Irepresent
practically the whole of the Metropolitan and Provincial Press. You
may have noticed that, a few days ago, a meeting was held in the
neighbourhood of, Fleet Street, composed of journalistic delegates
from all parts of the United Kingdom, who, in spite of their political
differences, were unanimous in their condemnation of the existing
Statutes.
The Commissioner. I saw a brief º of the proceedings, and
understood that the matter was referred to a thoroughly representa-
tive Committee.
34pplicant. Quite so, and no doubt the outcome of the Committee's
deliberations will be ultimately a new and better law.
The Commissioner. In the meanwhile, how can I assist you?
Applicant. By allowing me to say, that it is the last wish of News-
paper Proprietors, to substitute licence for liberty. The British Press
is jealous of its reputation, and would in no way weaken the hands
of the Executive to prevent or punish real scandal. At present the
great majority of Plaintiffs in libel actions, are either men of straw,
or persons of extreme, I may say, almost diseased sensibility. The
latter, perhaps, deserve pity, but the former are pests to society:
Very frequently a speculative solicitor is mixed up in the suit, and
then, whatever be the result, neither plaintiff nor defendant derives
any benefit from theJ. Again, it is not an uncommon
matter º in the provinces) for some person to commence an
action against a Newspaper Proprietor entailing on the defence heavy
expenses, and then coolly to drop it before it comes on for trial.
The Commissioner. Has the Newspaper Proprietor in such a matter
no redress?
b 4|ant. Absolutely none. He has to pay his costs, grin and
ear 15,
. The Commissioner. Do you consider Criminal Prosecutions in
Libel cases desirable?
Applicant. Certainly not—a criminal action for libel is an ana-
chronism. It was no doubt appropriate, when a journalist dated
from Grub Street, and was familiar with the wrist-holes of the
pillory. Nowadays libel of an individual should be purely a civil
matter—the Common Law is sufficient protection to public morals.
The Commissioner. Were I inclined to be frivolous, I might point
out that a libel, in one sense, could hardly be considered a civil
matter. But, as I am in a decidedly grave mood, and very much in
earnest, I can only suggest that the further consideration of this
extremely important subject should be deferred until the Committee,
to which you have alluded, shall have published their Report.
[The Applicant thanked the Commissioner, and withdrew.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,
OTHER pursuits, notably the completion of my great forensic
volume, A Handbook to Law, from the Earliest Ages to the Present
Day, have prevented me from sending you any copy for a considerable
time. When I have finished what I may fairly call my masterpiece
—I am making rapid progress, having got as far as Swedish Admiralty
practice in the Tenth Century—I may send you a few more papers.
In the meanwhile I cannot refrain from recounting a recent ex-
perience which has caused me much thought, and which appears to
me worthy of the closest investigation by those interested in solving
F. connected with the darker and more mysterious side of
uman nature.
A few days since, I happened to have business of a purely per-
sonal character, in one of our Halls of Justice in a south-western
suburb. I alighted at the station nearest to my destination on the
District Railway, and before I could ask the way, was directed to
take the second turning to my right, and then the first to my left,
“ and there it would be just before me.” I followed these instrug-
tions, and soon lost myself in a labyrinth of streets. I saw an intel-
ligent costermonger, and proposed asking him to direct me on my way.
Before I had time to speak, he in his turn gave me instructions,
“Second to the left past the public.’ouse, and there it is just afore
ou.” The man was unquestionably right—I took the second to the
eft and unearthed the County Court I required, or rather the
County Court that required me. But the thought-reading did
not end here. I entered, the building and found my way to the
vestibule of the Court itself. I opened a door, and was about to
enter, when I was stopped by a policeman. “You are wrong, Sir,”
said this intelligent officer. “This is the door for the Plaintiffs—
}. is yonder, with "Defendant’ written over it.”. As a matter of
act he had correctly indicated the entrance of which I was actually
in search 1 I was astonished, and felt that this interesting incident
was more, much more, than a coincidence!

RIGHTS AND WRITERS.
LAST Wednesday, The Incorporated Society of Authors, met under
the presidency of Mr. F. O. ADAMs, to hear Mr. JoHN HollingsHEAD
lecture on Dramatic Property. The principal representatives of the
Incorporated Society of Authors, were, according to the º:
report, principally actors and theatrical managers, including -
Tool.E, who when called upon to follow Mr. HollingsHEAD with an
address to the meeting, for once in his life had nothing to say, ex-
cept “ditto to the last speaker,” who had told everyone in plain
language what everyone knew, beforehand. Mr. FRANK MARSHALL
complained that rabbits and ºng. were protected by law—why
didn't he say rabbits and onions?—but not the work of men's brains.
He could have added that Heads º: to be protected as well as
Hares, and no doubt Mr. and Mrs. KENDAL would have applauded
this sentiment. The Dramatic Authors seem to have been con-
spicuous by their, absence, perhaps because they prefer their own
“society,” what there is of it, or more probably because they were
better º in writing than in ing.
What law.can prevent “coincidences?” and, what just remedy
can there be for a sufferer by a coincidence? Old materials must be
used over and over again, and the greater the genius the more utter
is his disregard of what ordinarily talented men would consider from
a narrow-minded and selfish point of view, their private and personal
property. . Why should the Dramatic Author who has hit upon what
is to all intents and purposes the same, plot as the Novelist be
debarred from producing his play because the Novel comes out first?
Considering the large sums that authors and composers in alliance
with theatrical managers, actors, and publishers receive nowadays,
far beyond the wildest dreams of Dramatists and Composers less than
fifty years ago, we should be inclined to say, “Let well alone, for
the truth you may find at the bottom of it, will probably not be a
very pleasant one after all.”
MRs. RAM says she heard a . gentleman recite a poem the
other night. She thought he seemed rather nervous for a profes-
sional actor, but she was told afterwards that he was an Immature.

At question time BARRAN buzzing about House likeabee that had
learned a secret. “More like a London sparrow,” said LUBBoCº, who is
an authority on these matters. Looking at him as he hopped about
the House, standing still for a moment and setting his head on one
side with chirpy motion, he really was something like a sparrow.
* What's the matter with you?” I asked, as he came and planted
himself by me. “Is the floor hot, that you can't stand still, but must
be hopping around like a parched pea’’’ - -
“Floor hot?" Oh dear, no, not that I know of ?” he said, looking
round as if expecting to see some smoke somewhere. ...“By the way,

Friday.—Only yesterday warned BALFour what was in store for
him as consequence of not wearing Shamrock on St. Patrick's Day.
Not .# to wait for fulfilment of forecast. House met to-night
ostensibly to continue debate on Closure Resolution. Ominous
gathering of Irish Members. Soon as questions over DILLON rose,
and asked permission to move Adjournment, in order to discuss
matter of urgent public importance, to wit, the arrest of Father
KELLER. “Got Forty Members?” said the SPEAKER. “Yes, and
to spare,” as was shown. Whereupon JoHN, taking off his coat, and
turning up his sleeves, made a dash for BALFour. Chief Secre-
tary, .." uncomfortably on ARTHUR's Seat, not yet accustomed
to narrow limits of Treasury Bench, frowned portentously, and
grew angrily pale.
“He’ll make a mull of it, I know,” said CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN
watching him from Bench opposite. “When I was in his place, and
they got up a row like this, I took it as a matter of course. The
more they stormed, the more placid I looked; and, as it's less
exhausting to be quiet than to make a row, theyfºy caved in
first. BALFour means fighting. Might as well knock his head
against stone wall.”
BALFour, when his turn came, threw himself away. Took every-
thing seriously; trembling with righteous indignation; met insinua-
tion with retort, and flung back defiance at challenge. In short,
made a sad muddle of the whole affair, and stamped his newly-begun
career as absolutely hopeless. Immediate consequence was, that
wrangle went on for six hours. Quarter-past Eleven before Orders
of the Day reached.
Business done.—Closure Rule passed.

ROMANES AWRY.
MR. G. J. Romanes, lecturing at the Royal Institution on the mental
ifferences between the sexes, accuses woman of the defect, among others, of
“not knowing her own mind.”]
Not know her own mind? What a scandalous flout!
Why a woman's chief charm is, she's never in doubt.
Believing, rejecting, or loving or hating, -
She's always cocksure without pause for debating.
It was not a woman, invented such tras
As Logic or Parliaments; she at a dash
Flies straight to conclusions, despising the plan
Of step by step premises—leaves them to Man,
The stupid slow goose who can't rule without laws,
Believe without reason, or hate without cause.
No, Mr. Roman Es, you’re quite off the track,
Lack of certainty is not a feminine lack.
Not know her own mind? Our denial is flat;
She may know nothing else, but she always knows that."
DOUBTS
Engendered by a Recent Ethnological Controversy.
WAs Sir WALTER Scott really a Dutchman?
Did WILLIAM THE ConquEROR originally live in Whitechapel, and
cross the Channel only owing to pecuniary difficulties, eventuall
returning to fight the battle of Hastings in defiance of his creditors
Are * present inhabitants of Danes Inn clearly of Scandinavian
origin
Were both CHARLEs THE FIRST and OLIVER CROMwFLL undeniably
Irishmen?
To what nationality does Mr. GLADSTONE really belong P. Is he
as he lately gives out, a genuine Bulgarian, or does he come of a good
old Cork stock not long settled in Wales?
Does the Emperor of Russia .# as is said, to a highly respec-
table family hailing from Camberwell?
Has Mr. BIGGAR something of the Arab about him P
Are the members of the Radical Opposition in the House of Com-
mons descended from a race of Cannibals?
And, does Prince HENRY of BATTENBERG consider himself a
thorough-bred Scotchman?
KATERING FOR THE PUBLIC.
As Miss KATE WAUGHAN, is pre-eminently a dancer, dancing the
public will have from her whatever else she may wish to do. They’ll
tolerate her acting if she will only gratify them by taking just a few
steps to please them. So KATE the Gracious, KATE the Graceful, not
º “curst KATE,” accommodates her programme to the taste
and fancy of her public. If she plays Lady Teazle there's a minuet
introduced into The School for Scandal, if she º Lydia Languish
there's some dance for her in the Pump Room at Bath.
What range of characters may not the Waughan-ting ambition
attempt, if only a dance can be brought in somehow P In the old
*; of The School for Scandal one line in the bill invariably was
“Sir Harry (with a song)” by Mr. whoever might be the singer
specially engaged for this purpose.
On this plan we venture to suggest the following announcements,
which will be gratifying alike to the fair actress and her admiring
public:—
OPERA COMIQUE.
THE KATE WAUGHAN COMEDY COMPANY.
In active preparation, SHAKSPEARE's Tragedy of
MA CBETH.
Macbeth. - - - - - . MR. FoEBES-ROBERTSON.
LADY MAcbeth (with a Highland Fling). MISS KATE WAUGHAN.
Also, in the course of the season, will be presented:–
HAMLET.
Hamlet (Prince of Denmark.) . . MR. FoEBEs-ROBERTSON.
OPHELLA - - - - . MISS KATE WAUGHAN.
In which character she will dance a pas de deur, assisted by Mr.
FERNANDEz as Polonius, and a pas de fantaisie in the mad scene.
The music specially composed by Herr MEYER LUTz.
Also in preparation and to be duly announced, SHAKSPEARE's
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
BEATRICE (with several dances of the
period) . . . . . !} MIss KATE WAUGHAN.
And a Grand Revival of
ROMEO AND JULIET.
When in addition to the old Italian dances at the Capulets' Ball,
Miss KATE WAUGHAN, as Juliet, will introduce into the Potion Scene
AN ENTIRELY NEW DAGGER DANCE.
Perhaps Miss WAUGHAN may try Mrs. Haller in The Stranger,
Julia in. The Hunchback, Pauline in The Lady of Lyons, each
with their own characteristic dance. There is literally no end to
a répertoire thus refreshed and re-invigorated. “Foot it, KATE!”
as the Oxonian, in Tom and Jerry, cried out, in one of the “merry
moments” of that immortal trio:who are now so out of date, and so
utterly forgotten—and may you dance to the best of all tunes, and
be sure that there will always be an admiring audience ready and
willing to pay your piper.
Cater, KATE, for the public, by giving them the most solid food,
but-spice it with plenty of capers. Cater and caper. “KATE,
0, thou reasonest well.”
A CHANCE.
WISHING to give the#. dear advertiser every assistance in our
wer, we reproduce, from The Manchester Weekly Times the fol-
owing touching appeal:—
O CHRISTIAN WIDOWERS.—A Nobleman's Widow, of good birth,
about 40, no family, left with small income, pleasing, sweet-tempered,
cultured, domesticated, fond of children. Desires Settled Home and a high-
minded Protestant Husband of 50, or older, seeking domestic happiness with
a devoted, loving Christian wife.—Address—
No, we won't give the address, or there'd be such a rush. Besides |
—ahem!—but no matter.
A PUFF FoR THE CANVAs.-Mr. Punch begs to acknowledge the
receipt of some “canvas” note-paper and envelopes from Messrs.
WALKER & Co. He had heard of and eaten a canvas-backed duck,
but had not yet come across a canvas-backed envelope. As the
material, being substantial, cannot be easily seen through, the canyas
envelopes will be invaluable for electioneering purposes. Seeing that
ink dries on it rapidly, and that writing on it is easy—he is “writing
on it” now, and finds the task a simple one, Mr. Punch considers
it the very canvas for a good sale.

“By THE way, You R FRIEND O'LEARY DiNED witH ME LAST NIGHT.
A DULL Dog HE is ' "
“Oh, THAT DEPENDs on what CoMPANY HE 's IN 1."
WHAT
ANOTHER ONE.
MR. PhILIPs's The Dean's Daughter is not equal to
his As in a Looking Glass. Neither book is intended
for the perusal, of “the young, person.” We couldn't
even recommend it conscientiously as a study of character
for Miss DoRothy DENE–but The Dean's Daughter,
after one of the chief characters has made his untimely
exit never to reappear, will scarcely interest the ex-
perienced and blasé novel-reader.
The author does not consistently sustain the character
he has assumed. His quotations from DICKENs and
THACKERAY are not at all what such a woman as the
Dean's Daughter would make. Again, he loves to
illustrate a situation with well-worn old stories which
however they may be, he generally contrives to spoil
in the telling. One of these—which it is needless to say
we have told so admirably ourselves after dinner, handing
it down from our father and grandfather—about the man
tying his shoe at Crockford's, Mr. PHILIPs ruins. He
casts SHERIDAN for the hero, and takes all the point out
of the story by elaboration. We can forgive him for
.# a novel without, a moral, but, for spoiling this
dear old story—never! We like Mr. PHILIPs's estimate
of Brighton, and his appreciation of eleven o'clock in the
morning as an excellent hour for anything.
The Dean himself is a combination of Pecksniff and
Eccles in one ecclesiastical character. On the stage
he would be played by Mr. JoHN CLAYTON, better
as a Dean of Comedy than of Farce. The earlier por-
tion reminded us somewhat of Nancy; but it is not
equal to that very clever work of Miss BRoughton's.
Its ending is abrupt and artistic according to Mr. Weller's
Valentine theory. Perhaps she will be continued in his
next, and shown as going on the stage, making a hit, and
settling down into a dull and respectable middle age,
when her divorced husband, a nonagenarian, will be con-
vinced of her innocence. She will give him his gruel,
and he will make a will in her favour.
The blasé novel-reader especially, will be disappointed,
as when reading Mr. PHILIPs's work, he will expect more
“fillips” than he will get.

ON THE TOWING-PATH.
(A Cantabrigian Canto.)
THE wind is brisk on the flowing tide;
Like hammer'd silver the water wide
Is blown to knops and ridges;
The battling sunbeams come and go, .
And the tugs puff up with their flocks in tow,
And lumbering lighters, heavy and slow,
Drift, broadside on, through the bridges.
The willows have taken a sunny stain,
And the underglow of the Spring again
In amber and brown is peeping;
The clouds, sun-broken, are moving free,
And the rooks caw loud from the leafless tree,
That shows in its waving tracery -
Where the wonder of leaves is sleeping.
And here they saunter, or stand at gaze,
Waterside characters, old M.A.'s,.
And “Men” of the current fashion;
Clerical types of a first-boat crew,
*...º.natty, bedecked with blue,
Schoolboy truants, and damsels true
To a vague University passion.
Butthought flies back to the “rounding grey,”
To the fenland flat, and the Autumn day,
And the path, where the patient gazer
Sees jogging along at a good round trot
With vehement shouts to you can't see what,
And a band of runners all piping hot,
The Coach in a light-blue blazer.
And then the sullen and sluggish stream
Is woke by the stroke and lit by the gleam
Of broad blades strenuous lashing,
And paans of hope in our hearts we sing,
AD REGINAM JUBILANTEM.
Though we soon tail off in a panting string,
And the boat sweeps on with a lifting swing
And a certain amount of splashing.
And away goes pounding the old grey horse
Whose task was more a matter of “course'
Than any Gee's that has hair on;
And back as the tinkling bells recall
To much-cut Chapel, or cheery Hall,
Across the river, while shadows fall,
By the ferry that’s kept by Charon.
Year after year unchanging change
Still finds new talent of equal range
In reading or cutting capers:
Still Dons are developed from Undergrads,
And Lights of Reason from roaring lads,
And the cranky ones are running their fads
In Parliament or the papers.
But the boat is coming; and, dark or light,
A 'Warsity Eight is a gallant sight,
No matter how grave we’re growing;
And dear to the man with an open mind
In the sporting columns next day to find
Such opposite praises and blame combined,
Such various views of rowing.
They write it up, and they write it down,
And it may or may not excite the town
Like a war or a Cabinet crisis;
But whether the people go or stay,
No heart is callous on Boat-race Day,
That ever has seasoned work with play
Beside the Cam or the Isis.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted From
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 20.-House crowded to:
night. vident anticipation of something in the wind. Usual
number of questions... GEORGE HAMILTON announced that "we have
decided to celebrate the Jubilee by Naval, Review.” Set forth par-
ticulars of programme. As he put it, “the Review will embrace a
large number of º: cruisers, torpedoes, and gunboats.”
Apoison, Q.C., sitting just behind First Lord, listened with growing
interest.' Surely luncheon and dinner couldn't be left out of the
arrangements? Face beamed with increasing delight. Rose soon
as Lord GeoRGE made an end of speaking....House observed with
interest that though it was nearly Five o’Clock ADDISON was in
morning dress. Wanted to know whether Members of the House
would receive invitations to be present at Review; what arrange-
ments would be made for, taking, them to Portsmouth; and, he
added, smacking his lips, while his face was illumined with seraphic
smile, “what accommodation will be made for them whilst there?”
In his mind's eye ADDIson evidently saw it all. The saloon
carriage in special train; the hampers of soda and brandy; the
cigars and the champagne; the arrival at Portsmouth; the carriages
to meet them; the drive to the Dockyard; the *. that the
sea was “choppy;” the quick determination; the return by land to
the hotel; the snack, and then the dinner, the hilarity broken in
upon now and then by echo of distant firing from the Fleet; Then
the return home; the joyous journey; more cigars, soda, and
brandy; and the determination to all about the review in the
newspapers next morning, Apdison's prophetic soul beheld all this;
§: an unctuous tone in his voice as he made inquiries. d
EoRGE said it was a little early to make such arrangements. .
“Wery well,” said ADDIson, “I’ll call again; ” and, sinking
back in his seat, quietly dozed. -
Tuesday, 2 A.M.–House still sitting, and likely to sit, and this
only the muttering of the coming storm. Began at Five o’Clock
yesterday afternoon....BAEFour gave notice to, move, for leave to
introduce Coercion Bill. SMITH followed up notice with another, to
ask for all the time of the House to consider the Bill. Then, amid
wild cheers from the Irish Members, and unmistakable approval
from Liberals, John MoRLEY gave notice to oppose Motion for prece-
dence. , Sudden transformation, scene. Hitherto, for eight weeks,

morning. Government, sorely handicapped by inability to put
Clöture in operation. The Minority being over forty, requisite that
two hundred Members should vote for Clóture. Messengers out in all
directions, knocking at doors, pulling bells, and creating wild appre-
hension in the West-End. Åt Half-past Two, thrill of genuine
emotion ran through Conservative ranks. Shortly after midnight,
CHRISTOPHER SYKEs had irº inton his way home from dinner;
standing at the Bar in
evening-dress, had scanned the
House with that curiously grave
inquiring glance peculiar to him.
Always expecting that sometime
House of Commons will suddenly
discover how ludicrously odd are
#!". and will volun-
tarily and permanently dissolve.
CHRISTOPHER much interested in
fulfilment of this expectation.
Whenever he passes neighbour-
hood, makes point of looking in
to see if House is still sitting.
...Yes,” said he, looking round
with 'slightly-parted lips and
troubled glance, “here they are

Can't make it out. But they’ll
find it out some day, and what a
rush to the doors there’ll be!
Think I’ll get off home. Rush
might commence now, and me in
the doorway.”
So walked off, turning as he
passed through doorway, to see if
at this last moment the crisis had
come..., House still sitting, Mem-
§ still talking, and so home to

“Early to Bed”

Two hours later CHRISTOPHER knocked up
urgently entreated to come down.
House not onl
through the livelong night. Felt more dazed than ever, ut
call f duty imperative; so got out of bed, selected for wear, a dull
brown suit as being indicative of undecided opinions on the situation,
and made his way down to the curiously fascinating abode of
mysteries. What a cheer they gave him, when at Half-past Two he
was once more discovered in changed costume standing at the Bar
and gazing wonderingly round ! ever since he brought in the
famous Crab and Lobster Bill has he had such an ovation. -
Qn the whole, proceedings not worth getting out of bed to witness.
Only one flash of genuine #. humour varied the monotony of pro-
ceedings. Whilst Windbag SExTon delivering one of an intermin-
able series of harangues, BARTLEY rose from the Benches opposite.
Wanted opinion of Chairman on point of order. , ''An Hon. Member
opposite,” he said, “has promised that if he catches me outside he
ill black my eyes. Might I,” he continued, as if really anxious to
be informed upon the point, “ask if that is in order?”
Chairman acknowledged that it was -
not. Then up jumped J. O'ConnoE, and '4 ///_
denied that he had used the words,
which no one had attributed to him per-
sonally. Tired remainder of Committee

very well in brief time; wisely content to rest on laurels. (By the
. does anybody ever rest on laurels?) SINCLAIR, who had pre-
ceded him, delivered himself of new theory on Irish affairs; Cir-
cumstances, he said, had been created by past injustice, and having
existed long time the injustice had become mellowed. Lockwood
happily paraphrased this. , Try
our justice,” he said, “and if you
find that doesn't agree with you,
try our fine old mellowed injus-
tice.” That did very well for a
eech as times go. Besides
LADSTONE wanted to speak be-
fore dinner to-night. "Private
Bills and Questions occupied two
hours and a half; so LoCKwooD
stood aside, and GLADSTONE
speaks in his stead.
Immense reception from Oppo-

down it seemed the House had
decided debate might as well close
here. Fact is it was close upon
dinner hour, and nobody with
carefully prepared speech inclined
to sacrifice it. SPEAKER slowly
rose to put the question. Con-
sternation on Opposition Benches,
complacency on Conservative.
- Nothing better for Government
than that debate should collapse, and division be forthwith taken.
Modesty unusually marked even in Irish camp. No one so aggressive
as to present himself with speech. Hear whispered entreaties on
various benches. “You get up,” “No, you’d better speak.” “I
think you’d do it better.” Seconds flying; crisis approaching.
SPEAKER had recited question, and was about to put it. Smile
broadened on Conservative Benches.
Then Joseph GILLIS came to the front and saved the debate,
Quite by accident,(as it appeared) he stuck a pin in the fleshy part
of CHANGE. In the pained surprise of the moment CHANCE sprang
to his feet.. “Mr. CHANCEl", cried the SPEAKER, under the impres:
sion that his eye had been designedly caught. In these circum-
stances no help for it, and QHANCE proceeded to deliver his speech,
which kept the thing going during the dinner hour. “Quite a happy
chance that,” JoEY said, with a twinkle in his eye. At the same
time careful to avoid the Hon. Member for rest of sitting.

Sir Robert-how he must nitely thank his Godfathers, and God-

Loyal Toastes, and the rest kept the ball rolling capitally. Lord
General PAGET told us as he come of a fighting race, and was the only

not satisfied with complementing me by repeating my remark that

Akorse they drank Mr. LABBYSHARE and BRADLoR's health and

like the Spectaclemakers, poor fellers] they always had, and the
always would keep up thé grand old horsepitality of the renowne
City of London. that's a great consolation to us poor Waiters in
these raddicle and grumbling times.
Then up stood a reellyfine specimen of a nobel minded Hem. Pea,
and he proposed, with all his art and all his mind, the good helth of
the Copperashun. Ah, his was summut like a speech his was. Ah,
if there was a few more members like Mr. Isaacs, what a much more

inquiry about the Copperashun is a going on, and the first thort as
game agross me after I had bin a standing there a little time was
this rather remarkabul one. I have herd sumwhere that, once upon

loºking at anybody's face, what their real charackter was, an
whether they was relieable or not. I think his name was sumthink
in the Layatery line, so I spose as he relied a good deal on wash-

Chancellor (interrupting). What for? For remitting old tax, or
imposing new one?
Secretary. Well, it's for remission. -
Chancellor (sternly). How often am I to say that I won't remit
anything? Do you suppose that I occupy this high position in order
to make myself pleasant to the public f My duty, and I may add
my pleasure also, is to find out exactly the most generally unpopular
and unfair tax that I possibly can, and then to impose it.
Secretary (soothingly). Quite so. I quite understand that. That’s
an elementary part of the business of a Chancellor of the Exchequer,

suggestion. hy not raise the tax on dogs to ten shillings, and put
one on cats and poultry as well? Is there any way in which I could
make myself more financially disagreeable than that?
Secretary. I don't know of any,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S MORAL FAIRY TALES.
W.—THE MAN WITH THE HUMP.
(Being the Sequel of “The Wideawake Beauty.”)
You have heard how the Wideawake Beauty was born, and how
the Fairy predicted, to the grief of all, that she would marry a Man
with a Hump.
Now, you must also learn that a Scotch Fairy, who was in attend-
ance when the
Princess saw the
light, had, with
the bestintentions,
presented her with
a most fatal gift.
“My child,” she
said, “you shall
never see a joke,
and shall be per-
fectly without any
sense of humour.”
The father and
mother of the
Princess thought
little enough of
this, at the time,
because they were
occupied with
lamenting, the
destiny which was
to unite their
daughter to a Man
with a Hump.
About this date
a neighbouring
Queen had a little
son, who wore a
hunch upon his
back, and was besides so far from beautiful, that it was for some
time. doubted whether he had the form of a human creature.
A fairy, however, who was in attendance as usual, assured his
arents that notwithstanding his want of * he would make
imself eeable to everybody on account of his great wit and
talents. . She added that this was not all, for that she had also
bestowed on him the Fº. of endowing the person he should love
best in the world with the very same qualities. -
This was a great consolation to his mother, and no sooner did, he
begin to talk, than he said the funniest things in such a manner that
every one adored him.
Meanwhile, the Wideawake Princess, though in other matters ex-
ceedingly acute, was the despair of all who enjoyed a joke. She
never saw what there was to laugh at, and in the gravest manner,
would discuss, and disprove, any little harmless piece of nonsense or
fun that came to her ears. In vain were the best Masters chosen for
her, one by one they withdrew in despair. The Princess, as she grew
up, attracted all by her loveliness, and her advice was sought on the
very gravest matters, but only then. The nobles of the Court, afraid
of i.f at dinner next a Princess who had never seen a joke, began
to travel into distant countries, leaving their estates and domestic
concerns. The Princess even argued that there were no. †. iust
as she believed that there were no ghosts, because, she said, she had
never seen either the one or the other. Meanwhile the Court became
so mournful and deserted, that even the Princess (who was extremely
sensible, too much so in fact,) felt the gloom.
Qften she would wander alone, in haunted places of the forest,
wringing her hands, and exclaiming, “Ah, if I could, were it onl
once, see a joke, even if it were no .. than my thumb. Ah,
would willingly marry the man who enabled me to see one joke.”
While she thuswept at her ease over her hard fate, she perceived
a young man of short stature, and with a hump, approaching her, he
was at the same time very handsomely dressed. This was no other
than the Prince of whom you have heard, but whose name, at this
e in the hº it is forbidden to pronounce. The Prince had
fallen violently in love with the Princess, from the portraits he had
everywhere seen of her, and he was delighted at so unlooked-for an
opportunity of meeting her alone.
Observing, after the first compliments were over, that she appeared
very, melancholy, he said, “I cannot imagine, Madam, how it is
possible for a lady of such beauty as yours to be so unhappy as you
appear; for, though I can boast of having seen many handsome ladies,
I assure you that none can be compared to you. One who is so
lº should be insensible to every misfortune.”
“I had much rather,” said the Princess, “be as º
; pºssessed of wit, than be the beauty you praise, an
Oke
as you are,

mured the Prince, adding, “if that is all, Madam, I can make you
perfectly happy.”
“By what means?” said the Princess.
have the power,” said the Prince, “to bestow the gift, not only
of seeing, but of making jokes, on the person I am to love best in the
world, and as that person, Madam, can only be yourself, it depends
on your own will to be the wittiest lady on earth....Willyou not buy
this gift with the priceless treasure of your hand?”
Said the Princess, who was very wideawake, “I have vowed to
marry any man who can make me see a joke. But, before doing
aught that can never be recalled, I must ask you to give an example
of your power.” -
. “ My am,” said the Prince, “your beautiful Christian name

“JUDY,” answered the Princess.
“If, therefore, you are enabled not only to appreciate, but to utter
a pleasantry, it would be a - come now, think,” said the Prince,
putting forth all his magic power.
“A jeu d'esprit ‘’’ cried the Princess, shrieking with delighted
laughter, and clapping her hands. “Oh, I have seen a jokel How
delicious it is.”
“By no means bad for a beginner,” said the Prince, and the
Princess hurried to rejoice with her friends, and present to them the
object of her choice. His nose, which had at first appeared to her
somewhat exaggerated, now looked merely aquiline, and gave him a
martial and heroic air, his hump was no more than the easy carriage
in which men of quality indulge themselves. Her parents were far
too happy to be critical, and thus the Princess JUDY married Prince

“FOR THE THIRD TIME OF ASKING.”

New Clerk. “Oh DEAR No, SIR. Most PERLITE THEY were, SIR.
THEY 'oped I'd cALL AGAIN, SIR . "
'SAID
ALL IN THE WRONG.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I have read with astonishment and indignation several
papers in Punch, intended, Hºnº, to cast discredit on that truly noble insti-
tution—the fondon School Board." ſcan find no language sufficiently strong to
condemn the folly and the wickedness of this attempt. nsidering all that the
School Board has done, is doing, and will do in the future, it almost makes one
despair of the cause of progress and humanity. And this is more especially
the case as the School Board just at the present time has taken a new and a very
startling “departure.” Whatever may have been its shortcomings in times
past, it is now resolutely prepared to amend them.
On the 17th of the present month (which happened to be Saint. Patrick's
Day) it was unanimously resolved:—
“That a Special Committee be appointed to consider the present subjects and modes
of instruction in the Board Schools, and to report, whether such changes can be made
as shall secure that children leaving school shall be more fitted than they now are to
perform the duties and work of life before them.”
The mover of this most wise and just resolution, was of opinion that the
children should work with their brains in the morning and with their hands at
night, that is to say, English grammar and algebra in the morning, and
cabinet-making or cookery at night. Another speaker said:—
“It could not but be felt that the public elementary education had not given the
country all that was wanted, for the boys educated in public elementary schools, scorned
all handicraft work, and wanted to be clerks, while the girls in like manner scorned all
domestic service.”
The motion was agreed to without a dissentient voice.
Are not the members of the School Board, one and all, to be congratulated on
the discovery, they have now made? Your cantankerous contributors, may
ssibly say they have been a long time about it. But Rome was not built in a
ay; and if, after sixteen years' experience, the School Board are unanimously
of opinion that they are on the wrong tack, what can be
wiser and nobler than to confess their error? How
many years it may take them to get on the right tack
is utterly immaterial. What is sixteen years, or twice
sixteen years, in the life of a nation? The School Board,
at all events, have learned much, although they tell us
that hitherto they have taught little to the : -
I still notwithstanding have unbounded enoein,
and veneration for the School In the discovery of
an unpalatable truth, it is true that they have spent afew
millions. But can truth be too dearly bought? I say
emphatically, no., The School Board is now about to
turn oyer a new leaf, and I shall wait with patience
but with confidence for the result. I remain,
Mr. Punch, your Constant Reader,
AN INDIGNANT RATEPAYER.
TO SYDENHAM.
(A Well-wisher's Ode of Advice.)
0 FAIR Sydenham, is then thy glory,
Thy Science, thy popular Art,
Just about, like some mythical story,
To fade on our lips and depart |
Must thou, then, after all thine adventures,
Confess that the struggle is o'er,
Since the holders of unpaid debentures
Will wait for their money no more!
Can it be that they so under-rate thee,
And watch without shedding a tear, .
The dread doom that they know must await thee,
When steps in the stern auctioneer.
And yet over the tale I should stammer,
For the thing too cruel would seem,
Should I witness thee brought to the hammer
'Twould be like some horrible dreaml
Of thy fortunes a precious reviver,
Were things, ahl to go with thee hardl
Thy big organ bought in for a fiver,
hy roof sold at so much a yard.
Then imagine thy Courts rent and shattered,
º greenery no longer fair;
Thy famed Kings and Queens, too, all scattered,
Knocked down, say, at threepence a pair
See thy quaint Aboriginal races
Subserving a new style of Art,
Now adorning, in clothes, with their graces
Some famed East-End tailoring mart 1
All thy triumphs of painter and gilder
Disposed of for what they can fetch;
Thy site in the hands of the builder!
h! perish the harrowing sketch!
So, arouse thee! The prospect before thee
is surely inviting and clear.
Let a spirited programme restore thee
Thy fortunes, this Jubilee Year.
For South Kensington no more competing
Treats thee, her old rival, with scorn.
So do thou, all her tactics repeating,
Set up for thyself thy Cremorne,
Quick, install the required apparatus,
Light up every terrace and glade.
Do thy best. Entertain us and fêteºus,
Thy efforts will soon be repaid.
It mayn't be the precise recreation
That once thou dids’t dream to provide,
But Cremorning suits this generation,
And borne on the stream thou must glide.
So, wake up! To the wheel put thy shoulder,
And commence but thyself the attack
Thou'lt soon tell the debenture stock holder,
Of dividends he'll find no lack.
So, fair Sydenham, see thy lights kindled,
Thy music set up; thou’lt soon pay,
And thy takings, that once had sodwindled,
Scare all jerry-builders away.

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. XXIII.-“SNAPPY SOMERs.”
HE was called SNAPPY for two reasons, firstly because, whether in
the hunting-field or “on the sweet shady side of Pall Mall,” he was
always so faultlessly neat in -
his “get up;” and secondly, -
because his temper was so
perfectly imperturbable. Men
often acquire these nicknames
in sheer irony, and one of the
most irascible gentlemen in
the West of Ireland, in the
days when *. “blazed,”
G
was well-known by the sobri-
quet of Milky. Going. His
most malignant enemy could
not accuse SNAPPY of being
snappish in disposition, A.
indeed it was recorded of him, 7%
that upon one occasion at a
cricket-match, he chanced to
tread upon a dog, and instead
of the usual formula of “Get
out, you brute!” which is
wont to escape our lips at
such mischance, SNAPPY
simply exclaimed, “f beg
our pardon.” But for all
is quiet manner Mr. SomERs
was pretty good all round.
He did in his own vernacular |º
most things a little, but then zºº”
his little happened to be *
better than most men's, a good deal...Mr. Som ERs, for instance,
rarely said much about his exploits with the trigger; but if you
happened to meet him at a country house cover-shooting, you would
find that the head-keeper pl him where “the rocketers” came
highest and fastest, and, if you had leisure to observe his performance,
would notice that there were few birds sailed over his head that were
not satisfactorily accounted for. -
About his hunting achievements he was similarly reticent. Some
one of his friends when a frost stopped the fun and sent hunting-men
up to town, would exclaim:— -
“I say, SNAPPY, you’d a real good thing with the Quorn, the other
day, hadn't you? ere you out?” -
‘Yes, nice gallop; ” but he would not mention that he had “set
the field,” and had the hounds to himself for about a quarter of an
Our.
A neat, slight, fair-haired little man, with quiet manner and low-
toned voice, one would hardly suspect him of being one of the boldest
riders that ever crossed a country, and most assuredly you were not
likely to gather it from his own lips, and yet he was a steeple-chase
jockey of some celebrity. SNAPPY SOMERs perhaps rode more queer-
tempered horses in the course of the year than any gentleman rider
in the country. , His patience and determination were invaluable on
animals of this description.
“Glad you won your money,” was his reply to an enthusiastic
follower, who had supported him successfully at Sandown. “You’re
rather lucky, for I nearly made a mess of it. I should never have let
GEORGE: MoRRIS get so near me at the finish, if I had known it.”
“Pooh! what did that matter?” rejoined the other.
“Matter!” replied SoxERs. “IIe can ride my head off.”
He is to be seen on every race-course in the racing season, but is
more given to frequent the paddock than the lawn. He is never seen
in the betting-ring, and is not given to air either his opinions or
speculations on coming events, and yet he is a man who is constantly
in possession of very accurate information. Ask him what is to win,
say the Derby, and he will tell you that he is no good at conundrums,
but if pressed by his intimates, will admit that he has heard Macaroon,
it is thought by those connected with him, will run well, and further
cross-examination by the privileged, may elicit the fact that he has
thrown away a pony upon it himself. One of his chums is wont to
say—‘‘I’d rather follow one of SNAPPY’s “thrown away ponies’ than
another Johnnie's certainty.”
He is usually up in town more or less all the season, though the
exigences of racing call him away for a few days pretty frequently;
is much É. to attending the meets of the Four-in-hand an
Coaching Clubs, where every one seems to know him, and he is very
often to be seen on the top of one of the drags. His friends are wont
to make much of him and he is a pretty constant diner-out, though a
most abstemious one, but he eschews crushes and never sets foot in a
ball-room. Next to being at the head of the first flight when hounds
are flying, his chief delight is “screwing home an outsider” at
Sandown or Kempton Park; still there is not a trace of horseyness
in his ordinary attire, and, judging by his usual conversation, he
knows no more about turf matters than a Bishop. His racing get-up
is the perfection of dandyism, indeed his friends go, so far as to say
that “SNAPPY don't care what sort of a brute he rides, but that he
can't stand an ugly jacket.” “Rather too pretty to be a workman,”
said, the sporting fraternity, when he made his first appearance,
“between the Flags; ” but they speedily changed their opinion, and
whatever Mr. Somers' mount may be, it is always r ed with a
certain amount of respect.
Still, for all, his imperturbable temper, SNAPPY SoxERs could
administer a quiet rebuke to pushing people, when they attimes took
the liberty of asking him whether he “fancied his chance” without
any acquaintance to warrant the question.
“The state of the betting,” he replied, on one of these occasions,
“would best indicate my prospects; as for myself, I have not as yet
set up as a prophet.” -
SoMERs, º, gets as much fun out of life as most men. He is
not rich, and he doubtless one or two extravagant tastes. Neither
hunting nor racing are the amusements of a poor man; but, a light
weight and a fine horseman, he gets the ; of a good º other
men's horses, which helps out his own rather limited stud, and gives
him the command of quite double the hunters he actually owns.
Racing the same; by dint of a shrewd head and the assistance of
some valuable hints from his numerous turf friends, owners, trainers,
&c., he manages to about pay his expenses every year, and so have
his fun for nothing, while he always vows that though he does not so
much as own a flower-pot, thanks to his friends, he enjoys as good
shooting as any man in England. This, though, is due in part to
himself. He can shoot.
He is a quiet, somewhat taciturn man, and this may be one cause
of his popularity. It is astonishing how appreciated a listener
is by those whose tongues are oiled. SNAPPY is not given to those
histories which some men dedicate their declining years to retailing.
He has only one story, which it seems incumbent on him to tell at
stated intervals.
“Some fellows are always in rows,” he will observe. “I can't
conceive how they manage it. Never get into rows myself, never
t into one but once, that though, was a scorcher. How was it?

and after dinner. I strolled into the suburbs with a pal, to smoke a
cigar and get a little fresh air. Suddenly two or three fellows passed
us; one of whom jostled against me, and knocked my hat off. #. my
politest way I requested him to pick it up, he ; by a loud
guffaw, I rejoined that if he didn't pick it up, I’d e him. There
was an immediate cry from his friends of . A ring! a ring! and my
opponent, taking off his coat, said he'd like to see me do it.”
“Well, I rather fancied myself with my hands at that time. I’d
been taking lessons in town, and thought I should rather astonish the
yokel. He was much about my own size, and we at once set to in
the summer moonlight. I º soon discovered I’d caught a
tartar, and though I certainly had pasted him a bit, I was getting
most terribly knocked about myself. After four rounds I began to
think of following out the advice contained in one of WHYTE
MELVILLE's stories, and tell my backer to give my opponent's second
a sovereign to take his principal away. at once a gentleman
came out of the crowd, and said, “I beg your on, Sir, but your

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH*S MORAL FAIRY TALES.
WI.-PUSS IN B00Ts.
THERE was a Miller once who had three sons, and when he died, he
#" Mill to the eldest, his Ass to the second, and his Cat to the
1rol.
The owner of the Cat was in despair, “for, when I have sold his
body to the pastry-cook, and made a cap of his skin, what,” said he,
4. Yº: left of
my patrimony; or
rather, indeed, of
my catrimony?”
he Puss, who
was just inside
the cupboard-
door, said, “My
good Master, do
not afflict me b
entertaining suc
pessimistic, I will
not say, such pus-
symistic views.
Pussil animity
never brought a
man goodfortune.
Get me a pair of
boots made, and
ou shall soon
ave excellent
mews of me!”
The young
man's first idea
was to cut off the
Cat's head, sup-
posing that he
- was the Editor of
a facetious periodical suffering under enchantment. , But as the Cat
assured him that this was not the case, he succeeded, not without
difficulty, in procuring a pair of boots for the Cat, which Puss put
: without the assistance of a friendly jack from the neighbouring
stream.
Equipped in his boots, the Cat entrapped several rabbits and hares,
which he carried, with the compliments of his Master, the Marquis of
CARABAs, to the King's Court. " His Majesty, who had lately passed
a Rabbits and Hares' bill, had consequently suffered from the total
extinction of ground game in his dominions. He therefore warmly
welcomed Puss, and entreated to be introduced to the Marquis. The
Cat promised that this should be done, and, without explaining what
he called (we regret to say) his “purrpuss,” he induced the Miller's
son to bathe in a stream near the road where the King's carriage
would pass. He next concealed his master's clothes, and when the
carriage appeared with the King and Princess in it, screamed,
“Help, my Lord is drowning !”. The attendants rushing to the spot,
met Puss, who assured them that, as the Marquis was swimming, his
clothes had been stolen by robbers. The King's own portmanteau
supplied a splendid suit of velvet, silk and lace, and the amazed
young man found himself sitting beside the Princess.
As he was a great reader of good books, he at once understood the
situation. The King, who was fond of horses, was driving himself,
and the Miller's son had an opportunity of speaking to the beautiful
but Socialistic Princess.
“Madam,” said he, “let me crave your pardon for an unwitting
offence. There is some extraordinary blunder. I am no Marquis.”
“I detest rank!” said the Princess.
“I am no man of property—” -
“Property is robbery, philosophers say,” observed the Princess,
with her sweetest smile;" ah! how I wish I could lead the people
to recover their own.” -
“But I am the son of a Miller, Madam, a man cursed with a clever
Cat, my only possession.”
“A Miller T. One of the People,” said the Princess, her heart now
completely enthralled, “oh, would that I were a Miller's daughter!—
It is the Miller's daughter
Has grown so dear, so dear.
That I’ve forgot the lady
Hight CLARA WERE DEVERE!”
sang the sweet Princess. -
is was what ladies call “giving” the Miller's son “encourage-
ment.” Filled with alarm, he was on the point of leaping from the
carriage, when he saw his Cat, flying along the road for dear life,
with one boot off and one boot on, pursued by an Ogre.
To spring from the seat, to draw his rapier, to deceive the Ogre's
parry in contrecarte with a doublez, dégagez, vite J and to riposte in
seconde, was, to the Miller's active son, #. work of a moment!
As the baffled monster lay bleeding on the turf, he asked him,
“why were you chevying my Cat?”
“The confounded brute,” said the Ogre, “had got me to show off,
and change myself into a mouse. He was just swallowing me, when
Ire . my original sha y
“It is rather original,” said the Miller's son; “I have rarely met
an Ogre with three heads.” - - - -
“And I was avenging myself, and would have caught him, in
spite of his boots—” - - - - - -
Here the Ogre expired, and the King, knighting the Miller's son
on the spot, implored him at once to marry the Princess, with half
the kingdom for her dower. -
On condition that she might i. out a purely, anarchical pro-
amme, the Princess bestowed her hand on the Miller's son, whose
haviour, you will have remarked, was very much more honourable
than that of Miller's sons in general.
The Cat, descending from a tree in whose branches he had watched
these roceeding, observed,
“Moral.—All's well that ends well.”
ALL IN THE WRONG.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
YoUR Correspondent, “AN INDIGNANT RATEPAYER,” is cer-
tainly thankful for small mercies. He speaks with enthusiastic
admiration of the discovery just made by the School Board, that the
plan of education they have adopted for the last sixteen years is not
only worthless but absolutely mischievous. It unfits both boys and
girls for the serious business of life, by teaching the one to despise
all manual labour, and the other all domestic service. At this most
significant conclusion the School Board, without a dissentient voice,
arrived on Saint Patrick's Day of the present year, and your Cor-
*: is jubilant over the result.
s he, then, an enemy of the School Board P Far from it. He
speaks of the Board throughout with unqualified admiration, and he
assumes, notwithstanding his experience of the past, that, having
confessed their error, they will forthwith proceed to amend their
ways. His faith is wonderful; but what are we to say of his
discretion ?
I, too, Mr. Punch, am a ratepayer; I have seen my rates trebled
since the creation of the School Board; and I am, now, told that I
º: to thank my stars that, after sixteen years' work, they have
at length displayed a glimmering of common sense. There seems to
be something ominous in this, term of sixteen years, for it, appears
that it is just for this period that we have been supplying the Army
with bayonets that won't stab, and the Navy with cutlasses that
won't cut. We are always calling ourselves, though nobody else
does, a practical people. But what care we for the opinion of our
neighbours, so long as we are happy in the calm contempla on of our
superiority?
e unexpected always “happens,” so said BEACONSFIELD, and it
seems he was right, for who would have ever dreamed that the
School Board would have ever made such a confession as they did on
Saint Patrick's Day? But although they confessed much, they did
not confess all. They said nothing of the numberless half-starved |
children whose health has been impaired or ruined by the tasks im-
§ upon them. Nothing of the hundreds of thousands spent in ||
ullying and worrying their poor parents. Nothing of the money
spent in endless litigation. On all such subjects the Board are dis-
creetly silent. They draw attention only to the outcome of their
labours, namely the boys and girls whose education has been com-
F.” survival of the fittest in short, but who are fit for
nothing.
“No handicraft work for the boys, no domestic service for the
girls.” The boys all want to be clerks; what the girls want to be
we are not informed, but domestic service is not to be thought of, so
the sooner my wife and daughters take to such, work the better.
And for this have I paid trebled rates. For this have we been ||
passing Code after Code, and fixing Standard after Standard, to find
at last that the whole work must be begun afresh. I too am indig-
nant, as well as your Correspondent, not that the School-Board have
been telling the truth, but that they have been so long in telling it.
I º against my money haying been spent in injuring the
health of half the }. children in London, and of injuring the
morals of the other half.
I remain, dear Mr. Punch,
ANOTHER INDIGNANT RATEPAYER.

whirling my hair-brushes round my head I carol forth:-

drive up in a Growler. A tiger in top-boots takes my card; but,
says, the tiger, rinning, “Master's got a model there, # you
don't mind.” d! why should I mind? Not if there were
twenty sitters. So, pushing aside the youth, I run up the marble
stairs, and, putting my head in, I call out, pleasantly, “Any
beastly pictures, RTVI, my boy?” But, , before the words are
well out of my mouth, there is a roar which shakes, the house,
and in another moment the Model has sprung towards the door,
where only my head has appeared. In less than it takes to tell this,

fortunately, the fall was the o § thing broken.
“It’s all right,” cries the noble Briton, appearing above. “Don’t
f. away... The brute's chained, the keepers are here, and the red-

But I remember I have an º: and taking his word
for it that he has never, painted anything, equal to what he is
ing to send to the Academy this year, I leave. Going out, Mr.
ONG is passing. I take him by, the sleeve., “I’ve only been two
minutes at RIVIERE's,” says I. “Then, you’ve not stopped long,”
he returns, falling into my trap quite innocently, “Yes, I have,”
says I, digging him in the ribs...He roars; whether at the merry
conceit, or because I was just a little too hard on him between the
fourth and fifth rib, I am not quite sure, but I beg him not to
roar again, as RIVIERE might take it unkindly. ... “I don't think,” I
can't help saying to my excellent friend, Long, “that RIVIERE quite
likes that sort of chaff; and by making that noise, you see, you touch
him on the roar.” Long's will be A1 this year. “It’s the subject
I promised,” he whispers to me, “four years ago.” “Aha! LoNG

into the four-wheeler. In another moment he has vanished, for the
man is driving like fury. When he reaches his destination he will

I look in at the studio of Mr. BURGEss, A.R.A. “It is a Spanish-
Mauresque subject,” he explains. “What shall I call it?” Can
he hesitate? “Burgess and Moore.” Earthquakes of laughter.
I walk up Bond Street. Three Academicians whom I meet there
say they feel it uncommonly hot. No wonder. Do they know where
they are standing P No. Why, with their backs to the Gallery
where The Furniss is being heated seven times to roast the Acade-
micians. The Artistic Joker is piling it up.
“He ought to display some greengrocery in the window,” says

H-Rs1-Y, R.A., bursting with it—for wit, like murder, will out-

waiting to pick up the pieces thatresult from this explosion, he jumps
into a Hansom with B-RL-w, who just now has a hang-picture sort
of look about him, and drives off to the G.N.R, for Manchester.
I look in at HERMANN HERKoMER's. Before me is a life-like
Fº of his cousin, the A. R. A., as Slade Professor-not at

“I will callround at the Herr Professor's,” I say, I do so. Qh,

OF our heroes in scarlet no longer vaunt only,
In praise of their gallantry all men agree;
But think of that suburb, that night dark and lonely,
And sing of the courage of BARKER, P.C.
A theme for a civic Tyrtaeus most trulyl
If pluck and devotion are worthy reward,
The Public must see it distributed duly
To men like this genuine “National Guard.” -
Just picture him creeping, while Cits were fast sleeping,
One man against two, only armed with a stick, -
On the trail of brute crime. We rest calm in such keeping.

At the thought of him lying, mauled, grippled, nigh dying,
Alone on the line in the dusk of chill night... .

WHEN Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN conducted his Golden Legend at
Berlin—where its first d. was a failure, owing to circum-
stances over which the Composer ought to have had some control-four
crowns were thrown to him. So that’s the value the Berliners put
on the work! Four crowns! Hang it, you can't expect much for
a sovereign. And, by the way, if the Emperor wasn’t there, besides
these four crowns was there a sovereign in the house? How Sir
ARTHUR must have even longed to be back again, flourishing his
electric-lighted wand among the Savoyards of Ruddy Gore House.
Later in the week Madame ALBANI came to the rescue, and the
Berliners must now celebrate the triumph of ARTHUR.

RATHER ‘GAsHLY.”—Some Welsh people
have a good idea of what a Jubilee Memorial
§ to be. This is from the Western
azz.:-
“At a public meeting at Llanwenog, in Cardi-
ganshire, presided over by Mr. T. H. Hughes,
J.P., it has been decided to celebrate Her Majesty's
Jubilee in that district by providing a public hearse
for the parishes of Llanwenog and Llanwnen. The
Chairman, who originated the proposal, was con-
ratulated upon his happy idea, and an Executive
Xommittee was formed to carry it out.”
Excellent notion! So full of variety, because
such a Jubilee Memorial as this is capable of
taking more than one form, not at a time, it
is true, but it may take a different form, in-
animate of course, more once afortnight.
The Jubilee in this district will be rather an
undertaking. Will they get the eminent
tenor, Mr. HAYDEN CoFFIN, to sing the Ode P
REAL APRIL FOOLS.
THEY say March comes in like a lion,
And exits in guise of a lamb.
Such fudge why will saw-mongers try on ?
The thing is a palpable flam.
Here’s April the First—such a twister!
It flows, and it snows and it blows.
Wild March has bequeathed to his sister
No soft lamb-like ways, goodness knows.
We’re all April fools who have flattered
Ourselves with fond hopes of the vernal.
We're bitten, and blasted and battered,
In short, it is simply infernal.
If March makes a baa-lamb-like exit,
The mind for that boon cannot care,
When April—to fool it and vex it—
Comes in like a dashed Polar bear!
THE Prince of WALEs opened the College of
Preceptors last week. H.R.H. remarked on
the absence of any sculpture § BIRCH, and
thought that Dean Eve would make the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“NOWEL-SUNDAY.”
WHY, Mr. Punch would like to know, should not Novelists have their Show
Sunday as well as Painters, and admit Society to view the works they have
prepared for the opening of the Publishing Season? When this has become a
general practice (as will no doubt be the case after a suggestion from so influential
a quarter) we shall probably see something like the following:-
SCENE-The luzuriously-appointed Library of Mr. Polygon PLASTICK (a versatile
but imitative young genius, who has not finally decided as yet upon the manner
he intends to adopt). Various newly-finished MSS. displayed conspicuously
upon handsome reading-stands. . Author discovered in attitude of readiness
to receive visitors. Enter a Gushing Lady, prepared to admire everything,
with unenthusiastic Husband. -
The G. L. (looking at title of MS.). This looks charming now.
ºp of Parmenas Brown.”
ease.
Novelist. Delighted!. It’s by way of being a little analytical study, and all
that. This is the way it ends. (Reads):—
“The state of mind with which PARMENAs, after carefully wiping his boots, and placing
his umbrella in the cast-iron receptacle in the passage, entered DAFFodiL GREEN's little
parlour, was curiously complex in its converging waves and cross-currents of incongruous
desires. He was conscious chiefly of a pervading uncertainty whether he was glad to be
there or sorry he had come, and, whilst felicitating himself upon having at last decided
to make a call, he found himself wishing almost earnestly that he had remained outside.
The parlour, as he gazed round it, presented few points by which it could be differentiated
from other interiors of a similar kind. It had the same—”
Well, I’ll skip the description. It’s rather long.
“—But to PARMENAs it bore the unmistakable imprint of DAFFodiL's oddly insistent
personality. He was still receiving this impression when she entered the room with that
air of hers of unconscious actuality which surrounded her like an atmosphere, and seemed
almost to diffuse a palpable radiation. As she stood waiting for him to speak, he was trying
to read in her face some suggestion of what he had come to say—but it told him nothing.
DAFPodiL was a little fluttered by this unexpected realisation of her highest hopes, but
she reflected that she could scarcely be expected to take the initiative. Both had a tor-
menting sense of being up a mental cul-de-sac ; unhappily it was not even the same cul-
de-sac. He began to smooth his hat automatically in the reverse direction of the nap, and
she was dimly aware, deep down in the recesses of her consciousness, of being faintly
repelled by this harmless mannerism. To escape from it, she swept abruptly to the window,
and occupied herself intending the canary. Ten minutes could not have passed thus, before
her thoughts were abruptly recalled ºr visitor by the sharp closing of the front door,
and, glancing up, she was just able to obtain a passing glimpse of PARMENAS BROWN’s
ruffled hat as it vanished dºi, down the long §: street. She could not have told how,
but she knew by some unerring perception that it had vanished out of her life for ever!
“DAFPopil, resumed her occupation with a faint sigh; she had realised that, hence-
forth, Life for her would be summed up in attending to that canary, but it did not
occur to her to rebel against her destiny.”
You can see, I daresay, whose influence I was under when I wrote that?
The G. L. Oh, yes, DICKENs, of course! only so much more refined! (Sees
she has made a wrong shot.) How stupid of me, I meant THACKERAY-just
his touch. But then they both belong to the same school, don't they?
. Novelist (disgusted). I’m sorry you think it's like THACKERAY,+it’s a study
in the American manner.
The G.I. (unabashed). And that is the only true manner, is it not? But
do tell me, does the poor canary die f I'm so interested init all!
Novelist (suppressing a groan). The conclusion leaves the heroine with her
canary—that is the note of her future life, the whole thing is a subdued tragedy;
what might have been, and er—wasn't, don't you know. But here's somethin
I hope you’ll like better—my latest manner. I own to being rather plea
with it. (Reads):—
“Just then I happened to open my eyes, and there, at the entrance to the cereba, I
beheld a sight the Ioathsome horror of which curdles my blood to think of even now ! For,
crunching and smashing through the prickly mimosa as though it were a bed of parsley
was advancing a hideous brute, its massive plated sides gleaming a mottled purple, and
edged with a fringe of coarse hair, which shone iridescent in the radiance of the patent
night-light by which our camp was illuminated. It was an enormous lobster, about the
size, I should say, to make a rough guess, of a Hansom cab-horse, and I had only to look
at its projecting and blood-tinged eyes, from which the light of intelligence had long
departed, to feel sure that the vast crustacean was in an advanced state of maniacal frenzy!
It was a sickening spectacle as it crawled on, its great jointed antennae dimly visible between
me and the stars, its fish. incers outstretched with a blind groping action infinitel
horrible to look upon I .# to sing out: “Mind your eye, you fellows!’ but the words
refused to leave my parched throat, and before I could ejaculate a syllable, the beast,
with one contraction of its formidable claws, had nipped off the foot of §". UNKI DoRUM,
as a man clips the end off his cigar. As I write, I can see the severed sable foot of my
faithful attendant as it went hopping over the sand—for all the world like a freshly landed

Piccadilly under happier conditions, Irummaged out a bottle of the salad-dressing, without
which I never travel. The unearthly scream of the creature as I flung the contents down
its foaming jaws, rings in my ears yet!” . . . .

boiler I’ve done for the Home Garland. But I’ll give
you a specimen of it with pleasure. (Reads):-

orns.

ists to do, dear. Hadn't we better take a Hansom?
Surely our Novelists will no longer deny themselves the
stimulus of such encouragement and appreciation as this,
and Mr. Punch feels tolerably certain that the Painters
will unselfishly consent to relinquish in their favour the
monopoly they have hitherto enjoyed.

John BULL TURNs ouT FRENCH Sou, AND TAKEs his FAITH FUL

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 28.-RANDOLPH back to-
night. Tºok up old position in comforting contiguity with Treasury
Bench. Catching sight of him there, toying with his moustache as
of yore, seemed as if nothing had happened during the last two
months. Believe that, much has happened. RANDoIPH unusually
reticent. Wears regular diplomatic air. Fancy he is silent only
because he thinks the more. CHAPLIN very uneasy, though he tries
to face the position with a laugh.
“Don’t suppose, Toby,” he said, “after your visit to the DEY
-- that RANDOLPH did much at Algiers, an
I'll answer for the Prince of MoMACo.”
It’s all very well to put a bold face on
it. But Our Chief, in his heart, believes
he's been circumvented, and that his great
plot will never ripen.
House crowded again from floor to
topmost tier of %. Lord Mayor
of Dublin, fresh from Channel passage
rushed in with notes of what proved
liveliest speech of debate.
At pretty early hour BALFour rose
to bring in what is proudly spoken
of as the Eighty-Seventh Coercion
Bill. Spoke for two hours
and half, amidst running fire
of sarcastic commentary and
bitter laughter from Par-
nellites. Speech would have
been three times more effec-
tive if it had been two-thirds
shorter. John DILLON very
angry at this, prolixity. So
vexed, indeed, that in de-
nouncing it he spoke for three
hours; thus the two first
speakers in debate carried
ouse on till half-past ten.
(Gave notice to-night to move for an estimate of the probable dura-

Tuesday.—House filled up again to hear GLADSTONE resume debate
on Coercion Bill. A large proportion waited to hear GoscHEN, who
followed dangerously close on the dinner-hour. But, already signs
of weariness. , House pretty well empty for rest of sitting, AUSTIN,
new Member, had curious experience. Made usual little appeal for
indulgence of new Member, then looking forlornly round benches,
remarked upon their desertion. Up jumped Irish Member and
moved that House be counted. AUSTIN's -
speech accordingly interrupted till count
took place; after which Members fled
again. When AUSTIN resumed, pretty to
observe his anxious avoidance of allusion
to condition of the House. In fact, by
some delicate touches managed to convey
the impression that on the whole he was a
little incommoded by the crush.
GLADSTONE still in good voice, Ablaze
with energy. A little embarrassed by
necessity of nicely observing personal re-
lations with old colleagues. House ob-
served with curiosity how he alluded to
HARTINGTON as “the noble
Lord the Member for Rossen-
dale,” to HENRY JAMEs as
“the Right Hon. and learned
Gentleman the Member for
Bury,” whilstof CHAMBERLAIN,
who sat near, he spoke as “my
Right Hon. friend the Member

Conservatives began to smell

is a disappointed man. Since debate on Coercion Bill began, has
spent most of his time in walking up and down before the Irish
Benches, trailing his coat, and, with genuine pathos, inviting some
one to tread on it. Has, specifically and individually, in hearing of
Members, asked Dr.TANNER to “Come out.” TANNER, however,
thinks he's safer inside, and declines well-meant invitation. KING-
HARMAN a full-blooded man. Consequence of disappointment might

to his seat comparatively cool. When paroxysm comes on, off again
to Cloak-room, and more play with the “figger.” Well enough, he
says, But he'd rather have five minutes on the Terrace with TIM or
TANNER in the flesh. Business done.—More debate on Coercion.
Thursday.-Pretty to see BALFour to-night gracefully reclinin
on Treasury Bench, ostensibly making notes, but really fixing Iris
Members with watchful eye. On Tuesday report current, that
infernal machine had been sent to CHIEF SECRETARY by Parcel Post
(ºmps omitted). HARCOURT much excited on hearing news.
‘This will try BALFour,” he said. “Nothing shows so sharpl
what mettle a man’s made of as to receive an infernal machine wit
morning letters. Remember when I was Home Secretary had one
delivered in my room at House. An interesting-looking box. What
did I do? Lose my presence of mind? Not a bit. As soon as I
saw box on table, hastily left the room, softly closed the door, sent
for Inspector DENNING, and ordered him to carry box away and have
it opened in a remote chamber. Turned out to contain a rusty pistol
with broken trigger. But that's neither here northere; presence
of mind’s the thing. Wonder how BALFoUR behaved.”
BALFoUR no chance of distinguishing him-
self., Infernal machine did not reach his
hand. Taken up by police; opened with
great}. found to contain smallbottle
used for homoepathic medicines. Now filled
with red tooth-powder. BALFour suspects
Irish Members of the joke. Joseph G.ILL.Is
too º a personage to indulge in such
ranks; but suspiciously like one of TIM
EALY's flashes of humour. So BALFour,
ostentatiously taking notes of Sage of Queen
Anne's Gate's speech, keeps his eye on Irish

guilt.
Long and not º lively sitting
in Commons. Sage's speech full of point.
Lost some effect by strategic absence of
HARTINGTON and CHAMBERLAIN. At One

“Wery well,” says SMITH, “but we’ll bring
matters to conclusion to-night.” Up sprang
HARCOURT in best earthquake form,
“This is , the Closure,” he , thundered.
“You take the SPEAKER's name in vain, and
threaten us with the Closure.”
SMITH came forward to explain; HARcourt
wouldn't give way; so two stood glaring at
each other across the table. “HEENAN and
SAYERs over again,” said PITT LEWIs. “Go
it, little 'un. I’ll back SAYERs.”
“Go it, little 'un' "
House on both sides roared and yelled. Scene lasted a full minute,
till SPEAKER interposed, and both combatants dragged off by their
friends. After this, Members, who were growing wearied, went off
home greatly refreshed. Business done.--More debate on Coercion.
Saturday, 3 A.M.–All over, even the shouting. Half-past twelve
last night, motion made to Adjourn Debate. GIADSTONE seconded
it. Uproarious, cheers, that greeted him from Liberal side, woke up
HARTINGTON, who had gone to sleep balancing his hat on bridge of
nose. HARTINGTON ºl. motion for Adjournment. HARcourt
went for HARTINGTON, More speaking. House divided, and Adjourn-
ment negatived by 107 votes. DILLwyN moved Adjournment of
House. SMITH appealed to GLADSTONE to stop further opposition.
GLADSTONE declined. Another division. Government majority rose
one. AKERs Douglas smiled. *...*. knew what would come
next. SMITH's appearance at Table hailed with howls from Irish
camp, and cheers from Conservatives. Moved the Closure. Members
rushed hotly down to floor, making for Division Lobbies. GLADSTONE
rose, and moved towards “No” Lobby. Instantly dense crowd
going in that direction parted right and left, and GLADSTONE walked
through the living line, amid deafening cheers and waving hats.
Closure carried by majority of 108. Main question, that “ leave be
given to bring in Bill,” put from Chair, whereupon Opposition rose
as one man, and left the House. So the Coercion Bill was brought in.
VERY HARD LINES.
HOW THEY WERE WRITTEN TO ORDER.
(Leaf from a Laureate's Diary.)
9 A.M.–Bother, the Jubilee! What, in the name of fortune, can
one, do with such a rubbishing subject? But here's MACMILIAN
waiting, and I haven’t done a single line yet. Must get something
ut on to paper, if only to quiet him. But how on earth to begin!
et in “fifty” somehow. Want fifty somethings that come but
once a year. Christmas? Good. That suggests Clown. I have it.
Fifty times the Clown has grinned and tumbled.
No. That won't do. It’s too shoppy, ...; Has a soupçon of
the Promise of May about it. . Wants something wider. Haſ The
Row, suggesting the Season, of course.
Fifty times the Row has filled and emptied.
No. Don't like it. Reads as if I was talking of a cistern. Too
heavy. Try, something lighter. Pastry?... Feathers? Flowers?
Ha! that’s it. Flowers, of course. Here, I’ve got it!
Fifty times the Rose has flowered and faded.
Anyhow, that'll do to go off with. Let's see. ...I want fifty some-
thing-elses to follow it up with. What shall it be P Cartloads?
Handfuls? Armfuls 2 Autumns? Harvests? Good again. Not
that there's any precise connection between them; but one must
stick down something. How’ll this do?
Fifty times the golden harvest fallen.
Yes, that reads all right. Is there any other way of putting “fifty”?
Yes, “twice twenty-five.” But that won't come in. Then there's
“four times twelve and a half.” No; that won't do. Enough “fifty.”
Now we want some allusion to HER MAJESTY. Must get in a “since.”
I have it, “Since our QUEEN assumed.” Capital. Here you are!
Since our Queen assumed the globe, the sceptre.
Çome; that's a beginning anyhow, Threelines! But they've quite
dried me up. Besides I can't go on in blank verse like this. Don't
feel up to it, Must try another metre. What metre? And then
what on earth am I to say in it? I haven't had such a job as this for
a long time. Could weep over it. A precious Ode I shall make of it.
For though I, know not anything,
Yet must I not my lot upbraid;
Since as the Laureate I am paid,
And, being paid, am bound to sing.
But, “ * glass of Therry, will make me merry.'. I'll try, One.
6 P.M.-Confound the Jubilee Ode! Have now been at it all day,
and am floundering worse than ever. Have got in something about
illuminations, sanitary improvements, subscribing to a Hospital and
Penny dinners, and given a kind of back-hander to GEORGE THE
THIRD, but who, on earth, I refer to as the “Patriot Architect,” and
what I mean by asking him to Shape a stately memorial, Make it
regularly—no, “regally”—gorgeous,Some Imperial Institute, I don't
know. But if I arrange it in parallel lines it will look like poetry,
and that'll be near enough.
Feel I'm making a horrible hash of it. Might go for a turn on my
bicycle. May clear my head. Might try it. Will. -
Have dined, and now, at 9 P.M., have again settled down to it over
a pipe and a glass of grog, Am in a more hopeless muddle than
ever. Trying to bring in everybody in a kind of wind-up appeal.
But look at this, -
You the snubbed, the unfortunate,
You, the Lord-Undertaker,
You, the Lord Omnibus-Conductor.
That doesn't seem to run very well, but it's the kind of idea I want
to work in. Don't seem able to manage it.
You, the Lady–Amateur Actor?
No, that won't do." Shall never get it done to-night.
10 P.M.–After awful hammering, managed to knock off two more
lines. Head spinning, but must stick to it. Feel I’ve never turned
out such stuff in my ife before. Hopeless! -
10:30 P.M.--Two more lines screwed out. But what lines! Won't
scan, and As to rhyme-ha ! ha —catch Ind rhyming to-night !
11 P.M.–Have come to a dead stand-still. Equal to it. Haye had
recourse to the wet towel. Refreshes me. Ha! I see light. Happy
thought ! As I can't do it in verse, why not write it all in prose,
and then cut it up into poetry afterwards P. Sure to get cut up when
it appears. Why nºt do it myself first *. I will. - Anyhow, here goes.
MIDNIGHT.-Done it! Labelled it Carmen Saeculare. Looks all
right, but quite the toughest piece of work, I’ve ever had to turn
out. Posted it to MACMILLAN. Hope he'll like it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH2S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.
MR. PUNCH's Poet has been laid up lately with an acute determination of prose to the pen
—a complaint to which bards are rather liable at this season of the year.... In proof of his con-
valescence he presents his pupils with a little Sporting effusion, which will almost recite itself,
and is entitled:-
JUNIPER JEM.
Yes—(rather aggressively, as if somebody had just said it wasn't)–Steeplechasing is stirring
sport, .# the most exciting events of all -
Are at Purlingham Park, when the field is large, and the ditches deep, and the fences tall.
And I for one shall never forget, till my brain is blurred and

º The day that Dot and Go One was steered by an infant hero-
with burst of ;R. UNIPER JEM! -
(In tone of easy explanation.) Robert RoPER was down to ride,
an j backed his mount—for he knew the course,
And, gad, he'd have managed to romp in first if they’d put
him up on a rocking-horse!
But out of the paddock the horses filed—and a murmur ran:
“It is RoPER's son 1 -

RoPER, it happened, was under a cloud, and the Stewards
had given him notice to quit, - -
For a little artistic arrangement in oils he'd endeavoured to paint on the favourite's bit.

Coughing and wheezing, they canter on; there's an awkward post and rails to be passed!
See, Stiffun, ah, yes, has refused it, twice, and the second time little BILL LARRUP is grassed!
'Tis the boy's turn now, and we hold our breath, and we watch for the daylight–By Jove!
there’s none! (hysterically)—
'Tween the baggy buckskins of j.UNIPER JEM and the slippery saddle of Dot and Go One /

(Horses don't strike out exactly, but that’s nothing in a recitation.)
And he's shaking himself on the opposite side—but he can't shake off*...* JUNIPER JEM |
There are only a couple ahead of him now, as he shambles up with a raking stride!
And the poor old Trombone's beginning to blow, as he pants in the rear of Polonia's Pride.
She is over the five-foot fence like a frog—but the Trombone's down and out of the fun.
(With a yell.) Now! cram him at it, JUNIPER JEM I (Relieved.) Well, he's done it somehow,
One more—and the finish! Now, neck and

mound;

(Pause—then, triumph.) But he's up the

we cannot call his condition trim

There's a roar from the Ring, and a shout
from the Stand, as they bucket by with
a final burst;
For the mare is beaten by half a head, and
the clever old grey is at home the first!
And the crowd are cheering the pallid child,
as he capless sits in the burning sun;
“Hip-hip-hooray!, for the infant pluck
that has scored a win on Dot and Go

But the boy replies with a gentle smile, “I
thank you all. I have done my part.”
(Keep this modest.

(Very tender here.)
And even the Stewards are softened now,
; the unshed tears at their eyelids
rim.
As they pardon RoPER his littleruse for the
sake of their promise to JUNIPER JEM.
Then we all of us rush to embrace the boy,
and to lift him down—(with surprise)—
but we strain our backs!
And the child explains, with a simple glee,
that he'd rubbed the saddle with cob-
bler's wax
“With such a precaution,” the cynic ºneer,
“no wonder the danger he didn't shun l’
(Turn up your nose disparagingly, then
give the last line with a ringing inflec-

Patient. All right, come yourself and

The Colonial Secretary. I had no intention of reflecting on an

-“Thereare nogentlemen in it!”—“Fou're another!”—and uproar.)
Perhaps I may be allowed to give a few details with regard to this
measure. (Gives them, his voice being rendered almost inaudible by
constant howls.) I must acknowledge the extreme, the almost un:

Mr. Freely (resuming his seat). It’s the Colonial, SECRETARY
who's out of order—bilious, I imagine. (Laughter.) Well, fire away!
The ColoniaL SECRETARY (who by this time has entirely lost the
thread of his argument) proceeds to contend that life in the Leeward
Islands is at present not safe, owing to the incursions of the savage
Aborigines—(“Three cheers for the Aborigines /")—and he must

Mr. O'Shy'un. Unpar’lleled except at a wake. -----
Mr. Funnybeer. It injures my most delicate susceptibilities.
The Speaker. I have not noticed any threat. (“You never do!”
and “Order! order!”)
The Colonial Secretary (sarcastically). It appears, after all, that
the point of order which the Hon. Members wished to raise is very
like a vanishing point. (Laughter, amid which two Hon. Gentlemen,
who have been threatening for some time to “punch each other's
heads,” retire outside, and have several rounds in, the Smoking-
Room.) As it is erfectly impossible for me to explain the clauses

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 4.-Quite a disturbance in
Strangers' Gallery about Seven to-night. Wanted their money back.
Said they’d come to House expecting to see, SPEAKER in Chair, in
wig and gown, whereas it was filled by a gentleman in plain evening
dress. Attendants remonstrated with malcontents; pointed out that
at the opening of the performance the SPEAKER was there in full
costume. Besides, money is never returned at
the doors of Strangers' Gallery; which is, I
believe, strictly a matter of fact. -
It was CoNYBEARE, who was responsible for
his incident. Finding nothing to do on Saturday,
House being closed, he had attended a public
imeeting where he brought gross charges of dis-
honesty against PEEL, in his high function as
SPEAKER. Probably thought his obscurity and
unimportance would shield him from detection.
e reckoned, without Our Chief. Nothing
escapes that eagle eye, which regards the
swelling Universe through an eye-glass.
CHAPLIN heard of the speech, and when the
House met this afternoon brought it under
notice of SPEAKER. SPEAKER, though
broken down by physical pain, rose to
height of occasion. Nothing could be finer
than his lofty scornful, yet half sad,
manner of resenting the charge, nor any-
thing better than the matter of his few
remarks. Visibly affected JoHN RoPERTs
of Flint. Pricked even the º.
hide of CoNYBEARE, who haltingly endea-
voured to show that when he said the
SPEAKER had betrayed his high trust, he
never thought he should live to eat his own

“All is not Flint that looks BEARE to É. back into seclusion. It was

stony after this that SPEAKER retired. .
Had
risen from sick bed to meet a charge as baseless as it was base.
“Quite enough,” as GENT-DAVIs says, “to make any man's veins
swell in his leg.”
After this, House, with average attendance of twenty-five
Members, had few hours' desultory talk on matters more or less
nearly related to Civil Service Estimates. Business done.—None.
Tuesday.—Some sensation at Four o’Clock. GLApstone discovered
on Front Opposition Bench. General impression that he'd come to
read prayers. The . Reverend BYNg before commencing service
looked inquiringly at him. Made -
no sign. Things took ordinary
course, but House remained puz-
zled. Such an event must portend
something. Believe myself ex-
Fº very simple. HARcourt
as of late with increased regu-
larity, secured seat of Leader of
Opposition, elbowing GLADston E
down. Attendance at P.
secures seat for remainder of night.
By early attendance GLADsroNE
got his place, and Fº HAR-
courT will take the hint. Noo
verrong, as Joseph GILLIs says
not unforgetful of a gift acquired
during famous visit to Paris.
Nothing happening at prayer-
time, next rumour to account for
GLADSTONE's unusual appearance
was that he intended to e great
speech; perhaps move the Ad-
iournment, eyes turned upon
im when order of the day called
on. Exclamation of surprise an

along for some considerable time, Members generally seizing the
opportunity to write their letters. Then came PEASE and War. War
in the person of Our Chief. What fine form he was in, and how
..º. enjoyed himself!. House not yery full, but GLAD;
SToxE in his place, and, at a safe distance, HARTINGTON. A good
deal of pains evidently bestowed upon oration. Full of antithesis,
anti-climax, and here and there a peroration; Sometimes, wi
corrugated brow, the great orator swung his body, as it were, on a
ivot, whilst he enunciated a platitude of exceptional ponderosity.
*. of his speech he addressed personally to GLADSTONE, empha-
sising its point with threatening forefinger. Some apprehension
that GLADston E would fall into trap, and Fº the game of our wily
Chief by interposing a correction. But he didn't even shake his
head, and presently went out. Remained just long enough to hear
that Pºf peroration in which CHAPLIN contrasted what he
called the “Demmon” of Anarchy with his Right Hon. friend
Providence, and pictured as a result a “smiling Ireland.” .
“What does he mean by “Demmon?’” W. H. SMITH, in awed
whisper, asked PLUNKET. - -
“Oh,” said PLUNRET, “it’s only an illustration of his natural
generosity. He has given the Devil more than his due by an “m’.”
Business done.—More debate on the Coercion.
Wednesday.—Our good SPEAKER still away. CourTNEY in the
Chair doing excellently well. In addition, some fifty or sixty Mem-
bers present. Large proportion have speeches ready. Some half-
dozen worked them off." But might has well been taken as read.
Front Opposition, Bench nearly empty. GLADSTONE already com-
menced his holiday. HARTINGTON torn himself away from his
beloved labours. CHAMBERLAIN at home packing up for his journe
to the Highlands. HARcourt says that CHAMBERLAIN has ordere
full Highland suit, and that he will wear it as soon as he gets North
of Oban. JEsse CoII.INGs has followed suit. Don't know whether
HARcourt's in earnest or not. But CHAMBERLAIN not the man to do
things by half., Would not stick at such a trifle as trousers to gain
his political ends.
Conversation on Coercion ceased at Twenty minutes to Six in order
to give F. S. Powell, opportunity of moving Second Reading of
Church Sites (Compulsory Powers). Repeal Bill. Just time for it.
Powell said few words in explanation of measure and sat down with
eyes eagerly fixed on Deputy-Speaker. CourTNEY about to put
question, when up rose Joseph GILLIs with his left hand hooked on
by thumb to armhole of waistcoat whilst other extended with be:
nignant grace as if he were bestowing his blessing on the listening
Senate. “Seems to me,” said Joseph, in his most judicialtone, “that
objects of the Bill have not been sufficiently explained.” This argu-
ment he urged till hand of clock touched quarter to six, after which
hour Bill could not be further proceeded with. So JoEY B. resumed
his seat. Business done.—None.
Thursday.—Morning sitting, but very few to sit. Members have
paired by scores like turtle doves; have fled away, and are now at
rest. Talking-machine still goes on at Westminster with less of
practical result than ever. Business proposed, further discussion of
Coercion Bill. Members threatened to talk at large on formal Motion
that House at its rising adjourn till Tuesday. SMITH, finding dis-
cretion better. º: of valour, at once hauled Hºw: flag just nailed to
mast, and did not persist in bringing on Coercion Bill. House
adjourned at Three o’Clock.
ow for the Easter holidays l Got all the time between now and
Tuesday. Think I shall be able to get as far as Wandsworth Com-
mon or Hampstead Heath for change of air. Business done.—None.
-
THE REASON WHY.
THE Parisian Press, discussing the alleged failure of the English
war-ships to answer the salute of the French squadron the other day,
off Cannes, account for the circumstance variously, as follows:–
Because the British Navy has barbaric instincts, and is unac-
quainted with the polite customs of civilised nations.
Because the Vice-Admiral in command is “one poltroon.”
C Because it was his design to fix an insult on the Municipality of
an Iles,
Because the Mariners on board are animated with the gross senti-
ments of Sir GILBERT-SULLIVAN.
Because LE DUC D'EDINBouhg wished to manifest his jealousy of
the French Flag.
Because he would not sanction the expense of the powder necessary
for the salute.

No DEMAND FOR INDIAN Bonds.-The Bishop of CARLISLE has
espoused the cause of a Hindoo lady of the name of RUKHMABAI
(which Mr. Punch suspects must be pronounced by that Asiatic-
Hibernian potentate, the great Padishah, “RUMMY.BAY.”), who
seemingly is desirous of becoming unmarried during the lifetime of
her titular first, husband. It appears that poor RUKHMABAI was
linked to her other half when she was little more than a Rukhma-
baby. She wants the law altered. Need it be said, after Mr. Punch's
historical advice “to those about to marry,” that she has his earnest
sympathy?

MOTHER AND ME.
A SCHOOL-BOARD BALLAD.
Billy Backslum loquitur :—
WHY yessir, it do ache a little, my head do; goes swimmy, you see.
It’s along o' the lessons no doubt, Sir ; I tell you that there Rule o' Three
Is a twister, and when a chap's 'ungry, and cold, and wet through with the
rain
To set working it out all the mornin' is apt for to gally his brain.
Heducation, Sir? Yessir, that's it, Sir. It’s got to be done, Sir, of course,
For without it a cove isn't wuth any more than a ’og or a 'orse;
Leastways so the Board-teacher tells us. I’aven't É. much of it yet,
But no doubt I should like it all right if it weren't for the 'unger and wet.
For them and for Mother! You see, Sir, we're poor, awful poor, down our court,
my father, a sweep, Sir, he died; it was sut on the chest cut'im short,
That and 'owling so ºard for a living; and me, Bob, and BETsy—JIM's dead—
Was left to poor Mother to look after. Thankye, it’s only my head.
Don't #. much, us common sort don't, Sir; it don't do no good, and wastes
line,
Well, Mother-ah!, she's a good sort, Sir, so kind, and gin cold ain't a crime
When it's took just for #. now is it? and two D it doesn't fºur.
And it never would run to no more, so it’s ’ard to be down upon her.
She had to look after us all, Sir, and I was the eldest, eleven,
And BETsy, the baby, just two, while young Bob, he was close upon seven,
But crippled along of his 'ip, Sir, and never wuth nothink for pluck.
So 'twas all left to Mother and me, Sir ; and I’opped the dºu, luck!
Played the wag from the Board School, I mean, Sir, it was such a beastly
wet day,
And ** 3. ”—that's BARNEY GREEN’s boy, Sir—was down in the smithy
at play,
It did º: so warm and so cosy, and I was that wringin' and sopped, -
I thought º the hours in wet togs in that school-room, and—well, Sir, I
opped.
Next day little Bob he was ill, Mother had to go charing to Bow,
she left me at 'ome with the young 'uns; they hadn't no muss, dontcherknow,
'Cept me, and sometimes DoTTY SPRIggDNs, the lame little gal from next door,
When Mother was out on the char or the wash-tub-cos why, we’re so poor.
That day, Sir, we'adn't no grub, not till Mother come 'ome late at night,
3. g a apple wot GINGER GREEN give me º I only arsked for a bite.
Lor’ it do give yer innards a doing to go all day long without food,
And ". . re at School it seems worse, though book-learnin' of course must
good.
Leastways, Sir, it ought to, and chance it; else why did them coves take and go
And come down so 'ard upon Mother? She's 'ad to drop charing at Bow,
As loses her three bob a week; but that’s better than quod, dontcher see.
Only fancy'er took off to prison a-leavin' them young 'uns to me!
Yes, that’s wot they threatened to do, Sir, unless I was kep' at the School.
Poor Mother, she cut up, she did, and the 'Spector he called her a fool,
And if I was a man with big fistes like BARNEY-well, there, Sir, that's wrong;
But learnin' comes 'ard on a cove when he's 'ungry and poor and not strong.
It do make my head ache, I tellyer, I spose with good togs and good grub,
A school may be no end of nice, and as cosy and warm as a pub.
Heducation comes easy that way, Sir; ah, even that there Rule o' Three
But they don't serve us poor people so, we must take it like physic, you see.
Oh, yessir, I goes pretty reglar. ... I shan’t 'op the Charlie no more,
if f iſ fºoijä fancy that black prison van would pull up at our door
To carry off Mother. Poor Mother! she can't keep me mended nohow,
Little Bob ties her up so tremenjus, and BETsr seems sickening now.
Wants nourishment—that’s wot the Doctor says; yes, and he’s right, Sir,
you bet,
Lor’, don't I just want it sometimes, sittin' there werry achy and wet?
I’aven't got fur, Sir, not yet I ain't, every one says I’m so slow,
But I’m told heducation’s a blessin', and praps by-and-by I shall know.
A blessin'! ... Well, Mother’s gone thin, and she coughs awful too of a night,
And BETSY's fell into the fender, and done somethink bad to her sight,
Along of not being looked after, It may be a blessin', you see,
But it looks like a new kind of torment to worry poor Mother and me !

AH! poor little dear, you're still waiting
Alone on the stairs. It’s too bad;

You're the general pet, are you not, Miss 2
And always come in with dessert:
This 'ere º; is regular rot, Miss,
No wonder you feel a bit hurt.
I don't know what's come to the house, Miss,
Good form seems a saying good-bye!
Though you’re sitting as still as amouse, Miss,
I see there's a tear in your eye.
You feel you’re unkindly neglected,
And sort o' shut out in the cold.
Well, it isn't what I had expected,
"Tain't right, if I may speak so bold.
Fº the likes o' me oughtn't to judge it,
e being a servant, you see,
But to see you a sitting, Mum BUDGET,
As some one has writ, worries me.
You're ready and well literated,
But, bless you, they’re not, my dear Miss;
And—well, all the years I have waited
I've never seen nothink like this.
The dawdling and noisy noration—
They calls it “discussion,” my dear—
Isreg'lar right down aggravation,
Like brickies, who row o'er their beer.

man turned paler than ever, and pulling his
ancient hat over his wrinkled brow, left the
office and wandered into the street.
“What shall I do?” he murmured, as he
stumbled rather than walked along failiſati.
“How shall I get my grievance redressed?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. XXW.—THE JUBILEE MAYOR OF PUDDLETON,
“ALDERMEN, Councillors, Townsmen, Friends,” said the newl
elected Mayor of Puddleton, in returning thanks for the honour whic
been conferred upon
him, “thirty years ago, a
oor, but honest, lad stood
in front of this noble Hall,
and made a solemn vow
that he would sit in the
chair to which you have
this very day elected me.
(Cheers.) Not that the poor
but honest lad in question,
hoped to gain his end {
artifice; for he had fait
in the power of industry,
and good conduct, and he
had already heard of the
high and honourable mo-
tives of the Puddleton
Corporation. (Loudcheers.)
Gentlemen, that poor lad of
thirty years ago, is now
thanking you for capping
the edifice of his ambition
with the highest distinction
which this HonourableCor-
E. can confer upon a
urgess of Puddleton.
#: cheers.) ... My dear
riends and Fellow-work-
- - ers, in the interests of this
ancient borough, I feel sure you will excuse me if, in the fulness
of my heart, I venture to refer to the next landmark in my
not uneventful career. Fifteen years after that first rash, but
earnest vow, I had the good fortune to wait upon a lady, for the
first time in my then master's establishment, in regard to whom I
made a pledge none the less audacious; for as I handed her into her
carriage, I said to myself, ‘CHARLEs. HARMONY SQRUPLE,' I said,
that lovely woman shall be your wife,” and, Gentlemen, that lady
by your votes this day, is at this auspicious moment the Mayoress of
Puddleton; and I can honestly declare that she is worthy of your
homage.” (Great applause.)
It is worth while to recall these memorable sentences of a remark-
able speech in order that we may impress upon the reader the resolute
character of the gentleman who now presides over the destinies of
Puddleton; and it is useful also as a record of the text of the
leading article which shortly afterwards appeared in The Puddleton
Times, defining the principles of the English Constitution in relation
to civic functions, and bearing upon an ever memorable event in
the life of Her Majesty the QUEEN, namely this gracious year
of Jubilee. “It is inherent_in_the_Constitution of this great
Empire,” wrote the Editor of The Puddleton Times, “that merit and
a blameless life shall, be recognised in the distribution of civic,
national, and imperial honours; and it is fortunate for the future of
this entity of Puddleton in the great union of English-speaking
oples that the Corporation, do not undervalue this fundamental
asis of the nation's liberties.”
CHARLEs HARMONY SCRUPLE was a linen-draper; so also, he was
wont to say, was JoHN GILPIN of famous London town; but the
Mayor of Puddieton had never been known to do a ridiculous thing in
presence of his fellow-townsmen. When he first began to study the
art of deportment as it should be exercised in the active duties of a
retail draper, he practised before a mirror; when he began to under-
stand the importance of a graceful manner and a persuasive tone of
voice to a salesman engaged in a store F. by the county
gentry, he experimented upon , those lay-figures whose plastic
rotundities exhibited his artful taste in the arrangement of
! draperies and colour; but in these rehearsals he was alone and un-
seen. . As a §§ man he was the only assistant in the Puddleton
emporium with whom the great ladies of the shire would condescend to
ex e a single word that was not of a purely business character;
as an elderly º: they frequently consulted him upon the
latest fashions both of dress and decorations, and it is believed, while
ji p. that in his capacity of Chief Magistrate
ill be §". to join the county committee for
lish almshouses for the relief of distressed
these lines are
of Puddleton he
º; funds to esta
downers and impecunious territorial lords.
He was short in stature; but venerable in appearance. His florid
complexion was picturesquely heightened by his white hair; he
spoke in a soft propitiatory voice, which, however, could rise to the
occasion of great events, and his kindly smile never seemed to desert
him; though he had once had to compromise a case of assault in
which, during a moment of exasperation, he had pinched the ears of
the youngest of his shopboys, whom he had caught in the act of
making faces at him while he was ſº in giving his best advice
to a forlorn townsman, who had solicited him for assistance more use-
ful at the moment than." pearls of honest counsel.”
The marriage of Mr. Scruple was not the least :::::::::;
of that “steadfast perseverance” to which the editor of the Puddleton
Times “fearlessly declared” that his Worship, like all great men
owed his success in life.” She was a confiding widow. Mr. CHARLEs
HARMONY SCRUPLE sold her the very weeds in which she after-
wards received his addresses. His sympathy, in the trying moments
of her first orders, and his gentle smiles of comfort when the time
came to discuss the question of half-mourning, were full of a º
consolation. When the conventional hour arrived for laying aside
the last coquettish indications of the widow's º he was her accepted
suitor, and in due course he entered into fºil possession of “the
lamented deceased's”. hard-earned savings, together with a most
comely and simple-minded little woman, who is devoted to him,
listens in private to all his impromptu speeches before he makes
them in public, is his best audience at the penny readings, and
has “many a time and oft” begged him to remove to London,
where his talents would have a wider scope for exercise and develop-
ment; but he is bound to Puddleton, he says, by ties of º and
he will never desert the town of his adoption, which is not only
hallowed to him by commercial and civic success, but is the happy
spot where first he met his darlin§ A. - -
You should see the Mayor and Mayoress of the Jubilee Year going
to church on Sunday mornings to take their seats in the Corporation
pew. There is no person too lowly for them both to recognise, and no
erson so high with whom his Worship will not pause to shake hands.
#: is a lesson in humility, and a rebuke to pride that walk to church
on Sundays; and prisoners the next morning who are sentenced, to
various terms of hard labour, for wandering abroad without any visible
means of subsistence and other awful crimes known to the law, seem
almost anxious to thank the Chief Magistrate for the kindly and
eloquent manner in which he confers upon them the heaviest sen-
tences legally allowable in their respective cases; his Worship never ||
forgetting to tell them that the first duty of a Justice is to see that ||
justice is done, in which he is often very warmly supported by a class |
of Magistrates according to whose professional calling one might ex- ||
ect that mercy would not be considered of secondary importance. I
ot that we would for a moment suggest any natural shortcomings of |
benevolence in the personnel of the Bench of Puddleton; but we
confess to have noticed, more in sorrow than in anger, that, from the
Mayor downwards, a sense of duty to the blindlady with the scales,
is apt to override the more beneficent exercise of the mercy which
tempers justice in the higher teaching of the law, as expoun by
that learned Judge in the courts of Venice, who tried to soften the
heart of a certain Jew who carried a pair of scales for avery different
purpose from that which is supposed to actuate the classic lady whose
effigy adorns the stucco façade of the Puddleton Police Court.
It was the rich, and at the same time, the loving hand of the tender-
hearted widow, to whom reference has been made, that enabled Mr.
SchuPLE to buy the flourishing business he has now for more than a
decade conducted on his own account; and it is a graceful tribute
that he asks Puddleton to offer to her and to their noble QUEEN, in
the subscription which he is raising, to build a Home for Poor Needle-
women, to be called after the two great ladies of these Puddleton
days, “the Maria and Victoria Institute;” and he “is persuaded
that in thus, as it were, bringing HER MAJESTY into their home-life
and allying, as it were, the Chief Magistracy of the Queen's loyal
town of Puddleton with the greater and grander Chief Magistracy of
the Empire on which the sun never sets, they will be, in a manner,
upholding those glorious liberties for which their fathers fought on
mº a gory field.” . - -
e quote these closing sentences of His Worship's speech on the
projected “Maria and Victoria Institute,” from a. i. report in
The Puddleton Times, the Editor of which high-spirited journal con-
fesses (in language which demonstrates the infectious character of
civic eloquence) his belief that when the Jubilee honours are Gazetted
the present Mayor of Puddleton, will be amply endorsed “in one o
those historic scenes not quite foreign to the experiences of Chief
Magistrates of less important, boroughs than, ours; one of those
stirring scenes of constitutional government, wherein a great Queen
confers the dignity of Knighthood upon a worthy subject, in dis- ||
tinguishing whose merits before the world she casts a reflected glory
upon the neitself.”
Obvious.
“THE Elements are out of order,” says
A Newspaper. 'Tis true; in various ways, -
Earthquakes, volcanoes, storms, are raising ruction.
But all this shindy upon sea and shore,
Earth, air, fire, water, only proves still more
The need of “Elementary Instruction.”

SEE us, lost in consternation,
Begging you at least will hear
Of the gross adulteration
Now affecting British beer.
Hops have from the compound vanished,
And the Brewer with his wiles
Introduces, barley banished,
Quassia and camomiles!
'Tis not that the public daily
Drinks this poison that we mind,
For they take to it quite §.
And the taste enticing find.
'Tis not that the stuff is heady,
And of drinks is quite the worst,
Making brain and legs unsteady,
And tenfold increasing thirst.
No ; what moves us in the matter
Is the stake we’ve in the hop,
For the Market still grows flatter,
And the prices daily drop.
So let loose the analyser,
Out with penalty and fine,
And he very soon, grown wiser,
Won't at water draw the line;
But will hunt up each ingredient,
Catalogue and make quite clear
What the Brewer finds expedient
To put in his misoalled “beer.”
Till, the Law in vain defying,
All the spurious traffic stops,
And we once more are complying
With a brisk demand for hops.
Help us then, as to the Nation
Thus we tell our piteous tale.
Just a little agitation—
In our object we shan't fail.
Help us, and you'll surely think soon,
ile the wrong you deftly cure,
As the British beer you’ll drink soon,
That our motives are as purel

WII.-BETTY AND THE BEAST.
WHEN the Merchant heard his youngest º (the clever one, from Gir-
ton) express her wish for, a singing laurel-leaf (after the two elder girls had
mentioned a diamond necklace, and a cachmire cachemisère), he thought it was
only her way of showing off. - - -
“A singing laurel-leaf from Apollo's own crown, my girl,” said he, and, in
his heart, É. registered a vow to fetch her Mr. TodhuntER's excellent Euclid,
for he hated ostentation. - -
His business done, the necklace and the cachmire purchased in the flowery
valley of Cachemisère, the Merchant was returning, when his train was delayed
by one of the snow-storms so prevalent in April: Stamping about, to keep his
feet warm, the Merchant found himself within the splendid grounds attached to
a princely palace.

which, indeed, were promptly inflicted on the Merchant by an unseen fist.
When the Merchant came to himself, he found one standing over him, whom
he recognised as a perfect Beast. - - -
“The insolence of the modern tourist is excessive,” said the Beast. “How
dare you pluck my singing laurel ?”
“Please, Sir,” said the Merchant, “I have a daughter at home”— . .
“The old story,” sneered the Beast. “Bring her with you for my Bride, or
it shall be the worse for you.” -
The Merchant, to tell the truth, was not, sorry to have a chance of getting
BEAUTY, with her airs and exercises, off his hands. In vain had he hoped that

a Tutor of Trinity would come forward. BEAUTY was a dialectician
so skilled that the cleverest young men shrankin terror from her side.
But, when the Merchant had returned home, and dashing away a
tear, began his tale, the eldest daughter, BETTY, interrupted him,
saying,
“I, and nobody else, will sacrifice myself for my father and my
family. Let the Beast devour me. Never shall it be said that the
youngest of us, a mere child, was deserted by her eldest sister!”
The resolution of BETTY was unshaken, and the Merchant returned
with her to the remote and rural residence of the Beast.
He received them with unexpected cordiality, and at once
introduced BETTY to his Aunt, an elderly lady of unimpeachable
propriety.
(Here, says the Arabian scholiast, the advantage of Mr. Punch's
over all other Fairy Tales is unusually manifest. In no other ver-
sion, except in that collected by Mr. Punch from the lips of his
attached and highly respectable subjects, is the beloved of the Beast
provided with a Chaperon.)
The Merchant now returned to his affairs, and BETTY and the
Beast were a good deal thrown together by the kindly old Aunt, who,
for her º was exactly like any other lady of her age. One day it
occurred to the Beast to show BETTY her own family in the Magic
Mirror, when, looking over her shoulder, he observed BEAUTY.
“Why,” exclaimed the Beast, “ you are the plain one of the
family I Go home and send me BEAUTY.”
Poor BETTY reddened, but she was the best of girls, and made
allowance for the frankness of the Beast. Associating for a long
time with pigs and tigers in the Garden of Circe, he had partly lost º
his manners.
BEAUTY came, and BETTY went, but, before she departed, the
Beast gave her a diamond ring... “That, diamond,” he said,... will
tºº as a ruby, if I am dying, blue as a sapphire, if I am
red.”
At home with her dear father, BETTY had almost forgotten the
Beast, when one day, glancing at her ring, she found the stone as
blue as a sapphire, yet slowly changing into ruby red. .
“My poor Beast is bored, my Beast is dying,” she said, and hur-
ried off to his palace. In the #. there lay her Beast, a volume
of Professor SEELEr's Books of History beside him, and surrounded
by the later works of several esteemed English poets. -
He faintly smiled as BETTY drew near, then, raising his head,
remarked–
“You come too late!
..Your clever sister has brought me to this!
She never leftoff improving me.
She let me hear about the Ding an
Sich, and about
KANT. She read

ings with Certain

added the poor
Beast, his mind
obviously wan-
dering.
BETTY threw

“Delightful
BETTY,” he cried,
“you have dis-

for ever yours!”
So saying, he led her within the castle, where his old Aunt received
him with tears of joy, while BEAUTY, coming down with inky fingers,
too late for luncheon, observed she was delighted that dear Berry
was happy at last.
Moral.--A good heart is better in a wife than a pretty face and a

THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.
(Before Mr. Commissioner PUNCH.)
An Officer of the Reserve was introduced.
The Commissioner. Well, Sir?
Applicant. I am a Captain in the Reserve of Officers.
- . The Commissioner (after search-
ing). I find no entry in the monthly
Army List of such a body.
Applicant. No, Sir, and that is one
of the grievances of which I have to
complain. Although Warrant Ser-
geants and Retired Majors of the
Auxiliary Forces appear, yet my
brotherofficers and myself are left out
in the cold. Ournames are published
once a quarterinan unwieldy volume,
which practically is never consulted,
and there the matter ends.
The Commissioner. I presume,
then, that your duties are purely
honorary?
Applicant. On the contrary, they
are very realindeed. During peace
} we may never be called upon to
ti serve; but, at the first hint of war
à we are liable to be sent anywhere and
everywhere at a moment's notice.
• The Commissioner. Then I sup-
pose you receive a retaining fee, like
the rank and file of the Reserve?
Applicant. Certainly not. On the
contrary, those of us who have re-
ceived our Commissions in Her
Majesty's Land Forces after long
-
s's s
*...* service in the Militia, may be called upon to join a Line
giment for a month's duty, at our own expense and without pay,
every year.
The Commissioner. May I ask of what body of men the Reserve of
Officers is composed?
Applicant. Officers in the Regular Army on half-pay, Officers of
the Army who have retired in the prime of life, and the
very pick of the Officers of the Auxiliary Forces. In this latter
class, a Major usually serves as a Captain, and a Captain as a
Lieutenant.
The Commissioner. In the event of war, of what service would the
Reserve of Officers be to the Nation?
Applicant. As a body, they would be of incalculable value. As
every one of them holds a Commission in the Regular Army, they
could individually be drafted at a moment's notice into any battalion
requiring their services, and sent, I repeat anywhere. In times of
peace their services are also available, though as a rule they then are
only accepted when they have been tendered on their own initiative.
The Commissioner. The Reserve Officers seem to be a useful body.
Applicant. This has been frequently admitted in Parliament, and
confirmed by the Horse Guards. In spite of this they are utterly
ignored by the War Office—except of course when their services are
*:::::: Then they are hunted uppertinaciously.
he Commissioner. What would you propose?
Applicant. That at least their names should be enrolled in that
Military Court Guide—the monthly Army List.
to The Commissioner (smiling). That should not be a difficult request
grant.
Applicant. And yet it has been made for the last seven years
without success. And secondly, that after a fixed number of years
of faithful service, they should obtain the honorary rank on retire-
ment granted to all other branches of the Service.
The Commissioner. And that also seems reasonable.
anything else you can suggest, Captain P
Applicant. No, Sir, save that you deserve the thanks of hundreds
of Officers in the Reserve for thus espousing their cause.
The Commissioner. Not at all. I will mention the matter to my

MR. PUNCH*S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.
IN graceful consideration for the requirements of students of the
softer sex, Mr. Punch has ordered his Head-Poet this week to produce
a choice example, of simple pathos. If its linkéd, sweetness some-
what resembles that of a confectioner's port which has tarried un-
duly in the decanter, possibly they will like it none the worse on
that account. We will call it
BURGLAR BILL,
(You must open in a hushed voice, and with an air of wonder at
the world's iniquity.)
Through a window in the attic, brawny Burglar BILL has crept;
Stealthily he seeks a chamber where the jewellery is kept.
- [Pronounce either “jewelry” or “joolery.”
He is furnished with a jemmy, centre-bit, and carpet-bag—
For the latter “comes in handy,” as he says, “to stow the swag.”
(“Jemmy,” “Centre-bit,” and “Carpet-bag,” are important
words-put good colouring into them.
Here, upon the second landing, he secure may work his will;
Down below's a dinner-party—up above the house is still . . . .
[Start here, and extend first finger.
Suddenly—in spell-bound horror—all his satisfaction ends—
For a little white-robed figure by the banister descends!
(This line requires careful handling, or it may be imagined that the
#!". was sliding down the banisters, which would simply ruin
the effect. Observe the bold but classic use of the singular in
“banister,” which is more pleasing to the ear than the plural.)
BILL has reached for his revolver—(business here with fan)—but he
hesitates to fire:
Child is it, or apparition, that provokes him to perspire?
Čan it be his guardian angel, sent to stay his hand from crime?
- ſº a tone of awe.
He could wish she had selected some more seasonable time!
“Go ". -> he whimpers, hoarsely. “Burglars have their bread
earn .
I don't need no Gordian angel comin' givin' me a turn!”
(Shudder and hide your eyes, then change your manner to a
naïve surprise.)
But the blue eyes open wider, ruby lips reveal their pearl:—
“I is not a garden angel—I is dust a yickle girl!
- - - ſº very artless here.
Qn the thairs to thit I’m doin till the tarts and jellies tum;
PARTINTHON, the Butler, alwayth thaves for Baby BELLA thome!
WOL. XCII,
Poor man, 'oo is lookin' 'ungry-leave 'oo burgling fings up dere;
Tum along an' have some sweeties, thitting on the bottom.thtair
“Reely, Miss, you must excoose me,” says the Burglar, with a jºk;
“Dooty calls, and time is pressing—I must set about my work!”
[This gruffly.
“Is 'oo work to bweak in houses? NANA told me so, I'm sure!
Will’oo try if 'oo can manage to byeak in my doll's-house door?
I tan never det it undone, so my dollies tan't det out;
They don't like the fyont to open evewy time they’d walk about!
Twy—and, if 'oo does it nicely, when I’m thent upthtairs to theep,
I will bying 'oo up some goodies—whichthall be for ’oo to keep!”
[Pause, then emotional.
Off the little angel flutters—but the Burglar wipes his brow;
He is wholly unaccustomed to a kindly greeting now !
Never with a smile of welcome has he seen his entrance met!
[Mºlº,
Nobody (except the Policeman) ever wanted him as yet! [Bitterly.
Many a stately home he's entered—but, with unobtrusive tact,
He has ne'er, in paying visits, called attention to the fact.
Gain he counts it, on departing, if he has avoided strife.
Ah, my Brothers, but the Burglar's is a sad and lonely life!
[With deep feeling.
All forgotten are the jewels, once the purpose of his “job,”
As he sinks upon the doormat with a deep and choking sob!
Then, the infant's plea recalling, seeks the Nursery above,
Looking for the Lilliputian crib he is to crack—for love /
#. generally does it for money, you know.
In the corner stands the dolls'-house, gaily painted green and red;
Qolouring again here.
And the door declines to open—even as the child had said 1
Qut come centre-bit and jemmy, all his implements are plied;
Never has he burgled better, as he feels with hº e!
Deftly now the task’s accomplished—for the door will open well,
When a childish voice behind him breaks the silence like a bell,—
“Sank’oo, Missa Burglar, sank’oo, and, betause ’oo's been tho nice,
See, I’ve bwought 'oo up a tartlet—gweat big gweedies eat the ice!
Pappa says he wants to see '09–PARTINTHQN is tummin' too,
Tan’t 'oo stay?” ... . . “Well, not this evenin', so, my little
dear—adoo!”
(Make a picture of the next couplet; let the audience see the haunted
victim %. prejudice beguiling his flight by tender memo-
ries as he escapes his {...}
Fast he speeds across the housetops—but his bosom throbs with bliss,
For upon his rough lips linger traces of a baby's kiss'
[This line, tear-laden as it is, needs very delicate treatment to
revent the audience from understanding it in a painfully
#. sense.
- - - - - -
(Now we come to the finale with a highly effective contrast—don't be
afraid of it.)
Dreamily on downy pillow Baby BELLA murmurs sweet: -
[Smile here with a sleepy tenderness.
“Burglar, tum adain an' thee me--I will dive 'oo cakes to eat!”,
That's one side; now for the other.
In his garret, worn and weary, Burglar BILL has sunk to rest,
Clasping tenderly adamson tartlet to his burly breast !
Linger lovingly on the word “tartlet,” remembering to cross
wour hands upon your bosom as you conclude, and, if you do
not find that several susceptible bachelors have been knocked
completely out of time by this little recitation, there must
have been something seriously amiss with your rendering of it.
“BELGRAVIA BOB'S' SHOW.
(From the “Yankee Gridiron Gazette.")
THE Show of which “Belgravia BoBº, is the Boss, is intended to
represent in a vivid manner all the striking and exciting incidents
connected with, High Life in the West. In London it covered a
space of more than a thousand acres (including Kensington), and
was composed of nearly three thousand chaperones, débutantes,
dancing-men, and millionnaires, all intended to illustrate fashionable
life. It exhibits the chasing and capturing of county heirs by the
wily dowager and her talented assistants and daughters, the darlings
of the New Club and the Park. Belgravia Bob explains the myste-
ries of pilling at the Club, baccarat, and flying kites. He also has
an engounter with a grass widow (from India) in which he comes off
second-best. Mr. HENRY IRWING is expected to be delighted with
the Show, and to say “that it speaks to him from its heart, and is
the best thing that has ever been produced by London—outside the
Lyceum Theatre,” wherein indeed much of the Show is often seen.
VERY GRAYs-FULL.--So Gray's Inn, is bent, upon producing a
“Maske,” in honour of the Jubileel An excellent idea! There is
no º that it will be a success, in spite of perhaps being
called by a Cockney a “Maske'oorayed.”

ROBERT AT HYDE PARK.
WELL, there I was, as usual, right in the werry middle of the whole
shouting mob, without no more intention of being there than the unborn babe,
Having been at the two last demonstrayshuns, I thinks they calls 'em, without
no, bother nor trubble, I natrally thort as I shood like to see a third, but only
jest from a distance as it were, but to my great estonishment I found myself
carried along by such a mob as I never seed, afore, rite up to a platform where a
wild-looking Irishman was a raving away like a wild Ingin. After a little wile
it struck me as so werry comical that I larfed out lowd, wen a werry sawage-
looking feller arsked me wot I was a larfing at, and afore I could armser him
said he wood punch my hed for a stoopid old fool if I did it agane! I am prowd
to say that in all my perfeshnal career that is the werry first time as them power-
ul words was ever said to me, but I was quite ekal to the ocashun. ithout
daining to say one word in reply, I fixt my eagle gaze upon him for a brief
moment, and then turned away and disdainfully squeeged my way out of that
part of the mob, with sitch awº." of supreme contemp upon my ancient
wisage as must as driven him wild with hanger if he could but have seen it.
When I got out of the dense mob to where the peeple was thinner, I arsked a
werry quiet looking Postman, who was enjoying his onusual holliday *...*
a good long seat in the Park, if he knowed what the great meeting was all about,
and he, told me it was all about coersion, witch he arterwards xplained to
mean that not nobody hadn't no right to prewent anybody from doing what-
ever they liked to do, purwided it wasn't contrary to Law. So I then arsked
him why a ferocious non-coersionst shood threaten to punch my head for
larfing? To which he replied that probberly he was a Irishman, which he
seemed to think xplained the hole matter. -
I didn't think as the hemblems of wictory as was carried in sum of the per-
cesshuns was quite so apropriate as ushal. For instance, a corffin isn't a partick-
ler lively hobject to carry about four mile for fun, or much calkerlated to raise
the sperrits of the carryers, but there it was, and when it’s acumpaned by the
Ded, Marching Sorl, as I was told it was, tho' I didn't see it, I carnt help
thinking they was both what I never am, I’m appy to say, namely, out of place.
There was one Motto as I couldn't at all understand; it said, “We are on the
side of the Donkeys!” or sumthink werry much like it, My friendly Postman
tried to xplain that it was not xactly that, but related to some ancient legend
about Donkey Carts with springs being better than Donkey Carts without 'em,
which may be a werry wise saying, but I don't think if
as I had had to select the mottos, that I should chose one
about Donkeys. Peepleisginerally so werry sarkastick.
One of the Irish gentlemen made a speech as made a
great himpresshun on me, and, witch I thinks as our
werry prime Minister ought to harnser. He said that
if this wicked Bill was passed, the º peeple who wood
be safe to live in poor Ireland, woud be def, and dum
people, as for anybody who wasn't so fortnit, the best
thing for them woud be not to be born at all, or if they
must be born somewheres to take care and be born some-
wheres else! There’s a degree of good sound common
sense in this powerful statement, that I should hardly
have xpected in so excited an Iri h Mimber of Parly mint
as uttered it, and, if he would but favour us with a
:Fº of how it's to be done, there’s a goodish lot
. #: next generation as would feel werry much obliged
lm.
One thing as struck me werry powerful was the almost
hutter habsince of wittels, that is to say such wittels as
one woud think was absolutely necessary to keep poor
body and sole together while marching or standing still,
for about six or seven ours, in about as fine a spessimen
of East wind as I have felt for sum time. How it affecs
others of course I don't know, but I do know that a
rattling East wind makes me that hungry that I can eat
amost anythink, ewen chops and stakes don't cum amiss.
My Postman told me as it was their enthusyism as kep
'em up, Well, all I can say is, that isn't myxperience,
for I allers finds as them as makes the most noise at great
dinners, eats and drinks the most.
Praps the thing as estonished me more than anything

ADWICE TO SINGERS.
By Junius Minimus.
NoTE.—Where the male sex is designated in such words as
“Singing-Master,” the female equivalent may in all cases be
read with equal, and sometimes with greater, force.
1. You should all be told, to begin with, a fact of
which, you were doubtless hitherto supremely ignorant,
but which nevertheless remains. It is seldom, if ever,
that your singing of any vocal piece gives entire satisfac-
tion to the composer of such piece (unless, indeed, you
sing your own music). On the .*.* so rarely do you
convey an adequate or even an intelligent idea of the
writer's intention, that not unfrequently you rob a com-
position of any merit which it might possess. This is not
said in disparagement of your vocal ability, but merely
in order to clear the ground of rubbish.
2. Learning, as you mostly do, of singing-masters as
distinguished from music-masters, you are generally
made heirs to the stock-in-trade of vocal prejudices
which your teachers have previously inherited. It is
true that some singing-masters are music-masters,
but with few exceptions the singing-masters most in
yogue . or having been in their time, singers, will
be willing, like yourselves, to sacrifice music to vocalism.
3. In the prevailing state of our musical ignorance,
when barbarous and loud cries are accepted as musical
utterances, the arrogance of vocalists is hardly surprising.

OUT OF IT; or, UP IN skyE
** HARK I HARK 1 THE LARK 1"
Such expressions as “interpretation” and “creation” tend neces-
sarily to foster complacency, and even to delude you into the notion
that you may ** embellish or even improve upon the notes
you have to sing. othing could be more unlikely. Only occa-
sionally do you not spoil your songs by singing out of time, by
singing out of tune, or by loading with affectation what should have
been simplicity itself. The last you love to do.
4. One of the first things you should aspire to is to sing in time.
If you are engaged in the chorus, either for a concertor operatic work,
you will be made to sing in time. If, on the other hand, you come
out at once as a soloist, the chances are that the conductor will keep
the band and the audience waiting while you dwell upon unimportant
notes and drag, the time agreeably to your teacher's instructions or
our individual measure of original sin. Therefore, as you are strong
merciful.
5. It is of course very desirable that you should also sing in tune,
and remain throughout a song, however long, in about the same key
as the accompaniment. I am aware that most singers find this
difficult, and F. it is waste of time to insist upon such a detail.
But a paper that touched ever so lightly upon singing might perhaps
be considered incomplete by the fastidious, were not some passing
allusion made to the desirability of an entente more or less cordiale
between vocalist and orchestra.
6. Desire for selfish display is the bane of vocalism. In solos from
a ballad to a scena, your want of taste is remarkable, and you must
not think, because a composer thanks you at the end of a perform-
ance and pays you compliments, that he is really pleased with you.
He is merely thankful that you have got through at all, and hi
compliments are given in fear lest you should turn and rend him.
7. It has been hinted above that you are not always ideal expo-
nents of musical composition. It would seem, therefore, scarcely
unreasonable to suggest that, when possible, you might, with advan-
tage to yourselves and your audience, accept any hints that the com-
poser might be in a position to give. Provided always that you are
not—as, of course, you generally are—better musicians than the
person whose work you are good enough to render.

matters improved in briskness. The Colonel made fine play with
his shillelagh, twisted it between thumb and finger round his own
head, and brought it down with a whack on any other he chanced to

Parnellites of having imbrued their hands in blood. “But,” he

TIM, speaking without emotion, as if he were moving

MR. PUNCH2S MORAL FAIRY TALES.
VIII.-LITTLE RED. Rogue RIDERHood.
THERE was once a woman who had the prettiest little girl in the
F. For this favourite child she made a red hood, which became
er so handsomely that all the neighbours called her LITTLE RED
Rogue. RIDERHood. The name was well deserved by the cleverness
of the little girl, as you will learn from the following tale.
One day, LITTLE RED. Rogue RIDERHoop's mother had done the
baking and also made a plum-cake, which she gave the child, bidding
her carry it to her Great Aunt, a wealthy but miserly old lady, from
whom the little Rogue well knew that she had great expectations.
So the young girl set out, with her basket on her arm, and, from
picking out a plum here and there, she soon advanced so far in her
studies as to finish the cake
altogether! When she saw
that there was no more left,
and reflected on the disap-
pointment to the old lady (from whom her expectations were con-
siderable), LITTLE RED. Rogue RIDERHooD sat down in a wood,
#.º bitterly. At this moment who should come up but a great

... Where are you going, my little maid?” asked the Wolf, .
“Going to my Great Aunt's in the cottage at Six Mile End, if you
please, Sir,” said LITTLE RED Rogue RIDERHooD, adding the full
address, and dropping him a courtesy.
4 -#” you going the long way, or the short way?” asked the
0II.
“The long way,” said LITTLE RED. Rogue RIDERHood, thinking
that she was in no hurry.
“I’ll be off then,” said the Wolf, “and mention that you are
coming!” So he trotted away.
Now LITTLE RED Rogue RiDERHood fell a-thinking. . She knew
that there are no wolves in England, and she remembered that there
was a Wild-Beast and Waxwork Show in the village that day.
“He’s escaped from the Show,” said the little girl, “and I’d
better go back and tell Mr. WARLEY,”—the spirited Proprietor.
So back she went to the village, and the º: trotted on, till he
came to the Great Aunt's house. He knocked at the door, Toc / Toc./
“Who’s there?” said the old lady from her bed.
“LITTLE RED. Rogue RIDERHooD,” said the Wolf, “with a cold,
and so hoarse.”
“Pull the latch, and the bar will fall,” said the old lady, and the
Wolf ran in and worry-gurry-worried her
“I’ll wait here for the child,” he thought, and he fell asleep.
Presently, Toc. Toc / somebody came knocking at the door.
“Who’s there?” says the Wolf.
“LITTLE RED. Rogue RIDERHOOD !”
“Pull the latch and the bar will fall!” says the Wolf.
Then flash! #. bang! went several guns, and the Wolf dropped
back in bed-riddled with bullets by the local Volunteer Corps; for
LITTLE RED. Rogue RIDERHooD had brought a Corporal's Guard to
look after her, and Mr. WARLEY of the Show.
LITTLE RED. Rogue RIPERHood wept bitterly over her Great Aunt,
observing that, if she had not given the Wolf the old lady's address,
this might never have happened, which is not unlikely.
But she now inherited all the old lady's large property, and after-
W. married the Squire's son, .# Mr. WARLEY, of course,
handsomely for the loss of his favourite old Wolf.

to receive Tenders for the supply of the
under-mentioned goods; to wit:-
50,000 yards of second-hand three-quarter
inch º (cut into proper lengths),
and available for conversion into rifle-
barrels of the Woolwich model.
20 cwt. of old hoop-iron, suitable for the
manufacture of sword-bayonets of the
approved Government pattern.
nd 500 reams of inferior damaged brown
paper, required for the strengthening, and
giving consistency to the soles of 20,000
pairs of regulation boots.
The Director wishes to point out to compet-
ing Contractors that, as the Department
assumes no responsibility whatever for the
character of the goods supplied, they will not
be so narrowly scrutinised as the amount
of the commission they carry with them,
which last he will take principally into his
consideration in making his award.

Wanted immediately to fill a highly
important position in one of Her Majesty's
Inspecting Departments, a well-trained ex-
ert accustomed to discharge the duties
evolving on him in such a fashion, that
when called upon to furnish any personal
explanation of matters coming within his
reasonable cognisance, he is able to shirk
all individual responsibility by referring
the inquirers for further information to the
system of which he alleges he is merely an
unrecognised representative. He must
know how to play a good hand at “Poker,”
thoroughly understand “Blind Hookey,”
and have some acquaintance with the “three-
card trick,” and must be able to gather, by
instinct when he is expected either to shut
his eyes to the condition of any, damaged
goods he is called upon to “pass” as sound,
or wink at the Contractor who has been
commissioned by him to supply them. Can-
didates will be expected to furnish refer-
ences from some noted member of a well-
known and recognised swindling Long Firm,
together with all further necessary particu-
lars to the Director General, Inner Rin

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
No. XXVI.-A. BRIEFLEss, JUN.,
Taken from One of His Own Rough Sketches.
ONE of the incidents of my income is the possession of certain
rents and profits of some leasehold property known as Royal
- Windsor Castle Palace Terrace,
North End, Fulham. My rents
and profits (which were left to
me by an eccentric spinster
relative said in her lifetime
to be extremely fond of （i.
tical jokes) are not particularly
lucrative. My tenants are ex-
tremely worthy people; but
experience has taught me that,
when I attempt to collect the
rents, I generally lose all the
rofits. Feeling that a land-
ord should take, a personal
interest in those who live upon
his estate, for some time
attempted to do without an
Agent, and appeared in person
on Quarter Day. On the first
what º: but soon propiti-
ated mysub-lessees by yielding
a ready consent to whatever
they required in the shape of
alterations. Thus, by a judi-
cious promise of a bath-room
here, a conservatory there,
and a copper yonder. I easily
gained their good-will. How-
ever, when I came to balance my accounts at the end of the
year, I found that, although. I had no doubt greatly improved
the value of my property, still the balance was decidedly, very
decidedly, on the wrong side. It was then, by the advice of a
friend, that I placed myself unreservedly in the hands of some
eminent Estate Agents, who, ever since, have saved me an infinity of
trouble; although, from the reproachful glances of those who live in
Royal Windsor Castle Palace ferrace, North End, Fulham, which
are levelled at me whenever I go near that delightful locality, I fear
I have secured the reputation of being a landlord with a will of
iron, and a heart of stone,
Some little while ago, a dispute about the payment of rent ne-
cessitated certain unpleasant proceedings, not totally unconnected
with the propriety of placing a man in possession; and, as usual,
my Agents acted with their customary promptness, and gave me most
excellent advice. I did not trouble myself very much about the
matter, having other anxieties pressing themselves more promi-
nently upon my attention; still, I had labelled the affair under
the very general heading of “Worries” in the storehouse of my
memory, and left it there unsettled.
A few days since it occurred to me to pay a visit to my chambers,
to clear up §. arrears of work that might have accumulated during
an unusually lengthy absence from Pump Handle Court. My excel-
lent, and admirable Clerk, Port NGTON, received me with some
hesitation, invited me to follow him into my room, and then care-
fully closed the door.
“Hope you enjoyed your Christmas holidays,” I said, pleasantly.
“Is there anything for me?” He placed before me my usual batch
of circulars (which were soon read and relegated to their temporary
resting-place, the waste-paper basket), and then again hesitated.
“Has anyone asked to see me?” I continued, in my usual per-
functory manner. To i". surprise I received an unlooked-for answer.
“Yes, Sir,” replied PortſNGTON, with more sorrow than exulta-
tion, “someone has been here several times during the last few days.
In fact he was most pressing, and wouldn't believe me when I said
that I thought you had gone on an arbitration case to Canada.”
“Dear me!” I observed. “You should have reminded me,
PortſNGTON, that I had such an engagement—it had entirely escaped
my memory.”
“Well, Sir, to tell the truth,” replied my excellent and admirable
Clerk, “it was a subterfuge. did not quite like the look of the
man, and thought it best to get rid of him; but of course, Sir, if you
wish to see him, I will show him in when he calls again. He told
me that he would look in the first thing this morning, and he has
been here twice already, and the last time said he was coming back
in a quarter of an hour.”
“By all means admit him,” I replied. “I never º myself to a
possible client. In these hard times, PoETINGTON, it does not do to
hºusine”. No doubt he will give me some work in one of the
ourts.
occasion I was received some-ly
“I think that most likely, Sir,” said my Clerk, rather dryly, and
withdrew.
I must confess that when I was alone, I felt rather apprehensive
that my interview with m; unknown visitor would not be altogether
of a pleasant character. I ransacked my memory to find if by any
act of forgetfulness I could possibly have rendered myself liable to
disagree . consequences connected with that most useful institution
the County Court, but could not recollect any incident of grave
importance. So far as Iremembered, in spite of the extreme depres–
sion in trade nowſº I had done nothing warranting measures
vindictively hostile. Then it occurred to me that I had promised to
sit for my portrait; perhaps it was the artist who had wished to
catch my expression when I was actually engaged in forensic work.
However I had not long to wait in suspense, as a few minutes later
PoRTINGTON, with a “Here he is, Sir,” ushered in my importunate
visitor.
The moment he had entered I recognised the reason for the hesi-
tation and distrust shown § my Clerk. The man before me was
unmistakable. He carried a hooked stick, wore a coat buttoned up
to the neck, and held in his hand a Kºś mapless hat.
“Well,” I said, with the air of King CHARLEs THE FIRST surren-
dering to a non-commissioned officer in CROMwFLL's army, “Well,
I and what do you want?”
“I am very º Sir,” he answered uneasily, “but I am only
doing my duty. I hope I don't intrude.”
44 £ertainly not, my good fellow,” I returned. “I do not blame
Oul.
“No, Sir, I humbly say you should not, as I have been trying to
get at you these three days.”.. -
I was a little surprised at this, as the man spoke as if he expected
me to be personally obliged to him for the embarrassing attention he
had paid to me.
“Give it me,” I said, putting out my hand.
“Certainly, Sir,” he answered, producing a document, and pushing
it towards me.
“I was not aware that there was anything due,” I continued,
without looking at the paper. “However, that is a matter of detail,
and of no interest to you.”
“Why, Sir, in course there was 1 The total was seven eight
twelve, and I would have got it that I would, but I couldn't find
a stick of furniture!”
At last my spirit was roused—the British Lion began, like a worm,
to turn upon his taunter.
... You have dared to go to my private address, annoying my
wife l’” I exclaimed in tones of thunder.
“Oh, please, Sir—no, Sir! I only went to North End, Fulham!”
I looked at the paper in my hand, and instead of—well, what I
had expected to see there—found a letter. It was from my Agents
for collecting the rents of Windsor Castle Palace Terrace, telling
me that they had put their broker's man at my disposal, as I, as a
Barrister, might tell him what I wanted done.
: How dare you, Sir!” was all I could say.
“But, please Sir—I didn't mean to do it—please Sir, I tried so
hard to find you ! If I have been here once, I have been here at least
a dozen times during the last two days! It wasn't my fault I
couldn't find you.”
I pondered. It was a serious matter. Here was my credit at
stake. _I am not very rich, but I am always respectable. What
should I do? At length an idea occurred to me.
4. º you] told them what you came for, Sirrah?” I asked,
severely.
“No, Sir, I never do,” º replied the broker's man.
“Take this,” I said sternly, and I gave him an old packet of
papers that *. to be lying on my table, “and for your life do
not utter a word. Give them me back when I get you to the door.”
“Yes, Sir,” returned my visitor, in a frightened whisper.
“Now, you villain!” I said in a low tone as I opened the door,
then raising my voice as I got into the passage, continued cheerily,
“You may be sure, my dear Sir, that I will give the matter very
careful consideration. Perhaps it would be better for me to discuss
the various points you have raised with the Attorney-General. Good
day, my dear Sir, good day.” . And I thrust him out.
' Will you give me your brief. Sir, that I may enter it in the fee-
book?” said PortſNGTON, relieving me of the bundle of papers I had
just received from the broker's man.
I looked at my admirable and excellent Clerk very gravely, nodded
and left my chambers; . Then I joined the poor fellow in the napless
hat outside, and gave him half-a-crown, but on the condition that he
promised never to speak to me again. He has kept his word.

THE GRAMMAR OF DISSENT.
JUDGING from the proceedings of the Grand
Old Grammarian and his followers on one
side, and Messrs. CHAMBERLAIN. Collins,
ÇAINE & Co., on the other, the leading pecul
liarities of the “Grammar of Dissent” would
seem to be as follows:–
1. The Articles are all indefinite—very.
2. The Adjectives are strong, and mostly in
the superlative degree.
3. The Substantives are singularly unsub-
stantial.
4. The Werbs are all exceedingly irregular,
and confoundedly hard to conjugate, the im:
perative mood predominating in most of them
111 a. º disproportionate way.
5. The Adverbs share the characteristics of
the Adiectives.
6. The Pronouns are mostly relative, but
very seldom agree with their antecedents.
7. The Prºpositions, as governing the “ob-
jective” or “accusative,” are quite the most
popular parts of speech—on platforms, and
other places where they perorate,
8. The Conjugations, are exclusively dis-
junctive, even at Round Tables.
9. The Interjections are invariably derisive
and denunciatory, each being as provocative
as Miss Miggs’ “Oh, Mim!” and as contemp-
tuous as Mr. Burchell's “Fudge!”
It will be seen at once that the study of
these parts of (partisan) speech must be con-
ducive to mutual conciliation, and general
harmony.

[APRIL 30, 1887.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRActrid From
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 18-Folkestone tells me of
an incident not elsewhere reported, which, as he says, shows the
growing spirit of misrule among the Masses. When House met this
afternoon, Strangers' Gallery filled with a rush. Few minutes later
entered a Stranger for whom attendant specially made room. When
he took his seat, Stranger put on his hat. ill of horror went
round crowded benches. Everyone expected to see attendants fall
upon the reckless man, and conduct him to lowest dungeon beneath
Clock-Tower. Nothing happened. “What's sauce for the goose is
sauce for the gander,” said another Stranger, putting on his hat and
folding his arms. In an instant attendants swooped down on him:
To remove his hat and lead him forth, work of a moment. “Booh!”
he cried through the keyhole when door shut on him. “And this is
what you call justice between man and man?” Yet this is only the
beginning, Folk Eston E thinks... We shall F. have the Masses
demonstrating in Strangers' Gallery, land perhaps insisting upon
taking part in debate.
Cause of all this was TIM HEALY. jº. on Friday night by
order of the House, he voluntarily hung himself up on topmost tier
of seats in Strangers' Gallery wearing his hatin mute defiance. Hence
looked downthrough greater part of night upon varied scene below.
Père SAMUELson took earliest opportunity of clearing a character
hitherto unimpeached. GoschEN, speaking at Edinburgh, had hinted
that the Père had been an instrument in the hands of the guilty
GLADston E, and had been put up to move amendment on Coercion
Bill. Evidently what hurt the Père most was, the suspicion that he
could be taken in.—he, the Father of such a son! Indignantly and
at some length rated GoscHEN, who with ill-affected lightness of
heart withdrew allegation, and so incident closed without bloodshed.
Fancy they’ll leave le Père alone after this.
Tuesday, 1'45 A.M. – House divided on Second Reading of
Coercion Bill. Everyone relieved. , Last instalment of debate con-
siderably above average of former nights. SExTon made many good
points in speech of hour and half duration. Would have been
º if it had been shortened by the odd hour. But the Windbag
will have its way. HARTINGTON followed in comparatively brief
speech, which, like GLADSTONE's and BALFOUR's, was constantly
interrupted.
“Haven't heard HARTINGTON º said the American Minister,
looking down from the Gallery. ... Has wonderfully improved as a
speaker since he went into Opposition against old friends.”
Curious spectacle HARTINGTON rising from side of GLADSTONE to
support Conservative Coercion Bill. GLADSTONE uncontrollably
wrought by old friend's observations. Across the seat vacated by
HARTINGTON he leaned, commenting with much gesticulation tº
John MoRLEY on successive passages. HARTINGTON must have heard
much he was saying, which made matters a little awkward
for everybody. GLADSTONE, in fine form when, after dinner,
his turn came. Constantly interrupted. But, with back against
the wall, planted some resounding blows among his assailants.
Then ARTHUR BALFour, whose speech was rather an 'altercation
with Irish Members; next

in hand, waiting opportunity, to rise, soothing to the perturbed
spirit. When he rose, regarded empty benches with a kindly smile.
No one would have been surprised if he had asked after their home
affairs, how the wife was, and whether MARY ANN was better of the
hooping-cough. His speech was like a benediction; and DE WoRMS
who had been up, for greater part of the night, presently assumed
suspiciously stolid attitude. Closed his eyes in order to think the
more closely; nodded his head in acquiescence, the regularity and
emphasis of which º contradictory of his subsequent refusal
to adopt Wrv1AN's views. The subtle influence of Wrvian's speech
more apparent in the division, Government º: defeat by a
narrow majority of five. Then there was some about Sunday
Letter-deliveries, which with perilous chances lasted through the
dinner-hour. But when MARK STEwART at half-past Ten #. sed
to discuss the system of Agricultural Education, Members ºand
House Counted Out.
Business done.—Some homely talk.
Wednesday.—Parliament chiefly out of doors to-day. Speeches in
all parts of the country by all sorts of men. HARcourt came out at
Shoreditch. By the way, forgot to make entry at proper time of
little conversation between HARcourt and BERESFORD. It was just
after Naval Lord's speech on Estimates.
“Capital speech,” HARcourt said, in his patronising way. “But
you know, CHARLIE, you don't look like a statesman.”
“Well,” said CHARLIE, “and you don't look like a Weathercock.”
Thursday.—Budget Night, though nobody would think it looking
round at benches. No crowding anywhere, and many gaps, the most
prominent and remarkable on Front Bench
where GLADSTONE's seat is empty. Hasn't
missed a Budget Night for nearly fifty
ears. But takes holiday to-day.
ARcourt there with large sheet of
foolscap designed to cow Gosch EN.
Desired effect obtained. What
with HARcourt in front and
GRANDOLPH on his flank, GosCHEN
looked picture of misery; spent
early hour of sitting in forlornly
wringing his hands. “Looks more
like as if he had a deficit than a
surplus,” said MonTAgu, who is
something in the City and interested
in finance.
GoscBEN got on at five o'clock,
another peculiarity of the occasion
being that no scene intervened.
-> This not JoHN DILLON's fault.
- Rose after questions, and so-
M %, lemnly indicted HARTINGTON
º/?.2 forasmuch as, he had brought
Ø 9 forward certain accusations
% without attempting to substan-
tiate them. HARTINGTON
according to genial custom, de-
layed his coming. . No one to
answer DILLON, and promising
scene smothered in infancy.
GoscHEN spoke for three
mortal hours. Good business
address, not absolutely entrancing in interest. HARcourt followed,
and then GRANDOLPH brought up his guns, raking GoscBEN fore
and aft., Gosch EN a little, alarmed by attack, but House not quite
certain that since National Finance a serious business, it would
not on the whole prefer GoscHEN at the Treasury rather than
GRANDOLPH.
Business done.—Budget brought in.
House of Lords, Friday Night.—Crushed worm will turn at last.
DENMAN stood years of obloquy from brother Peers. Have snubbed
him when he rose to take part in debate; out-manoeuvred him when
he has obtained precedence for his motion; fill the House with
conversational chatter when he argues, and fix him with stony stare
when he declaims. Generally too many for him. But this week he
had them in a fix. Gave notice to move the rejection of Land Bill,
so got leading place in important debate, and Lords compelled to
stay and hear him. For two ãº debate ran. DENMAN sedulously
taking notes. Quite impartial. Prepared to throttle Opposition
whilst he rolled Ministers in the dust. At midnight debate ran out.
LoRD CHANCELLOR about to put the question.
“My Lords,” said DENMAN, rising, and preparing to deliver a
two-hours' speech.
LoRD CHANCELLOR on his feet at the same moment. Put Amend-
ment—declared it Negatived; put Second Reading: “Those-who-
are—of-the-opinion—say Content-contrary- ot Content—Con-
tents—have—it.”
DENMAN still standing, with notes in hand, beheld the House
“Something in the City.”

He had been jockey'd l
When truth flashed upon

cried aloud—“This is another

THE CHOIR-BOY; OR, SENTIMENT MADE EASY.
I ONCE composed a Polka,
And I thought it full of “go,”
Sure to set the heads a-nodding,
And to please the nimble toe.
But my publishers said, “No,
dear boy !
The Polka’s had its day,
The public's got a serious turn,
Dance-music doesn't pay.
But there! don't be iºtarted
The tune's too good to waste.
Just take it home and alter it,
To suit the public taste.
We want a song with sentiment
To make the public cry,
The piano—not too difficult,
Theyoice-part—not too highl”
Then I took my little Polka,
And turned it inside out,
And added subtle harmonies,
I #.º: it ; ; [th
p 11 very slowly, ere-
§ harmonium here and
It's wonderful the pathos
The harmonium lends an air.
Then I added chords in triplets,
Strange, weird chords they were,
With rippling soft arpeggios
Like #. borne on the air.
Then fainter grew the music,
Then softly died away,
Like ling'ring gleams of sunshine
In the fast-declining day.
Then I wrote a set of verses,
Of a sickly sort of kind,
About a little choir-boy,
Of a morbid turn of mind.
Of course he’d large blue eyes,
And golden hair, that boy,
d of course he sang divinely,
Did that “mother's only joy,”
And when he sang on Sundays,
His voice o'ertopped the rest—
Which was very inartistic,
But the public like that best.
Of course he soon grew pale and
And faded day by day, [wan.
And just about the third verse,
He faded quite away!—
And now at Penny Readings,
Young curates ºf that song,
Till not a dry eye's left
In all that solemn throng.
And when the mothers hear it,
They softly sob and weep,
And #. fathers snore approval,
In their after-dinner sleep.
It's played on barrel-organs,
And on ev'ry German band,
And it's selling now by thousands,
Far and wide throughout the
land.
And when I get my little cheque,
I chuckle in my joy,
And bless that little Polka,
That became “The Choir Boy.”
AT CoyENT GARDEN.—What a brilliant Opera is Carmen up to
the middle of the third act, and after that, how sad! Poor Don José !
what a small amount of amusement he got for his trouble! Only to
sit on a hard chair, in a wayside tavern, while Carmen danced, sang,
and played the castanets! “Quality but quantity” was the Don's
motto, but “ $. and Quantity” is Colonel MAPLEsoN's, for the
House was crammed with all sorts and conditions of men and women,
and Mr. Punch can heartily congratulate him on his Italian Opera
at popular prices. Of BIZET's Leila more in our next. Forithe

“A FAIR JURY, AND ALL HOME-RULERS.”
THE CHALLENGE.
THE gauntlet's down! In tourney days
The Knight who failed the gage to raise
Had courted instant shame.
But who needs set his lance in rest
In days when knighthood seems a jest,
And chivalry a name?
The fire of honour burns so low,
The lying charge, the felon blow,
he modern lists disgrace.
Swashbuckler champions fling the glove,
And cravens falter ere they move
The swelling foe to face.
Of swaggering champion, shrinking knight,
One who provokes a needless fight,
Or shuns a needful fray,
Which most degrades a noble cause,
Or violates fair honour's laws,
Let casuist critics say.
The wanton challenger, perchance,
O'erconfident in ponderous lance,
Or *::::: mass of mail,
As little chivalrous may be
As he who shirks the glove, or he
Who falters in the fray.
The Philistine colossus flung,
With yaunting mien and mocking tongue,
His haughty challenge down
Before the hosts of Israel;
The braggart Titan, when he fell,
Missed honour's golden crown.
It is not giant strength of thews,
Or power the time, the lists to choose,
That wins a champion fame;
'Tis honest cause and courage high,
And knightly magnanimity
That dares not stoop to shame.
The gauntlet's down! That glove to raise
Will win the challenged trust and praise;
For men love not the shift,
Whate'er its motive, that evades
Arbitrament of crossing blades,
Or fears the gage to lift.
BLOWING THE FURNISS.
WHEN two of Mr. Punch's young men put
their heads together to produce so excellent a
literary and artistic joke as that now on view
at the Gainsborough Gallery, Bond Street,
Mr. Punch has o 3. to recommend the acute
Public to go and judge for themselves if he is
not right in saying that the humour exhibited
in the pictures and the catalogue is about as
mirth-provokingly original as anything they
ever remember to have seen. Mr. IKEN's
catalogue is }. a third of the joke.
Mr. Punch would advise them, when the
London Season is over, to start a caravan—a
Royal Academy on wheels—travel all over
England and Scotland, cross to Ireland, and
then visit the States. If they could §
obtain the services of a third humorist wit
the cackling and singing powers of the cele-
brated Mont Blancist, ALBERT SMITH, and an
impressario, like his brother ARTHUR, they
ought to make a fortune with their show here
in America. Prosit!
MRs. RAM is in a very excited state of mind
about Parnellism and Crime. “I cannot
believe,” she exclaimed indi tly, “that
any Irish gentleman would be associated
with such ruffians as these ruffianly Incur-
ables. And why doesn't Government do away
with the Fenian Park in Dublin?”
THE SOLDIER'S FEAR.
Upon the hill he turned,
To take a last fond look
Of the alehouse, and the ". church,
And the cottage by the brook.
To use his pockethandkerchief,
While tears began to swell,
The soldier leant upon his sword—
It bent—and down he fell.
Amid the roar of battle,
The warrior's fellest blow
Has failed to penetrate the coat
That shields the vaunting foe.
But though the pliant steel may cost
Our bravest and our best,
Be sure the sword most yielding..there
Has passed the strictest test.
THE BOBADIL BAYoMET.-BEN Jonson's
Every Man in his Humour, might be pro-
duced at a War Office ormance. There's
a capital scene where Bobadil, bending double
the bogus weapon commended to him under
that name, contemptuously cries, “This is a
Toledol Fohl”, ToMMYATRINs's blade in
action would probably “fool him to the top
of his bent.”
A propos of the above, Mr. Punch, wishes
it to be distinctly understood, that in his
“War Office Advertisements,” in last week's
Number, no reflection was intended on the con-
duct of any particular individual official.
With thefresh energy shown in every depart-
ment, and the decisive action taken at Chat-
ham and Woolwich, Mr. Punch looks forward
hopefully – STANHoPE-fully — to vast im-
provements in the future.

IT is seriously suggested that duelling is likely to be re-introduced
into England, to meet the necessities of Brawlers of the House of

Regulations should be formulated at once. Always equal to the
occasion, Mr. Punch jºr the want:— -
1. The weapons used shall be squirts full of dirty water, or thick
single-sticks—the challenged shall have the option of choice.
2. The duel s not be, stopped until either or both of the
combatants are drenched with water, or have their legs and arms
black-and-blue with bruises.
3. When the principals shall have been well drenched or º
thrashed, their honour shall be deemed to have been vindicated,
they shall retire.
4. An account of the proceedings shall be reported in Mr. Punch's
pages—pour encourager les autres.

THE CHIEF of the Loco MEDIANs, ScALPs HIMsFLF IN THE PRESENCE
OF HIS ADMIRING WISITORS,
THE DRIVING DUKE.
Fragment of a Coming Novel of Modern Society.
“ONE well-known West-end Milliner is a graduate of Girton: another
bears a title; a third conceals a name not unknown to BURKE under a
pseudonym *.*.* Many of the best women of all classes are ready to do any-
thing by which the honest penny may be earned.”—Daily Paper.
ALGERNoN PLANTAGENET FITz-WHELR, fifth Duke of Basing-
hall, stood at the scullery-window, and gazed at the blank wall
beyond. The drawing and dining-room floors of , the Belgrave
Square Mansion above were let 5. to two rich middlemen
from the provinces. Hence the Duke and his * were reduced to
the necessity of occupying their own kitchens. Things had been
going rather hardly with them of late. The sale of the Rutlandshire
estates had not realised enough to . off the mortgages with which
the º in º days had been heavily encumbered, and the
sum realised upon the disposal of the family jewels, and invested as
a last resource in the purchase of a wholesale butcher's business in
the Tottenham Court Road, had totally disappeared, engulphed in
the failure of that ill-fated and sadly mismanaged enterprise.
Nothing was, therefore, left them but the town family mansion, and
this, º boldly inserting a bill bearing the word “Apartments” over
the hall door, they had hitherto turned to sufficient good account to
enable them to cover the charges of the parochial rates, and still
preserve a little balance in hand over towards the joint expenses of
their living. But the struggle for existence was a severe one. That
very morning a local greengrocer who supplied them with an occa-
sional sack of coals on credit, had declined to let them have any more
without the money. It was this incident which had caused the Duke
to stare with such settled gloom at the blank wall beyond the scullery
window. ... Biting his iron-grey moustache, he turned mechanically
towards the room.
As he did so, a tall, fair, graceful girl, whose proudly-arched neck
and stately carriage told of the good blood that was flowing in her
veins, rose to meet him. “Ah! Papa,” she said, in a bright, cheer-
ful voice, “don’t be downcast about that horrid money. e, I shall
soon make some. _ I have already painted seven of these birthday-
cards, and when I have done three dozen the newspaper-shop round
the corner says that I may leave them on sale or return, and get
three-halfpence a-piece for them. Think, if I sell them all, you will
be able to purchase and pay for two sacks of coal at once. So,
courage, dear Papa.” The º HoNoHIA kissed her noble father
as she spoke. a only groaned heavily. In an instant his other
three daughters, the, Ladies ANNABEL, FLORILINE, and THEoposLA,
were at his side. “Look, Papa,” they all cried with one voice,
“why, we are all helping to bring grist to the mill.” -
“See,” said the Lady ANNABEL, holding out a specimen of her
work, “I am making match-boxes, and as I receive twopence for
five dozen, I am earning .# half a farthing in nine hours... It
doesn't sound much,” she added, with a light laugh, “but still it is
something.”
“And I, too,” continued the º

'next street to take three twopenny bottles on trial,
“Yes, Papa,” chimed in Lady THEoposia, “ and I'm making
button-holes for an Agent of a large East End slop-shop. It isn't
very quick work. But the Agent says I’m sure to make something
out of it if I can º at it. And I think I can.”
At that moment the bell rang. The four girls at once made a
movement as if to answer it.

“No-it is the dining-room ringing about dinner,” she said,
“and I had better take the orders.”
Spite the aristocratic hauteur of her manner, there was a subtle
tremulousness in her voice as she proudly swept through the kitchen-
door that told of hidden emotion, stifled by superior breeding. The
Duke noticed it. -
“And only last season she, in her train and plumes, was presenting
}. at Court!” he wailed, piteously surveying her four fair daughters.
hen he buried his head in his hands on the dresser, and wept.
The entrance of a handsome figure bearing a butcher's tray, and
wearing the ordinary blouse associated with that calling, aroused him.
“I’ve just left my last, joint,” said the new-comer, heartily
“and looked in to see how things were going. All's well, I hope l’
“Ah, CADoGAN, my boy,” said the Duke, mournfully surve ing
the garb worn by his son, “what a change from the Life Guards l'
His voice was choked with the strong feeling that mastered him.
“Can you, -can you bear it?”
“What! this?” replied the youthful Earl, good-humouredly,
fingering the article of dress in question. “Why }. considering I
may i regard myself as in the blouse: , Hal ha i. And as for
this.”—he took up his tray and swung it lightly on his shoulder as
he spoke. “I might e ‘ ſº bien’ for the family motto, so
well do we get along together. Hope the mother is all right. Ta,
ta, every one.” -
In another moment he had lightly mounted the area-steps, and
vanished, whistling in the distance. - -
But the Duke had fallen prone upon the kitchen-table, his head
again buried in his hands. He remained there motionless for some
considerable time, then he got up—not before, however, he had made
a resolve. It was to visit the representative of the General Omnibus
Company that very Right.
- - -
The apartments at 82, Belgrave Square are still let, and, owing to
the occupation of the drawing-rooms by a rich family of the Hebrew
persuasion, the house is doing fairly well. The Duchess still waits
on the dining-room, and the Ladies HoNoFIA, ANNABEL, FLORILINE,
and THEoDosLA, together with their fº. brother, the Earl
of LIMPET, do their little best to add to the family resources. The
Duke, however, comes home now only late at night and leaves earl
in the morning, merely getting an occasional Sunday at home wit
his family. But his time is well employed. He is the driver of a
King's Cross and Hammersmith omnibus. Those who do not know
his story only notice the extraordinarily aristocratic bearing with
which he handles the reins. Those who do, and they are limited to a
few policemen along his route, point him out to each other as a
“working man and no mistake,” “You’ll go a long way,” they
say, “before you’ll match the Driving Duke!’
A NEw LAMP For AN OLD ONE (at the Comedy Theatre).-The
“New Lamp” which employs the Russian Nihilist Oil, is but an in-
different substitute for the old and most effective Fidor. Lamp
patented by WICTORIEN SARDog. Only those who expect something
more than nihil from a Nihilistic plot will be disappointed with that
of the Red Lamp. A Trusted Reporter informs us that in this
drama something is always being expected to “go off,” but never
does; that Mr. TREE is wonderfully made up, and, unlike the mine
does “go off”—occasionally. Mines are hazardous things to deal
with. Our T. R. further observes, that much as he should like to
parody the piece, yet that this would be useless, as the Manager will
º: “take it off” himself, unless the Lamp burns somewhat
É. than it did on the first night. The Red Lamp may give
a steady though more subdued light, if carefully trimmed.
“CHARLEs—HIs FRIEND.”—Mr. CHARLEs WYNDHAM, by Dr.
MoRELL MACKENZTE's orders, was not permitted, to play David
Garrick on Drury Lane stage. The papers reported him as “seriously
ill.” Nonsense, he is not, and never has been, “seriously” anything,
and Mr. Punch is delighted to be in a position to inform the public
that their favourite º t comedian was only temporarily suffering,
like most of us, from the East wind, and on any similar occasion he
thinks of advertising himself as “East-WYNDHAM.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.
THERE are some votaries of that noblest of all Arts, Recitation,
whose not unworthy ambition it is to thrill and curdle a helpless
audience, and, as a corpulent and
immortal youth (not an Amateur
Reciter) is reported to have de-
sired, “to make their flesh creep.”
It is less difficult than might be
supposed to set your hearers long-
sº ing feverishly for the end, and
* the student may generally count
upon so much as attained almost
with his opening words; but to curdle them,
to harrow them up, and raise and lower
their temperature alternately, in leaps
of ten degrees Fahrenheit, all this re-
quires study, and (perhaps) a certain
appropriate quality in the subject you
have selected.
Mr. Punch's Poet has supped late on
purpose to satisfy so legitimate a demand,
and, if the result is not quite equal to his
expectations, he ventures, to think that,
treated with talent—and who recites with-
out the consciousness of so much at least?
—it will prove effective in its way. He
calls it (though there is no particular
reason why it should not have been called
something else)—

The clammy tombstones all distilled a †: unwholesome dew :

Then down he sank upon the stones with a dull and heavy thud,

“Full long,” he wailed, “upon this heart the worm hath banqueted!”
(A cloud was drifting past the moon, and sicklier she shone,

CLASSIC AD-WICE.
THE following . Address, has been received by the University
Authorities at Oxford on the subject of the bad Latin which dis-
figures the new “Statute” proposed by the Curators of the Bodleian
Library. It does not bear any signature, but is supposed, by internal
evidence, to emanate from some Undergraduate embers of the
University who have recently passed “Smalls,” and are rather proud
of the event. The matter has been placed in the paws of the Proctor's
Bull-dogs, with a promise of an addition to their salary if they
manage to discover the perpetrators. It is expected that every
Undergraduate will be required to sign his name in the presence of
the Proctor and Mr. NETHERCLIFT, for a comparison of handwritings.

Their numbers once were four, or five, or seven.

CATECHISM FOR LONDONERS,
Q. WHAT is a Premium ?
A. A Premium is a Latin word meaning “prize” or
“reward.” In London this reward is given by Land-
lords to themselves out of the money of incoming
Tenants.
Q. Is a Premium a prize for good conduct?
. 4: Exclusively so. The good conduct consists in allow-
ing Tenants to live in London at all.
Q..Is the moment when a house is, taken the only
occasion on which a Premium is exacted?
4...Not at all. When a lease expires, Landlords, es-
É. Ducal ones (see Mr. PLATT's evidence before the
arliamentary Committee), often refuse to renew without
a heavy Premium,
Q. Is it a valid plea to say that this Premium is a
repayment to the Landlord for improvements which he
has kindly made in the house?
. A. No; because the Landlord hardly ever makes any
improvements.
Q. Then, at any rate, Tenants of London houses can
always have the advantage of a lease, if they like to pay
a Premium for it?
A. Such is not the case. Some Ducal Landlords now
exact Premiums, and at the same time refuse to grant
eases,
Q. Then the Tenant becomes a mere Tenant-at-will?
4. Unless he prefers to become a Tenant-at-Won't,
and leaves the house in disgust.
Q. Why do not all Tenants adopt the latter system?
4. Because to leave his place of business may mean

to a tradesman the sacrifice of his “connection,” a fact of which Landlords
take full advantage. - -
Q. If a Tenant asked his Landlord for compensation for improvements
executed by himself, what would the latter do?
A. Improve him off the estate, probably.
Q. When a London Landlord destroys at one blow the value of a Trades-
man's good-will, by refusing him a lease, and drives him to emigrate by
exacting a “starvation rent,” what does he call the result to the Tenant?
A. A happy re-lease. -
Q. What is the theoretical foundation on which Ducal Landlords build
their claim to rack-rent all occupiers who “hold of" them P
A. That it is entirely owing to their own careful attention and unremitting
exertions that the soil of London is now of any value whatever.
Q. And of what material is that foundation largely composed ?
A. Portland Cement.
Q. What would the Ducal monopoly of land and houses in the best situations
in London be called in Chicago?
A. A “corner in rents.” - - - - -
Q. And what would be an appropiate name for the victim of this monopoly?
A. A Ground-Tenant.
Q. Although the Ducal system of “improving estates,” by turning out old
Tenants and raising the rent to the utmost possible limit, may press hardly on
individuals, do not these territorial, magnates display a splendid example of
public-spirited generosity and self-denying civic virtue which compensates for
private loss? A. Scarcely.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
rixtracted FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Wight, April 25:-GoscBEN had
quite a pleasant evening all to himself. Budget Resolutions sub-
mitted. GLADSTONE with flower in button-hole and smile on face,
blandly trampled on them. GoscBEN created Surplus by partly
intermitting payment on Debt. GLADSTONE shocked beyond measure
by financial immorality; but spoke rather in sorrow than in anger.
Carefully refrained from declamation; maintained throughout con-
versational tone; but heart evidently bleeding at defection of one of |S
his oldest and most promising pupils. “RACHEL weeping for her
children was nothing to this,” said HARCOURT, with a suspicious
ifle. As for GoschEN he broke down entirely; wrung his hands,
beat his breast, and at one moment seemed as if he were about to
rend W. H. SMITH's garments.
This scene enough for mortal, man to bear in one sitting. But
there was another distinguished financier who had also suffered
by reason of GoscHEN’s shortcomings. This was GRANDoIPH,
who had listened to GLADSTONE's criticism with marked attention.
Occasionally encouraged that young novice by audible expression of
approval. Now he took up the parable, and undertook to teach
oscEEN a thing or two. Only recently GRANDoIPH has come out as
a financial authority. House would not have been surprised to have
heard he had undertaken the control of the Army or the direction of
the Channel Fleet. Learned with-mingled amusement and amaze-
ment that he was Changellor of the Exchequer. Held the position
for a few months, and so qualified himself to lecture Gösch EN.
Quite a chance it wasn't GLADSTONE that came under his ruthless
criticism... GLADSTONE, however, in good luck. GRANDOLPH agreed
with him in financial policy, and joined him in belabouring Gosch EN.
Very funny to hear the stripling gravely discoursing Ways and
Means, patronising GLADSTONE, speaking with modified respect of
Sir RobºBT PEEL, and sternly reproving GoscHEN.
Old Mother HUBBARD had brought down speech designed to correct
GoschEN, and indicate where, even yet, after many disappointments,
a perfect Chancellor of the Exchequer
was to be found. Curious to watch
his face as GRANDOLPH, sported with
millions, and §adjusted the National
taxation. “ y ” said the old gen-
tleman, testily, “ he was in petticoats
when I first showed the House of Com-
mons what a much better Chancellor
of the Exchequer I would make than
DISRAELI.” -
Business done.—Budget Resolutions
agreed to.
Tuesday.—Never saw W. H. SMITH
so thoroughly roused as to-
night. . As a rule, throughout
successive crises succeeds in
preserving appearance of pro-
found wisdom. Does not speak
much, but conveys impression
that he thinks the more. Some-
times, after dinner, impassivit
becomes sensibly more fixed.
Grave suspicion that he's
asleep strengthened by deter-
; manner in which he
smiles when awakened by a
cheer or burst of laughter.
“Doesn't do this nearly as
well as Dizzy or GLADSTONE,”
says DILLwyN, who has
watched both through many years.

“Through whole hour lookers-
was awake or asleep. Sat with
coat-tails brought forward and º: over thighs, arms
folded, head bent, face like a mask. ... Might be asleep, and again
mightn't. GLADSTONE stretches himself out on bench, unblushingly
closes eyes, and looks fast asleep... But let someone misquote one of
his Midlothian Speeches, and he’ll learn whether he's asleep or not.
; when roused, looks too furiously as if he had been awake all
e time.
What woke up SMITH to-day was not sudden cheer or burst of
laughter. It was *. of unparalleled audacity submitted to
him. . Seems SMITH has two Secretaries, one Jones, other BRowN.
J; and B. spend leisure moments in writing to correspondents fierce
philippies against the Opposition. Two of these got into pa ;
MITH challenged, as to their genuineness and authority, “Quite
right,” he says; “letters written on my behalf by my Secretaries.
But I never saw them.” Didn't know they had been written till
now brought under his notice. House aghast at his confession.
What might not happen, Jones and BRow N, firing round at large
under the mask of the revered SMITH P Feeling of evident uneasi-
ness stole over House. No man felt safe. “Tell you what,” said
W. DAVIES, holding on to knees, and making himself look small as
possible, “what with forged letters going about; and Secretaries
writing in Ministers' names unbeknown to them, Parliament isn't a
bed of roses, nor yet all beer and skittles.”

B. B. looked at me in way that led me to change the subject.
Got B. B. in Distinguished Strangers' Gallery, BALFour (not
ARTHUR) on legs, explaining Scotch law to animated audience.
Instantly fixed B.B.'s attention.
“Who’s that fellow with his scalp lifted, jabbering away at the
table?” he asked.
“That,” I said, “is the former Lord Advocate for Scotland. A
very good º likes him.”
“Then who lifted his sca f ?”
“Ah, that's a mistake. It’s not what you think. . It’s a trick
people, especially Barristers, have here of losing their hair in early
youth... We have no scalping here, and this is a way Nature has of
redressing the balance between the Old World and the New.”
B. B. grunted, but evidently not satisfied. Presently began to
unwind something from his waist.
“What’s that?” I asked.
“That’s a lassoo,” he said.
“And what are you going to do?”
i. ºns to fetch that chap up,” said B. B., steadily unwinding
inseit.
Good Heavens ! ...Here was a prospect. An ex-Lord Advocate
lassoed from the gallery and dragged across floor of House.
“You can't do it here,” I, whispered, “you'll catch the table.
Come, and I’ll show you a better place.”
Got B. out, wandered about passages till lost ourselves, and finally
got, out into Palace Yard. B. didn't seem to care to go back, so
packed himself up again, and set out for the Wild West by Earl's
Court. Felt too shaken to return, and so home.

Mr. GoscHEN deplores its “gradual loss of all elasticity.”. It must

that case, how much longer will any Chancellor of the Exchequer be

ASPIRING AMATEURS.
MR. PUNCH has received the following letters, which have been
addressed to an eminent Judge, a famous Artist, a celebrated Sur-
geon, and a gifted Novelist, with an invitation that he should send
the writers a suitable answer. He has much pleasure in complying
with the request.
DEAR My LoRD, I.
I TRUST you will not consider me guilty of º;
am sure. that with a little
when I inform, you that I º nay,
coaching I could make as good a Judge as your i.; It is true
that, after a yery distinguished career at the Bar, your Ludship was
selected for the very high office it is now your good fortune to fill.
That I should appeal to you for assistance in this little matter is a
proof that I am sensible that your Ludship performs your duties
with much ability. If I did not believe that you were a very good
Judge I should not ask you to teach me the technicalities of the
position. But, having said this, I must, in fairness to myself, con-
fess that I see no reason why I should not do equally well. It is
true that I have a slight impediment in my . but that ºf
defect should make my decisions the more deliberate. When I tel
you that I once attended a Fancy Dress Ball in the borrowed robes of
a Barrister, I am quite sure your Lºdhººl at once recognise my
claims to a seat on the Bench. ours faithfully,
EDWARD SMITH.
RESPECTED SIR, II,
I AM sure you will be pleased to hear that for many years I
have been greatly delighted with the works of Art, you have con-
tributed to the Royal Academy. I have often looked at some of your
figure subjects, and whenever I have done so, haye come to the con-
clusion that I could do nearly as well. Were I not naturally of a
modest disposition, perhaps I might put the matter more strongly in
my own recommendation. In early life I failed to “pass out” of
Woolwich either into the Engineers or the Gunners, and as it has
ever been my ambition to write “R.A.” after my name, I think I
can accomplish the feat by turning Artist. My chief difficulty is in
the details of the profession. I feel you can give me a helping hand,
and, for the sake of Art, will gladly do so. What I want to know is
this—which is longer, a head, a b # or a leg P I should also (as I
am colour blind) like to have a few hints about how to paint a sun-
set. Were I to master these technicalities, I feel sure that I should
soon claim to sit in Burlington House as one of your colleagues.
Please let me know, soon whether you will give me the necessary
hints (you can teach me the whole bag of tricks in ten minutes) as
failing Art, I think I shall go in for being an Archbishop, when it
will be necessary for me to address a few lines in a similar strain to
His Grace of CANTERBURY. Yours truly, JoHN Jon Es.
III,
My VERY DEAR SIR,
PARDoN me for troubling you in the midst of your patients,
but I am so sure that I can perform a surgical operation as well as
ou, that I really, in the name of science, must refuse to apologise.
enfteil wou that I can takeoff the wing of a roast fowl without
the least difficulty, you will at once realise that I have already
mastered to a great extent the difficulties of anatomy. For all that
I should like a few hints. Perhaps you will let me know whether
ou should use Chloroform or Ether, or what? I suppose, too, one
as to get some peculiar sort of lancet or other surgical instrument?
I am determined to get a Baronetcy for proficiency in surgery, and
as I am far too cleyer to undergo the drudgery of walking the
hospitals, &c, &c., I shall be much obliged if you will, please give
me a rough idea of what is necessary. Yours f ully,
HENRY BRowN.

(Mr. Punch's Answer to the above.)
Mr. Punch, who has neither time nor inclination to send a separate
reply to each of the writers of the above letters, begs to deal with
them en bloc. He wishes to say that it is as easy for an ignorant
dolt without training or aptitude to become inten minutes, a Judge,
a Royal Academician, an eminent Surgeon or a famous Author, as
it is for an Amateur who has never got beyond the “form" of
“Charles, his Friend,” or “Lucy (Mrs. Bouncer's daughter),” in
the Theatre Royal Back Drawing-room, to bound on to the stage, after
a fortnight's coaching, and become at once an EDMUND KEAN, or a
Mrs. SIDDONs. Verbum sap.

Never met Mr. GLADsroNE in my life, before, but reckon he's a first-rate
|hand at getting out a smart and high-toned advertisement.
TRUTH states, that in consequence of, the funds forwarded by charitable
readers to aid in sending poor London Children for a few weeks' country air in
summer-time, Mrs. JEUNE was able to give four hundred and seventy-four of
them a real country treat. Out of compliment to this lady's admirable exertions,
the month of their holiday should be, evidently, June. The fulfilment of JEUNE
is better than The Promise of May.
It is not absolutely true that in consequence of his Artistic Joke in Bond
Street, the Fiery FURNIss has applied for police protection. But it is a fact
that being # * of a holiday after his work, our Caricaturist is going to
“take himself off.
“D.”
A Lay of Modern London,
“There are many known ways of disposing of house refuse;
but we are convinced that the very worst, the most stupid and
dangerous, is that which seems to be immortal in London—the
open cart, and the rotten basket.”—Lancet.
THE-he whom euphemism's courtly use
Softens, in good society, to “Deuce,”
Going his rounds in London, chanced to see
In windows here and there a big black “D.”
The longicaudate omnivagrant elf
Thought it at first a summons to himself;
But at that moment on his startled ear
There echoed through the street a sound of fear
Raucously resonant, so vile a howl
As never tiger on its nightly prowl
Thundered upon the º of Nox,
Although the fiend is used to aural shocks,
He shuddered at the shindy. “What,” he cried,
... Can this be?” ...Then, with loud and loutish stride,
With string-girt “cords” that left huge ankles bare,
With much-fouled smock, and mass of matted hair,
Lounged up a coarse colossus. With him went
A nameless, nasty, most mephitic scent
That Tophet could not parallel, . It rose,
Making his sable highness hold his nose,
From a much-crusted cart piled high with—what?
“He,” quoth “Old Nick, “may know—I’d rather not.”
A March wind blew, and on that biting breeze
Was borne a cloud that made you choke and sneeze,
Sicken, expectorate—a foul simoom
That might have whistled through the charnel's gloom.
‘‘Peripatetic pestl” cried Lucifer,
“Who are you?” “Whoy, oibe a doostman, Sur,”
Growled, huskily as Death with a catarrh,
The brawny, big-mouthed mooncalf. “Oh! you are ?”
Smiled the sardonic one. “I see, I see,
A sweeper-out of sepulchres!”—“Not me,”
Caliban chuckled. “Dust-bins be my mark.”
“Oh!” cried the fiend, still slightly in the dark.
Further to question this stentorian pig
Lucifer thought a little infra dig.,
And so he watched him simply. Saw him call
At a smart villa, trample through the hall,
Q'er the tiled forecourt, down the clean-swept stair,
Leaving his hob-nailed footmarks everywhere;
Saw him with spade and basket delve and thrust
At a malodorous bin of so-called “dust,”
Dispersing fetid fumes at every stroke,
Compared with which his Phlegethon's own smoke
Was summer fragrance; heard him growl and jeer,
Clamour for . and beg for beer;
Saw, at his loud disdain of “tip” or drink,
The housewife tremble and the housemaid shrink;
Saw him º: and leave a dirty wreck
Where, ere he came, was sweetness void of speck,
Then, with piled cart, slung ladder, basket foul,
Beheld the brute resume his noisome prowl,
His sullen tramp, and intermittent howl.
...Well,” mocked the fiend, “and this is what men call
Civilisation Stench, stentorian bawl;
Despotic insolence that naught can please,
Wandering noise and travelling disease.
A dirty chaos in the neat home-nest
The streets a hunting-ground for old King Pest.
Fancy proud Babylon dealing thus with ‘Dust,”
Without an insurrection of disgust 1
'Tis yon big brute they summon by their ‘D’ ſ
Well, while he rules, why should they call on Me?”
A, FISHING QUESTION.—According to a leading article
on “Large Salmon”:-
“Much in the natural history of the salmon remains myste-
rious. Whether it feed or not during its annual visits to its
native streams, is still a matter of controversy.”
If salmon don't feed in fresh-water rivers, how is it
* are fished for with rod and line P. When they rise at
a fly don't they mean to eat it? By what enticement
but that of a bait do they get themselves hooked P. Was
that point ever a matter of controyersy, and does it still
remain a mystery in the natural history of the On
which naturalists acknowledge themselves unable to
explain?

MADAME Favart has been revived at the

is scarcely a laugh in it from beginning to
end, and yet, years ago, we believe it was a
success with the same prima donna, WIOLET
CAMERON, and M. MARIUS, Mr. ARTHUR
RoBERTs, though playing Favart, is “not
in it,” and does hardly anything with the
art. But if Miss St. John, Miss PHYLLIs
RoughTon, — with one clever dance, —
pretty faces, and some bright music are
sufficient attractions, then the motto of this
house at present might well be, “a Fair
Field and no Favart.” . Perhaps it is only
a stop-gap until something Arthur-Robert-
sonian can be produced. Robinson Crusoe
was idiotic, but Roberts was very funny in
it, which he most certainly isn't as Favart.
We are inclined to adapt Caliban's doggerel,
and sing:-
“Ban, Ban, Ca-Caliban,
Avenue Theatre, 'Ave a new—piece l’”
At the §º Mr. EDouTN has produced
a farce called A Tragedy, in which he him-
self is droll enough, and it will make people
lº till he gets something better.
any of BUFFALO BILL's Indians, or Cow-
ys, we are not sure which, attended, it is
reported, a Presbyterian place of worship
on Sunday. This looks as if there is some
Scotch element from the Great Macaw clan
among them. This, however, is not so, as
we believe that, after visiting the Lyceum,
they one and all announced their wish to
be considered as Irvingites. The Indians
are delighted, as they say, “We have now
been face to face with the Great Mys-terry.”
MRs. RAM wants to know if “The Cockney
Isles” are so called on account of the num-
ber of Londoners touring there? (N.B.-
Her nephew is of opinion that the excellent
lady was thinking of the “Orkney Isles.”)

FROM “GRAND OLD WHITE Collah,” ALIAs “STRoNG WILL,” CHIEF of THE OPPER Sishu N
HINDERUNs.
CHIEFS IN COUNCIL.
From Our Own Special Earl's Court Interpreter.
THE Distinguished Statesman and party had now arrived at the encampment, and it was
explained to the illustrious Indian hero that the “Great White Chief” was waiting to receive
him without. In another instant “Yellow Slippers,” ferocious in his Nº. and feathers,
had sprung to the door of his tent with a wild war-whoop, and, brandishing his gleaming toma-
hawk, signified, in the stinging accents of the Sioux dialect, his readiness to meet all comers.
There was some commotion among those assembled outside, but it quickly subsided on the
Trapper announcing, at the Distinguished Statesman's request, that the “‘Great White
Father had only come to have a little friendly talk over the peace pipe.” Upon hearing this,
the Indian, eyeing his supposed rival disdainfully, drew his blanket moodily around him, and
waited for the conversation to commence. - - - -
“I had better put a poser to him, to open with,” observed the Distinguished Statesman,
thoughtfully. “Ask him what, in his opinion, will be the probable effects of the forthcoming
Show, on the financial prospects of the General Qmnibus, Company, and the Metropolitan
District Railway respectively, and how he thinks the Shareholders of either undertaking will
view the progress of the projected enterprise.” -
On this being translated to “Yellow Slippers,” he only glared fiercely for a few minutes
in the direction of the “Great White Father,” and then shook his head.
... He does not understand,” explained the Trapper. -
“Dear me, that's awkward,” rejoined the Distinguished Statesman, “for, wishing to
impress him, i had arranged several ºl. questions for his solution. Ha! but I have
them hinted at here in the notes for my luncheon speech. Suppose you #". read him this.
Ifancy it mayn't be very clear, for I haven't quite made up my own mind what it all means,
and so, no doubt, it will probably puzzle him.’
He handed a well-pencilled sheet of paper to the Trapper as he spoke. The latter
proceeded forthwith to translate its contents to “Yellow Slippers,” who, however, repeatedly
shook his head at the various points, and gradually assumed an attitude of threatening
defiance. Finally, on its conclusion, he instantly sprang to his feet, and again giving a wild
war-whoop, ‘. his desire to have done with palaver, and meet the “Great White
Father” in combat in the arena, either with tomahawk or lasso, and there discuss with him, in
a language he could understand, matters rather more within his ordinary comprehension.
Affairs, assuming, therefore, a rather threatening aspect, and “Yellow Slippers.” being
understood still to express a wish that instead of meeting the “Great White Father,”
surrounded by pale faces, at West Kensington, he could only come across him, alone, on the
deserted plains of the real Wild West, the Distinguished Statesman and party hastily withdrew,
and retired to another part of the extensive grounds under the guidance of the courteous
officials who accompanied them.
THE ARREST of M. SchNEBELſ.-Trop, de zéle evidently. Pop, bang, fizzle, and froth.
So much the better. Let “the Pagny incident” be remembered historically as the “Sham-
pagny incident.”

WAITING WIERIFICATION.
THE following letters, for the authenticity of which their unmis-
takable signatures may be regarded as an undisputed guarantee,
having come, no matter how, into Mr. Punch's possession, he pub-
lishes them forthwith without further comment:-
MY DEAR MARQUIS, - -
THANK H. for the pretty present of Primroses, which
arrived quite safely, and with which I proceeded straightway to
decorate my balcony most effectively. I join the League, believeme,
with the greatest pleasure, and shall certainly, as you propose; instal
a Habitation in East Mayo at the first possible tº: For the
rest, take no account of my conduct in the House. I am obliged,
for obvious reasons, to make some outward show on the other side.
But that, you know, is only a ruse. When the Division comes, you
will find, my dear Marquis, that you have not counted in vain on the
unflinching support of Yours devotedly,
24.2%
MY DEAR SIR,
You evidently, in common with the rest of the British Public,
have fallen into the trap artfully laid for you by the coloured posters,
and are associating my advent in this country with the forthcoming
performances of the Wild West Show about to be held at the
American Exhibition shortly to be opened at Earl's Court. . Please
dispel the idea from your mind, for my mission over here, which is a
double one, is of a very different sort. In the first place I am the
accredited agent of the Government of the United States to settle the
Fisheries Dispute with the British Cabinet. In the second, I am the
first living representative of the part of Mephistopheles in my
country, and I have come over here to show your HENRY IRWING how
he ought to do it. ... My reputed connection with the Indians and
Cowboys at Earl's Court, you may, therefore, regard as the wildest
canard.—Yours faithfully, 92 % º
MY DEAR GENERAL,

Though I have not, for reasons of -
referred to the excellent movement you have originated and organis
I cannot loº refrain from assuring you, that it has my heartiest
approval. Indeed, if you will send the drum and uniform down to
Lambeth Palace, I will at once join your ranks, if only in the capacity
of a humble Corporal. Only let me know when you have your next
“drill” on down this way, and you shall soon find that you may, on
your parade, count, on no more boisterous demonstrative, and in-
defatigable recruit than yours, sincerely, and enthusiastically,
DEAR HARcourt,
AFTER mature and weighty consideration, I have determined
to throw up the whole Irish game. The last arguments used #.
SALISBURY about the Crimes Bill strike me as conclusive. e
makes out a strong, and, as I take it, an excellent case. You may,
therefore, let CHAMBERLAIN and HARTINGTON know that I unflinch-
ingly abandon in the future all former points of difference. Tell
them I henceforth relegate “Home Rule” to the four winds. The
news will not surprise them, as they know how little I am in the
habit of being tenaciously wedded to my own views, and how ever
open I am to the influence of the fair and valid arguments of those
who happen to be politically opposed to me. Ever yours, with much
conviction, & .

DEAR CoCKALORUM,
IF I had only known that Fº: would have published m
tº: little note in the shape of an advertisement, how muc
better I could have made it. As it was, I read it in print wit
infinite satisfaction and delight. The whole thing struck me as
in such excellent taste. , But mind, dear boy, the next time you
want something of the kind you º me notice, and I promise
you you shall have something veritably hors de ligne. Hoping you
did enjoy the dinner. am, yours eternally,
N.B.-As Mr. Punch thinks it very º: that the foregoing
writers will deny their own signatures, he only has to ask them if
they can tell him how they got there: , Having called in a Committee
of Experts, he has of course satisfied himself that he knows what he
is about, though he candidly admits, judging from a recent rather
notorious ºne. that this is not the same thing as satisfying
everybody else.
THE LANE AND THE GARDEN.
Drury Lane.—The Rose Garden is open. The Temple of AUGUSTU's
DRURIoI.ANUs is occupied by CARL Rosa (Limited), and Mme. MARIE
Roze inaugurated the season—a short, but, we hope, a merry one-
with Carmen. It is put on the Stage in a style worthy of the

Augustan age, and the Year of Jubilee. For Wednesday (to-day)
the new Opera, Nordisa, by Mr. CoRDER, is announced. Sursum
Corder / CARL Rosa, flimited? We anticipate success for this
novelty. “Corder thou art, and shalt be more hereafter l’—which,
we believe, is in Macbeth, but if in doubt, refer to AUGUSTU's
DRURIOLANUs.
Covent, Garden.—That Leila and Carmen are by the same com-
poser is difficult to realise; the latter being sofull of catching melody
that after a first hearing, anyone with half an ear comes away
humming boldly, but incorrectly, the Toréador contento, and with a
burning anxiety to recall something of the cigarette song, -while
of the former not even a man with three correct ears for music could
hum, or would think of humming, a bar of its music.
Mlle. ALMA FoESTROM was a charming Leila, a sort of Weiled
Prophetess the 5. interest in the piece being occasioned by the
curiosity in the house to seize any moment when accident or desi
should lift the veil and show her face. It was like watching for the
cuckoo to come out of its little door in the clock when the hour
strikes. Mlle. ALMA sings and acts charmingly. M. LHERIE was a
picturesque Zurga, -whatever Zurga may be, apparently King of
the Fishermen.
The opening is bright, but this promise is not fulfilled. There is a
fine duet for Nadir (plenty of evident jokes on his name, which,
however, do not occur in the Opera), a very solemn and effective
prayer to Brahma, and a lively and telling finale to the First Act.
Leila appears to be very ill-used by the people who, after receiving
her as a divinity “to watch over and protect them,” immediately
change their tone, and threaten her that if she falls in love she
shall 'never again see sunrise.” She has, therefore, to get up early,
and the others get up earlier, and everyone more or less falls in
love with her, including three Fakirs—who do not sing the old
Jack Sheppard chorus of “Nix my dolly, pals, Faker way”—
with aii their clean finen from the wash tied rºund their heads, and
who are evidently suffering from violent chill in consequence, as they
pass a considerable portion of their time with their hands over a
sacred fire. If they were dressed as three Quakers, after the style
of Mr. BARRINGTON and Miss JEssIE, BoxDin Ruddygore, the flame
whereat they warm their hands might be the “Sacred Lamp”—not
the Red one—“of Burlesque.” In fact, in these Fakirs, with their
linen and drapery—the ee Linen-Drapers—the interest may be
h] said to be centred. They never tell their love for Leila, but they
show it by deeds; for they take a pot-shot at Nadir, her lover, miss
him, because the Linen-Drapers are not sportsmen, but bring him
in prisoner, and help to drag Leila away from his embrace.
here is a fine finale to the Second Act, and an effectiye finish, but
we should doubt whether º is in store for Leila and the
Iinen-Drapers, and whether any operatic, Manager will rub his
lºwith pleasure, and say to himself, “Leila / Good Bizet-

MR. PUNCH*S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.
A YouNg Man with a marked tendency to mildness º generally
does) select for recitation pieces in which that admirable quality forms.the
smallest possible ingredient. It makes a little
change for him, while it affords his friends
the surprise and gratification of witnessing
im in a new character. So the Poet this week
has constructed a piece which offers, a highly
effective character-part to the mild but am:
bitious youth. It is called “The Coster,” and
some of the lines may possibly be open to the
charge of coarseness. Perhaps they are coarse;
but then it must be remembered that a Coster
is not a Chesterfield. This is an Age of Real-
ism, and True Art is ever naturalistic. How-
ever, the Poet will undertake to forward,
free of charge, alternative lines to any verses
which may be considered fairly liable to
objection, for delivery in the suburbs and
provinces. - -- - -
In reciting this poem, it is of vital import-
- - ance that you, the Young Man for whom it is
intended, should let yourself go. For the
%. ! moment, remember that you are the Coster,

Good is not the Word.” vest.
Should you feel up to it, you might prepare yourself by turning up the
bottoms of your trousers, tying a silk wrapper round your neck, and wearing
our dress-coat inside out—it is not the usual costume of a Costermonger, but it
elps to give you confidence and assists the illusion. Try to be as vulgar as you
can: no one will mind, if they see the vulgarity is only assumed.
With these preliminary hints we will proceed:–
Soyer want me to tell yer about it? Well, yer don't seem a bad sort o' bloke.

Set down on the hedge o' my barrer; but mind yer don't tip up the moke!
(“Moke,” as you may be aware, is a donkey, in this case an imaginary animal,
harnessed to an unseen barrow; these little details render the whole thing
so much more dramatic and vivid.)
Yer kin stand me a drain when I’m done, if yer like—there's a public that's

And our 'ome was a bloomin' 'umble 'ome, but the 'umblest 'ome kin be dear!

wou can go round and apologise for it afterwards.) .

But hall of a suddin my thoughts got turned the t'other way about;

“O Feller-workers an' Friends,” says he, “Society’s rotten an' holler 1
Think o' yer comfortless 'omes,” he sez, “and yer lives as is spent in squoller!
Think o' the gorgeous †. rooms as is howned by the bloated rich, ſº ?
With their carpets, and sofies, and soft, harm-cheers. Hev you got the likes o'
These Swells is a wasteful extravagant set, as yer’ll see for yerselves when you hear
That they spends on soap in a single week what’ud keep you a fortnightin beer!”
Well, hejawed away till he showed quite clear, what I’d never believed till then-
That the 'ome I’ad bin so § on was honly a 'orrible den!
'Qw could it hever be anythink else but poverty-stricken and sordid,
When it didn't 'ave one o' them luxuries rare of which I had bin defrondid?
(Give this with passion, but convey the idea that it relates to a byegone state of mind.)
Fur many a day, as I thought this out, I'd take and cry like a child,
And the light seemed all blowed out o' my life, and its innercent pleasures spiled!
And the longer. I went on livin' the lower my sperrits sunk,
Till the Missus's eyes weren't blackfor amonth, for I'adn't the 'art togit drunk!

I reelly believe if I’adn't bin roused I was goin' to rack and to ruin,
But I felt I must make a heffort some'ow, so I give a copper a doin',

Who saw what I wanted was change of hair, and sent me to quod for a week.

Well, when I come out at the hend o' my time, I felt like a haltered cove;
As back, with a chastened 'art, I sped to my hattic at Lisson Grove,

But I wentured in; and I rubbed my heyes; for darned
if it didn't seem,
That either I couldn't be right in my’ed, or was in some
orrible dream!
(Pause ; then continue, in a tone of concentrated horror.)
Fur the room was painted a light pea-green (which the
same is a culler I’ates!),
And, wherever you couldn't get at 'em, was 'anging up
blue, and white plates;
The milepiece had a petticut on, and up on the winder-
s
Was a mug o' yoilets, as smelt that loud as they werry
nigh made me ill!
The door was a dollop o' Japanese fans, and the cupboard
was painted white,
And *i.ºneum had sprinkled a job-lot o' spadgers
in flight!
A thing as they calls a “dodo,” on the walls was a
runnin’ round,
And my oldfil was a settin' asleep in a ruebub-cullered
gownd!
(Try to realise here how excessively all this would be
calculated to annoy a Costermonger.)
In my hown armcheer, as had got a coat of horiental red,
And a big humberella was hupside down on the ceiling
over her 'ed!
Well, I routed her up in a minnit and I sez: “You’re a
nice cup o' tea!
. . (Coarse again, but characteristic-risk it.)
This 'ere is a pretty state o' things for your 'usban' to
come in and see
D'yer think I'm a goin' to set in a place as is on'y fit for
Tom-fools? -
With yer wickerwork cheers, and3: plants in pots, and
these 'ere little three-legged stools!”
“Why, BITI,” she sez, “I should never ha’ thought as
you'd fly in a tearin' passion,
'Cause a kind old lady's took in her head to do us up in
the fashion 1
She thought it was jist what yer wanted so, and she
never meant to insult yer, -
For this 'ere is luxoorious comfort, BILL,~it’s what them
asetics calls ‘Culcher l’
See, these little ‘hoccasional tables' is for arternoon tea
and chat, -
Or for, when a gentleman's callin', to put down his
chimley pot 'at;
Them plates is considered ‘so de-corative,’ and so is the
pots and º. -
But I can't recollect the partickler good of the humberella
and fans.” -
“I dessay it's werry genteel,” sez I, “but my notion o'
comfort it ain't. -
Tolive in a litter o' stuff like this would aggerawate a
saint;
Ifancy I sees myself fallin' about when I’ve taken an
extry drop, -
And a breakin' my shins like a bloomin' bull in a blessed
Chiney shop...
I'll not have none of it, BETSY,” I sez, and I chucked the
lot of it out, -
And my 'art it throbbed with a honest pride as I see it go
up the spout!.
(Give this with a spirited independence.)
For we all on us has our feelings, Sir, and mine was cruel
hurt,
To think as a swell could ha’ stooped so low as to rob a
poor man of his dirt 1
So I ". * for Culcher now, or henvy the harris-
Crats;
I'm cured for life o' the longing I’ad for a roomful of
brick-a-bats, -
Of spadgers and pea-green paint you will find in the attic
'ardly a trace,
And when my old woman and me has words—there's
allus plenty o’ space!
That is all, but the author believes it will be found to
bristle with opportunities for the beginner. There is an
alternative ending, in which the Coster is refined and
redeemed by the gentle influences of his new surround-
ings, but there really should be some limits to Naturalism.

Besides there was no sort of precedent for it. If PARNELL wouldn't

Third Well-Informed Passenger (putting down the Daily News).
No, I should think not. It is well known that the whole thing is a

“Toréador” must have been more than “contento” with the stage
arrangements made by AUGUSTU's DRURIOLANUs HISPANIENSIs. Yet
when we saw the Bullfighter going to the arena, it did not occur to
us that they were in Spain, but on their way to Goring. MARIE
Roze, in the gipsy scene, came in on horseback. Never was Carmen
so well mounted. Mr. LESLIE CROTTY as Marguerite's Valentine
(we’re in another Opera now) was excellent, with a touch of SANTLEy
about him, of which he * be proud. The grouping for the death
of Valentine excellent. After ſº there were º of calls,

people who will make comparisons said, “not equal to FAURE.”
How unfair! How can one man, as a solo, be expected to be

According to a popular Scottish proverb, “hawks winna' pick oot

in the statement that a Dean and Chapter of the Established Church
distrained for tithes upon produce belonging to a clergyman of their

that it hurts no Body.

AT THE BIER OF BEER.
(By a Poet more Ale than Arty.)
WHAT is pure Beer? The beer that’s brewed alone of malt and hops.
To that is ALLsoPP's limited—the beer brewed else all slops.
Quassia, calumba, guinea-grains, beer-drinkers may condemn.
Yet though those bitters match not hops, there’s little harm in them.
But hops although the wise above all other herbs exalt,
The element of all good beer essentially is malt.
Qf gentian mere infusion, to acknowledge truth compels,
Much of your so-called bitter ale by many an X excels.
Malt in the fine old English beer could Toby Phillpot taste.
No longer now l—the beverage of a Briton is debased.
“Home-brewed” hath superseded been by vile and vapid “pale.”
There’s none such stuff as “stingo,” no, nor any “nut-brown ale.”
Oh, for the sound malt liquor, and the brave strong beer of old,
Like that near Covent Garden which was once at “OFFLEY’s” sold!
Then was John Barleycorn your man, but now, alas, he's dead,
And the farmer's flowing tankard from the roadside inn hath fled!

event. Turned out to be misapprehension. Sir CHARLEs about to
make one of his rare public appearances as Chairman of Committee
on Petitions....Happens only once or twice in history of a Parliament.
A Private Bill disposed of, Sir CHARLEs, amid impressive silence,
addressed SPEAKER at considerable length. Seems there has been a
little game going on in respect of Petitions presented in favour of
Coal and %. ues. Names of all classes of distinguished persons
forged. “W. H. SMITH, of the Strand,” figures. So does “Joseph

with wrath.. Some young bloods of Conservative Party been jeering
Opposition through glass door, where, years ago, they stood and
howled at GLADSTONE, “Was that in order?” NoLAN asked.
“Certainly not,” said CourTNEy, and NoLAN collapsed. Nothing
like having an authoritative opinion on points of order.
Business done.-More Coercion Debate.
Tuesday Night.—Walking along Terrace before W. this after-
noon came upon CHARLEs LEWIs at remote end. as leaning over
Terrace wall tearing up something and throwing pieces in the rolling
tide. º nearer found it was an artichoke he was pulling to
pieces leaf by leaf. “Put it on,” he said casting a leaf in theriver;
“Don’t,” and he threw in another. “Put it on-Don't.” So much
engrossed did not observe my approach. Started when I playfully
nipped his calf. “Gracious, Toby,” he shouted, “you shouldn't
do that sort of thing. Might have had me in the river.”
“Collapsed."
“What are you playing at,” I asked, “with your “Put it on,”
‘Don’t. Is that the way you always take your artichoke?”
“No,” he said, “Fact is I’m going to repeat my old game of

artichoke out of kitchen and left settlement of question to fate. But
§: put me, out. I’ve lost count, and, if you’ll excuse me, I'll
1n again.
§. the last leaf was “Don’t,” for when after questions LEwis
rose on Question of Privilege he wore black waistcoat. The Times it
seems has been running a-muck at John DIILoN; wanting to know
what has become of his grandmother; darkly, hinting that DILION
could tell an' he would. LEWIs, inflamed with sudden indignation
on behalf of Irish Member assailed, demands that printer of news-
paper shall be brought to the Bar. Exultation in Irish camp.
Consternation on Treasury Bench.
“I thought,” SMITH growled, “that when we made him a Baronet
we'd shut him up. Suppose he now wants be a Baron.”
LEwis, accustomed to being howled at, bent his head to storm, and
pursued his way. Read a letter he had sent to John DILLON. Began
“Sir CHARLEs LEWIS presents his compliments to Mr. DILLon.”
Letter, two pages long, bristled with “Sir CHARLEs LEwis.” . At
every repetition of title, made in unctuous tones, House went into
convulsions of laughter. TIM HEALY brought up the white waist-
coat of twelve years ago, and flaunted it in the new Barnet's face.
A bad time for the B. B. K. Began to see that he had played
into hands of enemy. ... The Parnellites took up his Motion, and
vehemently clamoured that it should be carried without delay. His
Conservative friends angry at being dragged through the mire. Not
lacking in pluck, and not unaccustomed to be misunderstood by the
House of Commons. But all this too much to bear. So when Division
called, “the Hon. Barnet” slunk away, and was seen no more.
“Ah, Toby l’’ he said as he passed out, “things would have been
different if I hadn't fooled with that artichoke, but had at once put
on the white waistcoat.”

Up just now to report to the SPEAKER one of TANNER's gracious
asides. Heard him, he tells the SPEAKER, call gentlemen opposite
a set of cads—cads with an adjective.
“My good man,” said AKERs-Douglas, “why should you go and
do a thing like that. Haven't we enough of what TANNER says when
on his legs without you º: what you overhear him . when
he's sitting down?" Think it over.” De LISLE said he would, and
presented the Conservative Whip with a copy of his Bill designed to
cut off American Money Supplies for the Land League.

night. BRADLAUGH resumed Debate on Privilege. Been making

BRADLAUGH did his work uncommonly well... Kept his temper
when GRANDoLPH lost his, meeting all contradictions and denials
with quotations frominexorable Hansard. The more GRANDOLPH
wriggled the more self-possessed and incisive BRADLAUGH grew, and
the more uproarious the merriment of House. General impression
that GRANDOLPH had met something more than his match, and that
BRADLAUGH had scored off long-standing account. Much more
heated talk on the Privilege Question, but—
* Business done.—None.
Friday. — House getting a little weary of
Debate on Privilege. Some lively speaking to-
night, but great falling away in attendance.
TIM HEALY got on early, and carried war into
enemy's country. SMITH evidently uneasy
under references to book-stall connections. TIM,
perceiving his advantage, ruthlessly pursued it.
“You sell the Times newspaper,” he thun-
dered, shaking fore-finger at the FIRST LORD of
the TREASURY, “and you are equally guilty
with the Times.” -
A poor joke this, after all. Certainly not
worth the paternal affection TIM showed for it,
trotting it out whenever his speech began to
flag. SAUNDERSON followed, and, as Alderman
FowleR (who knows his Shakspeare), observed,
“Now the wigs are on the green.”. But SAUN-
DERSON not quite himself. At outset, got en-
tangled, in remarkable metaphor. , Described
Parnellites as backbone of GLADSTONE's following.

to whitewash his backbone.” “But,” added the
Colonel, with profound subtlety, “he will
succeed only in whitewashing the vertebrae.”

CoMMITTEE THAT MR.DILLON's ENEMIEs would READILY Vote
FOR.—A Hanging Committee.
A DISMAL D.C.L.
PROFESSOR FREEMAN has been deploring the frivolity of our great
“Seats of Learning.” He says Oxford is a place where learning
doesn't sit at all, but is simply sat on. It’s given up I-
to tennis, boating, cricket, flirtation, concerts, and a
feeble imitation of London manners. If GoLDwDN
SMITH, and HENRY WIN-GOLD IRWING both give a
lecture the same night, off goes the University to
listen to the Actor, not the Professor! Well, is not
acting better than mere professing?... No remedy in
particularis proposed, except to boycottathletics. The
great athletic events are considered quite recognised
Academic periods, and Mr. FREEMAN would put a full
stop to such periods. As for social meetings in the
gardens attached to Colleges at Commem.-time, he
isn't a garden party himself, he says, and he won't
be a party to 'em. Concerts too, are frivolous, and
will have to go, though these might have been thought
to have some connection with sound learning.
Altogether the Professor at the (Oxford) breakfast-
table is a very gloomy kind of Professor indeed—
makes quite a “free breakfast-table” of it by his
way of going on. If the other Professor, whose
lecture was not properly, attended and reported,
agrees with him, he ought to change his name to
Scol DwDN SMITH, Some day, perhaps, he will figure || tº
as MACAULAY's New Zealander, or Canadian, survey-|º
ing the site of Oxford from a broken arch of Magdalen|lº
Bridge. Evidently Professor FREEMAN's idea of the ||
sort of exercise fitted for students and tutors at a
University is to take a “constitutional” and discuss
the exciting topic of the Anglo-Saxon Monarchy;
a natural idea perhaps for a Constitutional Historian,
and the author of the Making of England—which is
shortly to be followed, we believe, by a companion
volume entitled the May-queen of England. ‘Merry
and Wise,” is not the motto for this ſ. edition of
the Freeman's Journal.

MODEL MANCHESTER 1
TAKE the best features of all the “Shows” of South Kensington,
add to them a never-to-be-equalled collection of English modern
pictures of unrivalled excellence,
and serve up the whole with a
display of taste, energy, liber-
ality, and ºlº never to be
surpassed, and the product is the
Royal Jubilee Exhibition at Man-
chester. Cockneys are not a little
proud of their citizenship, but it
is only just to say that their
Lancashire cousins in the matter
of Art have taught them their
roper place—back seats. Mr.
unch takes off his hat, and bows
to the Executive Committee in all
their sections. Never before has
been seen such grand specimens
of . never again will be
viewedsonobleadisplayof English
Art. At the opening ceremony
London was #. repre-
sented by their Royal Highnesses
the Prince and the Princess; and
so greatly pleased were the afore-
said representatives, that they
found one day insufficient for
their private view, and conse-
quently su pººl. it with
another. e occasion was a P
stupendous success. Everybody - -.
was present who could be there. Mr. Punch is pleased with his Model.
The sun, no doubt receiving a hint from Apollo, left London early in
the morning, to put in an appearance in Manchester later in the
afternoon. Even in this there was evidence of the shine being taken
out of the Birthplace of the Cockneys. Unlike the Laureate’s play,
the Promise of *} was fully realised.
In selecting Sir Joseph LEE for their Chairman, the organisers of
the gem of the Jubilee proved that they knew how to lay their hands
upon a jewel. They brought a sure LEE to their bark, which, under
his guidance, could never suffer from wreckage on a lee-shore,
although leisure (and plenty of it) was certainly necessary for an
adequate examination of all the treasures of their Argosy, with its
cargo of better-than-golden grain. Mr. Punch_frankly admits
that his head teems with pleasant fancies that in Manchester were
affairs of the sternest matter of fact. As he sits in his easy chair in
85, Fleet Street, a vision of the fairest work of the finest men rises
before him. He sees once more, with the matured successes, the
earliest triumphs of LEIGHTON, the pick of the basket, the flower of
MILLAIs, the flame-coloured ideals of BURNE-Jon Es, the “hers” as
wjī as the hims” of WATTs, the graceful curves of TURNER, and
the products of that undoubted_Briton–RIVIERE. In black and
white come the pencilled forms of TENNIEL, SAMBOURNE, KEANE, and
the FURNIss, in the far-off Gainsborough Gallery. Every work had
been seen before; but, for all that, the Collection could be accurately
called—and no doubt the same idea occurred, to their Royal
Highnesses the Prince and Princess, as they walked through the
§. º by the Chairman of the Arts Committee—
AGNEw one. Then Mr. Punch recalls the sheen of the Silk Section,
the g. of the Irish Lace-makers, the case (rather a hard one) of
the Ship Canal, to say nothing (for little could be heard if it were
said) of the din of the Machinery in Motion. Lastly Mr. Punch's
imagination carries him back to “Old Manchester and Old Salford,”
which, truth to say, even in his reverie, seem more substantial than
“Old London.”
So as this is the year of Jubilee, the Sage of Fleet Street (who
the other Sages) gives an additional word of
advice. He says to would-be Exhibition Manufacturers not, “Go to
Bath or to Jericho’’ (as a disagreeable Sage might be induced to
- “but go to Manchester!
y want a perfect article, a superb model, go to Man-
chester!” And to non-Exhibition-Manufacturers, and the public
generally, he offers the same advice. In all sober seriousness (which
18 a. .# different thing to, and must not be confounded with, ine-
briate dignity) he repeats, “Go to Manchester!” And those who do
go to Manchester, he will vouch for it, will not rest, satisfied until
they have seen every inch of the Royal Jubilee Exhibition.
MRs. RAMsboTHAM hears that slides have been erected at several
recent exhibitions for tobacconists, in imitation of the Americans.
She has cautioned her Niece against them; for although, as she says,
tobacconists may be a very respectable set of people, yet she cannot
approve of their society exclusively.

regretted not to see no Aldermen, and I couldn't learn mohows how the mistake
occurd. They allers adds a dignerty to such meetings, and their long xperience is
allus waluable. . The LoRD MARE, with his usual #: nature, said as it was the
most distinguished assembly to be found in the Metrollypus, of coarse, when he
said so, he shut his eyes to the glories of his own Manshun House. -
Our great and prime Minister, as sumbody called him, kept us all in a roar,
though why he complained of the table for groaning, I coudn't at all understand,
though it was just a leetle rickety. He said as he was glad to see as his noble
frend Lord JoHN MANNERs had been hanged in his proper place, at which they all
laughed, tho I thort it rather a unkind remark, till I looked round and seed as he
ony meant his picter. His Lordship, then, to my perfound estonishment, wentured
to xcuse the failures of our Artists in making Stattys, by making fun of the
full evening dress of the present time! and acshally said as there was not a livin
man who would wentur to chissell such an atrocity, and if he did he wood go an
commit suicide directly as it appeared in public! Considering as I sees this lovely
costoom nearly ewery evening, and that it is coppied in every partickler from the
full dress of an Hed Waiter, I wentures, with all becoming umility, to place my
opinion in direct opposishun to that of his Lordship. Praps a yeller primrose in the
button-hole wood reconcile him to the despised swaller tale.
I was glad to hear from so hi an authority, that the House of Lords by keeping
regular hours and allowing nothink to hinterfere between them and their dinners,
is enjoying a perfect state of saloobrity, while the pore House of Commons, as the
result of neglecting this most important of all important dooties, and constantly
swallering down their cheap and not nice meals in haste and discomfort, have
become such a cantankerous, and quarrelsum, and abusive lot of Hem Peas as praps
the world never saw before, and never hopes to see again. - -
The LoRD MARE delited them all by telling 'em that in addition to the butiful
Stattys in the Egypshun Hall, the Copperashun had lately opened a little art
Gallery to which about 40,000 peeple had been, and that he hoped they shood have
a fine gallery some day when they had jest got a little more money, at which they
all cheered away like fun. What a wonderful man the Chairman must be, and
what a pity he isn't in the House of Commons. I shood think he'd estonish a good
many on 'em. Not content with having proposed no less than seven toastes, he
acshally wound up the hole perceedings with rather a longish lecture on painting,
which he finished by boasting that they now had no less than four skools where
F. coud learn to paint from living moddels. I looked ard at the Bishops, but as
idn't see a blush on their wenerable features, I spose it’s all right, otherwise—
but I refranes.
I may add that it was a remarkable good dinner, and so indeed it may well be,
considering as the pore Painters only gits one a year. ROBERT,
“ UNDER CONSIDERATION.”
RUMoUR having been more or less busy on the subject of the forthcoming
official “honours,” the following current on dits may be read with interest:-
It is reported that in high quarters it has been determined that a large addition
shall be made to the House of Lords, and that the creation of at least three hun-
dred new Peerages, may be regarded as the minimum of honour contemplated in
this direction. ... Some difficulty has, however, been experienced in the selection
of suitable recipients, and though it was originally proposed to confer titles on the
Chairmen of the leading Railway and Insurance Companies, all the members of the
London School Board en bloc, and a large number of Common Councilmen, some
modification of this plan may possibly be expected.
Peerages are also talked of in connection with the names of Mr. HYNDMAN,
Messrs...MASKELYNE AND Cooke, and Mr. LABOUCHERE, to the last of whom a Duke-
dom will be offered, to which, in graceful recognition of his investigation into the
subject, it is said that a substantial perpetual hereditary pension will be attached.
aronetcies will be freely distributed to provincial Mayors and Aldermen, it
having been decided that a contribution of not less than £5 to the local Celebration
Fund (following a precedent set by JAMES THE FIRST) will entitle the donor to
receive the honour.
The Order of the Garter will be materially enlarged, several entirely new
Stalls being created expressly for the occasion, and of these, the names of Lord
ALFRED PAGET and several other noble patrons of the Drama are mentioned
as those of the probable occupiers:
... The Order of the Bath will also be largely recruited from the official classes,
it having already been decided, as a preliminary step, to raise to the dignity of
Military Knights Commanders of the Second Class the Beadles of the Iº.
and Lowther Arcades ...;
In conclusion, it may be confidently stated that the salaries of the Archbishop
of CANTERBURY, the Lord *. of LonDoN, Her Majesty's Cabinet Ministers and
Judges, and the Heads of all Departments, will be doubled, while the Lord CHAN-
CELLOR, and the SPEAKER of the House of Commons will receive each a brand-new
wig and set of robes, and the Chief Commissioner of Police a new cocked hat.

THE CRICKETER'S CAROL.
(By an Enthusiast.)
HooBAY! Cricket ip once more fires the blood,
And the footballer flounders no more in the mud.
The turf is no longer all hummocks and holes,
And the wickets again take the place of the goals.
Once more come the rollers, once more moves the chalk,
Once more from the tent do the flannel-clad walk.
The trees are half leafless, the meadows are damp,
And one pines, at the stumps, for goloshes and gamp.
The umpire looks frigid, the longstop seems frozen,
Our very best bat can't score more than a dozen;
As yet though 'tis only the middle of May,
And this is our climate's peculiar way:
No matter! At least we're again in the field.
Which the zealots of “passing” and “dribbling” must
yield.
The turf will get dry in a month, or say two,
And the sky, not our noses, be bonnily blue.
We can feel the old glorious heart-thrilling charm,
The Pavilion of striding from, bat under arm.
And hiding the tremor our bosom which moves,
By fumbling away at our pads or our gloves.
The Oraclesfire off their critical bolts,
And the Marylebone Club plays the Middlesex Colts.
Great slogs! what is life worth unless one can see,
Once or twice in a week say, great W. G.
Knock up a square hundred, or READ at the stumps,
Give the Yorkshiremen ſº. and Lancashire jumps?
The Newspapers now will no ionger be bores,
There is something to read fivery morning—the scores.
For DILLON I don't care a duck's egg, not I,
Qr whether Brum Joe goes to Putney or Skye.
The G. O. M.'s gabble seems long-winded rot,
And if I understand Mr. SMITH, I'll be shot.
But oh! that account of the M. C. C. Match
Of SHREwsBURY's century, LoRMANN's great catch,
The skyer that THoRNToN sent out of the ground,
And the way little ABEL “despatched 'em all round "l
#. it warms up one's heart in a way
That the East wind can't neutralise—even in May.
Oh! come along Summer, my soul's in a hurry
To see whether Notts will be walloped by Surrey,
If Kent will pull up, or the Tykes take first place,
Or if Gloucester successes will gladden “old GRACE,”
Whether W. G. will this season be seen
Leviathan still, unsurpassed, ever green;
Whether Stoddart again will play up to his form,
And LoRMANN for Surrey's worst foes make it warm;
Which of the two READs will see best of the fun,
Whether SHAw will go off, or young PoughER come on.
All this, and much more, I am anxious to know.
We’ve at last, as I hope, said good-bye to the snow.
And though it is chilly and damp-in fact, May–
The fresh Cricket-Season has started. Hooray!!!
PROBABLE INWASION OF LONDON."
MR. PUNCH learns from the City Press that, at the Meeting
of the Court of Common Council, a letter was read from the
London Chamber of Commerce on the subject of the Defence
of London in case of Invasion, followed by a letter from the
Secretary of Lloyd's, offering, on behalf of the Committee, to
#º. the Corporation a Gun, recently reeovered from
.M. ship Lutine, wrecked off the Coast of Holland in the
year 1799. Thereupon a question was asked whether the
said ancient Gun was to be considered as a first instalment
towards the defence aforesaid; and elicited in reply “the
loud laugh, that speaks the vacant mind.”
Mr. Punch was not himself personally aware that there
was any immediate danger of an invasion of London, :*
indeed, by German Clerks, Bakers, and Waiters; but h
he the knowledge, the fact that Her Most Gracious
MAJESTY had in ...}} City a force of no less than three
hundred well-ma Lieutenants, all entitled to carry
swords, if not, indeed, to draw them, would have allayed
|his fears, until, indeed, he remembered that they were, by
regulation, exempt from service abroad, except in case ºf
an Invasion. But, doubtless, their civic patriotism would
prevent them from taking advantage of any such thoughtful
º so Mr. Punch's slumbers will not be disturbed
y any thought of a foreign foe invading his sanctuary at
85, Fleet Street, E.C.

But finds a shrieking sweep and butcher-boy
More than a match for Charis.

Far readier echoes in Parisian min

Fires the hysteric throng.

Is patriotism the Boeotian thing

The hero virtue, shorn of manly sense,
Is slain by those who, fierce in its defence,
Degrade it and defame it.
O brainless Hate! A more enduring curse
Than despot's dungeon, or than Mammon's purse,
In your blind fury clings
To all earth's peoples, with a closer hold
Than the corrupting leprosy of gold,
Or plague of tyrant kings.
TIIough the Captain of the Victoria urged in his
defence the silence, of the fog-horn, the Court very

against him of defective seamanship is based.

SHAKSPEARE.
DURING the last few weeks, under the title of “Strange True
Stories of To-day,” an evening paper has been publishing a tale of a
very dreadful character. Whether the appearance of this painful
narrative (into which are introduced real names of living persons and
apparently faithful records of actual events) will be of substantial
service to the cause of morality is a question that is being mooted in
more quarters than one. owever, its production suggests yet
another mode of treatment, which, if followed, would be of advantage
to somebody. To further explain our meaning we append a specimen
of the kind of story that might be compiled under the auspices of
those we may appropriately term the lovers of useful publicity.
THE CAB ACCIDENT IN THE OLD KENT ROAD.
CHAPTER XIII.-Among the London Lawyers.
THUS far we have traced the career of the unfortunate BILL
BRowN.—unfortunate chiefly in, being the driver of a hackney
carriage—in the streets of London. Now we see the battle trans-
ferred to another arena, in which the combatants no longer engage
in hand-to-hand encounters, in strange oaths, in startling assevera-
tions, but where the combat is waged by legal champions in Courts
of Justice. BILL BRowN was charged before the LoRD MAYOR.
BILL BRowN did not know what to do, or where to turn. Therefore | In th
he was afraid of the LoRD MAYok. Some good genius sent him to
the – Restaurant. Here he obtained a most excellent dinner for
three-and-sixpence, consisting of two soups, two fishes, two entrées,
two joints, sweets, vegetables, and cheese. The wine, too, was
admirable, and, althoug not able to purchase any himself, he was
informed by connoisseurs that — brand of dry champagne, at 48s.

Restaurant, BILL, now thoroughly refreshed by the excellent meal
of which he had aken, walked along the Strand, looking listlessly
into the shop-windows. ... He noticed the watches in –'s, those
marvellous time-keepers that are the wonders of the world. Then he
turned his eyes in the direction of those excellent riding-habits that
only the skilful, cutters of Messrs. — & Co. can turn out; and
lastly, Cabman-like, he had a long stare at the artistic stationery
of —, which can be obtained at a discount of ten per cent. if paid
for on delivery.
CHAPTER XIV.- Adding Insult to Injury.
BILL BRowN was asked to plead in his own defence! What could
he do?. He had no defence. Still, he was an Englishman, and, as
an ...; was proud of the entertainment at the – Theatre,
where he heard — and—with an exquisite delight that baffles
description. So he kept an eloquent silence, which might have meant
anything. In that silence was contained secret allusions to the bene-
fits to be obtained from — hair-oil, and — cure for toothache.
He did not speak, because his heart was too full, and he was thinking
of the days when on the street-hoardings he had seen the “Moon-
light Plate-Powder” and the “Hottentot Cigarettes.” So he kept
his counsel, and was silent. He felt that if he called a spade a

MR. PUNCH'S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.
NAUTICAL Recitations are always deservedly popular, and Mr. Punch's
Poet has accordingly constructed one upon the lines of a very stirring and
celebrated model which is possibly not unknown to his pupils. Here is the
very distant imitation:—
THE WRECK OF THE STEAMSHIP “PUFFIN.”
Tell }} a story, Children? Well, gather around my knee,

And the snowy sails are reflected clear in a mirror of flawless calm.

And a wind is º water, and driving the ducks ashore, . . -
Ah! the Pond can look black and cruel then, with its waves running inches high,

British public, either for a “morning” or “a run,” but is certainly appro-
priate to the latest Play of the surviving joint:author of New Men and Old
Acres. The Venetian scenery was all that could be desired, but the dresses
were eccentric. Baron Falkenberg, head of the Austrian Police, for instance,
appeared in his own office (where a disguise seemed superfluous) in the
British undress uniform of a Royal Engineer, tempered with breeches appa-
rently borrowed from a Major in the Line. The Officers of the Third Regiment
of Croats, too, evidently had a penchant for the dress-belts of a Yeomanry corps.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 9.-House of Commons, ad-
journed, by common consent of #: to Wild West, where
}. BILL took the Chair at Half-past Four. The old place,
consequently, almost empty. Amongst absentees, ARTHR, BALFOUR.
Affection of Irish Members for Chief Secretary unbounded and un-
controllable. Always wanting, to know where he is. Insist on his
being on Treasury #º so that loving eyes may rest upon him;
TIM HEALY gave expression to this feeling with impatient voice and
manner. Threatened to move Adjournment next time Chief Secre-
tary absent at question-hour. Presently BALFOUR came in, blushing
like young girl at this somewhat embarrassing manifestation of per-
sonaſ affection. In his absence KING-HARMAN buffeted on all sides.
Begins to think that, on the whole, he was happier below the Gang-
way, where he was able occasionally to invite TANNEB to “come
outside.” Now has to observe an air of official civility even when
the amorous TIM, fretful at the absence of Chief Secretary, protests
against being left to the mercy of “this Orangeman.” -
Later, W. H. SMITH had a turn... Proposes on Thursday to give
precedence to Wote for £17,000 to be spent in
preparing Westminster Abbey for Jubilee Ser-
vice. That stern economist, GRANDOLPH, from
his watch-tower behind the Treasury Bench,
moved to indignation. What! Give up pre-
cious time to debate for Abbey services, when
Motion for referring Army and Navy Estimates
to Parliamentary Committee stands
aside? SMITH, nervously holding
on to the table, meekly explains
that he was fully aware of im-
portance of matter referred to by
noble friend. But he also attached
importance to the principle of not
spending mone fore it was
sanctioned by House. Conserva-
tives cheered these moral senti-
ments; soothing influence of moral
rectitude sp itself over Trea-
sury Bench. Then came Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate, with horribly
2-3 inconvenient question. Nothin
ſº to say against principle enuncia
by #: of House, but who was
paying the cost of work already
going for at Westminster
Abbey?, Awkward question this,

SMITH, waking himself up, resisted. Sage of Queen Anne's Gate,
roposing to offer few observations, yelled at for space of two minutes.

has gone before, had come down determined to stand by SMITH, now
rose slowly, deliberately, and with evidentintention of settling whole
matter. Hardly had he drawn himself to full height, and fixed eye-
glass, than there went up to high heaven a yell that woke sleepers
in distant ante-room, and brought them in, pale and anxious.
A grand sight to see Our Chief stand, with folded arms, looking
down on tumultuous throng: “Like Beachy, Head, when south-
west gale is tumbling up the Channel,” said ARTHUR BALFour,
looking sideways with admiration at the massive figure.
“Mr. CHAPLIN 1 Mr. CHAPLIN!” Court.NEY cried, through the
uproar.
But Committee would not have CHAPLIN. For fully five minutes
tumult raged. Court.NEY began to look dangerous. Somebody
would be suspended. Besides, five minutes' bellowing at Three
o'Clock in the morning a little exhausting. Storm fell. Turbulent
tide raced past, with sullen undertone of anger, and there stood

length, protesting against waste of time. W. H. SMITH plaintively
urged House to consent unanimously. Fixing his eye on Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate, appealed to feelings of a parent for sympathy
with desire of QUEEN to have children around her on interesting
occasion. “That’s all very well,” said Sage, not entirely unmoved.
“What we object to is, not leave to Duke to come home, but the

WISE MEN
IN THE EAST.
oNDoN Managers of Exhi-
bitions and Directors of
“Shows” in general are so
anxious ºf: to save the
Press unnecessary trouble,
that they take the greatest
ains to give the fullest in-
tions in which they are in-
terested. This has evidently
been the case with the Powers
that Be (represented appa-
rently º E. R. Robson)
of the People's Palace for
East London, who have oblig-
ingly placed at our disposal
a lithographed description of
the Institution, and a pam-
phlet on the same subject;
profusely illustrated, and
jºr. bound in paper
of a verdant tint. These
documents have been sent
without an invitation to visit
the Palaceitself, so we cannot
do better than quote from
them, although secondary
- - - evidence, as a rule. is inad-
Wealth and Poverty; or, Two points of the missible when anything better
the Compass—West by East. can be got. Perhaps the
Powers that Be consider that nothing better can be got—and they
may be right.
It appears that the Queen's Hall, opened on Saturday last by HER
MAJESTY, is merely a fragment;” but in revenge, “is the central
feature, and the only one likely to be ornate or interesting to archi-
tects.” From this we take it, that on the face of it, the Queen's Hall
must as “the central feature,” be the nose, and are consequently
glad to learn that it is likely to be ornate and interesting to
architects.
We further learn that this nose is “eventually to be approached
through a Social Room on the South End.” What “a Social
Room on its South End” may be, we cannot conjecture, but it is
evidently something decidedly useful if not ornamental, as it is
#. y to introduce the Nose of the Palace to the Eyes of the
ublic.
The Nose is to have on its other sides (so we learn) many other
buildings, so that when the whole is completed, “the outside will be
entirely concealed.” “Hence,” say the Powers that Be, in the accents
of conviction, “the plain exterior.” -
“Three entrances,” we further learn from the documents to which
we have referred, “are enclosed by a temporary porch.” This
arrangement, one, would have fancied, would have prevented the
People (either with or without cards of invitation) from j
admission. But that everything may be "quite safe, we understan
that “there are other doors for º provided at the East and
West sides and North end of the Hall, so that it could be emptied
in a very short time.” A suggestion that would have greater value
were it not highly probable that, owing to the enclosed entrances, as
we have pointed out, the Hall is seldom likely to have anyone in it.
we are further told that "the orchestra recess is elliptical in form
and half domed, so as to throw out the sound.” What this sound
threatened with ejection is, we can only guess, and therefore ma
conjecture it to be the street noises that have found, or may find,
an entrance through the open windows. We hazard this sugges:
tion with some confidence, as we learn that “the magnificent organ,”
ormation about the Institu-ld
although built, has not been erected “whilst the dust created by the
workmen continues.”
Qne of the º features of the building (because testifying
to the philanthropy of its founders) is the gallery in which “about
240 people are provided for.” But even in this portion & perhaps
“fragment” would be the better word) of the structure the wish for
universal exclusion which distinguishes the undertaking is again
apparent, as we are told that the front of this gallery will be politely
“bowed out for acoustic reasons.”
We learn, too, with much satisfaction, that “the statues of twenty-
two Queens, supported on carved pedestals,” are “placed in standing
º: as we feel that it would have been a decided mistake
although the effect would have had the charm of novelty) to have
erected these Royal effigies balancing themselves on their heads. It is
added, that “the Queens have been selected from those who have
been useful to their country, or in sympathy with their people,”, the
alternative proving that some of these chosen Dames, although “not
useful,” have echoed the prevailing fashion of the period, and thus
merited the distinction bestowed upon them. Itisinteresting to learn
that “the whole of the Statues are worthy of attention as works of
Art.” From a “short history of the twenty-two Queens,” we gather,
amongst other facts of great value, that “OsBURGA of England
(about A.D. 860),” gave her son ALFRED “a book at a time when
printing had not yet been introduced, and books were therefore
scarce;” that MARGARET of Scotland “purified the rough nobles
among whom she lived; ” that MARGARET of Denmark “tempered
her ambition with the tact that made her beloved;” that ANNE of
Brittany, by “prudence and judgment, saved her country from
isastrous wars;” and lastly, that ANNE of England “was almost
the first Sovereign of England who had no desire for despotic power,
being more remarkable for her domestic virtues than for her skill in
governing.”
It is interesting to know that “the space underneath the floor is
utilised for the storage of the chairs, and other purposes incident to
the daily use of the hall,” as the last half of the sentence satisfac-
torily accounts for the night receptacle of the charwoman's broom
and the washing-tub of the sleeping housemaid.
It is also as pleasant to find that “the whole effect is that of a
bright. ..". * diffused over the interior, which is maintained
throughout by the artistic decorations, gilding, and colour,” as it is
comforting to read that “the Hall is heated by means of hot water,
the pipes passing in panels underneath the floor, the warmth.being
admitted through iron gratings.” It is, however, extremely difficult
to understand how the Powers that Be could ever have thought of
such clever things!
But perhaps the greatest puzzle of the whole description is the con-
cluding paragraph, which, narrating how the “glazing to roof” is on
an improved system, º finishes as follows:-"No putty being

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A MAY MEETING.
Mr. Punch. Well, Mr. NIBBs, %. were not at the opening of the
Buffalo Billeries and the Show of Indians?
Mr. Nibbs, No, Sir; I was then crossing the Billow-ries between
Dover and Calais. The only “Injuns.”
that interested me at the moment were
those in the “Injun-room” of the Victoria
—a marvellously comfortable vessel—pro-
pelling her at sufficient speed for us to
accomplish the crossing in one hour and
ten minutes.
Mr. Punch. A good passage?
Mr. Wibbs. An excellent passage, goin
and returning; for, had it not been,
should have been the ,Chief of the Pale
Faces on board the Jubilee vessel Victoria.
Mr. Punch. And what did you see in
Paris? -
. Mr. Wibbs. Chiefly the American Pre-
sident M'NEILE WHISTLER, wearing such
an ultra-Parisian hat as, if he brings it
back with safety, and wears it about town,
will make him the observed of all the
most observant.
Mr. Punch. I shall not be surprised if
this arrangement in black—this decorative
tile which you describe—does not revive
the now almost forgotten slang question,
the sport of a bye-gone day, “Who’s your
hatter?” It is not a very remarkable
Salon this year.
Mr. Nibbs. No; but I was much struck
by the general excellence of the portraits and of the landscapes. You
have seen it, Sir? -
Mr. Punch. I see everything. It was refreshing to meet with
only one Tentation de Saint Antoine, and only one Salomé, with the
Baptist's head in a dish. This Salomé appears to be a very self-
possessed young lady of about fourteen or fifteen years old.
Mr. Nibbs. But, Sir! the surgical subjects and the nudities!. I
would have given a trifle to have had Mr. HoRSLEY as my companion
in one of the rooms.
Mr. Punch. His wrath would have been re-newed.
Mr. Wibbs. Indeed it would, and, in many cases, justly. Of course
I visited the principal theatres.
Mr. Punch. I hº §." saw Françillon.
Mr. Nibbs. I did, Sir. ... I should very much like to hear your
opinion of it as a piece and as a performance.
Mr. Punch...M. ALEXANDRE. DUMAs FILs, has written stronger
plays. Françillon is a comédie de mours. The characters repre-
sented are those moving in the “High-Life” of Paris. An English-
man not “in it” must take M. ALEXANDRE DUMAs' word for the
fact that an ordinary phase of Parisian society is truly represented in
this comedy.
Mr. Nibbs. Just so, Sir. ..In , London we have absolutely no
equivalent for the masked balls at the Opera, nor for the suppers in
the cabinets particuliers of the Maison d'Or, which are matters of
every night, experience in Paris. The story of Françillon is not
possible in London, save, under such exceptional circumstances as
could only appear probable to a very limited section of an exception-
ally fast community.
..Mr. Punch. So much for the local colouring of the plot which is
slight as a wire and as strong. The piece is worked out to the end
through the development of character by dialogue, for which process
our English audiences have no patience.
Mr. Nibbs. ‘‘’Tis true, ’tis #. and pity'tis 'tis true.”
Mr. Punch. Yes. An English audience is for ever crying out,
“Get on I get on 1 Cut the talk and come to the action.” Facta non
verba is the practical motto of an English Polonius-like audience.
Mr. Nibbs. It is Hamlet’s “Come to Hecuba,” and DUCRow's
“Cut the cackle, and bring in the 'osses,” put into practice by those
who have paid for the right to do so.
Mr. Punch. Yet we must remember that the School for Scandal
still delights, and will ever continue to do so. But, on the other
hand, BULwFR LYTToN's Money is now a very dull affair, and that
was accepted as a comédie de moeurs in its day. We have yet to see
the experiment of a Françillon tried on our English stage, which
shall give such a picture of London society as shall be generally
recognisable.
Mr. Nibbs. As to the acting, I suppose, Sir, you were delighted
with the ladies—BARTET and PIERSON,
Mr. Punch. Mlle. BARTET is admirable as Francillon, the best
acting I've seen since DESCLfe as the original F.". Madame
PIERson was excellent too, but you probably saw another actress in
*} rt, as PIERSON has not been playing lately.
r. Nibbs. Mlle. REICHEMBERG as the ingénue—
Mr. Punch. Wery nice, but, like all French ingénues, so much too
palpably ingenuous as to suggest to an Englishman that he is in the
presence of a very sly young person, who is only awaiting her oppor-
tunity to show how much she really knows of everything of which
the French Podsmaps suppose her to be ignorant.
Mr. Nibbs. I thought all the men good, especially TRUFFIER, as
the Parisian Masher, and THIRoN, as the rather prosy Marquis.
Mr. Punch. Yes, all act admirably, in spite, and not in conse-
quence, of the senseless stage-management which seems to be tradi-
tional at the Français.
Mr. Nibbs. I am glad you do not approve of the mise-en-scène.
Mr. Punch. It is simply ridiculous. I take one example, which
will appeal to everybody. The time is Winter: there is a fireplace,
to which most of the characters go, at some time or other. Now this
fireplace is on the stage right, about what we should call in England
“the second entrance,” and the chair and sofa, on the side near the
audience, are arranged with their backs at right angles to the fire-
place, so that the characters occupying these seats are placed in the
absurdly unnatural and idiotic position of sitting sideways, with
their backs to the fire, for the sake of having their faces to the
audience! And then the chairs, sofas, and tables, essential to the
“stage-business,” are all in a line, so that, when an important
dialogue has to take place, five out of seven are seated in a row, like
Christy Minstrels, with the aristocratic Marquis in the centre, to
announce the title of the next song and chorus.
Mr. Nibbs. And yet our English actors are told they have so much
to learn from the Théâtre Français !
Mr. Punch. There is always something for the wise to learn, and,
as the French, actors can frequently give us a lesson in some
specialities, so they constantly and very forcibly show us what we
ought to avoid. By the way, I hope you saw—
r. Nibbs. The Palais Royal and the Cluny, Sir. The latter
º absurd. Do you remember when Clotil -
Mr. Punch...Yes, perfectly, Very droll, but not eminently
successful, I believe. Au plaisir! Ereunt.
WERY HUMBLE PETITIONERS.
How curious that Mr. GLADSTONE should have signed his name
five times over in a Petition for the total suppression of all news-
papers and public meetings in Ireland! - ---
es, and *. 's Lord SALISBURY's autographin a Petition demand-
ing the immediate disestablishment of the Church in England,
Scotland and Wales. ---
Perhaps this person who signs himself as “CECIL,” residing at “Hat-
field,” occupation “none,” may not be the Prime Minister, after all.
Can Sir WILLIAM HARcourt be contemplating some gigantic
forgery;-a facsimile letter from Lord HARTINGTON to TIM HEALY,
jº expressing enthusiastic approval of the dynamite policy,
as a set-off to the Parnell Letter? The fact. that his signature
occurs exactly twenty times over, in this “Petition from Thames
Bargees in favour of establishing floating Grog-shops on the River,”
and each time in a different handwriting, certainly lends some colour
to the idea.
It is of course highly interesting to know that twelve of the
children of Mrs. BRowN of Larkhall Rise, are able to write, but it is
doubtful if their opinions on the bimetallic controversy are entitled
to much weight, or are worthy of having any currency given to them.
This surely must be a Bogus Petition, purporting to come from
“Five hundred ridiculously under-rented Tenants on the Bedford
Estate,” praying for a lot of new gates to be put up all over Blooms-
bury, “in order to facilitate traffic and further add to the comfort
and convenience of the inhabitants of this great Metropolis.” .
Ought not the Petition from the “Psychical Research Society,”
asking for pecuniary aid from Government in unearthing ghosts and
investigating haunted houses, to be called a “Bogey” Petition?
These Advertisements in the Newspapers—“Wanted, Canvassers
for Signatures to Parliamentary Petitions, willing to accept low
remuneration. Experts in Handwriting preferred. Good character
not essential. Send specimens of twenty different signatures, &c.”
—surely would come under the title of breaches of Privilege.
The style of caligraphy in this address from all the young, gentle-
men who are being educated at Mr. Rodwell's Academy, asking for
an extra summer Jubilee Holiday, seems rather too advanced to be
the genuine work of school-boys. Can Mr. Rodwell himself have
had anything to do with it?
Halloa! How does the name of “F. LoNDIN., Fulham Palace, S.W.”
get into the Petition praying that Parliament will put a veto on
“this ridiculous and unnecessary scheme for a Church House?”.
From the execrable scrawl which disfigures the Shoreditch Petition
for throwing the expenses of the maintenance of Hyde Park ex-
clusively on ratepayers of the East of London, it seems probable that
the Collector contracted to obtain signatures at a rate nearer a
shilling than ten shillings per hundred. Perhaps a reduction (of
genuineness) was allowed on taking a quantity.

WHAT Do You MEAN,
A GooD EVENINg.—Though Mr. GEORGE AUGUSTU's SALA has given distant parts of the
world the advantage of his powers as a Lecturer, we Londoners have scarcely had a taste of
his quality in this direction till the other evening, at St. James's Hall, when he told us what
he heard and saw in New Zealand and, Australia, for the benefit of the Royal Hospital for
Women and Children. And a very considerable benefit it proved, not only to the excellent
Institution alluded to, but to the crowded house who were fortunate enough to listen to the
Lecturer. But after all we are inclined to think that “lecture” is too formal a title to asso-
ciate with the easy, colloquial, 5.ºf chat, within which Mr. SALA manages to weave
a mass of solid information, pleasantly varied with graphic illustration and quaint humour.
Never for an instant dull, he tho hly held his audience from the beginning of his narrative
to the end. It is to be hoped Mr. SALA will again appear upon the platform before long and
give us more of his varied experiences at home as well as abroad.
THE QUEEN AT THE WILD WEST.
THE SoNG of PUNCHIwathA.
Would you hear how Colonel Cody
Gave his wondrous exhibition
Of his Indians on the war-path,
In the sight of Queen VICTORIA:
Listen to this simple story
From the mouth of Punch IWATHA.
When she reached the Exhibition,
Lo! a box near the arena
Was prepared for her reception:
WHITLEY too and Colonel RUSSELL
And the wily TownsenD PERCY
As an escort to the lady,
To the Empress of the North Land.
Then the Indians and the Cowboys,
And the wonderful Wanqueros,
Raced and charged and whirled before her,
Stopped the coach, and wheeled and circled,
Like some birds of brilliant plumage
Round a carcase on the mountains.
Balls of glass were thrown and shattered
By the clever Colonel Cody,
Like WABE-No the magician;
Ladies, too, there wielded rifles
Even as the strong man Kwa-SIND.
To the QUEEN came OGILA-SA,
Sioux Chief, and bowed before her;
He across the Big-Sea-Water
Came to see the Queen and Empress,
And will tell the wondrous story
Oft times in the Wild West wigwams,
In the days of the Hereafter.
To the QUEEN too, the papooses,
Dusky little Indian babies,
Were presented, and she touched them
Gently with a royal finger;
That the squaws, the happy mothers,
Might go back upon Kee-way-din,
On the Home-Wind o'er the water,
To the land of the Ojibways,
To the land of the Dacotahs,
To the Mountains of the Prairie,
Singing gaily all the praises
Of the gentle Queen and Empress,
And the wonders of the North Land.
ThE WERY PLACE.- #". the QUEEN
o for a private view to B. B.'s in Wild
est Kensington, when HER MAJESTY could
have commanded the buck-jumping riders
to have given their show at Buckingham
Palace? Then the QUEEN, in i.".
largesse on the tame Wild Indians an
Cowboys, could Shakspearingly have said,
“So much for buck-jumping-'em.”
“THE BUSINESS OF THE NATION.”
What is ‘The business of the Nation?”
Endless row, roundaboutation,
Mutual spite and objurgation,
Egotistic self-inflation,
Partisan disintegration,
Venomous vilification,
Pettifogging aggravation,
General exasperation,
Universal degradation,-- -
That’s “The business of the Nation,”
As 'tis done in Parliament.
Is’t not time the lot were sent—
Ere BULL's brain is dazed to dizziness,
Each and all, about their business?
THE Parisians expect that WAGNER's
Lohengrin, will be revived at some more
F. time. Its postponement might
ave been fairly anticipated, as no one could
reasonably have expected to hear in the
present time “the Music of the Future.”

REASONS FOR AND AGAINST HOME RULE.
I.—As CoILECTED FROM “SEPARATIST’” Sources.
Hoxie Rule is the only sensible and safe solution of the Irish
Question, for such reasons as these:–
Because the Act of Union was a “scoundrelly” Act, and ought to
be repealed. - -
Because Home Rule does not involve a Repeal of the Union.
Because it does. - - -
E . Ireland will never be satisfied to remain united with
Ingland. -
Because Home Rule will make Ireland perfectly content to remain
united with England. -
Because Home Rule will make the power of the Parnellites bene-
ficent, by burdening, it with responsibility. ... -
Because Home Rule will deprive the Parnellites of º entirely.
Because religious questions are at the bottom of the whole Irish
difficulty, and Home Rule will settle them. -
Because religious questions have nothing whatever to do with the
Irish difficulty. - -
Because Home Rule will make Ireland practically independent,
and alter the whole state of affairs. -
Because Home Rule will leave Ireland really subordinate, and
make very little alteration, after all.
II.-As GATHERED FROM THE SPEECHEs of UNIONIST ORATORs.
Home Rule is not to be thought of, for the following amongst other
reasons :-
Because Irishmen, like the poor, “in a lump are bad.”
Because their desire for Home Rule is only the disingenuous dis-
guise of a desire for separation, dictated by “a deep and undying
|hatred” of England, and a vindictive longing to cause her degrada-
tion and downfall.
. Because, this, deep and undying hatred is the spontaneous and
incurable impulse of the evil hearts of the vast majority of Irishmen.
Because it is also a factitious feeling forced upon them by the cruel
terrorism of a small minority.
Because the majority of Irishmen are desperately disloyal, and
therefore will be satisfied with nothing short of separation.
Because also the majority of Irishmen are, really content with
English rule, and do not desire separation at all.
Because the National League is enthusiastically * by the
. ºrity. which shows what an unmitigated bad lot they
must De.
Because the National League is also a merciless tyranny, whose
. the Irish majority would be only too happy to throw off, if it
could.
Because the Irish are Celts.
Because the Irish are not Celts.
. Because the presence of the Irish Representatives at St. Stephen's
i. *::::: to the degradation of Parliament and the disintegration of
e Iºmpire.
. Because in order to avoid the degradation of Parliament and the
disintegration of the Empire, it is absolutely essential to keep the
Irish Representatives at St. Stephen's.
Because it is our business and our duty to maintain and treat
Ireland as an equal and integral portion of the British Empire.
Because it is our business and our duty to prove to Ireland that we
can and will rule her.
Note to Both Sets.-Many of these reasons are contradictory and
eyen mutually exclusive, but, taken altogether, as they must and
shall be, they exclude, of course, the very possibility of any
“reasons” on the other side /–Q.E.D.

“DOLLIES 'ILL.
(Fancy Picture by D. Crambo.)
MR. AND MRs. GLADston E. KINDLY NURSING THE Dollies oF Dollis
HILL SEVERAL Dollies on THE MEND,
TABLE TALK;
Or, Catching them at their Meals.
THE Daily News in a recent issue having, under the sensational
heading,
“MB. GLADSTONE AT LUNCHEoN,”
furnished its readers with some remarks volunteered by the veteran
Statesman at a purely private entertainment prepared for him, the
other day, by Dr. PARKER, an attempt has been made on the same
lines to catch the passing remarks hazarded by other distinguished
Statesmen over their occasional meals. The following is the
result:—
LoRD SALISBURY AT TEA.
Yesterday Lord SALISBURY looked in at Grosvenor Square, where
a small but select circle were assembled for five o'clock tea. The
noble Marquis seemed in excellent spirits, and joined freely in the
general conversation, giving his opinions on the leading, pictures of
the Academy, the physical characteristics of the Colonial Delegates
BUFFALO BILL, .# other topics of the hour with much verve an
readiness. Eventually, § into the Crimes Bill, he held forth
on its details with considerable fervour for about an hour and three
quarters, during the course of which he effectually cleared the room
of all the guests, being left, ultimately, to finish his peroration on
the rug to his hostess alone. Owing to his Lordship's mouth being
repeatedly full, of muffin, it was not always easy to catch the exact
drift of what he was saying, but he was unders to express a
general determination on the part of the Government to persist in
their present course. AfterF. of an extra cup of tea and one
more round of hot, buttered toast, the noble Marquis, who seemed
highly gratified with the success of his yisit, cordially thanking his
hostess for her kind and attentive reception, gracefully withdrew.
Mr. W. H. SMITH AT SUPPER.
Mr. W. H. SMITH after quitting the House of Commons last night
strolled down to the Carlton and ordered jºi The room at that
advanced hour being comparatively deserted, the Hon. Gentleman,
who had come from the debate in avery communicative vein, for lack
of better audience addressed several remarks to the waiter who was
attending on him, on the leading questions of the hour, eventually
finishing up with a powerful oration on the Clöture. Subsequently
ordering some hot whiskey-and-water he continued the subject at a
still more impassioned level, and though º getting a little
indistinct would no doubt have continued his declamation, had not
the waiter, turning out the gas as a hint, pointed suggestively to the
coming daylight, that, was already invading the apartment. This
appeared to recall the Hon. Gentleman to himself, who laughingly ob:
serving that he seemed to have been having an “all night sitting,”
carefully descended the stairs, and hailing a Hansom, much to the
relief of the * disappeared in the dawni that was now
breaking on Pall Mall.
The Series, oftcourse, might be indefinitely continued, and by way
of contrast to the foregoing:-
MR. BRIGHT AT BREAKFAST
would furnish good material. The veteran Radical could to some
purpose contrast the views he once held and the application of which
supplied the “cheap” table at which he is seated, with those he has
more recently assumed. Then again,
LoRD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL AFTER DINNER.
seems to promise some lively experiences, being suggestive, as it is,
of a general abandon of utterance more than equal to anything ven-
tured upon by the Grand Old Home Rulist in his ºfeffort
above referred to. To descend even to more domestic circumstances,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN IN BEDIoweR HIs GRUEL.
would not make a bad line. There is something strikingly suitable
about the situation. The rather lugubrious explanation of his
present position that could be furnished under such conditions by the
eminent Radical to the attendant bringing him the comforting basin
should be good and apprºpriate reading being, as it is, eminently
suggestive of political influenza. Indeed, the idea of catching the
Atteranges ºf big men at their meals is an undeniably happy
thought, and we look hopefully to its further development.
ROBERT AT THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION.
...AFTER my jovial recklec.shuns of last year's Collinderies, it wasn't
likely as I should lose much time afore I wisited the Amerryean
Exhibishun, jest to see what our rayther bragging Cozens had gotfor
to show us. But I’m sorry to say that I thinks as they’ve bin in
Fayther toº great an urry to open, for the hole place, instead of being
finnished, looks as if it had bin begun jest about the week afore last.
Wot it will be wen its finished we shall see all in good time, but wot
it is now, or rayther wot it was last Toosday week, is wot I must
confine myself to.
Entering from the Earl's Court Stashun, the fust thing I seed was
a Cattle Show, and they suttenly was the poorest-looking lot of
animals as ever had the º: to go in for a prize. They was
all a lying down, looking cold and hungry, and sum on 'em was that
dirty and ragged-looking, and had sitch ruff heads, that Ispose as
they, must have had a werry bad journey from Aºy, and
hadn't had time to be washed and tidied up a bit, poor things!
The Bilding is diwided into 4 haveanews and 10 streets, and as
each of the former is jest about 1000 feet long, as a werry civil native
told me, and each of the streets more nor 100, “to walk the lot,” as
he sed..."is jest exacly a mile! and that, Stranger, licks all creation
in Exhibishuns.”
#.g much obliged by his infirmation, but not liking to be
called a Stranger, I natrally arsked him to take a drink, to which he
most kindly consented. With my greatxperience of Colonial drinks
last year, I thort as I was about up to heverythink in that line, but
I º estonished to hear him ask a werry nice looking young
lady all drest in red, and with a Amerrycan flag for a apron, for a
“Xhibition Buzzom Caresserl’ But she gave it him without a
blush, so I pluct up my currage and asked for one two, and werry
good it was, but I dowt. if I shall tell Mrs. Robert of the suckum-
stance, it mite do more harm than good.
I don't think werry much of the Xibition part of the Show, some
of it is werry much like our own Lowther Arcade but bigger. The
ºf: Shop of all is full of heartyfishal Teeth in all their grinding
and grinning warieties, and is enuff to give you a good twinge as you
passes by 'em. But another shop is werry interesting. Ony fancy
about 16 hundred silver watches all a hanging up together and all a
going together and being xactly 20 minutes past 1. I took the
libberty of asking the werry pretty young Lady as sold’em, allabout
the winding of 'em hup ewery day, witch she told me is done ewery
morning and took a long time to do, but just then a stoopid feller of
my aquaintance came behind me and said in my ear, “Oh, Mr.
RoBERT!” when I declare I started like a gilty thing and warcked
quickly away tho as innercent as a pair of sucking doves. A gentle-
man pressed me werry much to buy a cheap filter, but I couldn't see
much difference between the two waters, tho I i. confesses as
Iaint much of a judge of the harticle in question, thinking it werry
poor thin cold stuff. The shop-keepers was all werry free and active
with their stationary and gave it away freely. Two or three elderly
ladies amost filled their black bags with samples. Among other
things we was all asked to “take one” out of a basket of little
packets, so I took one, but afterwards found to my great estonish-
ment that it wos a bottel of pills, of which I didn't “take one.” No
thankee, not for Robert, Nobody wants pills as lives like a gentle-
man, unless he's bin and injured his constitooshun with hard work,
witch I was never such a fool as to do.
There’s several picter rooms and some really staggering picters.
There's one as is amost filled with a werry big pea-green wave as
has determined to turn hisself over and has then altered his mind and
stopt half way, the like of which I suttenly never, seed afore for
culler. I spose as the Amerrycains is rayther a sollem peeple, and
that may acount for the number of picters of corpses a lying aboutin
all manner of persitions, but they seems scarcely adapted for dining-
T00ms.
I was treated with a good deal of respect by the natives, and one
gentleman, who was called “Kernel,” promised to introjuice me to
Bufferlow BILL the next time I went. RoBERT.

the Princess had been more inte-

Mr. Punch. Rem acutetigisti. If
the story had been of a young woman
whose lover was a Chief of the Nihil-
ists, if in his absence she, for reasons
which a dramatist or a novelist
- - - - would be a very inexperienced hand
if he could not invent, had married an old general devoted to the
Czar, if this loverturned up again, and, in fact, if the Nihilistic
Prince had been a lover instead of a brother, then there would have been
the material for such a strong dramatic interest as does not exist now.
Mr. Wibbs. I see, Sir... I think that when there was a chance of the
mine being exploded in the Third Act, the situation was exeiting.
Mr. Punch. It was inartistically handled; the excitement ought
to have been intense, whereas it was only a gentle momentary thrill.
For myself, I found it impossible to care what became of anybody in
the piece; nobody interested me; not Mr. Sugden's commonplace
and wearisome Yankee, who began so well; nor the Ollendorffian
maid; nor Mr. BRookFIELD, admirably made up and acting nothing
to perfection; nor. Mr. PATEMAN, the Russo-Irishman, who calls
Prince Alezis “Prince Alexus,” and from whom, bedad, one
expects a who-whoop and a jig; nor the young gentleman who has
longwº.; about Nihilism—that is, about nothing—in which
Mr. WILSON BARRETT would revel, and who, by the way, has caught
something of the tone of that eminent elocutionist; nor Miss MARIon
TERRY, who has a poor part indeed.
“I wonder.”

Mr. Nibbs. Quite true, Sir; I could have quitted them at any
moment without a pang—and yet the finish is exciting.
Mr. Punch. Well—yes—the finish is the best part of it. As for
the mine which never explodes, the only persons deserving a “blow-
ing up’ are the author and the management. I should say the best
name for it would be Much Ado About Nihilism... -
Mr. Nibbs. The people in the stalls about me liked it, and found
it very interesting.
Mr. Punch. Did they? I sincerely envy them. If the public
patronise this play, it will only be for the sake of seeing Mr. BEER-
BoIIM-TREE. -
Mr. Wibbs. I noticed that there was a charming want of unanimity
in the pronunciation of his name.
Mr. Punch. Yes, some called him “Demaytritis,” some “Dimitrus,”
some “Demeetroos;” and poor “Kerteh,” was “Kirsch” and
“Keersch” and “Ketch” without the JACK.
Mr. Nibbs, LADY MoncKToN seemed to work uncommonly hard.
Mr. Punch. Seemed ! nay, she did: very hard. I have already men-
tioned the fault of this part, and the fault of this part is the blunder
of the piece, which, however, unlike the mine, seems to be going off
pretty well. Let us go and see Nadia, at the Alhambra. [Ereunt.

HOW THE R.H.A. WAS SAVED.
(A Story for the Royal Horse Marines.)
“It is cruel that I should have none of the Royal Horse Artillery
with me!” exclaimed the British General, as he examined the
position of the enemy. “Not only would a few batteries have been of
great service to me, but it is unfair that the R.H.A. should be
deprived of the glory of victory. However, since the recent, reduc-
tions, we are all in the same boat—the Royal Horse Artillery is
reduced to skeleton proportions! The more's the pity!”
A young Captain belonging to a garrison battery heard these
remarks and respectfully saluting, ventured to address the Officer
Commanding. -
“General,” said he, “I will undertake with your permission to
protect the interests of the mounted branch of the service. By the
end of the day, you shall admit that honour is due to the R.H.A.”
“I trust so, Sir,” replied the General. He º rather shortly,
because he did not care to be addressed so familiarly by a sub-
ordinate. The battle commenced. The Infantry skirmished and
charged, the Cavalry outposted and bore down in masses. The en-
gagement extended over miles of country. To the General's
astonishment the guns seemed to be everywhere. He knew that his
Artillery were only º: of position, and yet they appeared to get
over the ground as if they were light ordnance harnessed to racers.
He could not make it out. It was a hard fight. The infantry were
cut to pieces, the É. shot down by hundreds, but, thanks to the
guns, he pulled through at last. Wh. the enemy were in full
retreat, he sent for the Commander of the Artillery. The young
Captain he had already seen appeared and respectfully saluted him.
"So, Sir,” cried, the General, “it is to you and your men that
I owe, in great part, this glorious .* congratulate you, Sir,
upon your share in the day's doings. The greatest credit is due to
the Royal Artillery.” . . -
The young Captain tried to speak, in protest, but not a word
could be heard.
“I am not surprised to learn that you are hoarse, Sir,” said the
General, sternly—he was a great Martinet. “You and your men
served your guns with a good deal of unnecessary shouting. Still,
you managed admirably. How did you get your guns into so many
positions?”
The Captain, who had found a piece of chalk, wrote on a
sabretache, “I cannot speak—I am so hoarse. I got the guns into
so many positions by harnessing my men to the pieces, and treating
them like horses.”
“Excellent!”, exclaimed the Officer Commanding. “Capitall
Well, great credit attaches to the Royal Artillery. at P. You
protest! Why?” . Then the young Captain wrote with his chalk
these generous words:-‘‘We—my men and I-have been shouting
all day long, that we might become hoarse. We are hoarse!”
“Ah, I see!” exclaimed the General, wiping away a tear. “You
have done this that the flory might belong to the Royal Hoarse
Artillery.” And they had.
NOTES AND WOTES.
THE Central Committee, of the National Society for Women's
Suffrage certainly put forth an excellent programme at their last
Saturday's Concert at Prince's Hall, and must have been gratified at
the favourable reception accorded to their efforts by the numerous
and fashionable audience that, attended, on the occasion. Where
º: was so good, it is perhaps invidious to select, but a special
word of praise is due to Miss HILDA WILSON and to Miss DAMIAN
for their respective rendering of Mr. Cowen's two charming songs,
“Absence,” and “Tears,” as also to Miss AGNES LARKCoM, who,
accompanied by the Composer, Herr WILHELM GANZ, gave the pretty
ballad, “Sing, sweet Bird” with much effect. Capital, too, was the
playing of Miss AGNES ZIMMERMAN, while Mr. MAYBRICK was en-
tirely in his element with his effective “A Little Hero,” †.
the Central Committee's Concert may be said to have come off with
flying colours, the which they need not be ashamed to fasten to the
mast of Woman's Suffrage, a task for which they might possibly
requisition the services of Mr. SYDNEY NAYLOR, who acted most
efficiently as one of the Conductors.

Irish Members inexorable. Insist to the length of taking divi-
sion, in which the purists of style are beaten.
Clause discussed all through, afternoon... SMITH again “on the
pounce.” Divisions showed not enough Ministerialists present to
carry Closure. Whips threw messengers out in all #.tions.
Principal object of Ministers to-day is to have two hundred Members
on the premises. Slowly they came in, and it was Four o’Clock
before SMITH felt himself in position to “pounce.” Once success-
fully done, however, position assured. Pounced again at Twenty
Minutes to Six, with curious results. According to Standing Order,
debate must on Wednesdays close at Quarter to Six, House rising
at or before Six o'Clock. Division on Closure brought proceedings
close upon Six o'Clock. House had agreed that question should
put. ould it be put at this hour CourTNEY said Yes. So
second Division took place, and House, for the first time in recol-
lection of oldest inhabitant, sat till Ten Minutes after Six on a
Wednesday afternoon. Business done.—Wery little.
Friday Morning.—House getting so accustomed to Closure, might
have been thought nothing would astonish it. But SMITH managed
to surprise it last night. Questions over, Sage of Queen Anne's Gate
interposed, and, with assistance of some hundred Members, managed
to launch debate on Zululand. In good old times this would have
lasted all night. Looked as if it would certainly last over dinner-
hour. Under-Secretary for the Colonies followed the Sage, and made
usual kind of speech. Then came GEORGE CAMPBELL and Osborn E
MoRGAN. CLARK next rose to his feet, and proceeded to give Scotch
accent to debate. . As Osborn E MoRGAN. sat down, watchful eyes
from opposite Benches observed Qld Morality advancing nearer and
nearer edge of Bench. A hushed whisper passed from mouth to
mouth in Irish Camp.
“He’s going to pounce!” - -
And pounce he did before CLARK had finished his first sentence.
Angry cries from Irish Camp. Division challenged. Closure carried;
by Seven o’Clock decks cleared, for resumption of discussion, on
Coercion Bill. . Things went on till One o’Clock this morning. Then
Supply promptly turned into Irish debate. So we sat and wrangled
till dawn. Business done.—Hardly any.
FROM all accounts, it appears that Her MAJESTY need, not have
gone to West Kensington to witness a war-dance of Wild Indians
as the Dowagers of her own Buckingham Palace, in their paint an
feathers, could have provided her with a much fiercer and more
savage entertainment on the spot, on a regent occasion. Duelling
wiliºme in fashion for ladies if this sort of thing is allowed, and a
Drawing-Room will be worse than the House in debate on the Irish
Crimes Bill.

The beat of the hoofs, and the pulse of the stride,
The lash of the wind, the quick gasp at one's side,
The spectators' tumultuous shouting- ..
These, known from of old, have a charm for me still;
The old eager hope, the old passionate thrill,
Still move me, yes, that is past doubting.
And now? Well, I’ve scarcely a popular mount,
At least so they say, though Ifancy they count
The least little bit prematurely,
The Ring's cognoscenti. How often before
Have I saddled in face of a dissident roar,
And won at the finish securely 1

What an eye for an opening ! Yes, it was grand
To fight out a finish with DIzzy.
Bob CECII, BILL SMITH P Why, they’re not in the hunt.
If once with Home Rule I can forge to the front,
Once more the old Jock will be busy.
But can I? The field has been running all wrong,
And to make a straight dash through the clustering throng
Is a task that might puzzle a topper;
round loses time, and that game often fails;
t want to be driven on to the rails,
At the risk of a crush or a cropper.
SMITH's right in the road, stolid HARTY close by;
I fear I shall not “split” the pair if I try,
And a smasher would follow misjudging.

But you won't catch young Brummagem budging.
Shut in! Yes, by Jingo! They’re all in the swim.
Were it BILL SMITH alone, I would soon settle him,
But the other two back him—confound 'em!

Everybody is requested to remain in their

the fall of Marcel, Raoul, and Valentine.
Old Opera-goers will remain out of sheer
curiosity, for who of the habitués ever
remained in the theatre, consule Costa, after

The ladies heard firearms going off, and used
to think that the best thing they could do

appreciate every word at its real value. To them then I put the
question, Who forgets the old proverb that a Baird in the hand is

something Hawley-Smartleyish about one of the horses, isn't there?

THE Daily News of Friday last gave an account of the reception
of Mr. WILson BARRETT by a “large crowd of professional friends
and admirers.”. By the way, what a pleasant and lucrative calling
must be that of a “professional admirer.” And for our part we
should prefer a real friend to a “professional friend.”. However,
this is a matter of taste. Mr. BARRETT was “escorted to the Midland
Hotel,” and here Mrs. BERNARD BEERE greeted him gracefully, and
handed to him “a beautiful wreath.”
Then Mr. BARRETT replied, that all this came upon him “almost
as a surprise.” Note the “almost.”. The professional admirers lost
an opportunity here of striking up, “.9 what a surprise!” but per-
* they did not like to interrupt Mr. BARRETT, who went on to
tell them how “that morning, for the first time for many months, he
caught sight of the green fields of old England,”—well, of course,
not much to be seen of them in America—“and it seemed to him that
these words were about as welcome to him as were (sic) a draught of
water to the traveller”—the commercial traveller?—“in the

264 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[May 28, 1887,
VERY ORIGINAL GREEK AT OXFORD.
(By an Untutored Correspondent.)
I was on a visit to the Junior Warden of No Bodies. College,
when my eye was caught by an announcement of the second night of
a play at the New Theatre. It was
Alcestis. Though I have not had a classi-
cal education, yet. I have had a very fair
theatrical one, and I remembered the title
years ago at, I think, the Haymarket. I
procured a stall. The house was crowded,
and I could not obtain a programme or
a book of the º and so I was depen-
dent on my neig bour, a very pleasant
young Undergraduate, for my information,
N which, in the shape of notes taken at the
time, I now send to you.
8'30,-We are looking at a most original
act-drop, painted expressly (so my neigh-
bour teſis me) by Professor HERKoMER.
“A sonnet has been written on it,” said
my informant, though, for the life of me,
as I had no opera-glasses, I couldn't see
it, “by Mr. CourtENAY, a new fellow.”
My informant speaks of the Author of the
Sonnet as old boys do of a young chap
just come up. I mention this because it
- - is really an encouraging sign. For “a
Classic Costume revived at new fellow” to have written a sonnet on
Oxford. Professor HERKOMER's “drop,” proves him
to be of considerable promise. The drop, my young friend thinks,
might possibly be a drop too, much in any but a Classical Theatre,
...i he explains that the bold and beautiful figure seated on a
igantic soap-bubble is intended to represent an ideal form of mural
ecoration as known to the advertising, ancient, Greeks, on whom to
£azº long and lovingly on this would hº -
“At least,” adds my youthful but well-informed companion, “so it
ap-pears.” I fancy, from the twinkle in his eye, that he intends a
un somewhere, but at this moment three strokes of the hammer, as
in French Theatres, give the signal to take up the drop; and as the
lights are lowered, my young friend's twinkle, like “all worldly
shapes” in the poem, is “lost in!gloom.” -
he Pla *F House on a raised platform on the principle of a
show in a Fair. Country landscape in the distance. In front of the
stage is a P; stone table on which is a dessert of #. oranges,
(no bills of the play) bananas, and º: with a spirit-lamp to º
the coffee hot when it comes, or for ghting cigarettes. Apollo (
know he is Apollo, having seen him frequently in classical bur-
lesques) enters and speaks. My young friend asks me “if I under-
stand what he's saying.”. I reply, “Perfectly.” “It’s Greek,”
says my young friend, looking at me with an expression implying a
vote of want of confidence, in my statement...I listen to it for a few
seconds, as if I were catching a, tune, and then reply, “He is not
very distinct, but it does sound like Greek to me.”. This is strictly
true. I follow it at a more respectful distance than I should an
Opera in German.
My young friend further whispers to me, that the piece was, when
first written, an exact model of the old Classic Greek Farce, but that
the Vice-Chancellor had refused to license it, unless it was con- |b
siderably altered and cut down. The result seems to have been, that
most of the fun has been taken out of it, which however, I think,
could not originally have been screamingly humorous. .
“Did the new fellow you mentioned just now write it f° I ask.
My youthful informant pauses a second or so, he cannot have a very
§ memory—and he answers “No, it was another fellow.” He
#. his name at the moment, but is sure it is something like Mr.
Hugh RIPPITEs; and, do I know him? No I donot... Is hean Oxford
man? ... “Oh, yes,” replies my young friend with certainty. “He’s
an Undergraduate here.” Reallyl Now this is encouraging. That
an Undergraduate, Mr. Hugh RIPEITEs, should have written a play
in Greek, is an excellent sign of the revival of learning. I regret
my want of a classical education, and contemplate f. to Oxford
as a student., Never too old to learn. I do not blame Mr. HUGH
RIPPITEs for *::: introduced many, English words which every
now and then caught my ear—and indeed they were pointed out to
me by my neighbour—because, after all, as a first attempt, it is
most creditable. - -
Apollo talks. My young friend nudges me whenever there is a
double entendre in Greek, and laughs behind his hand., “Rather
strong that,” he whispers occasionally. I reply in an undertone, as
if I were with difficulty stifling my laughter, "Hush, be quiet!”—
but this only makes him laugh the more. The audience, I notice,
scarcely smile once. . Being in Greek, perhaps the ladies don't under-
stand the “hits”. in the dialogue. I don't, but this I keep to
myself. Then steam arises (an anachronism, of course, but “sym-
have had a soapyrific effect. “
bolical of progress,” as my friend assures me), and an old woman in
grey muslin, with a knife, appears. “It’s the Demon of SocRATEs,”
º companion tells me. Very good. Apollo and the Demon have
a dialogue, during which my companion is perpetually nudging me,
so I suppose it's full of good jokes which I don't exactly catch.
Again I pretend to be restraining my laughter, and beg him to be
decorous. Off trips Apollo, and the Demon goes through some
pantomimic action, then goes through a door, and disappears. Enter
a lot of melancholy young-old men—with very evident beards of
every description. They gather round the dessert and the ciga-
rette spirit-lamp. No one touches so much as a grape. Then on
the raised platform appears a classically costumed gentleman: My
young friend tells me that he is the show proprietor, and is called by
a very appropriate name, “Admittus.” The showman, Admittus,
tells the young-old men what is to be seen inside, in a speech, which
my companion (who knows the play by heart) tells me is “immensely
witty.” His audience do not seem to appreciate it, but evidently
there is no great attraction, as the young-elders show no sign of
even wishing to “Walk up, walk up !” but, instead, stay outside,
and commence singing an Irish dirge as they once more group
themselves about the dessert and the cigarette spirit-lamp.
Enter a lady on the platform, evidently very ill. “This,”
whispers my informant, “is Alcestis.” Of course I remember her
name perfectly, many years ago. She is in great pain, and Admittus,
the showman, suggests something about “toddy”. But whether she
is to take it, or whether she has taken too much of it already, I
cannot clearly make out, and don't like to bother my young friend
with too many questions. He whispers to me that it is this part of
the piece which the WICE-CHANCELLoR has spoilt by cutting, and
that, therefore, it is rather heavy. It certainly is.
Then come on two very pretty children, named, as I gather from
what I can catch of the words, “Tommy” and “Kitty.” Subse-
quently I find I am wrong, and that “Kitty” is “Sukey.”
Admittus talks about a “Se-gar,” which is also an anachronism
pardonable in a young Author's first work, but in keeping with
the spirit-lamp and dessert. Then Alcestis gets worse, and cries,
Qwl owl ow!” and Admittus, whose mind seems to run upon
nothing but eating and drinking, offers her “ducks and gun-
aiky,” which, my young friend tells me, is very old Attic for
green, peas cooked in a certain way. I catch the plot now; she is
suffering from having eaten “ducks and gunaiky,” and having tried
to correct the effects with “toddy” and a “se-gar.” Admittus
addresses her tenderly as “Molly.” I thought her name was
Alcestis. “Her family name is Alcestis,” my companion whispers,
jºy annoyed at my tone of momentary doubt... “She is Molly
4lcastis.” ...I beg pardon. I see perfectly. “Molly” the petit nom.
Well, Molly expires. Everyone is broken-hearted, and one of the
leaders of the Chorus, addressed by Admittus as “Mr. Martin,”
leads a walk round the dessert and cigarette-lamp.
Enter Hercules, with all the strength in his legs, which are
enormous (and were probably provided by the costumier), but with
no “power to his elbow,” as his arms are comparatively very slight,
which accounts for his not doing the usual strong-man business of
lifting weights, &c. He belongs to the Show, and goes in with
Admittus, who has upbraided him for not being there at the com-
mencement of the performance. The young-old men then break out
into a classic hunting chorus, with a refrain that sounds like
“Tiddy ti! who cares?” They finish with, a “walk round,” and
ereunt, leaving the dessert untouched and the spirit-lamp still
urning. This ends the First Part.
My young friend bids me good-night, as he has to go to supper,
and has seen it all before. § thank him heartily for his assistance,
and post this to you.
PERSONALLY CoNDUCTED.—Dean KITCHIN, so the St. James's
Gazette informed us last week, has announced that on certain days
he will himself, in propriá persond, show visitors over Winchester
Cathedral. “No Fees!” ill his example be followed by Lord
SALISBURY, or the LoRD CHANCELLOR, personally conducting country
cousins over the House of Lords, while the spºken will do the same
for “Strangers” in the House of Commons, illustrating every object
of interest with “the SPEAKER's commentary” on it? It is quite a
“new departure.” Dean KrtoRIN, telling the same stories over and
over again, may be known as a “Winchester Repeater;” but, at all
events, for the benefit of tourists, a most useful Servus Servorum
will be found in this KITCHIN. During the Dean's special Show
Service, the Organist might play variations on “In Verdure clad,”
with new words for the choir, commencing “As Werger clad.”

MR. PUNCH*S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.
|A || It is confidently hoped that any pupil who has followed this
i. | course with attention will be now sufficiently, advanced, to
| | | undertake a Recitation demanding powers of the highest. order,
º - and, acting under this conviction, Mr., Punch has set his very
º best Bard to construct a poem that shall provide the panting
amateur with even greener laurels than before.. - -
- In presenting his readers with an opportunity for attaining
distinction which may not occur again, the Author would
merely observe that the key-note of the piece is a vaguely
voluptuous melancholy, dominated by the approaching shadow
of impending calamity... If the Student feels any doubt, of
his power to convey all this, he had far better employ his
- - abilities upon something of an easier and less exalted character
than the following, which we will call
APROPOS DE BOTTEs.
In a bow-window on the Esplanade BELINDA with her BERTRAM breakfasted;
But while with outward calm the tea she made, within was all uncertainty and dread:
What though the toast was crisp, the eggs new-laid, when, in its envelope of dull brick-red,
The missive that had forced her heart to flutter, lay, yet unopened, by the bread-and-butter?
(Pause, until the curiosity of your audience is * aroused—then continue with deeper

of petrified despair; hand pressed to side, as if in pain; level tone.)
Her face she turned all piteously drawn, and gazed upon him apprehensively,
With eyes dilating, like a startled fawn; one crystal tear fell flashing in her tea, -
Nor did she heed the appetising prawn, nor amber marmalade from far Dundee; [City!”
'BERTRAM,” she gasped, “leave me not thus, in pity—they cannot really want you in the

emotion, clasp them.)
Ruthe-'Alack that I must answer yes! Who could foretell the dream would end so soon?
Or deem the envious cloud of busi-ness would drift across our radiant honeymoon?
But I must catch the Ten o’Clock express, which gets me up to London Bridge by noon!
Nay, sweetest one, give not the reins to sorrow—I shall be back ere dinner-time to-morrow!”
- With a fictitious cheerfulness.
And hearing, she forebore to make a fuss, but sought, with packing, her despair to drug;
Then, seated in the Hotel omnibus, she strapped with dainty hands his railway rug;
Till at the Littlehampton terminus they parted, with one last hysteric hug, -
And he, his manifest emotion choking, entered a first-class carriage labelled “Smoking.”
(Pause again;, then cast your eyes down, and continue in a tone of chastened melancholy.)
Now, feeling that her well of joy is dried, her lotus-tree aliwithered to its roots,
Back to her lonely lodgings she has hied—and here a pang through all her being shoots!

For–basking on the hearthrug, side by side—she finds her best beloved BERTRAM's boots;.
His patent leathers he had gone to Town in—so this must be the pair he'd travelled down inl
(Gently.) There is a pathos in the mute ºpe. of objects that have shared a bygone bliss;
And even these dumb boots are down at heeſ—seeming their absent master now to missil
Which, as BELINDA notes, she fain must kneel, and cheer them with a sympathetic kiss,
But now a carmine tide o'erflows her neck fast—the maid comes in to clear away the breakfast!
Anon a fantasy BELINDA thrills, and both the boots she on the table sets:
Full lovingly each vacancy she fills, with freshly gathered sweet March violets,
And heavy-headed saffron daffodils—nor necessary moisture she forgets. [such chalices P”
“To sigh,” she whispers, “for your native Nº. cease—for when were flowers honoured by
And she forgets the grim Teutonic bands: and she forgets the donkeys on the green:
And she forgets the sea-gull haunted sands: and she forgets the fashions in The Queen :
Seated before those boots with folded hands, she feels no yearning for a change of scene.
Content to linger by her flowers fragrant, and yield herself to recollections vagrant.
(Hands behind you for this last stanza, head slightly to left, eyes half closed, speak with a
dreamy musical lingering intonation.
And all day long she keeps them in her sight, and murmurs to them tender little phrases,
Imagining they comprehend her quite-conduct that her old landlord much amazes,
Who overhears her bidding them “good-night,” (kiss your fingers here) and open-mouthed
upon the threshold gazes, [Raise both hands.
Holding, perchance, that such proceedings can well entitle her to residence at Hanwell.
BELINDA seeks her couch—but ere she sinks into the brief oblivion of sleep,

About the Supernatural no man knew all—
So much she’s learned from many a Christ-

In restless dread the worst she must await,
Hearing on every breeze her BERTRAM's

Hark! is there not a clanging at the gate?
A feverish ringing at the front-door bell?
Lo!’tis her BERTRAM l Wondrous to relate,

You meaner beauties of the night,
That poorly satisfy the eye,

The ladies' names to specify,)
Where are you when my love is nigh P
Ye wallflowers that first appear,
That first appear and latest go,
Striking the surging crowd with fear
At your insipid anxious row,
What wonder that you find it slow P
Ye chanters of the drawing-room,
That warble ballads of the day
So that you well deserve the doom
Of the weak heroes of your lay,
Wait till my love comes round your way!
For when my mistress shall appear
In the new playhouse I’ve designed,
A serio-tragi-comic Queen, -
With all the latest fads combined,
Out of all sails she’ll take the wind.

SOMETHING LIKE BYE-LAWS
IT is said—with what truth remains to be seen—that the Thames
Conservators, not content with their absurd Bye-Laws in respect to
House-Boats and Steam-Launches, have under their serious consider-
ation the desirability of strictly enforcing the following equally
sensible and equally necessary regulations:-
Bye-Law No. 1437. From and after the 1st day of April next,
mo Swans shall be allowed to swim in the River Thames unless
properly attired, and no Bathing shall be allowed under any circum-
stances whatever, unless the person bathing be clothed by Mr.
MACINTosh from head to foot.
Bye-Law No. 1438. No Coal-Barge shall be allowed to navigate
the Thames above .."; Lock, unless supplied with a properly
authenticated certificate that the said Barge has been thoroughl
cleansed with soap and water before entering the River. Any co
falling overboard to be carefully dredged for, on #. of imprison-
ment. The use of i. on a House-Boat or Steam-Launch is strictly
prohibited, except in the case of Barristers of seven years' standing.
Bye-Law No. 1439. No field or meadow within a quarter of a
mile from the river, as the King-fisher flies, shall ever be manured,
unless a guarantee be given that no rain shall be allowed to fall on
such field or meadow within a lunar month of its being so manured.
Any infraction of this Bye-Lawto be punished with six months' hard
labour on somebody else's land, and a fine of £10 per acre to the
nearest Cricket Club.
Bye-Law No. 1440. That no Fish of any description, except
minnows under age, shall be allowed, under any pretence whatever,
to be in the River Thames during the close season. -
Bye-Law No. 1441. No one s be allowed under any circum-
stances to wash his hands or face in the River, except when passing
over a Weir. The Lock-keepers are ordered to see this regulation
strictly carried out. Whenever Cattle are permitted to drink of the
River, a Notice-Board must be placed, bearing the following device
in white letters on a black ground, and not less than four inches by
three in diameter:—“One Minute for Refreshment.”
Bye-Law No. 1442. All oars, sculls, and poles intended to be
used in the River to be carefully washed with soap and warm water
before being allowed to be so used., No sculls to be of more than the
ordinary thickness, or they will be treated as being infractions of the
patent rights of certain influential persons.
Bye-Law No. 1443. No Water Rats are allowed to enter, the
River between sunset and sunrise, unless in the enjoyment of robust
health, and under no circumstances whatsoever are Eels sufficiently
small to enter the pipes of the Water Companies to be permitted to
remain in the River more than one calendar week. -
The Conservators having given their whole minds to the calm
consideration of these important Bye-Laws, can scarcely consider it
possible that they can ever require alteration or amendment; but
should that be the case, such proposed alterations or amendments will
have to be submitted first to the Board of Inland Revenue,then to
the Court of Chancery, and finally to the QUEEN in Council, which
will not occupy more than about two years, or cost more than a few
thousand*. so the remedy will be as º: as it is inexpensive.
N.B.-It is proposed, after every heavy shower during the ap-
proaching season, to pour a pipe of Rose-water and a butt of Eau de
Cologne into the River, at Silly Bridge, to assistin its purification.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WITH - THE INDIANS ON THE DERBY DAY.
(From a North-East Windian Contributor.)
FoR many weeks past, go where I will, I have been unable to
escape from a variety of ići, and biliously coloured advertisement-
F. of savage Indians and picturesque persons in a sort of Mexican
unter's costume, riding recklessly among prairies, shooting every:
thing and everybody—and of other gallant sportsmen, riding wild
buffaloes or bisons, which were represented by the artist as uncom-
monly spirited animals, all of them like “Old Jo” in the nigger song,
“kicking up ahind and afore.”
Besides these, I had been haunted by the portrait of the leader of
the troupe, BUFFALo BILL himself, who is represented as a sort of
wild TENNYSON, of thirty or forty years ago, with a moustache, and
a fixed stony stare, suggestive of wool-gathering, which, by the way,
may account for the length of his flowing locks. I had heard that
BUFFALO BILL, in private, was the Hon. Something Cody, American
Senator, who preferred this style of sporting. Showman's life to at-
tending in his place in. Congress, just as if Mr. GLADSToxE, led
away by his enthusiastic passion for tree-chopping, should chuck
up his Parliamentary career, let his hair 5. long, assume a pig-
turesque dress, and make a tour of the world, on his own axes, with
a company illustrating English life at Hawarden, and calling himself
“Woodchopping WILL,” or “Crimes BILL"—this having been the
distasteful measure which had driven him to go about with a Show.
I was told that BUFFALO BILL's Show at Earl's Court gave a vivid
and truthful representation of Life in the Far West—that is a West
much farther than Kensington. And so, ever anxious to complete a
neglected education, and, from my youth upward, devotedly attached
to the novels of FENIMORE CoopFR, it occurred to me that the Derby
Day offered a chance of seeing BUFFALO BILL's Show in comparative
quiet. I don't know to what temperature the Noble Savages and the
Cowboys and Cowgirls are accustomed, but on this occasion, the un-
fortunate spectators in the two-shilling seats, who could not career
about, sat in the most piercing draughts, that the Wild. North-East
could provide, a few protecting themselves with huddling together
underneath their umbrellas (I personally huddled) while others were
turning up their coat-collars, and regretting the absence of wraps.
If the weather continues like this, a good trade might be done by
the programme-sellers at BUFFALO BILL's in hot-water bottles and
foot-warmers.
From what I saw there, I f". that Life in the Wild West is a
theatrical, circus-like sort of existence; that everyone dresses in a
fancifully embroidered costume, somewhat complicated by its arrange-
ment of leather straps and loose tags; that there is a good deal of
tan about, and that there are highly-coloured canvas mountains,
trees, and blue sky all round up to a certain height, above which can
be seen the attic-windows of the neighbouring houses; that Noble
Savages ride in at full gallop to the accompaniment of airs from La
Grande Duchesse, and other popular tunes, that they swoop and
whoop, and squeak and shriek, in all the bravery of their paint and
feathers; and that this, as far as I could understand it, is the only
“bravery” they display, as there is nothing particularly daring in
i. out, some forty or fifty of them, to attack four harmless
travellers riding in a tumble-down old ramshackle vehicle—well
named the “Dead-wood Coach.”–and, on the appearance of BUFFAL0
BILL and the Cowboys, to gallop away again in abject terror. Nor
is it remarkably courageous for the same number of savages, repre-
senting the entire tribe, to come out to steal a solitary horse which
is quietly grazing on the sawdust plain in front of a log-hut where
a man and his wife and a chance traveller, the owner of the aforesaid
horse, are taking a little refreshment, with the blinds down. Two
Indian scouts stealthily approach the horse, one º it,
and the other, in burglarious fashion, climbs on to the roof of the
log-hut in order, to shoot anyone coming out at the door, which he
could have done just as well if he had remained, like a sort of Indian
Chevy Slyme, “round the corner,” without taking this extratrouble.
In the meantime “the Braves” are in ambush behind some property
trees and rocks. Suddenly, º go rifles, the Cowboys, headed by
BUFFALO BILL, appear; more wild banging; the Indians ride round
and round, and, with screams and shouts and more war-whooping,
scuttle off as hard as they can in the direction of the painted trees
and rocks, behind which is their encampment. In fact, whenever
the Noble Savages come into collision with the Cowboys, they get
the worst of it.
But is this the true story of Wild,West life? Why should the
Noble Savages be always beaten by the Cowboys? It is a fight be-
tween Cowboys and, Cow-ards. One day the Indians will turn sulky,
and refuse to play any more, unless the Cowboys agree to be alter-
nately the defeated party.
Then there was a scene showing how one Indian tribe, out for a
pleasant pic-nic º , are just settling down comfortably, when up
come a hostile tribe. There was a sort of Donnybrook fair of º:
ing and sham-fighting, and when the pic-nickers had been evicted,
the new occupiers of the sawdust indulged in a most unimpressive,
ungraceful, and generally idiotic terpsichorean performance, which
the programme tells us is a War-dance.
. Taken altogether, I should say that these Noble Savages are born
circus-riders, and have a fine natural *. for equestrian per-
formances, but are somewhat deficient in humour., I saw one of the
younger warriors attempting some comic business, but he was imme
diately suppressed. Yet what a feature a tribe of wild Clowns might
be, in all their paint, with, of course, their Pantaloons, and a few
extra cockscombs and feathers! The Honble. Cody, who, as BUFFAL0
BILL, doesn't do much except career about, take off his hat grace-
fully, and shoot at glass balls, which, though clever, is not quite a
novelty, might discover a Pantomime Tribe in time for Christmas.
The buckjumping is the only thing that doesn't, seem to me tº
smell of the footlights and sawdust. It is a decidedly *...* an;
really dangerous, performance. It struck me that the “Wild West
on the cold, North-easterly Derby Day, seemed to be rather a Tame
West, the depression being, perhaps, attributable to anatural feeling
of resentment on the part of the Cowboys and Indians at being kept
at work instead of being taken for a holiday to see the Derby...But
B. B. knows best; and if the Noble Savages had once got a sniff of
freedom and the fresh air of the Downs, they might have gone for, a
lark all over Surrey, have attacked the Dorking Coach, driven.the
donkey-boys off the sands of Margate, won all the nuts at shooting;
scalped the Nigger Minstrels, frightened the Nurserymaids, seized
the bathing-machines, and used them as an encampment in the plains
of Thanet, set the local police at defiance, and at last, after refusin
to return to the Honble. Copy, they might have come to terms wit
the other BºAibert Éalace BILL, the People's Caterer- or

what’s the use of that gallant sportsman who ascends & pulpit ºn
makes continual harangues, º descriptive of the Show, but
scarcely one word of which could I, or those about me, catch on that
lamentably cold Derby Day? I hope somebody hears him, as other-
wise, if he is doing this twice every day, he is rather wasting his
sweetness on the desert air of Tame West Kensington.
ALL AT SEA.
THE column of “Naval Intelligence” has, during, the last few
days, been supplying the inquisitive portion of the public who refer
to it, with some #. y, if not encouraging, reading. - -
The Torpedo Channel Fleet º: to have been coming to grief.
Out of the twenty-four vessels that took #. in the recent manoeuvres,
eleven are reported as having returned disabled. The fatal disaster
that overtook No. 47 is already well known, and No. 57 seems only
just to have escaped a similar fate. Nos. 43 and 66 “came into col-
ison,” while No. 27, 41,42,44, 50, and 56 are all posted as having
been “temporarily disabled by breakdowns” in their respective en-
ine-rooms. No. 45 closes the list with the announcement of a
"damaged screw.” Indeed, that there is a screw loose somewhere, is
evident from the above catalogue of catastrophes. One of the firms
who supplied most of the faulty vessels in question, writes to the
Times to clear their character, and charges the Admiralty with
creating the fiasco by handing their management over tº uninstructed
crews and inefficient officers." If this is the case, the Nayal Intelli;
ence Department should lose no time in sharpening its wits and
f. into the matter. The Review at Spithead, is to come off
shortly; but if nearly 50 per cent. of Her Majesty's ships present on
the occasion are going to collide, blunder, and breakdown, from any
cause whatever, it had certainly better be postponed.

REFLECTIONs—“AS IN A LOOKING-GLASS.”
Mr. Punch. It is not a play at all. It is a study of character, of
one character, Lena Despard, admirably portrayed by Mrs. BER-
NARD BEERE.
Mr. Nibbs. You have read Mr. PHILLIPs' novel, of course.
Mr. Punch. Yes. The Diary of a Bad Girl—of a Becky Sharp,
in fact—decidedly clever,
and interesting, but as lack-
ing in construction as is the
dramatic version of it; that
is, if this can be called a
dramatic version, which is
only the novel unstitched,
º the leaves distribute
among a certain number of
actors.
Mr. Nibbs. There are the
materials for a good play in
the novel.
Mr. Punch. Certainly
there are. The novel sug-
ests an idea for a good play,
É. Mr. GROVE has done
nothing with it. An audience
should have been told at first
of the connection between
Captain Jack Fortinbras (a part for which the management ought not
to have chosen Mr. STANDING, whom it doesn't suit in the least) and
the Chief of the Russian Police, who is brought in as the deus éz
machiná, without rhyme or reason, whenever there is a knot to be
untied. M. MARIUs plays Count Dromiroff. very amusingly, the
only fault about his performance being, that his bearing and manner
convey, the idea that he is only a superior. Head-Detective mas-
uerading as a Russian Nobleman. If this view is correct, then the
romiroff of M. MARIUs is an excellent performance, but if Dro-
miroff is really a Russian Nobleman, then I think M. MARIUS's
impersonation is a mistake.
Mr. Nibbs. The other parts are weak as water.
Mr. Punch. Partly the fault of the Actors and of the characters.
Mr. DENIsox's representation of Sir Thomas Gage as a Punch
Doll, with a joint or two loose, and an imitation of Mr. BANCROFT's
peculiar high note, by way of a squeaky chuckle, is a praiseworthy
attempt at giving a little relief to rather tedious scenes. The fact
is, the success of the piece is Mrs. BERNARD BEERE as Lena Despard
and I have never seen SARA's pupil more worthy of her talented
teacher than is Mrs. BEERE in this character. Not that in this piece
Mrs. BEERE owes anything directly to SARA, except the death-scene—
(doesn't Fedora call out that “It burns! It burns!”, and doesn't she
writhe in agonies? I think so, if I remember aright).-and; indi-
rectly, the impersonation seemed to me, to owe something to SARA's
L'Etrangère, a rôle that would suit Mrs. BEERE down to the ground,
though no doubt she would Fº the original part of Lena Despard,
in . to have the merit of “creating,” and to avoid comparisons.
Mr. Nibbs. Your remarks do not detract in any way from the
excellence of her performance. - -
Mr. Punch. No; on the contrary, there is no reason why the pupil
should not improve upon the teacher, and in this play Mrs. BEERE
has done more. for . has improved on
herself. Her a tºtations and iºnotes are
discarded, and if the character were only
more developed than it is, if it were a well-
constructed play with strong situations, her
Lena Despard would probably merit the
description of a really fine per-
formance, of which it now just
falls short. But I shall rejoice
in the success of this piece for
several reasons.
Mr. Nibbs. Well,

logically be refused to an English play on the model of Françillon,
for example.
Mr. Punch. Exactly: And... I was pleased, to notice the
audience patiently listening to dialogue, which, though good, and
frequently witty, failed to .# or even illustrate, character. The
scenes dragged, but the audience listened and though wearied, were
on the whole interested, and ready to appreciate any touch of senti-
“young person” to see. No; it is not, most decidedly, any more
than the novel, As in a Looking-Glass, is for “the young person's"
perusal.
Mr. Nibbs. A Bad Girl's Diary placed on the stage is rather
unwholesome food, Sir? Don't you think so?
. Mr. Punch. To some, not to others. It is a story of the seamy-
side of life, vice is not rendered attractive, and there is no reality
whatever about the suicide, –(though there is great reality in
Mrs. BEERE's acting in the death-scene, which I should think was
the raison d'être of the play)—which only serves the dramatist and
the novelist just as the Russian detective served them,--as a means
for getting rid of a troublesome character, and as a happy thought for
stifling all inquiries as to any other personages in whose fate readers,
or spectators, might have felt some interest. Critics who can accept
d|and praise this as a model play, must be ignorant of the essential
canons of dramatic composition. If this is a good play, then con-
struction is a mere waste of time. I.et us to an opera. [Ezeunt.
* NEW WORDS FOR OLD TUNES.”
MR. PUNCH has noticed that there is a decided want of novelty in
the baritone and bass songs of the day. They do not march with the
times. The same old “Pirates,” “Scouts,” “Wagabonds,’ &c.; are
still to the fore. The same old monks are still quaffing and laughing
ha! hal and ho! ho! Mr. Punch, therefore, begs to submit the
following—written up to date in choice Pink'unese—with Glossary
annexed.
THE JUBILEE JUGGINs.
Song for Baritone or Bass, in one flat.
In the Major., Oh! “rippin’” it is thus to sport and to “spoof,”
As a Jubilee Juggins with plenty of “oof,”
To shout and to yell at the “Pav.” and the “Troc.”
Regardless of “writters” and “taking the knock,”
To join in the choruses night after night,
In every key but the one that is right,
To nod to the singers and call them by name,
It's thus that the Juggins seeks glory and fame.
To climb up a lamp-post and “paint the town red,”
Then “run in ’’ by “bobbies” to Wine Street to bed.
Then knock up a “pal” for the requisite bail,
Off to Marlborough Street the next day without fail,
A Magistrate's caution, a fine of five bob,
A head never ceasing to ache and to throb,
Qh! 'rippin'” it is thus to sport and to "spoof,”
As a Jubilee Juggins with plenty of “oof.”
In the Minor. But, Jubilee Juggins, beware of the day,
When the golden-egg'd “oof-bird” no longer can lay.
When the “writters” grow rampant and run you to ground,
And the gay little “stumer” no longer goes round.
When the “fiver” has ceased to be ready to hand,
And the humble half-crown e'en is scarce in the land.
Where then are your friends of the “Pav.” and the “Troc.”
They are off with the “oof-bird,” you've “taken the knock,”
Then the clothes run to seed, and the linen grows dim,
And the hat grows more flabby each day in the brim,
Then the boots which were always so natty and neat,
Only cling in despair to the poor weary feet-
Those feet grown so weary in searching around
for those fir weather friends—never more to be found.
(With a devil-may-care earpression.)
In the Major. Still “rippin'”, it is thus to sport and to “spoof,”
As a Jubilee Juggins with plenty of “oof!”
GLOSSARY OF TERMS.
Rippin'. A term much used in the upper circles. The final g is
never sounded by the best people.
Spoof. From the Dutch—a merry game or pastime—see Dr.
ARTHUR RobFETs' Philological Dictionary. (Very rare and scarce.)
Jubilee †. A Juggins—amplification of Jug. A vessel you
soon get to the bottom of. Jubilee Juggins—an exceptional Juggins.
Pav. and Troc. Homes of classical music.
Writters. Time-servers.
Taking the knock. Derived from Noz et praeterea nihil; hence
“making a night of it,”
“If you always are “making a night of it,'
There is nothing much left for the day !”
Paint the town red. A custom derived from the Romans, who after
.." would often sally forth and paint the town red till all
Was Dlue.
Pun in. You are generally “run in” after being “found out.”
Oof-bird. A new edition of the Goose with the Golden Eggs.
Nearly extinct.
jºr. A badly executed drawing—wanting in balance and
00:8,
ment or humour. I do not say it is a piece for Mr. Podsnap's

(A Legend of Sydenham.)
MR. RIPvaN WINKLE found the Meeting very wearisome. The
Chairman was full of statistics, proving conclusively that unless the
Debenture-holders sacrificed some of their interest, the Institution
must collapse.
“Hear! Hear!” exclaimed Mr. WINKLE as he rose from his seat,
and hurried away to the Refreshment º: To his surprise,
on leaving the Lecture-room, he was met by a hideous-looking waiter
who beckoned him to carry a barrel of whiskey, N. good-
natured, RIPvaN shouldered the cask and marched to the bar. A
pale silent young woman opened the barrel, poured some of the
whiskey into a large glass, added a little Apollinaris water to the
draft, and invited WINKLE to drink. Nothing loth, he obeyed.
...' had the liquid passed his lips ere, amidst the sounds of
demon laughter, he fell asleep. Such a sleep, it seemed to last for
centuries. When RIPVAN awoke he was alone. His umbrella
(nearly new before his slumber) crumbled away in his hand from
extreme old age. His white beard reached his knees, his clothes were
in tatters. He looked round—the refreshment bar—the glass roof–
all had disappeared, and ". he was in a railway arch. He
rose from the round, and determined to†. through the Courts and
then get into the Gardens. But, alas! There was no Crystal Palace.
It had entirely disappeared l In the place of the Alhambra Court
there was a Furniture Warehouse—where the Rosary had been he
found a hideous terrace of stucco-faced cottages.
“And has it come to this?” he exclaimed, with a sigh.
“Come to what, old man?” asked a Policeman, who was wearing
a. §§ entirely unfamiliar to him.
“Where is the Crystal Palace?” said RIPvaN, answering one
question by putting another.
“The Crystal, Palace!”, responded, the Constable, after some
consideration. “I fancy it used to lie in the direction of West
Kensington, as they call Reading nowadays.”
“Then where are we now?” -
“Why, in South-East Kensington, to be sure, stoopid!” exclaimed
the custodian, impatiently. “Every fool can see that.”
RIPvaN hesitated to put the next query., At length he mustered
up. fºss to ask “whether in its new shape the Crystal Palace
paid P’’ -
“Paid! Why, in course not l London's overbuilt, and there
isn't much chance of house property paying ! d now I come to
think of it, I do remember the º Palace. I thought I knew
the name ! It was on this very site! Why, to be sure, I have heard
a lot about the shareholders.”
“What?’” RIPvaN asked, eagerly; . -
“Why, that they were all buried in one grave, having died of
broken hearts.”
“Oh, no, no!”
“But I say, yes, yes! It all comes back to me! They would do
nothing, so the ground was sold at an enormous sacrifice, and built
over. It has never paid, and the purchase-money barely met existing
liabilities. It was a pity, as ever since the disappearance of the poor
old place the Alexandra Palace has thriven wonderfully.”
RIPvaN burst into tears—and woke. He was still at the Meeting.
It was breaking up, having decided nothing. “There is only one
thing to be done!” he murmured earnestly.” “I must write to the
Times. The Palace must be saved.” And so it must!

ITALIANO IN COVENTO GARDENO.
It is still apparently undecided whether to call him Signor
GAYARRE or GAYARR£-printers and pronouncers differ; but about
- one thing there is no doubt, that
he has never been in finer voice
than he was for La Favorita last
Tuesday—an excellent Opera, by
the way, to give on the eve of the
Derby; and Mr. Punch's Operatic
tip is, to go for the Favourite if it is
given again during the season, and
back GAYARRf for a tenor.
Rigoletto was given on Thursday.
* , Miss ELLA RussKLL, as Gilda, re-
ſº ceived an enthusiastic call after the
ºS “Caro nome,” when she disappears
& up the ladder, and goes, for change
º N of air to the upper C. The Rigoletto
Signor DEvoyoD was a decided
success, and the duet between
Rigoletto and Gilda was one of
the hits of a first-rate perform-
ance.
Signor FIGUER took the part of the
Duke at short notice, and of course it
ºquite intelligible that to be figuer-
ing as a Duke at short notice is very
trying. He was not a self-sup-
porting tenor, but contributed his
fair share to the concerted pieces. Signor BEVIGNANI was the Con-
ductor. By the way, is the Omnibus Box so called because it is in
a line with the Conductor?. Mr. WAGSTAFF was present and asked
us this Conundrum: If Rigoletto's house were in London, in what
part would it be situated? The curtain was just rising on the last
Act as he whispered the answer,<-“In the Fool'em Road, S.W.”
Then WAGSTAFF left. - -
Fine performance of Faust on Saturday night, with Madame
ALBANI as Margherita. Signor GAYARRé came out uncommonly
strong in vocalisation as Faust, but left the acting to Madame
ALBANI. No one can accuse Signor Devoyod of being devoyod of
rare acting and singing powers. His Valentine was a very powerful
impersonation. Madame ScALCHI admirable, as usual, as the ill-used
Siebel; but “Signor” LoRRAIN's Mephisto was made up rather like
a French clown, and he was perpetually attitudinising as if arranging
a series of poses plastiques. His laugh in the serenade was too

FREE SPEECH.
A SPECIAL Committee having been appointed to inquire into the
“conduct of Debate,” for the purpose of framing some new rules that
may be found serviceable in enabling Parliamentary discussion to be
carried on in future, more in accordance with the entire liberty of
speech and freedom from ºf...; restrictions that have recently
developed themselves in the House of Commons, the following pre-
liminary tentative regulations to meet the requirements of the case
have already been drawn up, and will be put in force upon the re-
assembling of Members after the Recess:–
No Member making use of the language of a bargee, coal-heaver,
coster-monger, or drayman, or indulging in any number of popular
adjectives, shall be regarded as offending against the good taste of
the House. The words “cur,” “liar,” “scoundrel,” “hippopotamus,”
“thief,” and the like, may be freely used in the course of debate, and
applied by one Member to another, and they may be strengthened by
the addition of any number of ſº. epithets without calling for
any intervention on the part of the Chair.
at-calling, yelling, whistling, shouting, swearing, and shrieking,
shall be accepted as a legitimate interruption to the progress of any
discussion, and if there is any attempt to stifle this unrestricted and
free expression of opinion, a dead set may be made at the Chair.
The SPEAKER, or Chairman of Committees, if rendering himself,
by his interference, obnoxious to any section of the House, may
pelted with rotten eggs, bags of flour, the lighter sorts of street
refuse, and orange-peel, and, if endeavouring to protect himself with
an open umbrella, may be hooted at persistently until he be com-
pelled, in self-defence, to leave the Chair.
In any attempt to enforce the “Closure,” brickbats, stout-bottles,
and dead cats may be added to the above-mentioned missiles.
An American drinking-bar will be opened inside the House, under
the Strangers' Gallery, for the use of those Obstructionist Members
who wish to stimulate their jaded spirits on the spot, and “Chair
Tickler,” “Speaker's Nettle,” “Constitution. Smasher,” and other
appropriate beverages, will be obtainable at all hours.
Horse-whips and six-shooters will be procurable in the lobbies and
be at the disposal of all Members who wish actively to prolong any
ºy discussion commenced within the House in the progress
01 oledate.
A THEATRICAL “PROPERTY.”
UNDER the heading “Stage,” an advertisement has recently ap-
peared in the Times, announcing that the third term of a certain
“dramatic class” has commenced, and that fees paid for it will include
one of the parts (several of which are not yet filled) in the next public
performance. It is probable that this announcement reveals a revival
of the old amateur theatre system of half a century since, when any-
one could play Macbeth, Sir Peter Teazle, or Charles (his friend)
for a consideration regulated in amount by the importance of the
part º for performance. This may be, or may not be, the
case, but if the latter, there is no reason why the omission should
not beat once supplied. A little training would do no harm to our
amateur friends, who take to the Stage with as little hesitation as a
duck takes to water, but, as a rule, with a very different result.
To make our meaning plainer, we append a Table which might be
furnished to every Student on matriculation:—

AESOP IN PARLIAMENT.
(Suggested as a Development of Lord Salisbury's Fable of the Ulster
Rabbit and the Parnellite Bore Obstructor.)
No. I.--THE LION AND THE DOLPHIN.
A CoNSERVATIVE Lion, with shaggy mane and an irreproachable
tail, was roaming on the E. sea-shore, when seeing a Liberal-
Unionist Dolphin basking lazily on the surface of the water, he in-
vited him to form an alliance with him; “for,” said he, “as I am
the King of the Tory Beasts, and you are the King of the Fishy
Amphibians, we ought to be the greatest friends and allies possible.”
The Dolphin readily assented; and the Lion not long after having a
fight with an Irish Bull, called upon the Dolphin for his promised
support, which as the Bull rushed tºº. into the water, the
; was enabled to give. But when the Lion subsequently had
a contest with a strong Midlothian Tiger over an exclusively English
bone of contention, and the Dolphin found himself unable to go out
of the sea to assist, the Conservative Lion accused him of having
betrayed him. “Do not blame me,” said the Liberal-Unionist
Dolphin in reply, “but blame my Constituents, who, however much
they may approve of my helping to tackle an Irish Buil, forbid my
assisting you in Tory schemes for domestic legislation.”
Moral.-In choosing allies we must look to their power as well as
their will to help us....We must also remember that there is another
WILL, a Grand Old Will, to be considered.
The First Year of a Silken Reign, by Messrs. TUER, and FAGAN,
bé would be an interesting book at any time, and is specially so for this
Jubilee Year. The illustrations are most valuable for reference, and
the hungriest student will own that rarely has he come across such
platefuls of excellent material. Taking the pabulum served with
these plates, the work results in “a § to set before a Queen”-
and her loving subjects.
“DIsTURBED DISTRICTs.”—Neighbourhoods full of Quiet Streets
where Organ-fiends, Street-singers, and Inharmonious minstrels revel.

AN INTERVIEW WITH A SINGH-ULAR INDIVIDUAL,
(By Our Quite Abroad Contributor.)
ON receiving your instructions to follow the Doo (as DHULEEP is
familiarly º in Russia) to Moscow, I hurriedly left Folkestone at
noon by the Mary Beatrice, and after a prosperous voyage, arrived
at my destination in time for lunch. As Moscow is not so well

known as it should be in England, I venture to send you a few notes
that may enable you to form some conception of its characteristics.
It has an excellent harbour from which the luxurious steamboats of
the South-Eastern Railway can depart or arrive at any hour. This
harbour will soon be replaced by one even more commodious, per-
mitting the use of larger boats driven at a greater speed, and thus
still further reducing the time in travelling from England to Russia.
Boolongsurmerikoff (as the subjects of the Czar call Moscow) is very
lively. It has an excellent Casino where capital concerts and
theatrical representations are given twice a day, an unrivalled plage
with admirable sea-bathing and any number of pretty country
drives. The hotels are of the first quality, the Meuriceski in the
Rue Victorhugokoff being unquestionably the best of them. For the
rest Boolongsurmerikoff is filled with the cheeriest of Englishmen and
the most amiable of Muscovites.
As I drove through the Rue Victorhugokoff to the Hotel Meuriceski,
I found the street almost blocked with enthusiastic parents who were
marching, after their sons garbed as athletes. It appeared that the
athletes (lads of eighteen, or thereabouts) were going to engage in
many feats of strength, including the “boxe Anglaise,” in an adjacent
suburb, and consequently that it was necessary that they should
arade the city to the music of a band of children before starting
orth on their adventures. During the day Iran across the proces-
sion breaking out in various parts of the city.
Once established in comfortable quarters, I made inquiries, and
learned that I was likely to find the Doo in the Haute Wille, or high
town. Warned by the want of success of the Representative of the
Times, that strategy would be necessary to obtain an interview, I
assumed an appropriate disguise. I put on a long-tail coat, enor-
mous collars, gigantic boots, and singularly-patterned trousers. I
wore an unusually high hat, carried a banjo, and darkened my face
and hands to the tint of a Hottentot. The Doo, I was told, was got
up as a stage Irishman–I would visit him in the garb of a music-
hall nigger. I walked through the streets of Boolongsurmerikoff
without attracting much attention—Englishmen are accustomed
abroad to dress rather strangely—and was soon in the court-yard of
the house in which the Doo was residing. A few Indians, in the
costumes of British tourists, were lounging about. Upon seeing me,
they immediately threw off their outer garments and boots, seized
tom-toms, and began to dance and sing. The force of nature impelled
them to welcome in me not only a man but a brother.
“Golly, golly!—dat you, SAMBof " said I, in the purest Hindu-
stani. “Is de poor iddle SING in de house?”
The Indians, still beating their drums with their hands, and
jumping about as they sang a sort of dirge, nodded their heads
affirmatively, and, by their gestures, invited me to enter. Nothing
loth, I acted upon their º and found their master on the
first-floor. The swarthy and portly Doo was wearing grey stockings,
buff breeches, a tail-coat, a red waistcoat, a hat with a pipe stuck in
it, and a shillºn.
: Golly, golly!-dat you, SAMHof”. I repeated.
“Yah, yah!—dat is me, Sar !” replied the Doo, for a moment off
his guard; then, recollecting his assumed character, he continued,
. º what de ye mane P. Is it myself that ye're afther, Masther
ear
Pleased at this friendly reception, I explained to the Doo that
I had come over expressly to see him, to ascertain if he really was
in receipt of Russian gold.
“Look at that, now !” he exclaimed, with indignation that I
trust was not assumed. “Is it myself that would so demane
myself as to take the dhirty gould of the Saxon f—I mane the
Muscovite!”
‘‘I am, heartily glad to learn, this, your Highness,” I observed:
“After all the kindness you received in England, it would be a sad
return were you to number yourself amongst our enemies.”
“What are ye spaking about?” cried the Doo. “Why do ye
call me out of my name? Shure I am PAT CASEY.”
Without a moment's hesitation I struck up a plantation song on
my banjo, and began to walk round the apartment. The Doo tried
hard to restrain #. but nature once more was too many for
him. After a struggle he got up, and joined me in my quaint
romenade; and when I indulged in a wild, joyous break-down, he
ollowed my example. As he did this the Acting Edition of the
Colleen Bawn fell from his pocket, and I became aware of the source
of his Irish inspiration. -
When we were both exhausted with our energetic capers, we sat
down and rested. ... I told the Doo that disguise was no longer
possible—that I had recognised him.
“Yah! yah!, De ole niggar am found dis niggar out! Yah!
yah!” returned His Highness, smilingly, speaking his native
industani for the first time, in token of submission.
I explained that a great many injurious reports were afloat, thanks
chiefly to his own reticence in concealing his motives. He assured
me that he would have been only too tº. to have seen the Repre-
sentative of the Times, if he had only approached him in the right
manner, as I had done. He then §". to give me the fullest
information on the morrow, if I called before twelve o'clock. With
this we parted, with a second national dance, indicative of mutual
esteem and goodwill.
I had searcely returned to the street when I was seized by members
of the Third Section of the Russian Police, gagged, bound hand and
foot and sent back to England.
[It is necessary to say that, although we have every confidence in Our
Representative, his communication puzzles us. His description of Moscow
under a Russian name (which we now read for the first time) although not
altogether unfamiliar to us, does not convey a very distinct impression of the
second city of the Czar's dominions. He appears to have found the Maharajah
a specimen of the Ethiopian race rather than an Asiatic, which is contrary to
fact, as DHULEEP SINGH is not at all like a negro. The abrupt conclusion is
also confusing. It is right to add that until we received this letter, we
were under the impression that Our Representative was spending the Whit-
suntide holidays at Boulogne.—Ed.]

aiming particularly nasty blows at his former friends. The G.O.M.,

It having been reported that, spite the profession of
the Intelligence Department that they wilſ have com-

pressure on the occasion of the forthcoming Naval Re-
yiew, and that the crews of the Indian troopships will

ployed as blue-jackets, and that the officers and men of
the gunnery and torpedo schools, which will be tem-
porarily closed, will be distributed among the Fleet, it is
now announced that still further efforts will be made by
the Authorities to grapple with the necessities of the
occasion. It is rumoured that three of Her Majesty's
ironclads, for which no crews can be found, will be
manned entirely by members of the Metropolitan Police
Force, who, for the purpose of putting them thoroughly
on their sea-legs, will meantime be taken several passages
to Boulogne and back by the long sea-route. Arrange-
ments have also been entered into, by the Admiralty
Authorities with Messrs. GATTI for the loan of the prin-
cipal naval characters out of Harbour Lights, to whom,
on their joining, important posts will be atonce assigned.
It is contemplated, also, to supply the deficiency of hands
ºf. in the torpedo fleet, by calling out all the
half-pay Admirals on the Retired List, which it is cal-
culated will supply a reserved force of veterans who, if
a little new to the work, will still be found of consider-
able use in the contem iated emergency,
Leading commands have been offered to, and accepted
by, several Captains of the London Penny Steamboat
Company, and it is understood that the Stewards of the
Channel Services have volunteered in large numbers to
fill the higher officers' grades that would otherwise have
had, of necessity, to have been left vacant. Altogether
strenuous efforts are being made at head-quarters, an
it is confidently hoped that, though the crews of the
respective ships may prove to be of rather a cosmopolitan
character, yet the Fleet as a whole will, if matters pro-
gress favourably, be found to be nearly fully half
manned by the date fixed for the holding of the Review.
THE QUESTION OF THE DAY.-“Where shall I see the
Procession from?”
/* |critical, and representative
f º
land should have achieved an cº
º, lintend
A “ BIG : BEN.’”
It would be difficult to find a gloomier play, and one less worthy of the genius
of its author, than Werner, and it is therefore a great tribute to the dramatic
ability of Mr. FRANK MAR- -
SHALL, who arranged this -
version for Mr. IRVING, and
to the genius of the actor
that Werner should have
deeply interested a crowded,
JUBILEE
audience for over two hours, ſº
undeniable success. Played
as it was last Wednesday, at
a matinée, only once in the
season now rapidly drawin
to a close, for the benefit o
Dr. WESTLAND MARston,
dramatic author, the piece
was as perfectly placed on ,
the stage as if it had been
for a run of three \
hundred nights.
There is nothing in it for
Miss ELLEN TERRY, who # 3.
strengthened the cast by
taking the part of Josephine,
“the wife of Werner,” as
explained in the bills,
w º,
“f “GIRLS AND BOYS COME OUT TO-PLAY!
or - - -
this occasion only.” Miss [Mr. Irving opens his Theatre for a Jubilee performance
to the London Children.]
EMERY played Ida. Mr. - -
ALEXANDER deserved the enthusiastic approbation of the audience by his powerful
performance of Ulric, a difficult and ungracious part. It is interesting to note
the influence of the master mind on the imitative faculty, as over and over again
we see Mr. ALEXANDER unconsciously reproducing the gait, tone, and manner of
Mr. IRVING, and Miss EMERY reflecting Miss TERRY—“as in a looking-glass,”—
with a difference. No better man than Mr. WENMAN could be found for Gabor,
the rough, honest, but unlucky soldier of fortune, who spends a considerable
portion of his brief hour on the stage in wandering about dark subterranean
passages, as if he were on a sanitary ...iº. examining the London sewers,
and had taken a wrong turning by mistake. As the “’Aughty Baron,” who is
described in the playbill as “Usurping Werner’s rights,” Mr. GLENNY took
care to remind us that this was not a modern melodrama, but one of the good
old sort, of which The Castle Spectre may be taken as a type.
Mr. IRVING's Weird Werner was wonderful. It is a figure that will haunt
us whenever we venture on a hearty supper of lobster, Welsh-rabbit and Bis-
MARCK's mixture of Champagne and stout “in a moog.” As we do not often
indulge in this, the weird figure, will not haunt us much. But his performance
was a memorable one, and what was weary reading became absorbing beyond
all anticipation in action.
After the play Dr. WESTLAND MARSTON came before the curtain and in a clear
and perfectly, audible voice, made one of the most graceful, touching and un-
affected speeches we ever heard from the stage on any similar occasion. It is
a sad, thing to have to send round the hat, but it is lucky to have a hat to send
round, and still more so to possess so generous and thorough-going a friend to urge
the appeal as Mr. HENRY IRVING. The result must have been most gratifying.
--
LIGHTING UP.
SIR,--Excellent, in a measure. from an economical point of view, as is the
Duke of WESTMINSTER’s suggestion of a house-to-house “candle-in-window”
illumination, it seems to me that the effect of a general rejoicing could be just as
readily conceived at an infinitely reduced outlay. Surely the display of a night-
light over the hall-door, say, of every sixth house, jº answer all the purpose
and be, moreover, a worthy and appropriate commemoration of those Royal
domestic savings for which He fifty years of HER MAJESTY's glorious reign have
been so justly celebrated. The effect, perhaps, would not be very great, but the
expense would be confined within reasonable limits, which, even at the zenith of
a Royal Jubilee, is a matter for the consideration of
Your obedient Servant, A HALFPENNY SAVED.
SIR,-What is wanted in London on the night of the 21st is a universal blaze
everywhere; and this can only be insured by the permanent installation of the
electric light. Gigantic search-lights should be at once planted in all directions,
dynamos set up in every street, and squares, thoroughfares, and parks flooded
simultaneously with the brightness of day. To give the display its full moral
effect, the whole gas supply of the Metropolis should be entirely cut off. Thus
the Illumination would be symbolical of the material progress effected during
the fifty eventful years of HER MAJESTY's glorious reign—a circumstance that
would much gratify Yours, obediently,
A SHAREHOLDER IN FIVE “ELECTRIC” ConſPANIES.
SIR,-There is only one legitimate . of illuminating the Metropolis, and
that is obviously by gas. And this should be done regardless of cost. Every
street should be festooned with jets, and every monument and public building.

the effect, and this would be in harmony with the traditions of the Royal Jubilee. Year
growning the, glorious fifty during which the Great Gas Companies, have so luxuriantly
flourished to their own benefit and that of the public. . At least, Sir, that is the opinion of
Yours faithfully, A DIRECTOR OF THREE.
SIR,-Here is an imperial idea. Why should not the entire male population of the
Metropolis turn out on the night of the 21st inst, in illuminated hats. These could be obtained
cheaply wholesale, and might be embellished on one side with the Royal Arms, and on the
reverse with the programme of the six weeks Italian Opera Season now about to commence at
Drury Lane...Take my word for it, the effect of such a crowd would be enormous. It would
make a real big thing of the Jubilee festivities. Yours confidently,
AUGUSTU's HARRIS.
- 'SIR,--I have been thinking that no more effective, and, I should say, popular, method of
illumination could be devised for the celebration of HER MAJESTY's Jubilee, than the erection
of a series of colossal transparencies, portraying in historical picture the progress of those
eat Liberal principles the triumphant development of which are universally accepted as
its most distinguishing feature. The subject matter for these might be drawn freely from
the public career of a prominent statesman, whom I feel I need not further, indicate... I
might add that the, incidents of a recent journey to Wales would be alone sufficient to line
one side of Piccadilly, and, indeed, the material. I could supply to the artists engaged on
the work would in effect prove inexhaustible. I have the honour to be, Sir
Your obedient servant, W. E. Gladstone.
SIR,-A few tons of dynamite judiciously distributed between Westminster Abbey, the
Houses of Parliament, the various Government Offices, and Public Buildings, and fired
simultaneously by electricity from College Green, would probably recommend itself as the
most, popular way of celebrating the Jubilee to those who take any interest, in the movement
on this side of the Irish Channel. However, I don't suppose the idea will be adopted; but
I merely throw it out for what it is worth. Yours nationally, A DUBLIN Boy.
SIR,-Any proposal to illuminate London will be incomplete without the ascent of a fire-
balloon. Why should not several ascend from the Royal Exchange at midnight, and take up,
in turns, the LoRD MAYOR and several of the leading Aldermen P. The effect, as an apotheosis,
would be striking, and it would not matter where they came down. Such, I am sure, would
be the judgment of those who, like your Correspondent, are able to subscribe themselves as
members of THE MUNICIPAL REFORM LEAGUE.
SIR,-Bonfires will be wanted on the
Twenty-First, and what more appropriate
sites could be found than those occupied by
the London Statues? Let these then be
tarred and feathered forthwith, surrounded
by pitch, and fagots, and kindled, on the
evening in question at a given signal. I can
conceive no blaze more symbolic of the
progress of HER MAJESTY's reign than that
which would hand over to destruction the
hideous effigies that have so long defaced it.
I am, Sir, yours, &c., LoNGA.
SIR,--Do you want a general illumina-
tion? On the evening of the 21st, after
dark, give every house-front, cab, omnibus,
policeman, and pedestrian in the Metropolis
a thorough good coat of luminous paint.
Then turn out the gas—and there you are.
Yours thoughtfully, CoLNEY HATCH.

“OPERA OMNIA.”
Though Dinorah at Covent Garden is so associated with the name
of PATTI as to make it odds against anyone else being accepted in the
art, no matter how charming
er appearance or perfect her
vocalisation, yet Miss ELLA
RussFLL did undoubtedly score
a distinct success as Dinorah
last week—a success which, con-
sidering the difficulties to be
contended with, amounted to a
triumph. We trembled for the
Shadow Scene, for PATTI was
the Shadow, and ELLA RUSSELL
is the Substance; and though
the acting was no great shakes,
i. the singing was, and her
t, note, far away, up in the
air (the air she was singing, of
course), took us, and everybody
else, by surprise, and after an
enthusiastic encore, which could
have been trebled, we found
ourselves wisely preferring the
present substance to the absent
shadow. After all, this is only
a question of figure; and if
PATTI's figure is four hundred a
night, no Management can stand

it... Signor STAGI, as the comic Cosentino, was rather Singer Stagey
in his humour: DANDRADE was an excellent Hoel, Madame ScAIGHT
was the Goatherd, “with song,” and the quartette of prayerful
peasants was one of the hits of the evening.
What a boy Madame SCALCHI is! . When Signor LAgo engaged
her as his contralto, he was not out in his ScAECHI-lation. To see
her as Maffeo Orsini, the gay i. mashing and impetuous page in
Lucrezia Borgia, and above all to hear her, is a real treat. Strange
that our old friend, Lucrezia Borgia should attract a bigger house
than Dinorah, but so it was, as anyone conversant .# Covent

once on entering the Theatre, -
and beholding the radiant ap- | º,

occasion looked like one of the º
“Halls of dazzling delight,”
with an orchid (Chamberlainia
Unionensis) in his button-hole
and an extra chair in his hand —
which he was ordering to be
taken immediately into the stalls
where there was no more room.
It was a fine performance. Madame CEPEDA was the wicked
Lucrezia, and GAY AREſ with an extra song, charmingly given and
yociferously encored—(did it matter what it was about being sung in
Italian and unintelligible to a majority, so º; as the audience were
happy?)—was the hero who is so unhospitably treated by the bad
uke, whose representative on this occasion, Signor LoRRAIN,
was worse than the Duke was ever intended to be. Yet there was
something artistically suggestive of a quivering of conscience in the
perpetual tremor of his voice (an effect that can be also artificially
produced by beating your breast penitentially while you are singing);
and when in his lowest, notes, so typical of the basest motives, he
was occasionally out of tune, why was this but to subtly remind us
: his conduct was not in harmony with all that was good and
e?

Saturday, at Covent Garden.—A magnificent perfºrmance of
Lucia di Lammermoor. ...Quite “old times revived”—for they are
playing a rival Lucia at Her Majesty's, and people are already taking
sides with Signor LAgo or Colonel MAPLEson, as in the historic days
when JENNY was at Her Majesty's and MARIO and GRISI at
Covent Garden. Nothing like competition. Signor Augustus

Miss Towers. “AND Do You succeRD !”
ALBANI was never in better voice than to-night as Lucia; GAYARRſ:
surpassed himself, Signor DevoyoD was an excellent Enrico (looking
rather like Professor HERKoMER), and Signor BELTRAMo as the bass,
but sympathetic, Raimondo, completed a first-rate cast. Signor
CoRSI did as much with the unhappy and much-snubbed Bridegroom
Arturo as could be expected of anyone under such trying circum-
stances, and the old nobility of Scotland, kindly, but somewhat prim
in their manners, came out effectively in the chorus which chimes in
with the septette in the Second Act, and keeping their eye on Signor
BEVIGNANI's beat—this is to speak of the Conductor as if he were a
policeman—assisted in winning an enthusiastic encore. A great
success, difficult to equal, much more to beat. Now let us hear what
our Other Chap has to say of Lucia in the Haymarket. . .
At Her Majesty's.-The Other Chap says Lucia was being played
while Another Fellow was at Covent Garden. The house was not
unpleasantly crowded—the orchestra was quite full, but there were
several vacant places elsewhere. The performance was interesting.
Signor DE ANNA as Ashton scored a success, both as a singer and an
actor. He has a powerful voice well under control, and a fund-of
quiet humour that should be useful to him in #. parts. His
calm contempt for the miserable guests (apparently poor relations)
he has invited to his sister's wedding was most amusing. The great
feature of the occasion (barring my own presence in the theatre) was
the débùt of Mlle. JENNY BRoch, who created a favourable impression
by her well-intentioned execution of the very trying passages of the
Mad Scene. The chief fault of this young lady's acting was her
F. to express extreme º, by suddenly falling flat on
or back; but this embarrassing habit found ample compensation in
}. musical athletics—the “vocal fireworks” were quite worthy of
ROCK.

IN STATU QUO.
A MEETING of the London Statues was
held at midnight (the exact date of which
has not yet transpired) to consider the
best mode of celebrating HER MAJESTY's
Jubilee. The Duke of WELLINGTON (late
of Hyde Park Corner), who came up spe-
cially from Aldershott to be present on
the occasion, presided.
The CHAIRMAN said that he felt very
much flattered at being asked to take the
Chair, or, rather, to retain his seat on his
horse-(laughter)—at so interesting a
gathering. No doubt it was considered
by many he saw before him that he, who =
did not claim kindred with the QUEEN, º s
was better fitted to preside than those * s
who were bound to her by ties of relation- % s

begged to remind them that he had the %%
honour of being the godfather of H.R.H. %
Lieutenant-General the Duke of CoN- %

A Statue who said he was the Duke

somewhere in the neighbourhood of the
Royal Exchange, here created a disturb-
ance by claiming to be the “real London
Hero of Waterloo.” By order of the
Chairman, the person, who wore a very
eccentric costume, was promptly re-

some applause, and said that he had

that his hat required a thorough renova-

into further details concerning the con-

piteously that he cut a very ridiculous

The matter had been thoroughly threshe

although he was a favourable specimen
of a statue (“IIear, hear !” and “No,

universally admitted that, as a whole,
they disgraced the Metropolis. (Cheers.)
He would suggest that they should all
be removed to . Westminster, Abbey,
where they would have the advantage
of witnessing the ceremony. (“Bear,

It was objected that there would not
be room, and, after a suggestion (from
CHARLEs THE FIRST, who quoted a pre-
cedent) that they should all be buried, it
was agreed that it would be better to
remove themen bloc from London to some
unfrequented part of the country, in
honour of HER MAJESTY's Jubilee. It
was asserted that this plan would be re-

most lively satisfaction.

MR. GREENHORN’S EXPERIENCES.
IT ought to be very consolatory, and even highly gratifying to me,
to learn what a very large number of friends I have in our grand ol
City. But it somehow scarcely seems to have that effect. I am
utterly unacquainted with them, never having seen their several
names previously, and yet they favour me with minute details, not
of mere probabilities but of absolute certainties of making a large
fortune by the investment of a comparatively very small sum.
I received last week five of such generous offers, rather more than
my weekly average. The very lowest return for my suggested in-
vestment was 17 per cent. per annum, but that was spoken of in a
rather depressed tone as if 17 per cent. was scarcely worthy of my
attention in comparison with so many others that were probably
being offered to me. - - - - ---
And my unknown friend was perfectly right in his supposition.
What is 17 per cent. per annum compared to the offer of a few shares
in a gold mine, of such almost incredible richness, that the gold was
shining in the surrounding rocks in such abundance, that the
Directors were only waiting for the means for purchasing the neces-
sarily rather expensive plant, to make every shareholder “rich
beyond the dreams of avarice,” which means, according to the illus-
trious SAMUEL JoHNson, rich as a Brewer—and how rich that is we
learned the other day from Sir SoMEBODY GUINNESS. The one matter
that prevented me immediately rushing into this realised El Dorado,
was the trifling circumstance that it was situate in the very utter-
most §. of the earth, and my stupid Atlas utterly failed to
describe its locality. -
I have a few friends on the Stock Exchange, and on talking these
several matters over with them, I find my statements invariably
produce the same results. They first laugh quietly at what they
call my charming simplicity, and then strongly recommended me
not to mention generally what I thought was the complimentary
manner in which I seemed to be selected by my unknown friends,
lest it should be thought to be a sign that my knowledge upon these
particular matters was not quite so great as it doubtless is upon all
others. This may of course be mere jealousy, but it has had the

seers were no more to be looked for than swallows in such weather.
But with the West wind Megs Terrace began to furbish itself up, and
look more hopefully at that bait of “Apartments” with which its
windows were so plentifully bespattered. Surely this would lure the
feminine population from the provinces with minds much exercised
on the subject of Spring fashions; and when it became a question of
shopping, Megs Terrace flattered itself it was “all there,” and within
a stone's-throw of all the noted emporiums of the West End.
Megs Terrace is regarded by its inhabitants as the very eye of the
Metropolis, the very centre of the fashionable world. If you may
believe Mrs. SKINNER, its locality is exceptionally favoured in the
matter of provisions. A remark on your part that a wild duck is an
uncertain bird, apt to be fishy, is immediately met by the rejoinder,
“We never has 'em fishy in Megs Terrace.” It º. also, that
in the case of butcher's meat and poultry this dingy-looking paradise
is similarly favoured. “We never has anything but the best joints
in Megs Terrace,” reiterates Mrs. SKINNER with stony inflexible face
that declines to discuss such a subject. When what she denominates
a chicken fricassee arrives, your want of belief in the poultry of the
neighbourhood is confirmed, mingled with the conviction that some-
body dined upon that fowl before it was hashed up for you. Mrs.
SKINNER has a way of brushing away all complaint or argument
by simple assertion. When Mrs. SKINNER has once stated a thing,
it is hopeless to suppose that the most glaring proofs of her being in
the wrong would make the slightest difference in her opinion. She's
more autocratic than King THEBAw in the plenitude of his power;
and the “Perhaps you would suit yourself elsewhere” with which
she * the conference, is a ukase from which there is no
appeal.
rs. SKINNER is a woman who has let lodgings to some purpose—
a hard woman, who has studied the subject and solved the extreme
possibilities of indirect taxation. She has got a nice little bit of
money laid by, and could retire from her vocation to-morrow if she
chose, but she knows that she would weary of doing nothing. With-
out lodgers to plunder and browbeat, Mrs. SKINNER j find life
tedious. She has her weaknesses, but never permits them to inter-
fere with her business, any reference to which invariably calls up
the stony stare. The first is her personal appearance. Ší. dresses
on high days and holidays in the most expensive fashion, not garishly
but richly, and cherishes the belief that she is still a most attractive
woman, and might speedily have her finger ringed if she could make
up her mind to part with her independence. She is probably right
upon this point, as there are plenty of idle men of her class who
would ask no better than to so anchor themselves for life; but Mrs.
SKINNER is not going to have her hard-earned money seattered in
that wise. . As for the defunct SKINNER, he is the most shadowy of
shades, and the general impression is, that after some years of spin-
sterhood the good lady thought it advisable to assume brevet rank.
Her second weakness is for a little something hot and strong in the
evening, and under its influence she is wont to relax, and, with a
little encouragement, recount to a sympathetic listener the rôle of
her conquests. In an unguarded moment, she, upon one of these
occasions, divulged some of the secrets of her calling, and rather
opened the eyes of her lodger,
“Yes, potatoes, Ma'am, I always send them up potatoes, whether
they want ’em or not. You see I buy them by the sack, and sell
'em top price, by the pound.”
º. something hot and strong must have been wrongly esti-
mated in regard to strength or quantity that evening, for Mrs.
SKINNER went into further revelations that made that lodger's flesh
creep. As to how she fed the second floor upon the débris of the
first floor's dinner, and those second-floorers, poor innocents, wondered
how it was that their dinner was always half an hour late.
“Thank you, my dear,” continued Mrs. SKINNER, increasing in
familiarity, and stealing her hand out towards the whiskey decanter;
“it’s a hard life, but there are pickings to be had; and it’s not a
bad profession when you understand it.”
To do her justice, it was rarely Mrs. SKINNER was overtaken in
this fashion; but that lodger remembered she, too, was “a second-
floorer,” that her dinners had been unaccountably late, and beat a
hasty retreat from Meg's Terrace.
But Mrs. SKINNER is high of heart about the profits that will be
made over this Jubilee Year. Like all her class, she is impressed
with the idea that the rush to celebrate the fiftieth year of Her
MAJESTY's reign from all parts of the world will resemble that to
the gold-fields some quarter of a century ago, and that the providers
of food and lodging will be paid in similar royal fashion. Keeping
a grocery store in those days was as good in Australia or California
as having hit off a most successful “claim.” Poor Mrs. SKINN
she works hard, and grinds persistently, at her mill both late an
early; and if she increases her store by, a little peculation, are
there not many others, who are getting their living by doing the
same on a grander scale, and who live and die much respected?

MR. PUNCH*S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.
Young Amateur Reciter, pardon the apparent abruptness of the question-
but have you ever loved and been rejected? Because, if you have not, the
following Poem is beyond your scope. It is dedicated
exclusively to the Blighted, for it deals with a tragic
misunderstanding between two fond young hearts,
which to some will doubtless appear trivial enough-
although Mr. Punch has read many a novelin which
two lives were shipwrecked upon a rock far less
substantial. Yes, there is genuine tragedy in the
subject, which can only be properly developed by
that insight which comes from bitter experience.
Most young Male Reciters are persuaded that it
has been peculiarl f: to them to represent the
varying phases of feminine emotion in a pleasing
and dramatic manner. Far be it from Mr. Punch,
ſ' or his Poet, togainsay their possession of this talent,

shade carried *{ lady of ordinary height are just about the level of
a gentleman's hat or eyes,” could not a law be passed to compel
damsels with parasols to walk on stilts? -
If carriages may be said to obey the rule of the road, ladies in
summer-time certainly #. the rule of the pavement.
RED SHIRT says:– “If I had only had a modern sunshade with me
in the Far West, Ishould have been able to do a great deal more scap-
ing than I ever actually accomplished, and in about half the time.”
i. the jºkes of a fashionable parasol be properly described as a
new kind of “facing points”?

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

THE DLARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Bouse of Commons, Monday, June 6th. – House of Commons
k again, after Whitsun recess. Lords defer their coming. In
meantime British Constitution must try to drag along without
them. Effort to-night rather melancholy. Benches nearly empty.
GLADSTONE “still in Wales' belly,” as CAVENDISH BENTINck (who is
here) says; “and precious glad it’ll be to get rid of him,” he adds,
rumpling his hair wrong way. HARTINGTON strolled in at question-
time, but presently decamped. CHAMBERLAIN didn't lookin at all.
These deficiencies made up by presence of HARcourt, who spread
himself over seat of Leader of Opposition, and smiled in patronising
manner on the Mace.
Fuller gathering on Treasury Bench. SMITH in familiar attitude,
with hands on knees, ready to “pounce.” To him enter AKERs-
Douglas, who has been counting noses in House and ante-rooms.
“Can't muster more than a hundred,” he reported. “No chance
of pouncing to-night.” Old Morality sat back disappointed.
Temper evidently ruffled. Snapped at BRADLAUGH when he wanted
to know about Burmah Ruby Mines, and sgowled on Dixon HART-
LAND when he asked for facilities to proceed with his Bill for Regu-
lation of Theatres. Only six questions on paper, after which, House
resolved itself into Committee of Supply, and pounded away on
Civil Service Estimates till Two o’Clock in the morning.
Business done.—Wotes in Supply.
Tuesday.—Coercion Bill on to-night, but not even its powerful at-
traction sufficient to draw House. GLADSTONE, on his way home from
Wales, made a speech hundreds of miles long—all the way from
Cardiff to Paddington. Occasional application of Clöture on the part
of Guard in charge of train. CHAMBERLAIN looked inforfew minutes.
Very little here now. Less even than HARTINGTON. SMITH at the
opening of sitting vaguely hinted at pending Closure. “I am not in
a position to do it at this moment,” he plaintively remarked, lookin
round at his suppºrters, who did not number a hundred. “But wi

Soon as House got into Committee of Supply, BALFouB wanted to

on accordingly.

Wednesday.—GLADSTONE back in House to-day. In high spirits;

all surprised to find him some night sitting at the Bar in Bardic
costume with harp, singing the dirge of the Government.
Business done.--Coercion Bill.
Thursday.—Red letter night for TIM. Began early with accusing
ARTHUR BALFour of making a statement which was “a mere
quibble.” No doubt of accuracy of description; but SPEAKER
objected to phrase adopted. In conversation which followed, TIM
ro to cross-examine SPEAKER. Did he, he wanted to know,
rule, that the word “quibble” was unparliamentary.” SPEAKER
wouldn't commit himself and finally having gained his point, TIM
consented to withdraw. - -
“‘Our allies are at least gentlemen,” said HARcoURT, glancing at
CHAMBERLAIN's empty seat. “But gentlemen don't usually answer
8. Plain question by a paltry quibble.”
“I beg your pardon P’’ asked BALFour across the table.
* Oh, nothing!” said HARcouBT. . - -

Business done.—Urgency Rule passed.
“AN OLD-FASHIONED BOY.”
TESTY old gentlemen are rather fond of informing us that “there
are no boys now, Sir!” and these laudatores temporis acti wi
#. to hear that a boy of the good old sort seems to have been
covered at Dartford lately. The Superintendent of Police stated
for the information of the Bench that a certain DAVID Col.I.INs, who
was charged before them with stealing “a quantity of wheat,” was
“an old-fashioned boy.” Master CoELINs had been awarded a
season of hard labour (it's too apt to be nothing but play with your
modern boy!) a few years ago for the same offence, when the young
gentleman stated that he was thirteen, and turned out to be “nearly
thirty.” When being charged and searched on the Fº occasion,
“six or eight live mice sprang out from the inside of his shirt,”
says the Daily Telegraph, sympathetically, “much to the consterna-
tion of the police officers.” Any old gentleman who would like to
adopt this nice little boy, and the six or eight live mice, (which of
course are all old-fashioned too) is hereby informed that “Master
DAVID,” will be at liberty to entertain proposals for adoption (Millers
where no cats are kept preferred 1 ) at the end of a period of twenty-
one days, during which he will be unavoidably detained by an engage-
ment of a pressing nature. The chance may not occur again!
SOMETHING MORE LIKE IT.
SIR,-I have read with consternation that HER MAJESTY intends,
on the occasion of her Royal Progress to the Abbey on the 21st, to
proceed merely in “semi-state.” Now this must not be. The idea
is preposterous. Why, Sir, I have just paid fifteen, guineas for a
third-floor window in Regent Street, and I should like to know, if
the QUEEN is going to wear an ordinary bonnet, and the whole pro-
cession isº to consist of a dozen carriages of notables in mere
morning dress, just following, one another, what I am going to get
for my money? However, it is not too late to set matters right... I
subjoin below a sketch of what the Procession ought to be, and the
sooner the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN, or whoever, it is who has to see to
the matter, takes it in hand the better it will be for the sight-seeing
public. Here it is:—
PROGRAMMIE OF PROCESSION.
(Amended to suit the Popular Taste.)
THE LORD MAYoR, ALDERMEN, AND CITY OFFICIALs MoUNTED
- ON BUCK-JUMPERS,
(Specially hired from Burº BILL's Wild West Show,) to clear
the way.
.., ONE OF THE LONDON Rºčº CoMPANY's OMNIBUSES, -
Filled inside and out with Archbishops and Bishops of the Church of
England in Full Canonicals.
THE LORD CHANCELLOR,
On the Woolsack, carried by Four Officials of the Upper House.
EIGHTY-SIX IRISH MEMBERs of THE House of CoMMONs,
Dressed in National Costume, dancing a jig as they proceed.
Two FoREIGN KINGs,
In full Gala Coronation Dress, walking abreast.
THE PROPRIETOR of THE BUCKINGHAM PALACE HOTEL,
On Horseback.
FIVE Fouh-WHEELED CABS -
(Handsomely É. with Dutch metal), containing Continental
yalties in brand-new uniforms.
THE SPEAKER IN HIS CHAIR,
On a Brewers'-dray festooned with Roses, drawn by Clerks of the
House in harness.
THE ENTIRE House of PEERs, -
In their Robes and Coronets, dancing backwards, and scattering
flowers as they retire.
HER_Most GRAClous MAJESTY
- THE QUEEN,
Attired in her Coronation Robes and wearing the Imperial Crown,
seated on her Throne in the centre of a colossal Car on a Revolving
Twelfth Cake, surrounded by appropriate Court characters.
INDIAN MAHARAJAHS
(In a Pleasure-Wan), arrayed in their best Jewels, and personally
conducted by Sir LEPEL GRIFFIN.
THE ENTIRE CollecTION of MADAME TUSSAUD's WAx MoDELs,
Arranged in groups on the tops of a series of tastefully decorated
Furniture-vans, containing insiderespectively the Bands of the three
rival Italian Opera Companies, the Life Guards, Marines, and Royal
Artillery.
- THE POET LAUREATE, -
Clad in Bardic Costume, singing his, Jubilee Ode, and accompanying
elf on a harp on the top of the “Dead-wood Coach,” the interior
of which will be occupied by distinguished Literary and Artistic
Celebrities, Musicians, Dramatic Authors, Actors, Dentists, and
leading Members of all the Learned Professions.
THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY,
In full Court Dress, riding in various attitudes on one of the new
101-ton Guns, and forming an Allegorical Tableau.
CHAIRMEN OF GAs AND INSURANCE CoMPANIEs
Decked out in suits of Tower armour, mounted on omnibus horses.
BUFFALO BILL.
Now, Sir, the above scheme may be capable of improvement, but
I maintain that if something simple of the sort is set on foot on these
lines there will be a comprehensive show at least somewhat worthy
of the occasion. If, on the other hand, the Authorities stick to their
meagre º and go in for this “semi-State” business, I
will undertake to say there will not be a single, member of that
extensive body, the sight-seeing British public, who won't be pre-
pared to subscribe himself, like -

PREPARING FOR THE JUBILEE,
Leo Britannicus loquitur : —
YEs, of course it's a bit of a bother,
And puts one a trifle about,
All this Jubilee pageant and pother,
This huge anniversary rout; -
But then there's a something that we owe
To impulses born of the heart,
And even a work-burdened Leo
Must dress for the part.
So I put my best tail-coat and tie on,
And brush-up my bellicose mane,
The ºil. says the old Lion
Wears well, which I hope isn't vain,
I’ve had but few holidays lately,
'Tis long since I went for a frisk;
I’ve been learning to trot most sedately,
For once I’ll be brisk.
I suppose in the light of pure reason
It’s all just a trifle absurd,
But to-day that reflection were treason,
Its utterer would not be heard.
KANT is all very well in his way, Ma'am,
But sense out of place sounds like cant ;
Few will listen to logic to-day, Ma'am.
I'm certain I shan't,
Yes; I do look a bit like a poodle,
Rigged out and brushed up in this style.
Prigs and pedants will call me “old noodle,”
That's certain, at which I shall smile.
In spite of my Jingoes abusive,
The sagest of leonine laws
Is—don't make too cheap or intrusive
Your teeth or your claws.
|Mine at present are trimmed down as neatly
| _As those of the Lion in love.
| Yet the idiots err most completely
ho deem me a mere sucking-dove.
To prove that to each self-deceiver
ere rather too much of a bore;
But—it's only fool Bottom the Weaver
Who's always all roar.
No, the Lion's part, just for to-day, Ma'am,
Ís simply to play and to purr.
BRITTANNIA, come, what do you say, Ma'am P
Öf course I’m aware you prefer
My mane freely tossing and flºwing;
y caput not topped º: “tile;”
But you do not imagine I’m goin
To stick to this style.
|'Tis only a gala-day get-up,
I've fº of stern business on hand.
My leonine back is not yet up;
But—ah! Ma'am, you quite understand.
There are things to set straight at St. Ste-
My Army, my Fleet, and my Laws [phen's,
Seem rather at sixes and sevens.
Well—'ware Leo's claws!
But to-day I'm not stern, nay, nor thrifty.
My motto is, “Oh! what a larks!”
They come only one year in fifty
These scenes in our streets and our parks.
One ºf though, my bosom to ire works,—
The job seems imperfectly done.
Why could not the people have fireworks
To finish the fun?
There’s a dash of the dowdy and dingy
About Metropolitan plans;
Even poor GEORGETHE THIRD was less stingy.
Roast oxen and loud rataplans
May not be entirely in keeping
With these high aesthetical times,
But rocket-rains whirling and weeping
Are surely not crimes.
However, dear Madam, I’m ready
To frisk with the rest of the crowd.
Only hope that old Sol will keep steady,
And not lap the land in a shroud.
In June in the Jubilee Year, Ma'am,
E'en town should look sunny and green,
And then what a shout we shall hear, Ma'am,
Of “God save the QUEEN | | | *

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH*S STUDIO.
No. XXVIII.-SIR BARNABAs BUTLER,
SIR BARNABAs BUTLER is the greatest citizen we have. He is
ahead of all the other citizens by twentº churches, 180 public-
Lºs O
uses, two hospitals, and a
museum. No other citizen
has built more than three or
four churches, or owns more
than twenty public-houses,
no other citizen has ever
built a museum. No other
citizen has encouraged vice,
or art, or religion, to half
the extent of Sir BARNABAs.
His statue stands in the
market-place, where he is
represented mounted on a
handsome coal-black
charger, which has been
endeavouring to throw him
off for the last five years,
and cannot manage it. It
is opposite Queen VICTORIA
in bronze, and only a few
WELLINGTON, on a. simple
six foot pedestal. Sir BAR-
NABAs subscribed largely to
the erection of his statue,
and he has his reward, for
it really leaves the other
statues far behind.
I have just been to see Sir
- - last church—the fiftieth.
He is yery.frequently laying foundation-stones.
He has fºrty-nine silver-trowels up at the Hall already, and this
will make fifty. . There is a huge sideboard charged with minor tro-
hiesin his drawing-room, with a full-length portrait of himselfinoils
hung above it. There are the forty-nine trowels in a row; there are
invaluable keepsakes, and mementos, from numbers of Dukes and
Marquises; there are testimonials and written addresses from all the
colleges, and museums, and churches, and hospitals, even from half
the chapels in the neighbourhood. and very many others. He takes
them down and reads them on a Sunday afternoon in an arm-chair,
under the great stained window, (it is a huge piece, representing
St. Martin sharing his cloak with the beggar) with coloured lightfall:
ing on the blue and gold colours of the illuminated addresses. New
ones are always coming in ; the last was from the Society for the
". of Confirmed Inebriates, to which he had subscribed #ji.
ere, is also a ledger bound in red morocco, with a list of the
subscriptions he has given to various charitable objects—their name
is legion. He will have it buried with him, it is popularly supposed.
. He is a remarkable man, with a curious magnetic influence about
him, and an inscrutable bland face. When he opens his lips at a
public meeting, a vibration seems to pass through the assembly, and
they watch him as if physically constrained to note his every action.
He stirred me like the Mephistopheles in BERLIoz's Faust, with
Amingled fascination and repugnance. His tone is essentially false,
but resonant and piercing with a peculiar swaying cadence that
compels attention. When he rose, to-day, which i. did with a
certain unction, everyone of the audience knew that he had risen.
That was after the Bishop's speech. The Bishop, by the way, had
referred very prettily to the fact of its being Sir BARNARAS's #.
foundation-stone... He said it was his dearesthope that if the Church
prospered in the City, as under the auspices of Sir BARNABAs it was
almost certain to .do, he might, live to see Sir BARNABAs lay a
hundredth foundation-stone. "If not,” continued the Bishop, rising
to enthusiasm, “the hundred and fiftieth.”
Sir, BARNABAs heaved a sigh before he began to speak—it was a
yards from the Duke of |d
others take up the instrument his modesty has refused to handle.
And, Sir, when yesterday I passed yonder image in the market-place,
the noble expression of a too partial appreciation of my poor efforts for
humanity—then I am not ashamed to confessit, the tears sprang to
: eyes.” . He released the Bishop from his gaze. The Bishºp;
relieved, but disconcerted could only murmur, “Reflects great credit.’
“The tears,” repeated Sir BARNARAs, more slowly and impressively,
“sprang to my eyes. It was not the beauty of the marble, Sir, it
was not the grandeur of those sculptured lineaments. No, it was
the knowledge that the hearts of the le had dictated that
majestic offering; I felt that I had a place in the hearts of the people,
that I would exchange for no palatial mansion, Sir, for no palatial
mansion.” Vigorous applause, during which Sir BARNABAS gathered
himself together for a fresh flight of rhetoric.
“I consider myself a Steward,” he resumed, “merely a Steward.
Riches take wing and fly away. Ah! But a faithful stewardship,
will never take wing. Services rendered to Art, to Science, to
Philanthropy, to Culture, to Religion—these will never fly away.
A place in the heart of the people, this, Sir, is my aspiration. This
is, I may say, my prayer. Let my wealth perish. Let those marble
features crumble—but let my image remainstamped on the memories
of our citizens, in characters more enduring than can be graven by
the sculptor's chisel. I ask no more.”
Amid vigorous applause, Sir BARNABAs proceeded to lay the
foundation-stone. did not stay to witness the conclusion, pre-
ferring rather to walk home by some of the slums of the city, and
eepen my strong conviction of the tremendous extent to which
humanity found itself indebted to Sir BARNABAs.
JUBILEE JOTTINGS.
SIR,-If it is not too late, I must utter a protest against the route
chosen for the Jubilee Procession which seems calculated merely to
satisfy the classes in the Clubs. I woulda!. that the route
should be as follows:–From Buckingham Palace down the Bucking-
ham Palace Road, Sloane Square, King's Road, Walham Green,
Fulham Palace Road, Hammersmith, Broadway, and thence into the
Lavender Terrace, Chiswick, in which I have a window and which
ends in a cul de sac, The procession might then get to the Abbey by
Kensington, Knightsbridge, &c., but that is a matter of detail.
Lavender Terrace, Chiswick. Yours faithfully, JUSTICE.
SIR,-As there is to be no firework ºy on the occasion of the
celebration of HER MAJESTY's Jubilee, may I be permitted to suggest
an excellent, substitute. I can scarcely imagine anything more
appropriate than a fire-balloon. If they were, dispatched by hun-
dreds and thousands the effect would be magnificent. Fire-balloons
are not expensive—I myself can supply an excellent article at one-
and-sixpence. ours º
Toy Warehouse. onTGoLFIER, JUNIOR.
SIR,-At the Review at Aldershott there is one branch of the Land
Forces of HER MAJESTY that will not be represented at all except by
its individual members... I allude to that fine body of men, the

DEAR MR. PUNCH,
- YoUR interest in all that is good in literature
is as strong as your encouragement to latent talent is
judicious. This consideration must be my excuse for
troubling you about my literary efforts... I have deter-
mined to reform the modern Stage by reviving the Shak-
spearian Drama. This is not to be effected by writing
five-act tragedies on historical subjects, whose interest,
for cultured people, has evaporated about the time that
they have finished their education; and for the masses is
non-existent. It is to be done only by applying the
Shakspearian method to subjects y present interest.
Our ordin nineteenth-century affairs - newspaper
reports, or what not—treated with the genius of SHAK-
flºanº, would produce distinctly Shakspearian results.
This, then, Sir, is what I have determined to accomplish.
My first attempt is a tragedy, called. The Lodger. I send
herewith an extract from the great scene in the Fourth
Act, where the Poet, who has found his lodgings incom:
patible with his culture, is haled before the Doge. Will
you º me your candid opinion, and suggest the best
plan for getting the play acted? RodeRICK TWEDDLE.
The Poet is here giving an account of his incompatible
lodgings:—
Poet. Beneath a shade of glass was posed a Thing
A dreadful Thing of feathers; the stuff'd sou
Of a lost Parrot; grey, with varnish’d beak,
A varnish’d horror, on a grey despair.
One eye, rebellious to the dry, shrunk frame,
Follow'd with glassy dread intelligence
All movements and all looks. The other eye
Took yet more awful heed of the still room,
Where in the mirror every action liv'd
Without the life of sound. The mirror's edge
Was swathed in yellow gauze—amorphous folds--
That might have eddied on the leathern limbs
Of nautching mummies. Two glass candlesticks,
With tinkling ringlets, flank'd the mouldering bird;
And shells, that breathed not of the sea, but kept
Some smack of fish defunct, the shelf adorn'd.
Two cups, whose claim to beauty was the crack
That made them poor for use; two vases blotched
By the coarse hand of vile machinery—
For each a woollen mat, a parasite
That stuck and clung, and on the easy chairs
Unstable housings; on the table round
Long folds of staring cloth, that caught the knees,
And hung about, and slid whene'er you moved—
And mats where there was never need of mats,
And maple-framed engravings of the QUEEN,
Of the Last Judgment, and the Plains of Heaven,
The Exhibition ºf Éighteen-Fifty-one
Clifton Suspension Bridge, the Death of Wesley,
And of a blunt-nosed Woodman's flat return.
The Baresark mood came on me. Right and left
I hack'd and cleft. Th' affrighted landlady,
Coming, suburban trim, all householder,
I slew upon her splinter'd furniture,
and fled with lightened heart!

SOME STILL WILDER REMINISCENCES.
(By a Modest Autobiographer.)
You have asked me if I cannot add to that history of marvellous, superhuman,
and heroic exploit which characterises the whole stretch and sweep of my Trans-
atlantic career, some startling incidents that have accompanied my rapid and
decisive rise and progress in public favour since I have set foot in this country.
Yes, I certainly could do this, and in a way fairly to astonish you, were it not
for that lack of leisure which a continual flow of invitations to the mansions of
the nobility and the aristocracy of this Metropolis forces upon me. I do not refer
to this in any boastful spirit. That they should pay their homage to my world-
famed courage and †. and wish to have my intensely picturesque
figure, as represented on the advertising coloured posters, prominently adorning,
as a central figure, their gilded saloons, is only natural, and I merely state the
bare fact without comment. But such is the pressure brought to bear on my
spare moments by Dukes. Earls, Marquises, and other members of the Hereditary
Peerage of the Three Kingdoms, that I have not, as you may, possibly have
noted, yet been able to find time even to have my hair properly cut ! This,
however, by the way... But to proceed in some sense to answer, your question.
To attempt to detail the remarkable adventures, the hair-breadth escapes, and
the combats to the death in which I have been º: even since my arrival in
this i.7 with my troupe at Earl's Court, would far exceed both the time at
my disposal and the space accorded me in your columns, I will therefore content
myself with referring to a few incidents connected with my display of personal
prowess and undaunted pluck in the immediate neighbourhood of the “ Show”
itself. My single-handed encounter with one of the West Kensington omnibuses
on the afternoon of the first of April may not be new to your readers, but it will
bear repeating.
Seeing the vehicle approaching, and wishing to proceed to my destination on
its roof, I straightway hailed it, but was met with the laconic reply of the
conductor that it was “full inside and out.” I was walking with the Chairman
Of the Concern, and asked him whether I should make a dash for a place. He
gave his consent, and in another instant, like a mighty tornado, I flung myself
upon the horses' heads, they reared up in the air, came down on their haunches,
and I cut the traces. In another minute the passengers had dismounted and the
driver leaving his box faced me in the road.
“I know you, BUFFALO BILL,” he said, “if you want to fight, well, come on!”
I had nothing but an umbrella and he a horsewhip, but without a moment's
hesitation, I accepted his challenge, and went for him. For some short time
we danced round each other, but at last I hit him over the head and he fell.
At the same moment my legs got entangled in the thong of the whip and I
stumbled to my knees, . Then we closed and rolled over together from pavement
o pavement a couple of policemen looking on, but in no way interfering in the
xontest. We got disengaged for a moment, then I saw my opportunity, and,
getting out my ready knife, ran up to him and scientifically scalped him in
something under five-and-twenty minutes. The whole episode occupied but two
hours and a half. As the Chairman who had been watching the duel from a
neighbouring door-step, came up, I swung the Omnibus driver's º:
in the air and shouted at my loudest, “The first scalp for the Boss of the Big
Show!” And thus Irelieved the General Omnibus Company of the services
yf an uncivil servant.
But the rash driver was by no means the only individual who owed his pass:
bort to the local hospital ward to my hands. In much the same fashion I
ſhortly afterwards disposed of the Chief Contractor of the Refreshment, Depart-
ment inside the Show itself. But to detail these various feats would only weary
be reader, and I prefer in conclusion just to glance at some other features in
my career.
It would be easier to jot down those callings I have not followed than to relate
he various pursuits in which I have been engaged. My heroism and endur-
ince in flood and field are too well known to need repetition here. It may not,
lowever, be in the cognisance of some that I have starred as a tight-rope dancer
with fair, success, and been, in turns, successively a coalheaver, Queen's
Xounsel, Archbishop, dustman, greengrocer, Operatic Tenor, and Pirate. What
ther rôles I may fill before I leave these shores it is impossible at present to
oretell; but that I am equal to any and every call that can possibly be made
n my courage, philoso º intelligence, intrepidity, and tact, cannot, I should
ay, for a moment be . ted by those who have read, the modest and retiring
manifestoes that have hitherto been submitted to the public under the un-

“WHAT P-what? How?—how P Hay?—hay?” sounded a faint
and flurried voice in Mr. Punch's sanctum.
“Pray be seated, Sire,” said Mr. Punch, with a calm courtliness
well calculated to put even a hurried and embarrassed Royal Shade
entirely at his ease.
“Farmer GEORGE” sank into a chair, with a sigh of relief. Only
the queue of his ...is seemed to wobble a little, as he
gazed in uiringly around him.
“Well, well,” he murmured, “I never expected—never—to find

“Humph!” said His Majesty, dubiously. “I–I trust my Royal

“Our Sovereign Lady is far too sensible not to do so,” responded
Mr. Punch. “Her place in the affections of her people is much too
solidly assured to need the sham support of sycophantish adulation.”
“Well, well, times have changed–times have changed, indeed,”
said the King, stooping to pat the Dog of Dogs.
“Praise is no longer servile, blame no longer brutal, and even
caricature no longer coarse, your Majesty,” responded Toby's Master,
pleasantly.
“Ah, well,” cried Farmer GEORGE, “I never did understand

No. XXIX.--THE FISHERMAN.
SURELY, Piscator, like Poeta, nascitur non fit. To no one but the
born Fisherman, are his patience, his infinite capacity for taking
pains, and his Stoical indifference
to personal discomfort, at all in-
telligible. To the world at large,
his quiet satisfaction, with ap-
arently meagre results is quite
inexplicable; for the true sports-
man will be more elated by the
capture of one brace of trout from
certain streams, than if he had
drawn hundreds from a Scotch
loch. To him the surmounting
of difficulty is the d object,
and the smallest basket may often
only be obtained at the price of
the most consummate #.
address, resource, and perseve-
rance. Do the fish rise better in
the morning than later in the day?
The Fisherman will rise still ear- S
lier, and he will not grudge, if º
need be, to walk miles so as to be & Nº wº
present at their levée.
See him as he approaches the river, his eye fixed upon the likely
places! With what practised speed, and yet how carefully, he sets
up his rod, standing the while some distance from the water's edge!
On the way he has determined what flies he will use first; he does
not hesitate an instant as he attaches the casting-line, though already
his heart beats fast with excited speculation as to the result of his
first few throws. All is ready at last, and now he begins to fish
working slowly and steadily towards the ideal spot where fish should
be, if anywhere. Mark how his line traverses the whole area of
water; every trout has an º of seing the flies which are
presented in succession even before the wily, veterans lurking fº
in snug retreats which are either inaccessible to, or neglected ſ:
inferior anglers. Qttentimes only by a hair's-breadth does the tail-
fly escape the treacherous snag or overhanging bough that seems to
lean forward on purpose to catch it; and though he cast with every
precaution, mishaps will constantly occur even to the most dexterous
Fisherman. When misfortunes come, as they often do on a bad day,
“not as single spies, but in battalions,” then the temperament of the
true angler is needed. Who but a Fisherman can comprehend the
feelings of one who in a failing light finds his last and only “killing.”
fly fast in a bush, while he knows that within a few yards lie fish
waiting to be caught?
He who wields the fishing-rod pursues an unsociable calling. If
he start forth in the morning with a brother of the angle, the pair
will possibly return together at night. But during the day the two
will probably hardly interchange more than a word; as likely as not
they will not meet. Isolation from his fellow creatures is essential
to the Fisherman; Nature and his own thoughts are his companions.
For him the fleecy clouds as they scud across the sky are eloquen
the ruffled surface of the shallows and the opaque black or white o
the depths bring each their message, the “leaves and zigzag branches
write 5.ºf words against the evening sky.” The fisherman,
like every solitary sportsman, becomes of necessity a philosopher.
Unconsciously his mind, absorbs somewhat of the serenity o
landscapes among which he moves. - -
As a result the Fisherman is of all men least prone to glory in his
own prowess; heavy baskets he knows to be at times impossible to
the jº. and at others hardly to be missed by the novice. To do
as well as circumstances will permit is all that he aspires to achieve.
But he who is heart and soul in his craft will take fish when no one
else in the neighbourhood can so much as catch sight of a fin. His
º is always adjusted with the nicest precision, and the knots of
is line contain part of the man's character. He does not
the applause of others, he wishes to use the best tackle to the best
purpose. -
Overnight Piscator selects his tackle, and rigs his casting-lines;
on the morrow, by the river's brink, he sits down to mend, to re-
place, to make alterations, with a cheerful intentness than it is good
to see. In his ears sound the murmur. of waters, and the hum of
insects; before his eyes a panorama of light and shade is continually
shifting. Cattle eye him occasionally with a º indifference as they
stumble to the ford to drink, and the water-rat flops into the stream,
making off with all possible dispatch as he approaches.
The Fisherman's day is indeed an idyſ, ever changeful and
charming as the music of CHOPIN. Some it delight; to destroy
pheasants with noise, and to stand in “hot corners.” To others are
. the Angler's gentle zeal, and the soul to appreciate his
privileges.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE JUBILEE OF KING EDWARD THE THIRD,
(Gathered from the John Hollingshead Chronicles.)
QN the morning of the 25th of January, 1377, the King was early
astir. . He sent for the Poet Laureate and invited him to partake of
breakfast. The meal of the period was composed of an infusion.of
herb and hot water, sweetened with a sort of sugar and mixed with

“Gadzooks,” he exclaimed, using the strangeidiom of the century,
“but this concoction suits me to º ! Come, CHAUCER, can you not

occasion?”
“Ay, that can I,” replied the Poet, dreamily, “I have a fancy

“Be it so,” returned the Monarch, heartily, and a few minutes
later King and Trobadour were discussing a dish that for many years
s was known as “Iggs and Bakun.”
“And now, CHAUCER, what shall I do next? Beshrew me, I am
a needy one? so-ſook you—let not thy plan cost me a silver
pº I want something cheap and popular.”
“Why not confirm Magna Charta ?? suggested the§: who was
inhaling a vapour that passed from a bowl full of smouldering dried
cabbage-stalks through a tube into his mouth, “why not confirm
Magna Charta ?” -
“I have done this kind of thing several times before,” replied the
King, musingly, “but as thou sayest it costeth menothing. So here

With this the aged Sovereign taking a feather from a goose that
happened to be passing, made a large cross upon the palladium of
British Liberty, and smiled graciously. -
“So much for the people, and now for myself. Canstnot hit upon
some plan for my entertainment?”
“That indeed can I?” returned the Poet, putting . *. his

sighed, and leav-
- ing the break-
fast-table, threw himself on a couch which had recently been sent to
him by the Pope from Italy. This couch, which was, gallantly
furnished with a padded seat and a sort of cushion, was called a sofa.
“I can always listen better, with a covering over my head,”
observed the Sovereign suiting the action to the word.
“I call my little effort The Canterbury Tales,” commenced
§º. spreading out his manuscript. “I think you will like
em.”
Then he read for the space of three hours while Edward THE
THIRD expressed his great satisfaction by breathing loudly at regular
fººl. At the end of the third hour the King sat up with a
start,
“Where am I?” he exclaimed, and then quickly added, “I mean
to ºl çapital Excellent! You should send them to a comic
Journal.
“I will,” replied CHAUCER... “I have long intended to start one.
I should like it to be called, The London Charivari.”
“Why not call it Punch fº asked the º:
“Or, the London Charicari,” persisted CHAUGER, who was an
obstinate kind of person when contradicted. “And so thou art, in-
deed needy, O g,” continued the Poet. “I am sorry for that,
as, had it been quite convenient to thee, I should have asked for
the º of my own salary, now three quarters in arrears.”
“It is thine own fault, old word-jigger,” returned the Monarch.
“Thou art fond of the vapºur of cabbage-stalks—why
dost thou not discover tobacco P Did thou invent it, thou shouldst
have the monopoly of its sale, which wouldst pay thy salary a
hundredfold.”

“Have what?” asked the King. ..." And halidom is an ana-
chronism, and will not be used until a later century than that
wherein thou and I exist.”

“Good, my lord,” cried CHAUCER, excitedly. “I have it. Put

“Certainly—but wherefore?”
“To celebrate thy Jubilee, to be sure! Go by as long a route as

year afterwards), and was extortionate in his fares. However, the
; citizens paid merrily themselves, saying, “By our troth, but a
ubilee cometh but once in fifty years!”
The day ended, and once more Troubadour and Sovereign were
closeted together. They were enjoying the illuminations. CHAUCER
poured into his Master's hands vast sums of copper money.
: Qf a verity this is a brave display!” exclaimed his Majesty;
“Sire, thou hast not forgotten the terms?” questioned the Poet.
“That thou, O King, were to have the takings of the stands after
my salary had been paid in full.”
“A ºftly arrangement and a just one—now have I no more to
receive?”
The Poet shook his head signifying that he had paid over all that
he had received, and then putting forth his hand exclaimed, “And
now, O King, my salary?’
. “Shall be paid in full out of the tobacco monopoly when that next
is discovered,” i. the Monarch locking up the cash, “say, old
friend, what t est thou?”
“That if my salary depends º tobacco, it will end in ‘smoke.’”
The King laughed, long at this quaint conceit. The Poet also
smiled, but whether the smile was intended for the quibble (which
truth to say, was not a very new one) or was caused by a recollection
that out of the stand-lettings he had already paid hi his salary
told a hundred-fold, the Chronicles do not testify.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
*ARRY ON THE JUBILEE.
DEAR CHARLIE
You are a old 'ermit ! Did think as you'd trot up to town,
To#. this 'ere Juberlee gammoek and back hup the Court and the Crown.
I’d as soon be a bloomin' old Blue-Point deep down in the briny, dear boy,
As be mugged up in medders and mangolds with nothink to door enjoy.
The town's painted red I can tellyer, a º flare-up and no kid;
Got a seat for the Ryal Percession for which I'd to blue arf a quid;
Pooty stiff, but then ARRY's a patriot, the scene'll be somethink immense,
And when larks and loyalty jine, I say wire in, and bust the expense!
We shan’t see sech another dust-up, CHARLIE; Juberlees ain't like green peas,
Or Derbies or centenny—wotsits, and that's wy I’m in for the squeeze.
A fifty years' stretch on the throne is a record as ain't often made,
Pertikler in times like these 'ere, as is bad for the Ryalty trade.
Wot with dynimite, CHARLIE, and duffers like HYNDMAN, KRAPOTKIN & Co.,
And º: º like GLADsroxE and MoRLEY, kings' cribs are not wuth
art a diow.
They seem always a gitting kicked out or blown up, mate, and suddent at that,
Jest as though º: wps tram-car conductors, without no more rights than a rat.
But HER MADGESTY-bless 'er!—'as bested'em. No one, dear CHARLIE, can't say
She ain't'ad a fair run for 'er money. And now it's 'er Juberlee Day;
And I mean bein’ in it, I tell yer. Ishan't shy at blueing a bob,
For my patriot soul's hup at pop-pint, and 'ARRY is fair on the job.
It’s a rare fillaloo, and no error, Q. J. is all over the shop;
Heard a bloke cryin'. “Juberlee Winkles,” and arter that where will they stop?
Fact is, Trade is still so dashed bad, and there's bin sech a run on the tin,
That most heveryone takes up the cry on the horf chance of jest a look in.
I am hup in the sterrups jest now, as you know, my dear CHARLIE, thanks be!
And since I’ve bin ‘‘ hinterviewed”—well, even W. R. Perself must know Me.
So I’ve togged myself up to the nines, mate, and if I should ketch the QUEEN’s
heyes,
Well, she won't be ashamed of 'er subjeck, that's poz, dear old pal, and no flies!
It's in me, my pippin, it's in me, and, 'ang it, it’s bound to come out, [lout;
That there jenny say quor, dontcher know, as divides the true gent from the
And if Mrs. GUELPH, as we call 'er, should spot me—well, there I won’t blow

I did 'ope to git into the Habbey; I ought to 'ave bin there, you see,
As a true repprysentative man, wich is wot I’m admitted to be. -
But there is sech a lot of red-tape, CHARLIE., Fancy wot might’ave bin done
With this Juberlee Day if the Bigwigs'ad only been fly to true fun!
Wy ain't there no Fireworks, for instance? That there Dook of WESTMINSTER
Of candle-ends stuck in the winders is like that close-fisted old codge. [dodge,
Wy didn't he stump up the ochre f Herolls in it, CHARLIE, old man,
And yet his contrybution to Toosday is this mangy taller-dip plan.
Wy when GEORGIE THE THIRD, poor old buffer l—was playin' 'is Juberlee game,
They'ad larks with roast oxes and rockets, and wy shouldn't we do the same?
Primrose "Ill all ablaze with set-pieces, and bonfires all over the shop.
That’s wot I should call doin' it prime, and 'twould catch the B. P. on the 'op.
If our toppers mean stickin' up top, mate, and not coming down with a run,
They must ladle the ochre out freer, and give us a little more fun.
They may be jest as rich as old Creeses, and none on us won't care a bob;
But if they turn stingy, old pal, they may jest as well turn up the job.
We'll pervide 'em with L. S. D., CHARLIE, with palaces, pensions, and parks;
But if we supply the canaries, the toppers must let us 'ave larks.
That's a moral, old man, trust yours truly. Their game is a trifle too steep,
And if there's one thing as won't wash, it is Ryalty done on the cheap.
'Owsomever, that’s jest # the way, mate. I’ve wolfed lots # ujubes, old man,
For I mean to hooray till I'm hoarse, and I want to be heard i } Call.
Can't yer run up to town for the evening, and take a all-rounder with me
To see London light up for VICTORIA P I tellyer it will be a spree.
Polly PECKHAM will be on my arm, I can furnish you out with a gal
As will suit you right down to the ground, CHARLIE. Do make a heffort, old pal.
It’s a thing as we all oughter see; I'll mount all the topsail I can carry,
And if you’ll shove in your jib-boom, you’ll oblige yours right loyally,

No better Show than the Military Tournament, with
Major TULLY in command, and Captain DANN-the
“hoarse soldier.” as Mr. Punch first christened him
§. ago—as Master of the Ring. . The building the
ridge, the crossing it, and the assault on the fort gal-
lantly defended by the Military Band under the noble
old of “Refreshment Contractors” waving above
their heads, were more exciting than last year, owing to
the Armed Train, which runs in screaming like a wild
Injine, and with Blue jackets in front to work the #.

:* arrangements, the carrying off of the wounded boy,
and the ambulance lending assistance, reflected the
greatest credit on Colonel ONSLow. The dead men acted
their parts to the life. The audience was crowded, hot,
and enthusiastic. The welcome given to the Princess of
WALES’s Own Hussars (or Lancers, we forget which)
was spontaneously hearty. Altogether a great success;
and BUFFALo BIII's Show (except the Buckers) not “in
it” with the Military Tournament, which, it is to be
regretted, lasts only one week.
THE Reform Club Ball was a splendid affair last Wed-
nesday. The dancers were plucky, and, in spite of crush
and heat, formed and re-formed over and over again.

MR. PUNCH*S MANUAL FOR
YOUNG - RECITERs.
MB., PUNCH had quite set his heart upon
furnishing, his pupils with a Jubilee 5.
which should afford the fullest scope both to
their loyalty and
elocution; and he
had given an early
order to his regu-
lar Poet to furnish
him with a piece
of superior quality
and finish. The
Bard, however,
yielding to an un-
worthy diffidence,
has shrunk from
competing with N
singers of stronger §
pinions than his NS
own, and had it
not been for a
gifted native gen-
eman of Bengal,
a Mr. CHATTERJEE
MookERBHoy, who
rushed antly -
into fill the gap with a composition that is, on
the whole, º creditable to his head and
heart (thoug rhaps a little unfortunate
here and there, from a not unnatural want of
familiarity with the nicer nuances of the
language)—had it not been for enterprising
Mr. MookEhlshoy – the Amateur Reciter
would have had no Jubilee Recitation upon
which to expend his energies. Here, then, is
the Baboo's spirited effort, which, from its
extreme simplicity, can be rendered with
comparative ease by even a beginner:-
JUBILEE ODE.
Compounded by Baboo Chatterjee Mookerbhoy, as
token of loyalty.
In the groves of calorific India, . .
Stands a pillar, stamped with two initials;
And the Ryot bows himself before it,
aking a poojah.
(“The recitationer,” says the Baboo," should
manifest here before the audience the
alluded mechanism.”)
X. he crowns it . a. ...; champak,
nd, on tiptoe gingerly approaching,
Down its mouth, that gapes, as if expectant,
Pops in a sweetmeat.
(Imitate a #. gesture, and skip back
with a salaam.)
Then he lays his letter down before it,
oping for the notice of the Demon,
Who resides within the little column-
W. R. the viewless!
(Fold your arms across, your stomach, with a
transit to cultivated compassion and quiet
inflatedness.)
We are blessed with better education
Than to kneel in front of pillar-boxes,
Though *g all are symbols of a Sov’reign,
plendidly ºp!
No malignant deity is W. R.
To be wooed by long itiation!
But a kind, good-natured-looking lady-
j udging by portraits.
So 'tis not with superstitions motives
That we’ve ornamented all the lamp-posts
With festoons of flowers made of paper,
Finer than fivepence!
For we greet the fiftieth recurrence
Qf the day our QUEEN the throne ascended
With a solemn universal high jinks,
Painting the town red!
On this rompish Day of Jubilation
Let there be no sign of any snip-snap!
Let the bells ring out a merry welkin!
(“The practice of making the welkin ring on
§ rejoicings is remarked at,” says
r. MooRERBHor, learnedly, “by all the
number-one poets and best-quality war-
blers.”)
Flourish the trombones!
(With an exalted raptness of one who has
got j dazzlement on his Horatio, or mind's
eye.
Here she comes, the Governess of Albion!
Let us all draw in our horns before her,
Make a leg, and greet her with a curtsey,
Shout “Lackadaisy!”
Now we bend, respectfully collapsing,
For her stately caravan advances,
Through the festive crowd of cockahoopers,
All of a twitter!
OVICTORIA, we thy loving subjects
Raise for thee the clamorous cut bono /
Deign to jerk us, in retaliation,
One little simper!
(With an action of imploration, you should
retire backward, avoiding the emotional
displays of feeling which are likely to
proceed from those by whom you may be
audited.)
Mr. DAVITT has made afew mistakes lately.
When Mr. PARNELL is inclined to use strong
language, he says “O DaviTT 1"

OH, THE JUBILEE!
“Per te d'IMMENso GIUBILo,” &c.
Lucia di Lammermoor, Chorus, Act II.
Signor LAgo—already victorious—and the vast
forces at the disposition of General AUGUSTUs
DRURIoIANUs. But the Colonel, though he
has warily retreated, is still undefeated, and
sounds the trumpet for another attack, which
is announced for Thursday next. Success to
the veteran warrior Whether AUGUSTUs in-
tended to take the town by storm with Aida,
is a matter which the result has left uncertain.
The Orchestra, under the baton of Field-
Marshal MANCINELLI was grand, glorious,
and enough to blow off the heads of an
audience. Of course Aïda is a noisy opera,
and when the voices aren't *. power-
ful, it is as well to make up for quality with
a quantity of wind and string. But here
there was quality-good quality, too, as far
as the chorus and most of the principals
went, and even the weakest of these came out
uncommonly well in a chorus.
If ensemble were to be the strength of
Opera Druriolana, then the public will say to
Augustus IMPERATOR, what Roz said, to
Coz, “Then give us a chorus.” But this
should not be so, as in his Signori PANDOLFINI,
MIRANDA, NAVARRINI, and the French Tenore
Robusto—“Irobusto, toi que j'aime!”–JEAN
DE REszKE,-romantic name-quite the title
of an Opera in itself-he has what Mrs.
RAMSBoth AM would call “The Elephants of
success.”
Signora (why “Signora º as she’s Ger-
man?—but no matter) MILAKüPFER-BERGER
may be all that is required as a “Prima Donna
Drammatica” by the audience of the Teatro
Real at Madrid, but the audience of the still
more real Theatre at Drury Lane, want some-
thing more than dramatic talent, which
didn't seem very over-powering, in an Opera.
The make-up and costume of the Donna
Drammatica as Aida was curiously *:::
estive of one of the Huntresses of the
ild West Show, and some ignoramuses
seeing Mr. Foley—we mean Signor Foll-in
the stalls, mistook him, on account of the
length of his locks and his drooping mous-
tache, for BUFFALo BILL himself, who they
thoughtyas present to encourage the perfor-
mance of one of his troupe.
On the same night, at Covent Garden
Lohengrin was given, with ALBANI an
GAYARRá; and though the Opera to non-
Wagnerites is somewhat tedious (and the heat
was trying to audiences everywhere), yet there
can be little doubt that the Covent Garden
Company, having
ahead, and that ANI and GAYARRä are
the favourites, and will bring in Covent
Garden first at the end of the season. One
Opera will pay, two won't. Wºłº the
usical Millionnaire, Madame PATTI, come
forward, and, out of mere love of Music, start
a Company of her own, paying first-rate
salaries, and being a naturalised Welsh-
wºman; ready to show what “gallant little
Wales” can do, ready to take the profits as
her share, or nothing, since she is well able
to stand the loss of a few thousands, if loss
there could ever be with the proverbially
lucky diva. That she, our Dinorah, our
Aida, our Rosina, our several other things,
should be out of it, is “the º of it,” and,
if she liked, she could put it all right. Thi
is a suggestion from TOTHER FELIow.
P.S.—“In this hot weather, after the
Opera is over, a cold something in aspic, or a
deliciously fresh lobster, washed down with
whatever your particular weakness may
be—”. “But, one of my rules is never to
sup.” “Then,” we say, “go to our RULE's
for an exception.” It’s worth the last quar-
ter of an hour of any Opera. Verb. sap.

A PEACEFUL TRIUMPH.
Punch's Ode on the Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen
Victoria, June 21, 1887.
NoT with the ruthless Roman's proud parade
Of flaunting ensigns and offettered foes,
Nor radiantly arrayed
In pomp of purple, such as fitly flows
From the stern Conqueror's shoulders, comes
... our QUEEN
Whilst England's ways with June's glad gar-
niture are green.
Not with the scent of battle, or the taint
Of cruel carnage round about her car,
..., Making the sick air faint
With the dread breath of devastating war,
Rolls on our Rºyal Lady, whilst the shout
Of a free people's love compasses her about.
The pageantry that every step attends
Is not the martial pomp that tyrants love,
No pººl shout of slaves the shamed air
rends;
- Peace's white-pinion'd dove
Might perch upon those banners unafraid,
The shackled forces here are thralls of Art
and Trade.
Titans beneficent that in the train
Of peaceful progress walk with willing
ee
In the proud service of the conquering brain,
- Loyally strong and fleet;
With calm-eyed Science, and with white-
robed Health,
The unarmed champions of the new Common-
wealth.
Unarmed with tools of slaughter, yet of
strength
To shake the phalanx and to blunt the
spear.
O QUEEN 1 the loyal land through all its

. Breaks into one wide cheer
Of §§ rejoicing on this day,
And hails, your Peaceful Triumph winding
its calm way.
Triumph! Shall we not triumph who have

From snow to sun, since when, a girlish
UEºn
In that far June-tide's glow,
Your brow first felt that golden weight,
well-worn,
Which tried the Woman's heart, but hath not
overborne?
Fifty fair years which, like to all things
alr,
Are flecked with shadow, yet whereon the
sun.
Hath never set in shame or in despair,
Their changeful course have run.
And we who saw the dawn now flock to see
Juns; ºy light illume VICTORIA’s
uldliee,
Triumph! No brainless,
boast
Of indiscriminate self-eulogy
Rings from our lips, or from the loyal host
From every land and sea
Who gather, drawn by kinship's gentle cords,
As heroes flººked of old to the fierce feast of
swords,
The hands that wave in jubilant acclaim
cº at stern need, clench close upon the
loud thrasonic
t;
But England yearns to build a nobler name
Not on the conqueror's guilt,
The iron ruler's raw and ruthless might,
But on . patient potent faith in love and

Of Honour's full fruition yet to be?
The music round you is no martial blare
But voices of the free
Ring unconstrained rejoicing on your way,
Symbol of England's might and ocean-girdling
sway.
Just, pure, and gentle, yet of steadfast will
When high occasion calls and honour pricks!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extra-aortrid FBox
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, June 13.--When new office
created for KING-HARMAN in connection with Irish Government,
everybody wanted to know Why? Nobody answered. Now secret
out. KING-HARMAN made Parliamentary Secretary to Irish Govern-
ment in order that he might deliver the perfectly delicious answer
about ambulatory crowbar which convulsed House to-night.
“Is it true,” ConyBEARE asked, “that at
the Bodyke Evictions a bailiff threw a crowbar
through a wall?”
“No, Sir,” said KING-HARMAN, drawing
himself up to full height, and steadily con-
What is true is, that on one occasion a crowbar
slipped from the bailiff's hand, and entered
the house through an aperture in the wall.”
Shouts of laughter, amid which KING-HARMAN
stood immovable. When uproar partially sub-
sided, he added, “It was purely accidental,
and did not occur a second time.” Disposition
on part of Irish Members to resent ARTHUR
BALFour's practice of leaving questions to be
answered by his subordinate. If KING-HAR-
MAN can go on this way, there will be no
further question of the arrangement:, .
More pegging away at Coercion Bill in Com-
mittee. Settled that at Ten o’Clock on Friday,
whatever Amendments to whatever num-
ber of Clauses remain unsettled shall be
run through forthwith, and Committee
stage accomplished. That being so, BAR-
3 TLEy, who looks in on his way home after
º, having founded another Penny Bank,
wants to know what's the use of wastin
time? TIM HEALY, who has discover
in facial aspect of the Member for Isling-
ton resemblance to one of those automatic
figures which moves when a penny is
inserted in the open mouth, tells him to
go away and mind his own business. As for Irish Members, they
intend to ignore Resolution of Saturday morning. Will discuss
Clauses line by line and word by word as before... If on Friday
Government like to rush through without discussion any Clauses
that may remain, the consequence be on their head. Penny Bank
BARTLFY is conjured to “put that in his pipe and smoke it; ”
which he, metaphorically, does, and goes his way. . .
JoBIN MANNERs back to-night, after a bout of illness. House
delighted to see him. Cheer enthusiastically when he rises, blush:
ing, to answer question. House justly proud
of the ...]" old man, almost last sur-
viving link with Young England days.
Business done,—Coercion Billin(Xommittee.
Tuesday.—Shadow of the coming Jubilee
lies heavy on House. Various questions
discussed; but Jubilee always reasserts it-
self. Many questions about Grand Stand in
Parliament Square. Seats not to be reserved
and numbered, it appears. GEORGE CAMP-
BELL sternly asks, “Are we to understand
that Ladies are to scramble for their places?”
“I hope,” said that £º: chevalier,
PLUNKET, with a pained look"
w - at the enormity
of the suggestion, “that es do not
scramble.”
“Put a penny in, and the
figure will move.”
Clear through the grating in
the cage over the Press Gallery,
came the whisper, “What a
ºn nice man!”
GARDNER wanted to know
how long the streets would be
kept open for Members' car-
riages, and Alderman Fowl. ER,
twice Lord Mayor of London,
posed PLUNKET with inquiry as
to what was to be done with
Members' carriages when they
had arrived and set down their
fare? JoHN DILLON gave new
turn to conversation by sug-
gesting that House should sit

At last House resumed Committee on Coercion Bill, the movement
being signal for general Exodus. Almost alone GLADSTONE sat on
Front Bench with Bill in one hand and copy of Amendments in other,

table TIM, wearied with the worn-out theme. Leaders of the
Government abdicated, leaving Treasury Bench in possession of
Irish ATToRNEY-GENERAL, Soi1cITOR-GENERAL, and CHIEFSECRE-
TARY... Even John MoRLEy, most assiduous attendant upon House,
had given himself rest. The Irish Camp half empty, and the
Benches opposite tenantless. And here was GLADstone, leaning
forward, with elbows on knees, Bill in one hand, and Amendments
in the other, as eagerly scanning them as if he had but just dis-
govered this new fount of delight. ARTHUR BALFour looked across
the table at him with perceptible increase of interest.
“What on earth can he find interesting in the beastly Bill?”
he muttered, and, settling himself forward another inch, went to
eep. -
“Curious, thing,” says WILFRID LAwson, “how Irish Secretary-
ship diversely affects different men. It ruined FonstER's health and
temper; it turned TREVELYAN's hair grey; it gave an added tone of
placidity to CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN's imperturbability; and it
makes ARTHUR BALFOUR sit more and more recklessly on his spine.
Fancy, before Bill is reported, he’ll have accomplished his heart's
desire, and be able to sit upon the blades of his shoulders.”
Business done.-Very little. No prospect of more pending com-

“SHADEs of Evening.”—“What to do with your hands,” is
always a difficulty for amateurs, for débutants in Societ and for
nervous persons. If anyone would learn what to do with his hands,
let him call in one evening at the Pavilion and see Professor TREWEY
(he used to exhibit at the Alhambra) make a “galanty show,” out
of his two hands, . Wonderful and immensely amusing, especially on
a hot evening, which is warm in the well-ventilated, Pavilion. It is
well worth seeing, and anyone visiting the place will find our words
verified, we mean Trewey-fied.
ROBERT ON THE JUBILEE.

a quiet home for him for a fortnight, where
he could enjoy the advantages of domestic
supervision, coupled with, such liberty in
seeing the chief sights of the Metropolis as
might be found compatible with his social
proclivities. As he enters a Drawing-room
with a double back somersault, descends
the stairs with a war-dance, and would
like, if possible, the run of a neighbouring
square on a Buck-jumping cab-horse, an
aged and lonely couple, living in a retired
suburb, who wished to enliven their declin-
ing years by the introduction of a little
novelty and excitement into their house-
hold arrangements, would find this an
eligible opportunity. As the Chief's food
consists of a raw tripe breakfast, an early
lunch-dinner of Bison steak, while he takes
five o'clock tea in a watering-pot, the
character of the cuisine would be no
great object. Is quite contented with a
shake-down on a couple of coal-sacks in the
front area. The Advertiser will supply
strait-waistcoat, handcuffs, leg-chains and
padlock complete, for ºf him out
to dinner, which can always be managed
most conveniently in an empty furniture-

ROBERT AT THE PERSESSHUN.
I HAVE offen remarked that for downright furmness, not to say
obsternacy, there’s nothink to compare to a fond, loving wife, who's
made up her mind to see a Royal Persesshun wen she appens to ha' got
a new Bonnet! So, finding my orful pictur of the dredfull dangers of
the streets on a reel Jewbilly Day, as don't come werry offen, treated
with derision, if not contemp, I submitted at larst, as I mite jest as
well have dun at fust, and descended with my beloved but firm
partner into the orfully scrowged streets. I must confess as 1 did
wentur to suggest that praps High Park mite be about the best place
for a safe, tho' distant, view, but my beloved had made up her mind
to git as near the Abby as posserbel, and was quite surprised to find
--
as both sojers and perlice º werry strongly to our going up to
the front door and waiting there quite cumferal for our Sovverain
and her Princes and Princesses, and cream-cullerd ponys. So we
had to push our way back jest as hard as we had before to push our
way forred, but with rayther wuss tempers; and at one part, where
the sojers was werry thick, one of 'em backed his horse at the rong
time, and game bump *i. my beloved. Fortunately the wild
hannimal didn't kick, and that wunderfool woman was quite ekal
to the occashun, for seeing sum grey-looking sojers with a plank
reddy to assist any one as feinted, she squealed out, tho' she wasn't
hurt a bit, and frowed herself in my arms; so they carried her into
the Abby for change of hair, and, strange to say, she wood not
recover herself till HER MAJESTY had cum, when she opened her
eyes, and saw everythink! witch, strange to say, I didn’t, as I
wasn't there, but was a being pushed about by the dredful crowd,
quite orful! RoBERT.
A BLAZE OF GLORY.
THE unanimous chorus of acclamation with which the recently
published announcement of Jubilee Honours has been greeted by the
general public has inspired, “those in authority,” to make some
still further additions to it on the same lines, and the follow-
ing names will probably be submitted to HER MAJESTY for her
approval:—
To be raised to the Peerage.—Mr. SMITH, Mr. BRowN, Mr. Jones,
Mr. RobTNSoN.
To be Members of Her Majesty's most Honourable Priry
Council.-Mr. ARTHUR Roberts, Mr. W. Hol.1.AND, the Author,

ECHOES FROM THE JUBILEE.
DEAR Mr. PUNCH,-It is not very likely that we shall have
another Jubilee for some little while; still, as it is always as well to
be ready for any eventuality, I send you a few notes that may be of
service to Londoners during the next celebration.
Bow to get a Seat to View the Procession—Some people say that
getting up at 5 A.M., and waiting in a brougham outside the stand
in which that seat is situated, is
“out and away the best mode.”
Many of my friends tried this method,
caught severe colds, and then were
so weary when the moment arrived
for the cortège to pass, that they
slumbered the sleep of the just.
Mine was a far simpler process, and
had the advantage of being perfectly
successful. I did not worry myself
to secure a voucher, but merely -

public office intil the §§ of Why not Goschen's head for a Jubi-

the approaches... As I anticipated, in a moment of extreme excite-
ment the guardians turned their heads to see what they could see.
It was then that I seized my opportunity, and, walking in as if the
place belonged to me, selected the best stand, mounted into it, and
cheered while my voice lasted. After this I was a little hoarse, and
consequently got back home without fatigue.
How to Illuminate cheaply and effectively.—Chinese lanterns are
all very well in their way, and so are Fairy lamps, but the first are
apt to “catch” in a high wind, the second to topple over, and both
cost money. A great deal may be done with a ream of tissue-paper,
and a seven-pence halfpenny worth of chamber candles. Cut out
some loyal sentiment on the paper, place a light behind it, and there
you are. If by any chance your house should burst into flames, you
Of course you will
have taken the precaution to be on the right side with the insurance
º Another method is to burn down your neighbours' houses,
ut this is not so profitable as burning down your own, although it
gives just as much pleasure and costs infinitely less trouble.
How to Entertain Country Cousins.—Write to say you will be only
too delighted to see them, and arrange to secure good places for them
for the ceremonial. Having done this, engage the largest room in
the best hotel on the line of route, and meet them there on their
arrival, spend the day with them, and delicately leave before the
waiter appears with the bill for the expenses. You should not do
this with a very rich uncle (from whom you have expectations) unless
you are quite sure of his temper.
How to Keep your Health during the Jubilee.—Leave town until
it is all over.
Believe me, dear Mr. Punch, always at your service,
WITNESS OF THE TRUTH.

stables may be safely Warrented.

Marked their hard toil amidst the mob's wild fun,
And, filled with genuine pride and admiration,
He publicly awards his warm “Well done!”

THE LONGEST DAY.
It is over! What a day we’ve had! What a succession of days
and nights! We saw the Procession from various Jubilee coigns,o
vantage, a few of the five-sovereign gold pieces, merely as memento:
for our collection, we should not mind possessing-but, at ng point
was the demonstration more enthusiastic than in Trafalgar Square,
where beaming from among flags and flowers rose Mr. Punch in a
central window of the Grand Hotel to salute H.R.H. The Prince of
WALEs—“Heir Apparent, or Visible Prince,”—the sixteen moun
Princes, and then to wave his hat to HER GRAcious MAJESTY, and
*with heart and voice” to sing out, “God save the QUEEN' " . The
Grand Hotel seated two hundred persons free! This was “doing
| the Grand” in a right royal manner. During the entr’acte luncheon
was served in the salled manger, where the arrangements met with
Mr. Punch's entire approbation.
There were severaſ most remarkable features in this great
assemblage, Mr. Punch's of course being the most noticeable-of
which we have observed no mention in any record that we have as
et seen. The first was the º Envoy in a splendid carriage
iving Westwards. Where was he going? Had he mistaken the
route for Westminster Abbey? -
The next noticeable feature was Sir CHARLES WARREN pouncing
down on a toozealous Constable, and giving him such a shaking as
brought him to his best senses and elicited cheers from the crowd.
Then there were some foolish persons who would throw coppers
from the windows, and there were some irregulars who broke their
line to pick them up. One of the irregulars was, put under arrest,
tried by Court Martial on the spot, and would (we º have
been there and then shot, had it not been for a superior Officer who
re-heard the case in two minutes, gave his decision, reinstated the
offender, and gave the Officer who ordered the arrest a wigging that
was highly appreciated by the spectators.
The Queen returning was visibly affected, and Mr. Punch himself
wiped away a tear on seeing the Princess of WALEs and the Princes
Royal bending towards her, and evidently sustaining her with their
affectionate sympathy, “Don’t give way, Mother,” they seemed to
be whispering; “we’re just home.” And though her º,

the Grand. “Not exactly,” replied Mr. Punch, as he pointed towards
H.R.H. and all the Princes mounted; “Paris at all events is repre-
sented by the Passage des Princes.” -
For impressive splendour and simple dignity, the Royal Procession
couldn't be beaten. But as a Pageant-(by the way, Mrs. RAM. was
delighted at seeing Lord ALFRED PAGEANT in full uniform riding all
alone with no one to talk to)—as a Pageant there was much to be
desired. But, after all, a Pageant would have been theatrical, and
this Procession was solid.
What a mistake were those closed carriages! When there's
another show we should strongly recommend the plan (adopted in
Pantomimes and to some extent in Lord Mayor's Shows) of preceding
each fresh lot of Notabilities with a big banner, on which shall be
legibly written the styles and titles of the characters following. No
one can look at a programme and see a procession. No one can take
glances at a printed list in his hand and be sure that he hasn't mixed
up the third carriage with the second, mistaken a King for a Prince,
or gone wrong somehow. Banners would obviate this.
Then as to music. There were three bands in Trafalgar Square.
One played on arrival, and on departure. The second played drearily
at long intervals. The third didn't play at all. As far as music
went—which wasn't far—the Procession was the dullest of its sort
ever witnessed in any big city on any big occasion.
The Police were all A 1.
After the ceremony, Mr. Punch proceeded by Vauxhall Bridge and
Dulwich to Sydenham, where he finished a royal day at The Palace.
#. the grounds were filling, and the É. le were coming down
in shoals to spend a happy afternoon and a brilliant evening.
Anybody who was at the Palace on, Jubilee Night would augur
well for its future success, in spite of all past and present difficulties.
The new mode of º and decorating the interior gives an air of
life to the Palace, which, in the evenings, it never has before possessed.
Mr. RUSSELL is to be congratulated on this ; and if the public only
back up the show, which is just now eminently worthy of their *::::
É.º C. P. Company may yet behold a Happy Future in the
rystal.
Mr. Punch witnessed BRock's magnificent º of fireworks—
quite a Brocken night—and from the smile upon his countenance we
are warranted in saying that he thoroughly enjoyed it. -
Also, on our own account, we can honestly add that besides, the
startling “Niagara of Fire,” there is another show which is alone
well worth a visit. This is an open-air ballet, most ingeniously
contrived and arranged by Mme. KATTLE LANNER, full of marvel.

surprise!” from beginning to end. Altogether for an outing the
combined entertainment at the C. P. is quite an “out-and-outer.”
The Rhododendrons look lovely. It ought to be made a twenty
minutes run by rail with L. C. & D. trains every half-hour. The
Crystal Palace ought not to be allowed to droop and die for want of
support, as . one will say who pays it a visit just at this time.
The fireworks had banged and popped for the last time, the gas
was going out fast, so were the people, about forty thousand of 'em,
and as “mid pleasures and palaces,” we had ceased to wish to roam,
we began to consider “there’s no place like home,” and so homeward
went, and the Jubilee Day was over.
THE daily papers having announced in good time that June 21st
“would be observed as a Collar Day,” Sir QHARLEs WARREN was
enabled to provide an efficient staff of. plain-clothes men, for the
occasion. It is remarkable, from the Police Reports of Wednesday,
how very few were actually collared.
‘ABBEY AND GLORIOUS 1 ''
Tuesday.—Upearly. Singing to the tune of “The Mocking Bird”—
“O, I am going to the Abbey,
To the Abbey, to the Abbey !
If there I don't see Mr. LABBY,
I shall know that he must have stayed away.”
The ceremony in the Abbey will never be forgotten by those who
were present. In spite of the tiers of seats filled with fighting
“everybodies” and “nobodies,” and several very comical incidents,
thefunction was intensely impressive. The Court officials did not seem
to be well “up” in the names of the Kings and Princes, and had to
“sort” them before apportioning seats. One very officious gentle-
man seemingly was asking Sovereigns for their names, with a view
to finding out where they should be put. This pleasant person seemed
to be saying to a subordinate, “Pass one King to the bench on the
right of the altar, and find a couple of places in the stalls for these
be-jewelled Nabobs.”
he Queen of the SANDwich Islands was a decided success.
But—Abbey Thought—why didn't she come attended with a corps
of Sandwich Men? The bows of the Court Officials were a welcome
relief to the more serious functions of the day. As each “Royalty”
assed, the Gentlemen in embroidered coats ducked their heads as
if to avoid the blow of an unexpected cricket-ball. These sharp
little nods continued as “H.R.H.” after “H.R.H.” passed along,
stopping only a moment to allow the Marquis of LoRNE (recovering
from his “nasty cropper”) to move on without clockwork-bobbing
recognition.
But the moment HER MAJESTY had taken her seat on the Throne,
surrounded by her sons and daughters, in the#. of her People
the situation became unspeakably grand. e very place, so full
of memories, added its dignity to the scene. Not even the strange
robes of the Clergy, worn awkwardly, could lessen the solemnity of
the occasion. Abbey Thoughts for Ritualists–Copes and Dalmatics
Until the close of the Service the QUEEN represented Royalty in its
noblest sense. It was only when HER MAJESTY turned round to
receive the homage of her children, and insisted, contrary to all pre-
cedent, upon kissing them, that the People realised once again how
intensely womanly their Šovereign La y was, and why they not
only respected . admired, but loved her. It was then that many
eyes were dimmed with unbidden tears, and every heart echoed the
earnest prayer, “God save the QUEEN l’”
THE CHILDREN'S FETE.
GIRLs and Boys came out to play,
Sun was shining—a lovely day !
Came with a whoop and came with a call,
How they romped and enjoyed it all !
Dancing about on the spacious green,
Cheering and blessing their gracious QUEEN,
And when the fun and frolic had ceased,
Cheering the Founder of the Feast.
May their fate in the future, we heartily pray,
Be as bright as we saw was their Fête of this day !
(JUNE 22.)
RACING THE BOATS,
Monday.—Started from Southend. Plenty of money for expenses.
Magnificent sight. Genesta took a decided lead. Granville Hotel at
Ramsgate could not be better.
Tuesday.--Nasty sea-fog. Heard that the Dauntless had lost her
way, and had wandered up the Seine as far as Paris. Started in
pursuit.
Wednesday.—Searched everywhere for the Dauntless, but could
not find her. No one had seen her on the Boulevards, and I cºuld
find no trace of her in the Folies Bergères. They had not seen her
in the Café Anglais where I dine.
Friday.—At Dieppe. Waited the whole day on the chance of
sighting the Genesta. Failed in the attempt. Could not see her
even from the Casino, although I was on the alert the whole evening.
Saturday.—Got to Brighton in the hope of coming across the
Dawn. Atlantis, I believe, all right. Some one fancied I should be
able to hear more about her if I went to Littlehampton.
Sunday.—Atlantis not in sight at Littlehampton. Dense sea-fog.
Tried Arundel—she was not there. Spent the whole afternoon lying
on my back under a tree in the park, looking for her.
Monday.—Away again. Ran down to Scarborough. Pretty place.
Nice bathing. Swam out some distance, but did not come across the
achts.
y Tuesday.—Spent all the money provided for my expenses, which
have been considerable. Coming back to town in a dense fog. Shall
get a fresh supply of cash, and then continue my journe after the
race with increased determination. [No, you don't.—ED.

length in the presence of His Majesty. He was sipping a cup of cold
coffee, and was seated huddled up on an ottoman, in his dressing-
flºwn and slippers, and as I slid into the room and produced the
‘Convention” from my pocket, I noticed that he visibly turned pale,
and returned my § salutation with an uneasy smile.
“If it is for me to sign that paper that you have come,” he com-
. hervously in bad French, “I cannot do it. It is not
possible.
“I’m very sorry, your Majesty,” was my promptreply, “but I’ve
had º orders from my Government, and they are, that I'm not to
leave this room till the thing is settled. So there; make up your mind
to it, for you’ll have to do it.” -
I dipped a pen in ink as I spoke, and courteously approached him
with a winning grimace.
“I tell you, I cannot,” was his plaintive reply, “I dare not. See,
what I have just received from the Russian and the Frenchman.
Read for yourself.”
He took a couple of despatches from a table-drawer as he spoke,
and burst into tears; then apparently overcome by his emotion, he
made a bound past me, and §. I could stop him fled from the
room. I halloo'd after him, but he had got a good start down the
next two corridors, and, as chace was useless, I let him go. Ithen
turned to the two documents. I make no comment on them, but
enclose them herewith for your inspection. Need, I add that after

British Embassy, Constantinople,
MY DEAR LoRD SALISBURY, June 23rd, 1887.
INEED not say that immediately on . of your telegram
I did my very best to carry out its instructions without further delay.
It reached me when I was busily employed trimming some oil-lamps
for our Jubilee celebration here, which promises, I am glad to say, to
be a very successful affair; but I at once abandoned my occupation,
çhanged my coat, put on my best hat, and hurried off to the palace.
On presenting my card I was, as I expected, at once declined admit-
tance. However, the tone of your telegram, hinting, as it did, that
I should have the support of Her Majesty's Government if I found
myself compelled by untoward circumstances to have recourse to
unusual measures, inspired me with the happy idea of tripping up
the sentry on duty, and making a dash for the grand marble stair-
case, which mounting five steps at a time, I was enabled to reach the
long series of antechambers that lead to the SULTAN's private
sanctum. These were filled with high Court officials, who were too
much taken aback by my sudden appearance to bar my progress, and
so, by knocking over a few who did, and º; a Grand Vizier,
who stood immediately in my way, with a Union Jack pockethand-
kerchief (a portion of our Jubilee decorations) that I had purposely
brought with me in case of need to emphasise my nationality, I made
a bound at the curtained entrance, and after a slight scuffle that can
not have lasted more than a quarter of an hour, found myself at
action as a direct casus belli. I need not, therefore, point out to you
the 1 ity under which you lie of altogether ignoring Sir

Well over, and over so well.
It was worth while abandoning “clover”
For ºlº, Square or Pall Mall.

How youthful I was, and how green,
Till I thrilled with contagious emotion
To “God Save the Queen.'”
A cynical coldness the vogue is,
And yet my most dandified cubs

Who thronged the hotels and the Clubs
To crowd for the handiest places
On that thef. Jubilee Day,
And yell, until red in their faces,
A British “Hooray!!!”

The town is more full of “good fellers”
Than modish omniscience knows.
Their notions nubibustic,
But this is abundantly clear,
That Britishers, urban or rustic,
Still know how to cheer.
A crowd more good-tempered and jolly
Has never stood hour after hour,
With scarcely a sun-shade or “brolly,”
Beneath a broad sun at full power.
The help those brave “Bobbies” afforded
Was noble, and free from all blame,
And if they are not fitly rewarded,
I say it’s a shame.
Those Ambulance chaps, too, were splendid!
The gentle and vigilant way
In which on the crowd they attended
Was one of the sights of the day.
Bravo, Sirs When multitudes muster,
Such help, unconstrained and unfee’d,
Prompt, kind, without red-tape or fluster,

HONOUR TO AGNETA FRANCES RAMSAY 1
(CAMBRIDGE, JUNE, 1887.)
THE Jubilee Week was a bad one for Theatres and
Operas. At Covent Garden there was another splendid
performance of Un Ballo in Maschera. Quality was
gº." Quantity was absent. Enthusiasm great.
ignor GAYARRE first-rate, and Mme. WALDA charming.
Mme. ScALCHI could not appear, but she had an excellent
substitute. In the Operatic Record of the Season, the
Garden is still to the front. -
At the Lane AUGUSTUs DRURIOLANUs leads his hosts
with undefeated energy. So much for his hosts, but how
about his guests? º they did not care much about his
“Prima Donna; Drammatica,” and wished that she were
more of the Prima Donna, and less of the Drammatica.
Then the weather being warmer,
Mr. HARRIs brought out Norma;
in which Miss ENGLE (is she Engle-ish?) was very nice
as Adalgisa, and her appearance quite explained Polio's
little flirtation. In Don Giovanni the HAUK as Zerlina
came out as the Nightingale. Mlle. ARNOLDson ap
as Rosina in Il Barbiere, and, if she is not yet a JENNY
LIND or an ADELINA PATTI, she is, at all events, The
success of the Drury Lane Season. She has ev ing in
her favour, especially youth. May we have an Itali
Opera House next year with Mlle. ARNOLDSON as one of
the principals. r., Punch welcomes her, and thinks
that she will obtain the ear and voice of the public; not
of course in exchange for her own.
Les Huguenots was given at Covent Garden on Satur-
day. GAYARRá superb in Duel "Scene; SCALCHI said
appropriately, “No, No, No, No, No, NO!” to an enthu-
siastic encore, ELLA RUSSELL, as Margherita di Valois,
electrified the audience with a high note; there never
was a better Conte di Nevers than DEyoyod; Mlle.
SANDRA was nervous as Valentina; and (here comes
try) CAMPELLO as Marcello, wasn't good, but didn't
llow. BEVIGNANI's band and chorus excellent, and
Music HALL, with a buttonholia gladstonensis in his coat,
beamed on Royalty and a brilliant house.
The same evening, AUGUSTUs DRURIOLANUs was very
much to the frontº-" called” vociferously,–wi -
Walpurgis Night Ballet in Faust. ii. i*ing was in
front to assist, if necessary.
At Her Majesty's, revival of The Colonel—(MAPLEson).
PATTI is announced for next Friday: , She's a dear
creature, a very dear creature. Still, if she “draws” as
well as she sings, the piper may be satisfactorily paid.
WHAT THEY ALL THINK OF IT.
Justin McCarthy.-Just been proposed to me that I should take
*Titular º of Irish Party in House of Commons!” PARNELL
(whose health we all hope to see improve) wishes it, it appears. Feel
utterly staggered by suggestion. Proud position, no doubt, but still—
am I the sort of person to lead TANNER, TIM HEALY, SExton, T. P.
O'ConnoR, not to mention MICHAEL DAVITT, and the rest of the
“boys” outside Parliament. And what does “titular” leader mean?
Strikes me the word is suspicious. PARNELL says, “I should make
such a respectable figure-head.” Query—is this complimentary or
the reverse? I am sure it's meant to be flattering, but somehow it
doesn't sound'so. Then if I accepted position, it would be positively
necessary that I should do something which would forge Authorities
to put me in prison, as this is a sine quá non for obtaining confidence
of Irish people. Question is, what is the very mildest illegal act for
which Government would be safe to lock me up? Might arrange
matter amicably with BALFour, perhaps. Awkward if he refused
me ink and paper in Kilmainham. Where would my novels be then?
Yet Kilmainham would certainly give me some useful “local colour.”
Yes, but then if I had to go a tour like O'BRIEN first, might get the
local colour somewhere eiº all over my body, for example. On the
whole think I’m like lamented IDDESLEIGH-haven't sufficient “go,”
—would rather write History than make it, any day of the week. .
Davitt.-Not good at game of “follow my leader,” under any cir-
cumstances. Now PARNELL’s shelved, think I might take his *.
out of Parliament. Circumstances of course prevent my being
leader in Parliament. Besides, I am so volatile—violent, I mean,
and can't help breakin
awkward for G.O.M. Perhaps on the whole JUSTIN's the man.
HEALY's name is TIM, which is fatal for a leader.
Dillon.-As, disinterested Patriot, of course don't care twopence
about Leadership. Still, PARNELL might have asked me, I think.
Does he forget how often I’ve led the Forty-Thieves—I mean Forty
Members, necessary to support motion for adjournment? Not sure,
though, if it isn't more comfortable to be the "BAYARD of the
out now and then; and that would be | dis
League,” than Leader;-it would bayardonme, to expect me to cut
my hair and to cultivate compromisel McCARTHY an inoffensive
fellow. Much better than HEALY. Yes, decidedly—“Aut Justin,
aut nullus.”
T. P. O'Connor.--It strikes me PARNELI, has forgotten my ser-
vices to the Party; how I won 'em a seat at Liverpool, for instance.
Feel I'm cut out for a revolutionary leader. Don't mind what I
say, and not much what I do. JustiN not the only man in the world
who can write books. Would back my Gladstone's Parliament
against his inflated History of Our Own Times, any day, both
for style and accuracy. Fancy a Novelist at head of Clan-na-Gael!
Still, better to have him than that bellowing bull, TANNER, or that
straw-splitting limb of the law, HEALY, PARNELL says that JUSTIN
“divides the least.” Yes, but oughtn't Nationalist leaderin Parlia
ment, to “divide” the most?
Tim Healy.—Ridiculous to think of “T.P.” as my leader!, Don't
mind JUSTIR, at least not so much, but there's something blatant
and even vulgar about the other one. In fact can't think what
PARNELL’s about if he does not recommend me for Leadership.
Haven't I fought Crimes Bill inch by inch P Who's got so muc
legal—or perhaps I ought to say illegal-acumen as I? Can't help
being called TIM; besides, it's a, Biblical name, and qught to com:
mend me to hierarchy. Think I’ve a real gift for leading. So had
PARNELL–it was thirty thousand in his case, I remember-mustn't
say this to anybody, however.
Br. Tanner-Nobody seems to have thought of me to succeed
PARNELL! Yet nothing succeeds like success, and I flatter myself
I’ve gained a unique reputation in House for #. that would
- a bargee....HEALY!. A quibbling, pettifogger. Sexton'ſ
A rhetorical prig. ...T. P. O'Connor, 1 Feeble imitator of my style,
As for Justin—well, he’s less objectionable than rest, perhaps; but
didn't he write History of Our T. Never rºad the boºk,
but strikes me a Nationalist who would act as chronicler of that
blood-thirsty British organ is out of therunning for leading Patriots;
If it had been a “History of our own P.M.G.,” now, that would
have been different.
