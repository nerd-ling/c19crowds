« And
66T was about the lovely close of a warm Summer day,” in fact it was on the night of the great Victorian Jubilee Day,
IT
June 21st, 1887.
"Night sank upon the dusky beach and on the purple sea,”
and Mr. Punco, upon a chalky headland, overlooking the “silver streak,” gazed forth into the vast star-s pangled vault of
heaven, musing of many things.
He, the swift, the ubiquitous, had been an observant witness of the impressive pageantry, the imposing popular out-
pouring of the day. And now, Toby at heel and torch in hand, he had climbed to set fire to the beacon whose "red glare"
was to blaze out over the wide Channel waters, and blazon forth to all the land England's joy and Mr. Ponch's loyalty.
Flash! The ruddy flame leaped forth on to the night with the brightness of the levin, the impetuosity of a tiger's
spring. A lurid cloud of smoke rolled upward and outward, slowly lifted and wafted by the soft salt sea-breeze of June.
The ringing rhymes of MACAULAY—that sound-hearted English writer whom prigs pooh-pooh, and Punch, like all
sensible Britons, enjoys—ran in the head of the Sage. He thought of that other Summer night, three centuries since, when
another Queen sat on the throne of the island realm, when-
"From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,
That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day,”
with preparations for welcoming the Armada.
" Venit, vidit, fugit !” murmured Mr. Purch.
“Dux fæmina facti," sibillated a responsive voice in his ear.
Who, what were these two shadowy shapes in doublet and ruffle? One frail, and, like the Sage himself, slightly
hunched; the other brisk, alert, bronzed, bearded.
“Well capped, ROBERT CECIL!” said the Ever-Ready One, courteously bending to 'the illustrious Shades.
you, stout Sir FRANCIS, give you good greeting on this night of nights, when 'tis no marvel two such patriot spirits should
revisit thus the glimpses of the moon."
“What bodeth this ? ” queried DRAKE, pointing to the flaring beacon.
“Oh, this is no 'ghastly war-flame,' but a jubilant Jubilee bonfire," said Mr. Puncii, with a smile.
"The better so, if what that ranting rantipole Lord RANDOLPH says is sooth,” retorted the slighter Shade, with a
touch of sardonic grimness. “Were I in the place of my living namesake, your present PREMIER, I'd take such order with
the rebellious springald as "
" You did with Essex, eh ?” interjected Puscu. “Well, well, times have changed. We are more tolerant than of
yore, and the Tower and the block are not now looked upon as the appropriate retort to indiscreet praters of Party rubbish
or personal rhodomontade.”
Then Sir Francis broke briskly in. “Supposing, good Sir, that some King of Spain's beard required summary singe-
ing; dost mean to say your singeing-irops are so ready, that your Singer-in-Chief could afford to finish his(game of bowls
ere he took them in hand ?”
“Listen !" cried Mr. Punch.
"The best troops of the country were at this time absent in Flanders, and there was no standing army except the Queen's
Guard and the garrisons kept in a few forts on the coast or on the Scottish border. The royal navy was extremely small; and the
revenues of the Crown were totally inadequate to the effort of raising it to anything approaching a parity with the fleets of Spain. It
was on the spontaneous efforts of individuals that the whole safety of the country at this momentous crisis was left dependent; if these
failed, England was lost ;,- but in such a cause, at such a juncture, they could not fail; and the first appeal made by the Government to
the patriotism of the people was answered with that spirit in which a nation is invincible.'
So writes the historian concern ng England on the eve of the advent of the Great Armada. Sir FRANCIS, despite doubts,
which I share with you, and notwithstanding maladministration, which, with all honest souls, I hate, I will back the

mental duffers—beshrew them can do much mischief, but there's one thing they cannot do."
" What is that?" asked both the Shades, eagerly.
" Stop our supplies of Drakes and CECILS, of HOWARDS and RALEIGHS, of ELIZABETIS and— VICTORIAS," respcoded
Mr. Punch. And,” pursued he, " if this were a war-beacon instead of a peacc-bonfire, trust me that from .Malvern's lonely
height' in the Midlands, again would flare forth the ruddy sigoal of ready loyalty,-
• Till Belvoir's lordly terraces the sign to Lincoln sent,
And Lincoln sped the message on o'er the wide vale of Trent;
Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burnt on Gaunt's embattled pile.
And the red glare on Skiddaw roused the burgbers of Carlisle !'"
“Marry! but this MACAULAY of yours hath the right British ring in bim !" burst forth DRAKE, enthusiastically.
“Nathless,” said Cecil, more soberly, “let not the old lion of England be caught napping, Mr. Punca."
“Sirs," said the Sage, stirring up the bonfire till it blazed forth afresh in sky-reddening radiance, “Sirs, there is an
inextinguishable beacon-lght, of another sort than this, ever before the eyes of that noble if somewhat somnolent animal,
which will prevent a fortuitous forty winks ever løpsing into the lethal lethargy of a Rip Van Winkle's slumber.”
“ And that ? " cried the Shades, simultaneously.
" It is light and fire made portable as the staff-hidden spark of Prometheus," answered Mr. Punch. “ Like unto
FAURE battery, it stores immense force in small compass, and for public convenience is replenishable half-yearly. It can be
multiplied to any extent, and conveniently carried to any distance. You, if you wish, can take it with you to illuminate the
Sbades, and warm your patriotic bosoms with knowledge and good hope."
“What is it?" ejaculated Mr. Punch's ghostly Visitants.
“Take it and try it, most noble Shadrs," responded Punch, heartily. “ By its light you shall see both the best and
the worst of the grand old land you grcatly loved, and as greatly served. You shall see how, despite the feuds of faction and
the fumblings of official folly, England is England still-only more so. You shall see how sleepless a sentinel, how vigilant

best worth seeing in this England of the Victorian Jubilee Year.”
Whereupon, without another word, Punch presented to the two illustrious Elizabethans his

ECHOES FROM THE JUBILEE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,–It is not very likely, that we shall have
another Jubilee for some little while; still, as it is always as well to
be ready for any eventuality, I send you a few notes that may be of
service to Londoners during the next celebration.

THE LONGEST DAY.
It is over!, What a day we've had! What a succession of days,
and nights! We saw the Procession from various Jubilee coigns of
vantage, -- a few of the five-sovereign gold pieces, merely as mementos
for our collection, we should not mind possessing, but at no point
was the demonstration more enthusiastic than in Trafalgar Square,
where heaming from among flags and flowers rose Mr. Punch in a
central window of the Grand Hotel to salute H.R.H. The Prince of
WALES—“ Heir Apparent, or Visible Prince,"—the sixteen mounted
Princes, and then to wave his bat to HER GRACIOUS MAJESTY, and
“with heart and voice to sing out, “God save the QUEEN!” The
Grand Hotel seated two hundred persons free! This was "doing
the Grand" in a right royal manner. During the entr'acte luncheon
was served in the salle à manger, where the arrangements met with
Mr. Punch's entire approbation.
There were several most remarkable features in this great
assemblage,-Mr. Punch's of course being the most noticeable-of
which we have observed no mention in any record that we have as
yet seen. The first was the Papal Envoy in a splendid carriage
driving Westwards. Where was he going? Had he mistaken the
route for Westminster Abbey ?
The next noticeable feature was Sir CHARLES WARREN pouncing
down on a too zealous Constable, and giving him such a shaking as
brought him to his best senses and elicited cheers from the crowd.
Then there were some foolish persons who would throw coppers
from the windows, and there were some irregulars who broke their
line to pick them up. One of the irregulars was put under arrest,
tried by Court Martial on the spot, and would (we suppose) have
been there and then shot, had it not been for a superior Officer who
re-heard the case in two minutes, gave his decision, reinstated the
offender, and gave the Officer who ordered the arrest a wigging that
was highly appreciated by the spectators.
The QUEEN returning was visibly affected, and Mr. Punch himself
wiped away a tear on seeing the Princess of WALES and the Princess
ROYAL bending towards her, and evidently sustaining her with their
affectionate sympathy: "Don't give way, Mother,” they seemed to
be whispering; "we're just home.” And though' her lip quivered,
the QUEEN did not give way, but bore herself bravely to the end.
It all went off admirably without a contretemps, except the
Marquis of LORNE coming a cropper, and even he went off admirably,
-and, falling on a very soft place, was unhurt. Being in Highland
costume, it was at first rumoured that he was "Kilt entirely.”
"Give me another horse! Bind up my wounds !” he cried; but as
there were no wounds to bind up, no special attention was needed: but
another horse was brought, and again he urged on his wild career,
reaching the Abbey comfortably in time for service. At the significant
request of H.R.H. the Prince of WALES, the Marquis is, it is said,
going to take lessons on buck-jumpers at Wild West Kensington.
"The French Nation is unrepresented, Sir,” observed one of
Mr. Punch's Staff to his Chief as the Royal Procession was passing

THE Jubilee Week was a bad one for Theatres and
Operas. At Covent Garden there was another splendid
performance of Un Ballo in Maschera. Quality was
present, Quantity was absent. Enthusiasm great.
Signor GAYABRE first-rate, and Mmo. Valda charming.
Mme. SCALCHI could not appear, but she had an excellent
substitute. In the Operatio Record of the Season, the
Garden is still to the front.
At the Lane AUGUSTUS DRURIOLANUS leads his hosts
with undefeated energy. So much for his hosts, but how
about his guests? Well, they did not care much about his
“Prima Donna Drammatica,” and wished that she were
more of the Prima Donna, and less of the Drammatica.
Then the weather being warmer,
Mr. HARRIS brought out Norma ;
in which Miss ENGLE (is she Engle-ish ?) was very nice
as Adalgisa, and her appearance quite explained Pollio's
little flirtation. In Don Giovanni the HAUK as Zerlina,
came out as the Nightingale. Mle. ARNOLDSON appeared
as Rosina in Il Barbiere, and, if she is not yet a JENNY
LIND or an ADELINA PÁTTI, she is, at all events, The
success of the Drury Lane Season. She has everything in
her favour, especially youth. May we have an Italian

that she will obtain the ear and voice of the public; not
of course in exchange for her own.

D
IT
SCENE - A snug anil seq westered if clily corner of the Eysian Fields. Present, the Shades of SAAKSPEARE and Bacox, engaged in
reading Mr. DONELLY'S egregious lucubrations, not without such mild and mitigated mirth as becomes the locality. To them
enters a small and sprightly Personage, light-footed, but of seeming cis-Stygian solidity.
Bacon
Shakspeare (together). ILillo !
Mr. Punch. That sounds human. Savours rather of my own Fleet Street than of the realms of the other Rhada.
manthue. What cheer, sweet Will? How fare you, Brother FRANCIS ?
[Salutes courteously.
Bacon. 'Twere affectation to ask who you are, Sir. The question, “How gat you here ?” may perchance be more
pertinent--and pardonable.
Mr. P. (airily). Oh, I had been for-say, the wth time—to see “ Our MARY" in The Winter's Tale, and being more
inclined for profitable talk than for s'eep, I just took you on my way home.
Bacon (smiling). Marry, Mr. Pusch, were the statement of sequence equivalent to the explanation of causation, yours
would be a most satisfactory answer.
Shaks. (mildly). Be not too scientifically scruticising, Brother Bacon. Mr. Pusch, Puck and Ariel in one, is free of
all places, lord of all latitudes, penetrator of all spheres, permeator of all elements.
Mr. P. True, sweet Will! How much niore catholic, in comprehension, as in charity, is the creative mind than
the merely critical one!
Bacon. Humph! That sounds Sphinxian. HERAOLITUS the Obscure was pellucid in compar son.
Mr. P. And yet, I warrant you, Master SAAKSPEARE here could play the “Diver of Delos” where your pundit's
plummet should not find bottom. However, “ broad-browed Verulam," let not that brow's breadth cloud or corrugate in
vexation at my persiflage. What do you read, Sir?
Shaks. “Words, words, words ! ”
Mr. P. “I mean the matter that you read."
Shuks. “Slanders, Sir." For the coney-catching rogue-one DONELLY—says here — but of course you know what
”
he says. [The trio laugh Homerically, until the asphodels wag their white heads and convulse their starry corollas in sheer
sympathy.
Bacon. By Democritus, laughter in these latitudes is seldom enough of this sort and compass.
Mr. P. To succeed in shaking the sides—of Bacon, here, is somewhat indeed, the greatest triumph, be sure, that
awaits the incongruous Cryptogrammatist.
Shaks. Would that Ben Joxeos were with us to join in the glorious guffaw.
Mr. P. Conceive Rare Ben being jockeyed into accepting you, his contemporary and tavern-companion, as the author
of such“ unconsidered trifles" as Hamlet and Lear, Othello and Macbeth, The Tempest and The Midsummer Night's Dream !
Wer't ever at the “ Mermaid,” VERULAN ?
Bacon. Verily, Mr. Purch, I should like mightily to have joined in that company, just for once, and to have discussed

the Cryptogram with the “Spanish great galleon " and the “ English man-of-war" (as FULLER puts it), whom DONELLY NOW
desires to knock, as it were, into one curiously composite craft. Did not this same maker of mare's-nests indite a fantastic
tome, full of bottomless argument and visionary particularity, concerning that fabled island or continent of Atlantis, which
the Egyptian priest told Solon had been swallowed up by an earthquake ?
Mr. P. Like enough, my Lord, like enough. Once a mare's-nester, al ways a mare's-nester. Nephelo-Coccygia was
terra firma compared with the elaborate but evanescent Cloud-Cuckoolands of riddle-reading theory-mongers.
Shaks. When EDIPUS gets crotchet-ridden the sooner the Sphinx devours him the better.
Mr. P. True, 0 Swan! Let the Great Brethren of British Genius b: brethren still-twins, if you please, but twain.
Verily it might almost pass the might of Mother Nature tc round two such splendid orbs into one. Rare Ben had his tribute
for you also, my VERULAM. “No man ever spake more neatly, more purely, more weightily, or suffered less emptiness, less
idleness in what he uttered." Might have been said of Me!
Bucon. Preise shared with you is praise indeed! But the language of the Realm of Phantasy-Will's own world-
the speech of Arcady, of Arden, of shadowy Elsinor-, of Prospero's eochauted Isle—Will's native tougue-passeth many a
league-long step beyond the "reatness" of the judgment-seat, or the "fulness" of the Novum Organum Scientiarum,
Mr. P. Well said, Wisdom !
Shaks. (chortling softly). Why, who knows? One day, perchance, - quons hence, of course, some puzzle-headed

House of Commons, Monday, June 27.-Back again to the Coercion
Bill. Report Stage reached, and strong whips out on both sides in
anticipation of Division. Both Front Benches crowded like the rest.
GLADSTONE in his place, as eager to make speech as if it were his
first on the subject. HARTINGTON there too, and CHAMBERLAIN,
making, with HENEAGE, a brave show on end of Front Bench.
GLADSTONE spoke early. A full House, but everyone bored to death.
Later, House thinned to degree that invited a count; but at sound

Would the Brahmin Head of Benares be allowed to approach HER

Then Sir GEORGE, uplifting his voice to its most melndious heights,
produced his poser :-
Would the Moderator of the Free Church of
Scotland enjoy such a privilege ?”
Old Morality and his colleagues on the Treasury Bench began to
grow uneasy. No saying where CAMPBELL'S list might end. FER-
GUSSON whispered to and nudged till, propped on his feet, he feebly
urged that Moderator of Free Church of Scotland does not come under
the category of a Foreign Potentate. A poor quibble this. But
CAMPBELL generously disinclined to push his advantage, and Govern-
ment escaped immediate defeat.

where should I be?
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (surprised). You! The question rather is,

Navy Estimates to be cut down Five Millions, each, eh ?

A DAY OUT. (By Jacques Junior )
A FISHING, paddling pic-nio! What, to stand
On the lush margent of the gusty stream,
With feet benumbed, and watch the bobbing quill,
And then to dine al fresco-not for JACQUES !
Where, for the smooth mahogany of Ind,
The unplaned earth is board; for cushion's chair
The damp earth, ant-infested, or rough root
Chafing the unaccustomed cuticle ;
Where mint sauce th' insecure platter doth o'errun,
With hose and doublet playing Lucifer;
Where glasses must be emptied as they're filled,
To the great prejudice of temperance,
Or, if set down, drops me a spider in,
To spoil the fortune he cannot enjoy,
Like Sir No-Company, who makes a third.
While e'en a grumble, relishabler far
Than that keen sauce of Sparta, is denied.
For one there'll be who'll not let ill alone,
But, “I prithee try this compound ; I learnt the kpack
In Venice,” or, “Thus in England wines are mix'd I
Pray you pronounce upon 't.” Another, worst,
Will keep all waiting while he spoils good food,
Concocting some vile preparation,
Calling 't a Sallet. "Taste in charity,
For Fate's against me; some ingredient
Of utmost import hath been left at home.”
And so the wholesome green is all besprent
With bile-disturbing mixture. Out upon't!
I'd rather find a kitten in a stew
Than one of these same preaching salad-bunglers.
What are the uses of al fresco meals ?
Who likes a toad, ugly and venomous, —,
Where's such a precious fool-upon the bread ?
And they who, in contempt, the Dryad's haunts
Profane with empty bottles and loose papers,
Find tongues in tarts, ants running on their boots,
Wasps in the wine, and salt in everything!

But they 're thundering ugly, your new Iron Walls,
And when a big fight comes,-well, look out for equalls.

THE COURT CIRCULAR.
THE Levée held by Mr. John CLAYTON, and Mr. ARTHUR CECIL,
on Friday night, was numerously attended. Excellent specimens
of Mr. PINERO's work were presented in the first Acts of the recent
Court successes—to wit, The Schoolmistress, Dandy Dick, and The
Magistrate. Mr. CLAYTON made an excellent speech, which was
enthusiastically applauded, and Mrs. John Wood and Miss
NORBEYS received special calls. After a brief interval, during which
Court favour will be extended to King William Street, Strand, a
more spacious palace will be erected for the reception of Courtiers in
Chelsea, where a new Comedy, by Mr. PINERO, will be presented.
Mr. ARTHUR CECIL, though retiring from managerial cares, will,
when the new Theatre is finisbed, undertake what would be a
difficult task for anybody else, to fill his usual place on the boards.

Portsmouth, Saturday, July 23, 1887.
DIFFICULT NAVIGATION;
OR, THE PROUD SKIPPER AND THE PATIENT "PILOT.
A (more or less) Nautical Ballad.
I.-AT SEA.
THE Government Yacht (with a rather mixed crew)
Sing hey, sing ho, and a capful of wind!
Sets sail to crack on with a will till all's blue.
Ho! the breeze blows brisk o'er the billow !
The Skipper is stout, if his looks are a clue
(But you mustn't trust them, you may err if you do),
And the smart second officer carries the blue
Like an amateur yachtsman at Margate. Woohoo!
The sea is as soft as a pillow.
The Government Yacht it sets sail in full state,
Sing hey, sing ho and a well-caulked
deck !
And what do you think of that canny first mate ?
Ho! the sky is as bright as a beryl.
That canny first Mate is a smart Volunteer,
And to look at his jib and to list to his cheer,
You would think as a hero he hadn't a peer,
Superior wholly to flurry or fear
In the tryingest moment of peril.
With a Skipper so stout and a Mate so astute,
Sing hey, sing ho, and an even keel!
The course of that yacht can't be hard to compute,
Ho! the sky shines fair in the offing !
SALISBURY dauntless, and Smith debonair,
And GoSCHEN a Nautical Ajax who'll dare
All the lightnings on hand-at least so he'll declare ! -
How finely with such a fine crew they should fare,
In spite of the land-lubbers scoffing.
Hooray!-Humph! By Jove that's a suddenish squall,
Sing hey, sing ho, and u spinnaker boom!
The Skipper, he doesn't look steady at all,
Ho! there's something amiss with the compass !
Whilst SMITH, the first Luff, looks a little less smart,
And GOSCHEN-by Jove, can he be losing heart ?
He swears there's some blessed mistake in the Chart,
Is his not the cool imperturbable part ?
Then why should he kick up a rumpus ?
It's hard navigation midst quicksands and rocks;
Sing hey, sing ho, and a chopping sea!
The hull has been strained by some smart little shocks,
Ho! the sky looks black in the offing !
Is this the plain-sailing you promised, my Lord ?
Why the rival Skipper will swear he has scored.
What say you, Chief Mate? It won't do to be floored,
Don't you think we had best take a pilot aboard,
In spite of piratical scoffing ?
II.-ON SHORE.
There's a smart Cookney Tar with his glass to his eye,
Sing hey, sing ho, and a Brummagem salt !
And what does the tria longshore yachtsman desory ?
Ho! he's spying like Robinson Crusoe !
The Pilot in pose imperturbable stands,
With slouching Sou'wester and pocketed hands,
But his eye's on the Yacht and he quite understands,
The fix of the Skipper-poor chap!- who commands,
Or at least is imagined to do so.
“Hillo!” cries the Cockney; "they're signalling now,
Sing hey, sing ho, and a flag to the peak?
If the Yacht runs aground, Mate, there will be a row.
Ho! the Pilot is peacefully winking.
I've an interest in her myself; can't afford
She should seek Davy Jones, not at least till I've scored.
How is it, my HABTY-beg pardon!—my Lord !
They signal a pilot; shall you go aboard
To save 'em from striking or sinking ?

FAX:
ROBERT AT SPITHEAD.
THE question as prayed on my mind during the long waits at the Rewiew on
Saturday, and which not ewen the Marines_couldn't anser, and for which I
dessay as I shall have to wait till the next Jewbilly afore I gits it sattisfac-
toryly xplained, is, why must these șillybrations be all begun so uncommon
hurly? There may be sum werry singlar peeple as likes burly rising. Having
probberbly nothink werry pertickler to do of a heavening, they, natrally goes
to roost hurley, like powltry, and plowmen, and such like, and having probberbly
nothink werry pertickler to do in the morning, they natrally gits up hurley
to do it, like the powltry aforesaid. But to Waiters in gineral and to Hed
Waiters in pertickler, nothink is so hawful as hurley rising. As late as you
like at nite and as late as you likes in the morning. Them's my sentiments
and I means to stick to 'em. And I suttenly thinks as I never seed sitch a
sleepy-looking set of gents as assembled at Warterloo Stashun at about arf-past
seven, Hay. Hem. on Saturday Morning. However, we most of us had a nice
refreshing slumber on the way down, and then pulled ourselves together for the
gorgeous specktacle.
My werry fust thort was, how about the foaming billows ? and I'm bound
to say as they behaved theirselves uncommon steady. There was no playfool
game of pitch and toss, but they were as quiet as Chelsea Reach. The number
of great big ships as we seed was enuff to make ewen an Hed Waiter proud of
his country, but I confesses that I carn't say much as regards their beauty, for
I thinks they was about as hugly a lot of black-looking monsters as ever tried to
rule the waves.
Having propperly attended to my offishal dooties, I learned from a most
respectable-looking Marine that it wood be at least two hours afore the QUEEN
came, so I thort I wood seize the hoppertoonity of increasing my nolledge of
ships and shippery by arsking my frend a few naughtical questions. Of course
I begun with the Anker, and arkst him when it was last weighed-he said,
about a week ago. How much did it weigh? Just 2 tun, 4 pound, 6 ounces.
Why did they weigh it so offen? To see if it wood stand the shivering of our
timbers when we fired our big gun. Had he spliced his mane brace lately?
Not during
the last
fortnite. Having got on so well with him, I thort I woodn't
not arsk him no more questions, for fear of betraying my hignorance, and I seed
him afterwards a pinting me out to sum grinning Sailers, ewidently as the
werry rewerse of a mere Land Lubber.
He had kindly shown me the best plaice to stand to see the QUEEN's Pursession
pass, so I quietly warked up to it about 3 a clock, wen she was xpected to start,
and there I waited till 4 a clock, and then we heard the gun fire as told us the
QUEEN had started; and then began such a deffening noise with all the ships a
salooting, as they calls it, and such a blinding smoke arterwards, that I wished
myself miles away: and then, jest as the Percession was a gitting in site, there
cum a order from the Hed officer, “ All below 1” witch I soon found out
meant as no one of us laymen was to stop on deck to see the QUEEN, for fear as
the QUEEN mite see us, witch wood have bin agin the rules! So we was all
bundled down stares, ladies and all, and a few was kindly allows to peep through
the Port Holes, as sumbody called ''em, though, as there wasn't no Port served
out, I carnt make out what that means.
I amost forgot to menshun the heat, but it really was that hot that when
a going for to lean cumferably against the Capstain Bar, I think they calls it,
it amost burnt a ole in my and! Speaking about this to my frendly Marine,
he told me as they didn't think nothink of that, for when they went to the
Troppix, wherever that may be, they allers cooked their stakes and chops on the
Fokestal by the heat of the Sun, which did 'em to a turn, and then roasted their
Appels for desert, and then biled the Kettel for Tea. . What a grand thing is
Nolledge! for I am free to confess as I was quite hignorant of all these fax
afore. But then it's werry easily accounted for in my frend's case.
He isn't like a mere common Sailer a got to look after the ship. A Marine
is of that shuperior class of man as is allers seleckted to receeve the most him-
portant hinformation. When anythink of a werry striking charackter occurs
it is allers reckomended that it should be “ told to the Marines," so they is
naterally allays brim full of hinformation, and allers reddy to communicate it
troothfully and onerably, as my frend did to me, and without which I shood
have remained in my prewious state of hignorance.
If arsked for
my reel opinion as to the Naval Rewiew, truth would compel me
to say that what with the noise, and what with the smoke, and what with being
ordered below jest as the QUEEN went past, I didn't see werry much of it, and
what I did see didn't strike me as werry himposing, like a Lord Mare's Show
for instance, or the Drewry Lane Pantomime. But it gave me the oppertoonity
of bragging about it to them as wasn't there, and that's abont the cause of
most peeple going to such things, I rayther fancies; but after all, there's such
a fine feeling of purfect safety on Terror Firmer, as nothink can't equal on the
bounding Sea, so I hopes when the next Naval Rewiew is held, that they'll have
it on Shore.

The whole huge Fleet the signal read-
Confound that thoughtless act of folly!
What could I do but bow my head,
And bid a long (?) adieu to SOLLY ?
I hear my name's on every tongue
As a true Sailor, brisk and cheery ;
That like a breeze my voice has rung,
And waked the Commons, dull and weary.
I'm little now to mirth inclined,
I'm not, as usual, gay and jolly,
But care I'll whistle down the wind,
And try to make it square with SOLLY.
You see 'twas getting on for night,
And true-bred tars, e'en midst carouses,
Think with considerate delight
About their sweethearts or their spouses.
Up went my signal, frank and free,
(A breach of rule most melancholy)
To "give the tip” to Lady C.,
And now I have to part with SoLLY.
“Tell Lady CHARLES to go on board
The Lancashire Witch, where I will join her".
And all the Fleet read this and roared.
Well-of strong words Jack 's a free coiner,
But never mind what I remarked
When I perceived my act of folly.
They 'll think the Naval Lord has larked !
Hang it! I'll say good-bye to SOLLY.
Such games aboard the Royal Yacht !-
Although I am a chartered rattle,
The Big-wigs won't stand this. 'Tis rot,
But with red-tape who, who can battle ?

THE END OF THE JUBILEE.
I've been to the Abbey, the Naval Review,
The Maske at Gray's Inn and the Institute too;
In fact I feel just like the Wandering Jew,
Or other historical rover:
I've turned day into night and the night into day,
In a regular rollicking Jubilee way,
And now I can truly and thankfully say,
I'm uncommonly glad that it's over.
I've been to a number of Jubilee balls,
And I'm really worn out by the parties and calls ;
I've fed in the City 'neath shade of St. Paul's,
And ate little fish by the river:
I've been to big picnics both up and down stream,
I've wallowed in strawberries smothered in cream,
Which, following lobster, most doctors would deem
Was remarkably bad for the liver.
I've read all the Jubilee articles, loads
Of Jubilee leaders and Jubilee odes,
And seen how each poet his Pegasus goads,
Though gaining but slight inspiration;
A chaos of Jubilee Numbers I've seen,
And Jubilee pictures and lives of the QUEEN,
And the Jubilee coinage that's greeted, I ween,
With anything but jubilation.
But, now all is over, sincerely I trust
The Nation no longer will kick up a dust,
The Jubilee really has done for me just
As Commodious" scared Mr. Boffin :
Any more jubilation would finish me quite,
As it is I've a horrible dream every night
That a Jubilee demon is screwing me tight
Down into a Jubilee coffin!

as to return trains for Germany. W. REDMOND " has had his attention called to him, and

more general cheering than usually falls to his lot when he wanted to know what reason could
be given for so extraordinary a mark of confidence ! GEORGY HAMILTON explained that there
was best possible reason. Prince Louis a heaven-born sea-Captain. No one like him among
ordinary Britishers. Appointed to Dreadnought simply because he was best possible man.
Then PICKERSGILL came to front. Couldn't object to First Lord's personal preference, but
gave notice that if Prince LOUIs were confirmed in command of Dreadnought he would move
that his salary be disallowed. More cheers. Idea of German Princeling holding office, how-
ever honourable, without drawing a salary struck Commons as comical. Subject seemed to

House of Lords, Monday, August 8.- Curious debate in Lords.
As everyone knows, GEORGE RANGER has given notice to Volunteers
that some of his tenants in neighbourhood of Wimbledon object to
the assembling of Camp, and so the tents must be struck. As Com-
mander-in-Chief, GEORGE RANGER is, of course, specially solicitous
for the prosperity and convenience of the great and singularly cheap
adjunct to regular forces. But as between a landlord's interest and
a patriot-soldier's sentiments sentiment must take back seat. Nice
thing to talk about in after-dinner speeches, and at opening of
Bazaars; but, GEORGE RANGER regrets to say, quite another pair of
GOVERNMENT
sleeves in actual life. So Camp must be struck.
To-night WEMYSS brings on Motion deprecating contemplated
procedure. Removal of the Camp, he said amid cheers, would be
* nothing short of a national calamity,” Would endanger progress
if not existence of Volunteer movement. Dook behaved most nobly.
Declared with tear in his voice that he would not be obstacle to free
course of debate. Lest Peers of England should be awed by his
presence when discussing matter of “national interest,” G. R would
withdraw, which he did! Noble Lords made free use of their liberty.
Wantage who, fresh from his command at Wimbledon, knows all
about it, deplored the contingency. SPENCER effectively brought the
ultimate ends of his left-hand whisker to witness that driving-out of
Volunteers from Camp would be “a
public disaster.” Harris hinted, on

tax-payer might somehow be brought

course with hand in breeches-pocket.

against loss real or imaginary, and so

everything. Why not leave our sacred
House to itself. ROSEBERY, everybody
knows, yearns after the Commons, an
institution which I believe is situated
in some parts of this building. I, for
one, very glad to get rid of him. Will
undertake, if I can get support (which I
don't doubt), to bring in Bill, legalising
ROSEBEBY's dismantling himself, and his
being qualified to sit in the Commons.”
HUBBARD (forget his new name) offers to back the Bill. “Yes,” said BRABOURNE," that will do admirably. You'll stand for new
Peers, and so whole House will be represented. Impossible that we, of the Ancient Peerage, can brook impertinence of this kind.”

LAWFUL (?) LATITUDE.
As "cross examination to credit,” has recently been considerably
developed by certain members of the legal profession, the following
questions are suggested to students studying for call to the Bar, or
admission to the roll of Solicitors, as likely to be peculiarly conducive
to qualification.
To a Bishop.—When your Lordship was at school were you ever
flogged ? Will you swear it was not for committing petty larceny? Did
you ever in your life steal an apple? When at the University were you
ever sent down? Will you undertake to say that you have never been
drunk? When you were two-and-twenty years of age did you ever
swear or use profane language ? Remember you are on your oath,
my Lord, and answer this—will you dare to assert that you have
never in the whole course of your life been guilty of conduct that
bad it been brought to light would not have been a proper theme for
denunciation from your Lordship's own pəlpit ?
To a General.- Now, Sir, have you ever been accused of cowardice ?
Is it not a fact that some little time before you obtained your first
commission you were known as "Tell-tale TIT”? Will you swear
you have never been guilty of cheating? As a matter of fact, did
you not frequently get a comrade to do your verses at Eton, and then
allow your tutor to believe that you had written them yourself?

When anyone who has been under treat-
ment a week, unexpectedly meets a friend
here, he stops short, stares at him, examines
him from head to foot, and then exclaims,
in a tone of utter astonishment, “What!!
you here!!" as if the new arrival were
either an intruder or a lunatio. The
person thus addressed immediately retorts
in an injured tone, “Well, what on earth
are you here for ?" and then he adds mali-
ciously, “there doesn't seem to be much
the matter with you.” Now to say this is
to utter your deliberate opinion that the
person you are addressing is at Royat (or
any other Salubrity Abroad wherever it
may be) under the false pretence of being an
invalid, and is therefore, to put it plainly,
a shammer, an impostor.
After this greeting, explanations follow.

the evidence to be incontestable, on the

retto, one asks which, as a body, most contribute to the prosperity of Venice,
and so merits most consideration . . . The penny steamer and the gondola
are irreconcileable, and cannot exist long together, for the simple reason that
the gondoliers cannot earn a support, and must take to other avocations."
" Exsul's” Letter to the Times on “ The Venice of To-day."
Shade of CHILDE HAROLD sings :-
Yes, this is Venice; yon's the Bridge of Sighs;
The palace and the prison, still they stand:
But 'midst the maze foul funnel fumes arise.
As by the touch of an enchanter's hand,
A bundred such their smoky wings expand,
Around me, and a dying glory smiles,
On what was once the poet's, artist's land,
Soot smears the wingéd Lion's marble piles,
And Venice reeks like Hull, throned
on her hundred isles.
She looks a swart sea Cyclops, from the ocean,
Rising with smutted walls and blackened towers;
The vaporetto, with erratio motion,
Muddies the waters with its carbon-showers.
And such she is! Progress's dismal dowers
Have spoilt the picture ; now the eye may feast
On garish signs and posters. Gracious powers !
Sewing-machines and hair-washes at least
Might spare the Grand Canal. Trade is an ogre-ish beast !

cuting the palace and the gondola . . . As to the gondola, the mass of Venetians
possess none, and rarely go in them ... They forget that the much-desired
foreigner does not come to Venice to read signboards from a steamboat up and
down the Grand Canal; and, by handing over this magnificent waterway to
a company of foreign speculators, they have well-nigh reduced the ancient
body of gondoliers to beggary. The steamers are numerous and noisy ... If

In Venice Vulcan's echoes hiss and roar,
And idle sits the hapless Gondolier.
His Gondola is crumbling on the shore,
The Penny Steamer's whistle racks his ear.
'ARRY exults—but Beauty is not here;
Trade swells, Arts grow-but Nature seems to die.
Hucksters may boast that Venice is less “dear,"

But, by great Ruskin's self, the thing is all my eye.
For unto us she had a spell beyond
Cheap dinners and Advertisement's array
Of polychrome, of which Trade seems so fond.
Alas! the Dogeless city's silent sway
Will lessen momently, and fade away,
When the Rialto echoes to the roar
Of vaporetti, and in sad decay
The Gondola, its swan-like fittings o'er,
Neglected rots upon the solitary shore.
Such is the Venice of my youth and age,
Its spell a void, its charm a vacancy.
Rosy Romance, thou owest mapy a page,
Ay, many that erst grew beneath mine eye,
To what was once the loved reality
Of this true fairy-land; but I refuse
To deck with Art's fantastic wizardry
A haunt of Trade. Mine is not Mammon's Muse,
She will not sing for hire of Soaps, or Silks, or Shoes.
I know that there are such,-but let them go, -
They came like ghouls, they'll disappear like dreams.
But oh! my Venice, dare they treat thee 80 ?
fain would flay the Vandal horde; still teems
My mind with memories of thy towers and streams, –
All that I sought for in thy midst, and found.
Must these too go ? The ogre Progress deems
Such fair and flattering phantasies unsound;
Now other voices speak, and other sights surround.
“The spouseless Adriatic mourns her lord,";
Ay, and yet worse, Venetian souls grow rude.
The Gondola lies rotting unrestored,
The Gondolier unhired must lounge and brood,
Or stoop to "stoking” for his daily food,
On board a puffing fiend that by." horse pow'r”
Measures its might. Oh! base ingratitude!
Dogs! ye one day shall howl for the lost hour,
When Venice was a Queen, with loveliness for dower.
Gondolas ruled, and now the Steam Launch reigns,
A stoker shovels where a lover knelt.
This thing of steam and smoke that stinks and stains,
Might suit the tainted Thames, the sluggish Scheldt ;
But the Canal, which for long years hath felt
The sunshine of Romance—that downward go ?
This is the deadliest blow that Trade hath dealt;
Enough to bring back blind old DANDOLO,
To fight his country's latest most debasing foe.
Before St. Mark still glow his steeds of brass,
But garish signboards glitter in the sun ;
And up and down the watery alleys pass
The snorting steamers. Venice lost and won,
Her thirteen hundred years of beauty done,
Sinks to an Isle of Dogs. Let her life close !
Better be whelmed beneath the waves, and shun
Ev'n in destruction's depths her Vandal foes,
Than live a thrall to Tradē, a scourge to eyes and nose.
Dreams of Romance-all shattered! They revile
Our “Ruskinismo," do these souls of dust,
Who care not for their sumptuous marble pile,
Oh, sons unworthy of their splendid trust!
With his oar broken, and his dry keel thrust,
Unused ashore, the Gondolier recalls
Gay days and nights of glory, such as must
Too oft remind him who his land enthrals,
And Alings a sordid cloud o'er Venice' shining walls.
How can the Childe's poetic shade refuse
To plead his cause, on his base foe make war?
Perchance redemption from a phantom Muse,
Whose voice now faintly echoes from afar,
May come, and check his sordid conqueror's car,
E'en in its roll of victory, snatch the reins,
From Greed's foul hands and further havoo bar,
Say, shall

CASE-Oʻ-MY-BANKER.
(The Story of Another Child.)
Tor Boy stood in the sweltering street,
Whence all but he had fled ;
The fast-departing dog-days' heat,
Flamed fall upon his head.
He was not beautiful nor bright,
Nor born to rule the storm;
A most unlucky urban wight;
A small, yet grimy, form.
His parents could not grant the boon
-A fortnight's Country air;
They would have spared him precious soon,
But had no cash to spare !
He called aloud: "Kind Public, say,
If me you have forgot!”
But far from Town the Public play
Unconscious of his lot.
"Speak, millionnaires," again he cried,
"If I'may not levant!"
And but the falling leaves replied,
And daylight growing scant.
Upon his brow he felt the breath
Of summer slowly fail,
And looked and prayed for kindly aid,
As seaman for a sail.
Meanwhile the Children's Country Fund,
Formed near the roaring Strand,
(At Buck'n'ham Street, the Number Ten,)
Had no more cash in hand !
He murmured faintly once again,
Kind Public, must I stay?"
While to the seaside cab and train
Bore happier lads away.
Ah, Publio! You this Summer's heat
Have felt at Pleasure's marts ;
Think how you'd like it in the street,
Before it quite departs !

a traitor or a dezerter. Luckely they missed me, and, laying down their mur-

I remaned fixt on the spot. Luckely my son WILLIAM came by in a Bote, so I
hollowed to him, and, getting in, he pulled me across the foaming River. I
luckely remembered hearing 2 of the Tems Consewatifs a torking at the LORD

They must have bin quite fust-rate shots, for wen a hole flock of pidgeons flew
into their garden, amost close to 'em, they all three fired at the lot, and acshally
wounded one of 'em, poor thing.
When warking by the side of the River this arternoon, I was arsked by a
young, but not werry successful angler, what o'clock it was. I told him, in
course, and he said as he coudn't fish no more, as it was lunch time, so we warked
along together, and he told me all his trubbels. He had þin at it for five days,
and had never cort but one fish, and he was too little to keep. He was a nice
brite young chap, so I simpathised with him. He said other peeple cort plenty
of fish, but they came and looked at his bait, and then turned round and swum
away; so I gave him a bit of adwice as I had wunce herd of. Don't buy your
flys, I ses, but make 'em yourself. Anythink will do if it has 4 legs, and 2 wings

he gobbles up your fly, and so you has bim slick. How my young frend did

my gaze! It used to be one of the atrakshuns of the place for anyboddy as could
walk. What is it now! All the roads as bin dug up, and left so, and at the
entrance to the lovely paths there are orrid bords put up, saying, “No path-
trespassers persecuted.” But it isn't true. They are Paths, and they leads every-
where, and I wasn't persecuted. All the finest trees are smeared over with dirty
bills, saying, “No person allowed to camp, land, or picknick," and sumbody
had added, ** Or cough, or sneeze, without permission I". As a poor feller said
to me, who was hobbling along on the horful road, and who knew the late pro-
pryeter, "Ah, a kind, Cristian Landlord ought to live as long as he posserbly
can, for he never can tell what's to foller."
There's a place there where the Wolunteers practises firing, and I'm afraid
they must be werry careless, for they writes up, “No one must damage the pro-

Lo! the sea-gulls slowly whirling
Over all the silver sea,
Where the white-toothed waves are curling,
And the winds are blowing free.
There's a sound of wild commotion,
And the surge is stained with red;
Blood incarnadines the ocean,
Sweeping round old Flamborough Head.
For the butchers come unheeding
All the torture as they slay,
Helpless birds left slowly bleeding,
When the wings are reft away.
There the parent bird is dying,
With the crimson on her breast,
While his little ones are lying
Left to starve in yonder nest.
What dooms all these birds to perish,
What sends forth these men to kill,
Who can have the hearts that cherish
Such designs of doing ill ?
Sad the answer : English ladies
Send those men, to gain each day
What for matron and for maid is
All the Fashion, so folks say.
Feathers deck the hat and bonnet.
Though the plumage seemeth fair,
Punch, whene'er he looks upon it,
Sees that slaughter in the air.
Many a fashion gives employment
Unto thousands needing bread,
This, to add to your enjoyment,
Means the dying and the dead.
Wear the hat, then, sans the feather,
English women, kind and true;
Birds enjoy the summer weather
And the sea as much as you.
There's the riband, silk, or jewel,
Fashion's whims are oft absurd;
This is execrably cruel ;
Leave his feathers to the bird !

BACKING BACO.
THE movements of Prince FERDINAND, as recently reported,
appear to be shrouded in some mystery. It was announced that his
Mamma was about to join him, and that a suite of apartments was
being already prepared for her reception at the Palace. No sooner,
however, was this encouraging piece of_news published, than it was
followed by a sinister rumour that the Prince himself was about to
hurry off from Sofia to Baco, one of his country-seats on the frontiers
of Hungary. As there is no mention of his being accompanied by
his suite, it is doubtful if, in going to Baco, the Prince intended to
take "returns.” Naturally the Sobranje would like to be assured
that, in going to Baco, he was really only going there and back, and
did not mean, as the name of the place might suggest, to back out of
the situation altogether. But perhaps there may not be, after all,
any good foundation for the story of the proposed journey, in which
event all this disturbing talk of a visit to Baco will probably end, as
it naturally should, in smoke.

HOUSE AND HOME.
MY DEAR MONEYPENNY,
PRAY excuse one more refusal of your kind and seasonable
invitation, so often repeated, to come and stay with you at the
"Sycamores.” Believe me, there is nobody in the world than your-
self I had rather live with if obliged to choose somebody. But to pass
more than a few hours at a stretch in anyone's house besides my own,
is more than I can abide, unless now and then for a night or so at an
hotel, where I am not expected to notice anybody, and nobody minds
me except the waiters in attendance, whom I am not ashamed of
giving trouble. Besides, my dear fellow, you have no idea of what
my making myself at home in your quarters as I do in my own
would mean. Am in the first place, a very late riser. If my mind
is occupied with any problem, usually lie in bed and think it out,
very often until noon, or, even later.
When I have done breakfast (invariably taken in my own room),
I always smoke a pipe, and then set-to at reading or writing for
a longer or shorter time, and go on smoking at intervals in the mean-
while. Sometimes sit and meditate till I lapse into a brown study,
and am then liable to dream day-dreams, and fall into fits of un-
conscious cerebration, in which I frequently start up and spout
SHAKSPEARE, or sing songs, or hum passages in operas, oratorios,
symphonies, and overtures, a trick which, as my voice is very harsh
and discordant, would of course be most 'irritating and offensive to
anybody who could hear me, as would be generally the case anywhere
out of my own den. Could never bear to be punctual to meal times,
must always dine at what time it suits me; am utterly incapable of

that the last Southbourne Park train should

is any danger attending the experiment of
mixing equal parts of nitro-glycerine, gun-
cotton, and sulphuric acid in an iron tank in
your back-garden ?" We have never tried
it, so cannot say. The best modus operandi
would be to invite your landlord, mother-in-

EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, September 13.—The House is “up,”
or nearly so, and it not altogether, more shame for it. We are, as
will be seen from thumb-nail sketch annexed. I'm not only up, but
have been off for a clear week. Come back just to hear HARCOURT'S
Speech. Liked to go finally before, but ARNOLD MORLEY wouldn't
let me. “Get a pair,” said he, when I again broached subject, "and
go as soon as you like.”
All very well to say, “Ģet a pair,” but where do they grow? In
moody thought, and growing despair, met HARTINGTON's dog. Here
was chance! "Roy” rather nondescript politician. Says he's a
Liberal, but þarks in favour of Government, and, though admits
they're not always right (opposed them, for example, on ČADOGAN'S
Amendment to Land Bill, and on Proclaiming of National League),
yet steadily votes for them. Is, in short, a Liberal-Unionist. We're
asked not to pair with Liberal-Unionists. But exceptions to every
rule; will make one here. “Ror” delighted. Says he's sick of
politics, and would like a roll on pasture-land.
Nearly everyone else off, pair or no pair. Irish Members, with
exception of PARNELL, have nowhere else to go, so make up their
minds not only to stop themselves, but to be the cause
of stopping in
others. PARNELL long ago gone off shooting. The O'GORMAN MAHON
shook his hand all the way across Palace Yard, and assured him he
might go without a sense of uneasiness.
I'll keep mee oi on things when ye'er gone, dear Bhoy,” he
said, giving his Chief resounding whack on back that nearly knocked
him down.“ "We learnt a thing or two when gettin' the Bill o'
Roights through, and I've seen a thrifle since."
A dreary place the House, yet struggling through fag-ends of
work. Not a cheery Session from any point of view. No new
reputations made; some old ones shaken, some shattered.

incidentally suggests that that wily monarch was guilty of a crime
with which he has not hitherto been credited-a proneness to give
imitations of Mr. IRVING in the character of Mephistopheles. For
the rest, the piece itself is most interesting, is capitally staged, and
in the subordinate characters, fairly acted. In the Red Lamp, which
followed the Ballad Monger, Mrs. TREE appeared as princess
Claudia, the part originally played, and excellently played, by Lady
Monckton. Although probably accustomed to roles of a lighter
kind, she was fairly equal to the occasion. As for her husband, as
Demetrius, he was simply admirable and inimitable.

VAUGHAN, and Messrs. MERVIN, CAFFREY and PRINCE MILLER.
Another great merit of The Barrister is that he is closely associated
with the word "brief." He makes his appearance every evening at
nine and has retired for the night before eleven. I fancy, that unlike
many other “gentlemen of the long robe," he will have plenty of
work to do during the Long Vacation and after.
Mr. BEERBOHM TREE, who has become lessee of the Haymarket,
has commenced his management by producing a one-act romantio
play, called The Ballad Monger, a version (capitally adapted by the
two WALTERS-POLLOCK and BESANT) of M. THEODORE DE BANVILLE's
Gringoire. I remember the same piece was "done into English "
some twenty years ago at a Gaiety matinée, when the translator,
Mr, ALFRED THOMPSON, appeared himself as the principal character,
with the probably unlooked-for result of shelving the drama, so far
as London was concerned, from that distant date until last Thursday
evening: However, the motif of the play is pretty well known.

appreciated by those who have benefited either from the
good offices of the School Board or the careful tuition of
the leading Universities. Mr. WILLARD, is so good that
no one pays particular attention to the efforts to please
of his fellow-actors and actresses. The scenery of the
Pointsman is sufficiently ingenious to satisfy the crav-
ings for sensation of a typical British audience. The
Railway collision worked as a sort of transformation scene,
- the interior of a signal-box changes into the site of a
fatal accident-creates much enthusiasm, but the win-
some if vindictive WILLARD still remains the centre of
attraction. In the last Act a good deal of gunpowder is
burned advantageously to the simplification of the
issue. It is scarcely necessary to say that, when the
Curtain falls, what remains of Virtue is triumphant, and
all that is left of Vice is on the road to justly merited
punishment. The Pointsman is likely to remain on the
line of the Olympic bills for many a week to come. I

the nearest Fever Hospital ?”. Because self-preservation (or
preserving a case for oneself) is the first law of nature, and
also because in London neither the registration nor the
isolation of infectious disease is considered at all essential.
Of course it is to be regretted that some of the fever pa-
tients who were taken the other day first to the West
London Hospital in Hammersmith, then to the London Fever
Hospital, and afterwards to Stockwell, and who finally—as
those institutions were quite full-spent the night in a
draughty corridor of the Homerton work-house, should have
collapsed owing to exhaustion ; but then what an admirable
thing it is that there should be so many places for the recep-
tion-or rejection-of patients, and that they should be scat-
tered all over the Metropolis !
It is really rather irritating that the laundress, whose
services we have had to dispense with owing to five of her
children being down with typhus, should call us “selfish"
and "finicking," and threaten to summon us to the Police
Court for interfering with her business.
Yes, a trip by steamer on the Thames can be confi-
dently recommended to delicate persons in search of health.
Wrap the whole face in cotton-wool, which has previously
been soaked in some powerful disinfectant. Get the man at
the wheel to sprinkle your clothing every ten minutes with
the anti-cholera mixture. When passing “Barking Out-
fall,” be particularly careful to go below, and keep your
head completely buried in a basin containing a mixture of
smelling salts in solution and Eau de Cologne. Beyond a
sore throat for a week or two, you will probably—thanks to
these precautions-experience no evil results.

I saw a vision in my sleep,
The earth had swung with secular sweep
To the last gulf of Time.
I saw the last of human mould,
Alone, unfriended, unconsoled
As ADAM when the night first rolled
O'er Eden's early prime.
The San's eye had a sickly glare,
The Earth with age was wan;
The wrecks of shattered thousands were
Around that lonely man.
Some had expired in pain,-its brands
On olammy face and clutching hands, –
In sudden palsy some.

Pain's very voice was dumb.
Still, statue-like, that lone one stood,
With fixed earth-seeking eye,
Silent as a flame-blasted wood
When winds have all swept by.
The last surviving unscathed One!
His face was grey, his race was run,
Cold as antarctio snow,
Unmoved by hopes, untouched by fears,
Left by the tide of human tears
That never more may flow.
He moaned, “No more shall man let stand
His power, his pride, his skill;
The arts that made fire, flood, and land
The vassals of his will.
Yet shall I mourn man's vanished sway,
The Systems that have had their day?

The triumphs with which earth once rang,
The Progress which spared not one pang
To trampled human hearts !

this change in the public taste for carpets. Whether

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
FROM A YOUNG MAN STILL IN THE COUNTRY.
Eaton Hall, Saturday.
One additional drawback from a quite unexpected
source makes itself known by correspondence with my
colleagues. They are all in a dreadful state of fussy
alarm. My uncle the Markiss begs me to be careful.
“ Firmness without Rashness" is an excellent copy-
head, which W. H. SMITH sends me in fine round-hand
from the distant Mediterranean. I wish they'd all mind
their own affairs. In the intervals of my other occupa-
tions I can answer for Ireland, and if any awkwardness
arises, I can put up KING-HARMAN to answer for me.
So, dear TOBY, don't you have any anxiety on my
account. Some half-hour after dinner, with the contem-
plative toothpick at hand, and my heels on the table, I
will, if the subject occurs to me, settle the Irish Question.
Yours faithfully, ARTH-R B-LF-R.

was last Wednesday, -that is, judging by the

me), and if there is another of the sort, we
shall vote that the Times isn't taken in here

like that. A word from you will be sufficient,
I am sure.

Appears quite hurt at its condition; says, “I've sat on

commends my carrying a “bowie-knife" instead. Am
surprised at JESSE's acquaintance with deadly weapons.
Ask him what historical event took place at Coleraine.
Says he doesn't know and doesn't care. But what's he
here for except to keep me posted up in local details ?
Hint to him that “I hope I may be able to offer him

Off to Ireland !-At last. COLLINGS with me, of course :-rather grumpy,
because SALISBURY's got the credit of passing the Allotments Bill, instead of
himself. Still, JESSE better than nobody. Would create bad impression to visit
Belfast without an entourage.
In Steamer.-Look up my Irish History-or rather, JESSE's Irish History,
which he's borrowed from Birmingham Free Library. An Alderman can do
that sort of thing. Also examine revolver. Not accustomed to carrying one.
What is the best place for it? JESSE says, "left-hand coat-tail pocket,
decidedly, because then you can whip it out in a twinkling.” JESSE's confidence

revolvers, like a cow-boy, -or a “three-acres-and-a-cow-boy." Do as he ad-
vises. Very uncomfortable feeling. Sit down on revolver in a moment of
forgetfulness, and nearly blow Captain's head off. Captain irritated. Asks me
for "ransom." Ridiculous !
Belfast.-No end of a reception. Drive through the principal streets.
Enthusiastic populace insist on taking horses out of carriage and pulling it
themselves. Gratifying, but should feel safer with the horses. Why will Col-
LINGS bow? I'm the person to bow, obviously. Bad taste, but don't like to
stop him. Believe the mob take him for me-or why do they cheer him so ?
At Hotel.—Just found out reason of enthusiasm evoked by appearance of
JESSE. He's got on an Orange tie! Ask him, reproachfully, why he did this?
Pretends it was a mere accident-forgot that orange was favourite Ulster colour.
Don't want a religious riot, so make him take it off. JESSE getting grumpier.
Can't help it.
Evening.–Before going to meeting, had better find out what Belfast chiefly
famous for. Ask COLLINGS. Replies "linen-shirts and handkerchiefs." Try
to put him in good humour by remarking that “ he seems shirty." Is there no
other historical fact connected with place? “Yes," he replies, “visit of Lord
RANDOLPH CHURCHILL.” Wish he hadn't mentioned latter event. Dispiriting.
Reminds one of proposed National Party, with self and RANDOLPH as sole leaders
-and sole followers, too, it seems.

AN AUTUMN LAY.
(By a Belated Oarsman.)
COME, little Maid, to the cracked piano,
The semi-grand in the coffee-room;
We'll take your harmonies all cum grano,
For the strings vibrate like the crack of doom.
Over the lawn the flat clouds loom,
And when they lighten the rain falls faster;
Like gossips who relish a friend's disaster
The ducks quack loud in the rain-ruled gloom.
I've studied the cracks in the ceiling-plaster,
And the statuettes with their stolid leer,
And the landscape visions of some Young Master,
Who viewed the world through a haze of beer.
We've done as much with the hostel's cheer
As sane men may in corpore sano ;
So come, little Maid, to the cracked piano.
Play us“ The Battle of Prague," my dear.
The silence clouds, like a potion shaken,
As the limp strings jar to an ancient pain ;
Their light and sweetness no touch can waken,
And only the dregs of a tone remain.
The silk-sewn music with fray and stain
Swoons on the keys at the urgent stages,
And the little Maid, as she props the pages,
Just murmurs, “Bother!" and starts again.
And the streaming window again engages
The thoughts that stray from the field of Prague ;
And the moping birds in their gauze-girt cages,
And the wax-work fruits of a genus vague;
And the flies that buzz like a lazy plague
Round the lone lorn jam, as it stands forsaken;
And the varnished pike in the mill-pool taken
About the year that they fought at Prague.
But twilight falls, and its folds encumber
The misty mounds of the patient trees,
And sunset cheers with a touch of umber
The puddles of steel-gray Gruyère cheese.
And, interposing a little ease,
Our frail thoughts dally with false surmises
Of a morning as brilliant as mid July's is
With bravest sunshine and sweetest breeze.
Alsoothing silence the soul surprises,
For the little Maid, like a hero true,
Has fought her fight through its poignant crises,
And shown what practice can dare and do.
And, tearing the moonlight in handfuls through,
A giant arm in the cloudland sombre
Scatters the light on a world of slumber,
Through snowy craters, from gulfs of blue.

Greenery Yallery Gallery. I fancy, from all I
have heard, that the sort of thing I want will
be found in the Greenery Yallery Gallery."
She was quite pleased at the notion. To tell
the truth the Spirit of Art was rather weary
of perambulating the streets of London-not
even the advertisements of BUFFALO BILL on
the hoardings gave her lasting satisfaction.
“Let me consider,” she said, as she hovered
on the threshold of the Grosvenor Gallery,
“now I shall find myself amongst the grandest
works of Mister JONES. I am never tired of
that pale face with the pointed chin—no more
is Mister JONES. This frequently-reproduced
portrait of a lady is most interesting. No
doubt it is a study of a chronic case of
dyspepsia that must have lasted for twenty
years. Then I shall see the choicest works
20 of MORE and MILLAIS, and WATTS, and oh,
joy! of Sir COUTTS-LINDSAY! This is indeed
the very spot for a resting place.”.
So the Spirit of Art glided up the staircase
and into the Grosvenor Gallery. For a moment
she was puzzled. There was no dyspeptic lady
"no greenery” and very little gallery.".
Then she shivered, for on all sides she found
immense pictures of battles and executions
ghastly beyond description.
“Why, what are these?” she gasped.
“What are these pº
“ Catalogue, Miss ?” replied a civilattendant.
“Thank you, Miss, - sixpence.”
And then the Spirit of Art read that such
and such a picture represented a dreadful de-
feat, that a pestilent hospital, yonder one a
soene of torture. She found representations of
war treated in the most prosaic and unbeauti-
ful form.
She was horrified and fainted !
Then the vision before her became more and
more terrible and the entire contents of the
Catalogue was unfolded before her. Dying
soldiers defying vultures, mutilated Russians
lying in an open grave, old men being blown
from the guns! Wounds, and fire, and blood !
When she came to herself she hurried away.
She thought it out.
“I must gradually accustom myself to less
horrible things,” she whispered. "I will begin
at once. If I were not to do this by degrees,
I should go mad!” She called a hansom.
“Where to, Miss ? "
“To the Marylebone Road,” cried the Spirit
of Art-in these days the Spirit is a very self-
assertive young person, and not at all like an
unprotected female—"Baker Street Station,
Marylebone Road.”
Then she threw away her Catalogue..
“I must see something less repulsive than
this-I must gradually resume my normal con-
dition. Something less repulsive! I have it!
I will begin with the figures of Madame Tus.

thing, and he doubtless doesn't feel it.
How is GR-ND-LPH getting on? Not so well as he
used, I fancy. His new attitude of friendly neutrality
does not suit him, and is, moreover, not nearly so attrac-
tive with the people as what I may call his Malayan
manner, when he used to run amuck at every body,
including myself. It was a very dull speech he made at
Sunderland on Thursday. He must certainly wake up,
if he means to keep his old place. . Perhaps he is, like
me, getting aweary of the whole thing, and wishes he
were well out of it. If I had my will, I would cut the
whole business, and spend my days and nights in the
laboratory here. But that cannot be, for the present at
least. So you will hear from me soon in the midst of the
fray; and, in the meantime, mind you understand that
I am in the best of spirits, confident in the present, and

THE ACTOR'S PROGRESS.
WITHIN the last half-century, the education of actors
has advanced in an extraordinary degree, inasmuch as
some have been known to take a degree, or try to, at
the University. Therefore the following advertisement
in the Era will probably cause little surprise :-

a few Weeks, while a Member of the Company returns to
Oxford to take his degree. Must be a gentleman. Address, &c.
This gentleman, to use the language of the Era, seems
inclined to “combine leading business with general
utility.” It is to be hoped he will get his degree, and
return to be an ornament to the stage. But if this
kind of thing goes on, we shall probably eventually see
announced in our theatrical contemporary—“ Senior

Writing to you, cher Toby, in the confidence of friendly corre-

temper is perhaps a little peculiar. I am essentially a fighting-man.
If any one bites his thumb at me I will know the reason why, and
no considerations of what is politic will prevent me from returning
a blow. I know that some people think I'm almost to be pitied
because (as they put it) I have hopelessly thrown away a position
which no one but myself could have destroyed. They think I am
politically done for. We shall see. However it be, I shall not forget
the wild joy of battle that the events of the past year have purchased
for me. I like it best with my back to the wall in the House of
Commons, when my old friends jeer and howl at me, and the rap-
turous cheers of the Conservatives testify their pleasure at seeing me
of all men playing their game as they think. I confess things at
the moment are not from any point of view very bright. But I can
afford to wait, strong in the assurance that I can do better without
the Liberal Party than the Liberal Party can do without me. They
call me a Dissentient, which reminds me of a story I once heard

his revelations as to his past career, as was Cardinal NEWMAN in his
straightforward Apologia pro sua vita. In fact in these SOTHERN
latitudes—there was a great deal of latitude in that quarter—Mr.
FRITH's work is suggestive less of an autobiography than of a
naughty-biography. He owns that he feels" humiliated and pained ”
at recounting T'HACKERAY'S rude jocularity towards himself, and
from the apologetic tone with which he introduces some of SOTHERN'S
caddish practical jokes, in which Mr. FRITH had no share, and of
which he was not the victim, it may be inferred that he had already
begun to feel “humiliated and pained ” at having given so much
space to such stories. How glad he must now be that he kept a
dear Diary,” which has been an invaluable aid to his memory
Another great merit in the book is that, without ever sacrificing
its character as an Autobiography, it is never egotistical; egoism
being the great “I-sore" of such works. Should the humble indi-
vidual who writes this necessarily brief notice ever arrive at the
time for publishing his Recollections, he is perfectly sure that the
book will be unequalled as a work of imagination. Mr. FRITI tells
us how he improved his pictures by touching them up, --some
people, too, are occasionally improved by the same process, if the
touching up” is only done judiciously, -and his self-restraint is
therefore really admirable when he rejects the temptation to em-
bellish, or spice, a story which no one is likely to contradict. For
instance, in what may be called the Sass-age portion of his early life,
he has some amusing anecdotes about Mr. JACOB BELL, then an Art
student. BELL drew a man hanging, and Sass, the master, told him
to leave the studio, “as such a career, as the man hanging, “is a
bad example to your fellow-pupils." Now Mr. FRITH ought to have
given BELL a triumphant exit speech-he ought to have said to Sass,
* Sir, I was only illustrating what should be the fate of every one of
your successful pupils—to be hung on the line. Good day." Exit
BELL. Then he recounts how JACOB BELL, who, like SOTHERN, had
a taste for such practical jokes as are utterly indefensible on the
score of good taste and gentlemanly feeling, dressed up as a woman,
and went to a Quakers' Meeting House, where he sat among the
female portion of the congregation. Thinking he was discovered,
this nice young man "took fright,” and bolted. Here Mr. FRITH
should have made the jovial JACOB subsequently explain that "he
left because the women were all jealous of him, as he was the only
'BELL'among them.” Mr. Frith, full of his fun, jests, and humour,
must be congratulated on having stuck to the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
a
THE FOUR NOBLE BURGLARS.
A BARON, a Marquis, a Duke, and an Earl
Were dining together one evening at White's;
They were all overdone by the worry and whirl
Of a long London season's amusements and sights-
By the luncheons that stupify, dinners that tire,
Dull rides in the Row, deadly
five o'clock teas,
At which fashion condemns you to gasp and perspire
While draining the cup of ennui to the lees.
No pleasure they took in the joys of the table;
Though stalwart, they recked not to breakfast or sup-
E'en to plunge at bézique they no longer were able,
For the fact was these nobles were deuced hard up!
Moaned the Marquis, “We're all in a state of depression ;
As for me, my existence is simply a bore;
Let us strike a new line out-adopt some profession
Which no British Peer ever practised before.”
They hankered for something quite simple and plain,
Both suburban and poor, for their trial essay;
So they picked out a one-storeyed house down a lane,
Which they learned had been empty for many a day.
They commenced their attack in the dead of the night,
Scaled a wall, dug a tunnel, and cut through two floors,
Wrenched a lock off with stern, irresistible might,
And broke open some thoroughly unsecured doors.
For booty they hunted below and on high-
But naught could they find save a chunk of cold veal,
Till, down in the basement, they chanced to espy,
Near the back-kitchen sink a huge trapdoor of steel.
In a second the trap from its fastness they tore,
When, heaped up pell-mell, of all shapes and all sizes,
The gratified Peers beheld score upon score
Of grand and legitimate housebreakers' prizes, –
Tiaras of rubies and diamond rivières,
Superb jewelled bracelets and brooches and rings,
Great emerald, sapphire, and pearl solitaires,
And all manner of precious, magnificent things.
As they gazed on these treasures with glittering eyes,
Lightly handling the gewgaws with delicate touches,
The Duke softly murmured, “Oh! what a surprise !
Why, some of these trinkets belong to the Duchess!,”
“By Jove!” said the Marquis, “ this carcanet here
Has been worn scores of times by my dowager-aunt!"
And the Baron rejoined, " It seems perfectly clear
That this squalid abode is a regular plant!”
What a joke!” cried the Earl. “We have chanced on the ken
Of professional brethren, our seniors in guile,
And I think that, for young inexperienced men,
We have collared their plunder in workmanlike style.
Let us cull and remove these nefarious hoards,
We can turn the whole lot into cash at our leisure;
A delightful career is before us, my Lords,
A bright future of usefulness, profit, and pleasure!,”
The next day they disposed of their swag for a plum,
And invested the proceeds in Spaniards and Turks,
After nobly deducting a moderate snm
For the Burglar's Relief Fund and other good works.
They paid all their creditors, kept up their rank,
Betted ponies and monkeys like regular “toppers ;”
Till one night, as they'd just broken into a bank,
These deserving young nobles were nailed by the coppers."
The Old Bailey was crowded one sundy May morn
With ladies arrayed in superlative frocks,
When the jury who sate on our nobles forlorn,
Found them guilty at once, without leaving the box.
And it thus came to pass, I regret to relate,
That these earnest, industrious, well-meaning Peers,
The pride of their order, the stay of the State,
Were condemned to pick oakum for twenty-one years!

mu

A WORD FOR THE WAR-OFFICE.-Mrs. RAMEBOTHAM says it's
all very well to talk about the parsimony of the War-Office; but
she hears that the soldiers are provided with fatigue jackets, and
thinks it's really kind of the authorities to supply the men with
something special to wear when they are tired.
Then the Baron cried. “ Listen, old chappies ; I've hit
On a notion that's brilliant and perfectly new ;-
Why shouldn't we four try to burgle a bit,
And wrest from the wealthy what's fairly our due ?
Garotting is vulgar, and cruel to boot,
The pickpocket oft is despised when detected ;
But burglary's just the profession to suit
A lover of enterprise, highly connected.”
A paper was fetched, and his Grace read aloud
The following paragraph :—“Criminal Tips !
Young Nobles and Gentlemen under
a cloud
Apply to Professor JEHOSHAPHAT FIPPS,
At his residence, 2, Sheppard Buildings, E.C.,
Where he nightly, gives lessons, from seven till nine,
To youngsters of spirit, from prejudice free,
In arts which amusement with profit combine.”
Next evening the Peers, fully dressed for their parts
In moleskin and highlows and flat beaver-caps,
Sought out the Professor with quick-throbbing hearts,
Their courage all but in a state of collapse.
Mr. FIPPS gave them seats; then politely inquired,
If aught to oblige them perchance he could do,
And replied, when they told him what 'twas they required,
“All right, noble sportsmen !-I'll soon put you through !”
He taught them to handle the jemmy with grace,
To frisk with the centrebit, toy with the file-
To Aourish the fitful dark-lantern apace,
And wield the gay crowbar in elegant style;
With skeleton-keys to pick counting-house locks,
To ply the dumb saw and the chisel that's cold,
To prize rp the lid of a banker's strong-box,
And the portals of burglar-proof safes to unfold.
When their Lordships were thoroughly versed in their trade,
And had passed their exams. in a masterly way,
They agreed that a dashing attempt should be made,
Their expertness to test without further delay.
Should they first try their hands at a light, easy job,
Not too risky, but graceful, artistic and neat,
Or essay a bold stroke the Exchequer to rob,
Or the merry Old Lady of Threadneedle Street ?
At last they resolved that the best thing to do,
Was to try an experiment. just for a lark,
(And to keep their hands in for a lucrative coup,)
On a workman's abode near Victoria Park.

affairs may be due to his admirable administration, but
there is no recognition of his agency. On the other hand,
if the least thing connected with his department goes
wrong, he is held personally responsible, and the fiendish
newspapers fall upon him.
That is my experience after a little more than twelve
months in office, and if I am a little wearied of it who
shall blame me? Why should I remain the butt of all
the captious critics throughout the country? I have no
hour, except these stolen ones, that I can call my own.
All the pleasures and recreations of private life are
swallowed up in official cares. Why should I longer
submit to be engulfed in this state of slavery? I am
not in the absolute prime of youth ; but still, as we
Statesmen go, I am not old. For example, I have seen
but two_summers more than that elderly young beau,
H-NRY J-M-S. Someone once said of me, that for my
recorded age, I had the youngest-looking body in the
House of Commons. That is a subtle distinction, the
value of which I cannot grasp. I know that I have been
a buck in my time, and if I only get my time to myself
once more, I may again become as ornamental as I am
now useful. I will think it over, and probably in the
course of the next few weeks you may hear what
resolution I have taken.

The post, of course, has its attractions. It is no small thing to be principal
Secretary of State, with a seat in the Cabinet, and an adequate salary. But,
to tell the truth, dear Toby, the Home Secretary lives too near the People to
have an uninterruptedly pleasant time. He is too close to, and too frequently
under, the public eye. It is like working in a glass hive. A Foreign Secretary
labours in secret in the Samoan Islands, or some equally remote quarter, and
months elapse before the publication of the Blue Book places his labour under
the criticism of the public. The Secretary for the Colonies works under similar
conditions, whilst the First Lord of the Admiralty and the War Secretary,
except upon rare occasions, have only their respective Services to deal with.
But the Home Secretary is, necessarily, always at home to impertinent
lookers-in, or idle callers who have not sufficient business of their own to attend
to. If anything goes wrong with the water or the gas, if a country Magistrate
makes a more than usually

A MYSTERIOUS PAPER.
THE near approach of Christmas, with its fireside stories, has
suggested the following list of questions for examination that may
be put to himself by any intending raconteur. As he may be sure
that if he can tackle them satisfactorily he will be able effectually
to enchain any family circle he may come across during the coming
festive season, he may be safely recommended to go at them in all
confidence :-
1. What is a "spook"? Have you ever met one in society ?
Define" telepathy;" Can you send a telepathigram”? If so, do
you think it would cost more than a halfpenny a word ?
2. Write a short biographical notice of Messrs. MYERS AND
GURNEY. State which of the two you would rather be, and give, if
you can, your reasons for your answer.
3. Furnish a brief abstract, that must not exceed 300 pages, of
their joint work, Phantasms of the Living. What would be the
present price of the two volumes on MUDIE's Second-hand List ?
4. A certain Mr. Brown knew a Captain Jones, who knew a
Major ROBINSON, who one night sitting at Mess at a hill-station in
the Central Provinces of India, thought he saw a figure on the
verandah and felt a sudden dig in the side as if somebody had
.pushed him with his elbow. He had been mixing his wines rather
freely, but turning to his neighbour, he said, 'I am almost sure
something has happened to my Uncle JAMES.”. He subsequently
wrote a dozen letters to England on the subject, but oould never get
any answer; and to this day, though his Uncle JAMES is known to be
alive and quite well, the matter remains a mystery. To what class
of "inconsequent warnings” could you refer this experience ?
5., At Bansbury House, Buckinghamshire, a phantom omnibus full
inside and out of headless passengers, drives three times round the
central grass-plot on the eve of the day on which the heir orders a
new dress-coat. Account for this, if you can, and compare it with
the reported apparition of the famous luminous elephant said to be
visible to the Lairds of Glenhuish whenever the amount of their
butcher's-book reaches the sum of £20.

conduct of the celebrated little old man in the bagwig and faded blue

THE. DUSTMAN AND THE
BARGE-OWNER.
(A River Carroll.)
“ Mr. AKERS DOUGLAS assured Baron HENRY
DE WORMS that a system had arisen of London
barges, laden with tin kettles, old iron, pots,
crockery, and even iron bedsteads, emptying this
refuse into the sea near the Isle of Sheppey, and
that the Wbitstable oyster-beds were in conse-
quence being ruined." —Daily Paper.
The Dustman and the Barge-owner
Were very fast allies ;
They wept like watering-pots to see
Such rubbish-heaps arise,
Including iron bedsteads, and
Pans of enormous size.
“If any householder in Town
Told me to move this 'ere,
Do you suppose," the Dustman said,
“That I should get it clear ?"
“I doubt it," said the Barge-owner,
“Unless they gave you beer!
“But I've some barges on the Thames;
So here's a jolly spree
We'll take this lot of tins and pots,
Also the crockeree ;
And when we're out of sight of land,
We'll drop 'em in the sea ”
The Dustman and the Barge-owner
They loaded barges four,
And when they got to Whitstable
They anchored near the shore;
The Barge-owner said nothing but
“Why should we voyage more p”.
“But, wait a bit !” an Oyster cried,
Turning quite blue with dread;
“You surely would not empty here
Your refuse on my head !
I do not want a bedstead, though
This is an Oyster-bed.”
“The time has come,” the Barge-owner
Remarked unto his mate,
“To talk of Barking outfall, and
Our Vestry's last debate,
And whether pots or liquid slush
The Oysters most do hate.”
"It seems a shame," the Dustman said,
"To spoil the Oyster breed,
Considering that, when nice and fat,
They're very good indeed,
Eaten with bread-and-butter, brown,
And flowing bowls of mead.”
“I weep for them, I do, I'm sure,"
The Barge-owner replied;
Then sorted out the nastiest things
His rubbish-ship supplied,
And, winking to his dismal friend,
He chucked them o'er the side!
“O Oysters dear!" the Dustman cried,
“Our business we have done.
I hope you 'll find the bedsteads fit."
But answer came there none;
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd perished every one!

the chair at a mass meeting summoned under the auspices
of the local branch of the Land League of Longford. A
room was taken, the word passed round, and all prepa-
rations made for a successful meeting. The Police,
however, got wind of it, and of course the meeting was
proclaimed. But Tim, as you may happen to know, is
not the man to have his purpose lightly set aside. It was
made known that Tim would make his speech and the
Police might catch him if they could. You know, may
be, the big faotory in the thriving town of Longford-
the one with a tall chimbly? Well, the word was passed
along again that the bhoys were to assemble about the
factory. “Would they bring a chair or a table,” they
said, “for Tim to stand on?” “No," said Tim, wiping
his spectacles, “ you leave it to me."

My Dear MR. PUNCH,
In my Autobiography,
which I am glad and proud to say,
has met with your cordial appro-
bation, I have recorded how the
late lamented Bishop, Dr. Suv.
NEB, said to me, “I have drunk a
bottle of port wine every day since
I was a boy." Well, his son, the
Archdeacon, is annoyed at this
statement. Now, my memory is &
very good one, and if I am wrong

narrated, why not in severa), why
not in all? If the Bishop did not
say this, to me, who did some-
body said it, that I will swear.
Who said it ? If my memory
fails me, is it not also likely that
the Bishop's memory was not
particularly good, and conse-
quently, that he was mistaken in
thinking that he had drunk &
bottle a day since his boyhood ? I
have little doubt that the Bishop
only imagined it, and perhaps he
was joking. Perhaps he was
playing on the words " bishop"

port wine. I have no hesitation
in comforting his Archidiaconal
offspring by assuring him that,
to the best of my knowledge and
belief, his father, the Bishop, did
not drink a bottle of port every
day since his boyhood. He was

I HAD the cureosity one day to arsk a lerned gennelman on whom
I was waiting, whether the poor fellers who lived in the world ever
so many hundred years ago had got any Copperasbuns. He pretended
not to understand me at fust, and said, with a larf, as he dared say
as they was made much as we was; that is to say, sam with large
ones, and some with little ones; but when I xplained what I reely
meant, he told me as they had, speshally amung the Romans as lived
in Ittaly. He was a werry amusing Gent, and when I araked him
what langwidge the Romuns torked, he tried to gammon me as they
all spoke Latin, owen the little children and all, but in coarse I
wasn't quite such a hignoramus as to swaller that, as my son
WILLIAM, who isn't by no means a fool, learnt Latin at Skool for
three year and tells me as he oarn't speak it a bit. The lerned gent
also told me as it was such a rum tung to speak that they hadn't not
no word for “ Yes!” So that if & Gent of those long days had bin a

Waiter, like me, and had said to him “Woud you like arf-a-crown.

I was jest a leetle shocked at his torking such rubbish to me, it was

a going to make a call on a few Royal Princes and Dooks, insted of
opening a new Park surrounded by numbers of the reel working-
classes. But he always has bin a reel gennelman, and never makes
no difference atween rich and poor when he can do some good. I

actually confessing his cowardice in not claiming the

mean?
“What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth

Then occurs this truly remarkable sentence:-

Given whom? Why, Bacon himself! Did he not make
his face into another's, namely, SHAKSPEARE's? The

Or make "seditious" speeches.
They quodded him, his plans to baulk,
And-tried to bag his breeches !
But brave O'BRIEN's blood did burn
(Say, who his plack impeaches ?)
He up and swore in acoents stern,
“I won't-wear conyiot breeches !”

In bed-without his breeches !
In vain the prison-clothes they show;
Badge of dishonour each is.
Patriots prefer to lie below
Bed-clothes-without their breeches !
But friends unto the dungeon bie,
No gaoler marks (or peaches),
They hand O'BRIEN, on the sly,

A plucky people is not ruled

But when her goal she reaches,

THE PLUCK OF GGGRRANDD DOLLLMANN'S CAMP.
(4 Story of the Welsh Gold Fields.)
BY BRITT PART.
THERE was commotion in Gggrrandddolllmann's Camp. It could
not have been a fight, for in those days, just when gold had been
discovered on Welsh soil, such things as fights were unknown. And
yet the entire settlement were assembled. The schools and libraries
were not only deserted, but Jones's Coffee Palace had contributed
its tea-drinkers, who, it will be remembered, had calmly continued
their meal when even_such an exciting paper as the Grocers'
Journal had arrived. The whole Camp was collected before a rude
cabin on the outer edge of the clearing. Conversation was carried
on in a low tone, but the name of a man was frequently repeated. It
was a name familiar enough in the Camp-“W. E. G.-a first-rate
feller.” Perhaps the less said of him the better. He was a strong,
but, it is to be feared, a very unstable person. However, he had sent
them a message, when messages were exceptional. Hence the
excitement.
“You go in there, TAFFr," said a prominent citizen, addressing
one of the loungers; "go in there, and see if you can make it out.
You've had experience in them things."

And the muscles of his legs and arms
Stand out like steely bands.
His hair is fair, and closely cropped,
His pink face bears no tan;

Excited Britons go,
To see him swing his left and right
With slogging force though slow;
And the guests are scarce a pretty sight,
They're loud and rather low.
Green youngsters scarce released from school
Flock in at the open door.
They love to see him “kid” and feint,
And pay their bobs therefor;
And if his right he does let fly

At length he into training goes,
Attended by “the bboys,".

And to each other whisper them

Why, that is quite another thing,

I'm Welshman at heart; this gold-find in North Wales
And many dark storms 'twixt the cup and the lip,

Yes, indeed, and all places, though foreign and beautiful,
But I said in my heart, little Wales I love chiefly,
This brave little country I prize far above;
And sweet JENNY JONES, too, in truth I do love!
For indeed in my heart I do love the Principality,
And you, JENNY JONES, too, in truth I do love.
I agree with PARNELL, and the Lord Mayor of Dublin,
In loving fair Erin, of Islands the Queen;
For fifty long years I've ploughed Politics' ocean,
And having worn Blue, Buff, and Red in succession,
And served my full time in the gallant State-ship;

A Christmas Carol for the Comfortable classes.
OLD Father Christmas came once more,
His eye was bright if his hair was hoar,
And the old old gifts on his back he bore.
With the old loved legend now as then
The pleasantest ever inscribed by pen-
“Peace upon earth, goodwill to men.”
What was it the good old greybeard saw?-
War’s iron teeth, greed's gaping jaw,
And shaken order and broken law.
Each land ringed round with a fence of steel,
Each party snarling at other's heel ;
Nune seeming loving, few looking leal.
Poverty spreading athwart the land,
With mutterings few dared understand,
Though they palsied Charity's helpful hand.
And the good old greybeard stood and gazed
At the thousand hearths where no Yule-fire blazed,
At the hate-led nations, the classes crazed.
“And oh!” he cried, “is it come, the time
When the land low grovels in greed and grime,
And heeds no longer my cheering chime ?
“Is it past, all prospect of love's increase ?
Is it time my rallying cry should cease-

MY VERY DEAR SIR,- Thank you for the last six Private Boxes,
which, although not all of them in quite first-rate positions, enabled
me to knock off a few obligations that I was under to certain impor-
tunate friends and connections. But I am now going to tax your
kindness still further. I wish to give all my tradesmen a treat, and
should like them to have the Queen's Box in turn. I am, therefore,
sending you the addresses of my butcher, my baker, my bootmaker,
milkman, greengrocer, and my tailor, and request that you will
communicate directly with them, with a view to finding out on what
nights they could most conveniently visit the theatre, and arranging
accordingly. Please be careful to direct the envelopes carefully and
legibly, as I should be sorry that any carelessness on your part
should lead to disagreeables over the matter. Indeed, as long as you
keep me well supplied with the places I require on the Grand Tier, I
have no wish to be nasty. But you know, from experience, it won't

at this day to hint what has been, Ex peute Herculem.

DOLL-CE DOMUM.
One of the prettiest and most seasonable
sights we have seen for a long while was the
display of toys collected by the proprietor
of Truth from the readers of that entertain-
ing periodical, exhibited in Willis's Rooms
before distribution amongst the children of
our hospitals and work-houses. The dolls
(there were thousands and thousands of
them) seemed to be bidding the fashionable
world adieu before entering, like so many
Sisters of Mercy, upon a mission of tender
charity to the sick poor. There was a
private view on Sunday, a week before
Christmas Day, and those who examined
the treasures revealing the glories of Regent
Street and the Lowther Arcade, could not
help thinking "Mr. LABOUCHERE must have
a heart as good as his head, and be a very
kind man au fond.” We wonder whether
that confirmed cynic, the proprietor of
Truth, would make the same admission ?
The reasons given in the correspondence
published in the Times of last Thursday for
discharging Mr. HIGHTON from his offices in
connection with the Westminster Play seem
to us inadequate. Instead of his work
tending to lower the tone of the performance,
surely its effect would obviously be to

$MY RIVERSIDE ADWENTUR.
(A Trew Fact as appened at Great Marlow on
Bank Olliday)
I WAS setting
one day in the
shade,
In the butifull
month of
August,
When I saw a
most butifull
Maid
A packing of
eggs in sum
sawdust.
The tears filled her butifull eyes,
And run down her butifull nose,
And I thort it was not werry wise
To let them thus spile her nice close.
So I said to her, lowly and gently,
"Shall I elp you, o fair lovely gal ?”
And she ansered, “0 dear Mr. BENTLEY,
If you thinks as you can, why you shall."
And her butifull eyes shone like dimans,
As britely each gleamed thro a tear,
And her smile it was jest like a dry man's
When he 's quenching his thirst with sum beer.
Why she called me at wunce Mr. BENTLEY,
I sort quite in wain to dishcover ;
Or weather 'twas dun accidently,
Or if she took me for some other.
I then set to work most discreetly,
And packed all the eggs with grate care ;
And I did it so nicely and neatly,
That I saw that my skill made her stare.
So wen all my tarsk was quite ended,
She held out her two lilly hands,
And shook mine, and thank'd me, and wended
Her way from the River's brite sands.
And from that day to this tho I've stayed,
I've entirely failed to diskever
The name of that brite Dairy-Maid
As broke thirteen eggs by the River.

MASTER TOMMY'S HOUSEHOLD
RECEIPTS.
The Rumorous Ancestors. - To produce these
most effectively it is desirable to be staying in
a country house containing a handsome gallery
of hereditary portraits, though in their absence,
a few valuable family pictures would serve your
purpose equally well. Having provided yourself
with two tins containing respectively white and
vermilion quickly drying enamel paint, proceed
to bedizen the features of each portrait in suc-
cession after the fashion of the clown in a
Christmas pantomime. When a whole gallery
containing several generations of a family are
thus treated, the effect is extremely quaint, and
your host probably convulsed with laughter,
will be the first to admit that "he did not know
he was descended from such a set of humorous
ancestors !”
