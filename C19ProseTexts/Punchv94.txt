6 * rjlLLO-O-0! Ahoy there!!!"
jLl The Voice—a strong but silvery one, a blend, as it were, of the two sorts of " Sirens" (fog-horn and pretty girl
to wit)—sounded, like that of Mrs. Browning's " Great God Pan," down in the reeds by the river.
Mr. Punch, who was "paddling his own canoe," responded with a sonorous "Aye, aye I " turned with one dextrous
stroke his canoe-point shorewards, and—came plump upon old Father Thames, the unmistakeable " reverend Sire " himself,
1 but " so neat and so clean and well-flannelled withal," that Mr. Punch, accustomed of late years to the sort of mulberry-nosed
mudlark of the metropolitan Thames-reaches, started in pleased surprise at his old friend's picturesque spick-and-spanness.
A moor-hen scuttled away through the reeds, and a kingfisher flashed like a winged jewel across the creek, as the
prow of the Sage's canoe " pointed " at the recumbent Sire of Streams.
"Why, Father, I hardly knew you!" cried Mr. Punch.
"Because I appear in my native shape, undisguised by dirt, and unattended by dead dogs," responded Father
Thames, sententiously.
"Well, flannels and a clean face certainly suit you better than a costume a la chiffonnier, and reeds and kingfishers
are worthier of your pcetical antecedents than a retinue of long-shore rubbish." So the Sage.
"Of course," said Father Thames. "But Civilisation has treated me badly. Precious few kingfishers left, I can tell
you; cockney sportsmen and sham ornithologists have taken care of that / By the way, you '11 find a beaker of Iced Deli-
ciousness down in the moss there. Spare it not,—any more than I hope you will the pernicious fools who do their best to
exterminate the Thames fauna I"
r. Then was there music as of nectar sweet
f Glug-glugging from some high Olympian bottle;
The sound of shandy-gaff descending fleet
The Sage's throttle.
"But that's not the only bone I have to pick with Civilisation," pursued the Hoary Sire. "They've churned my
upper reaches into saffron mud with their pestilent S team-Launches, and converted my lower ones into a malodorous drain
with their trade-refuse. They've potted my moor-hens, and peopled me with sewer-rats. Where they have not been able to
make me unclean, they have made me cockneyfied. But they might Defend me!"
"Oho !" cried the Sage. "Then you too, 0 aged Recluse of the Reeds, 0 venerable Solitary of the Sedges, have
been seduced by the Modern Magazine, have been lured into the maze of Contemporary Polemics 1"
"Mr. Porch," said Father Thames, with energy, "a Recluse may be a Patriot. And who should be a Patriot if not
I? Once indeed, long, long years ago, my stream was dishonoured by a foreign ship with a broom at its mast-head. Well,
well, never mind. But I don't want it to happen again I!!"
"Naturally," rejoined Mr. Punch. "National Defence is a subject which is now attracting a lot of attention. The

Defence of the Thames is a very essential part of it. An enemy's iron-clads in the Pool would be as little to your mind as
torpedo-fishing at Pangbourne; eh, mine Aquatic Ancient?"
"Precisely, my Punchius! How long then would it be before Toby there floated, paws upwards, off the Temple
Gardens, whilst his Mighty Master mourned in a Tower dungeon?"
'* Sunum corda, Sire!" responded the cute but ever-cheery Oracle of Fleet Street. "'Tis a far cry to Traitor's Gate.
To rr'apt the Wizard once more:—
"Our Wimbledon has marksmen good, "And many a ship shall be shot-torn,
(Though Dukes be dour and snubs be rude,) And many a man to earth be borne,
Cockneys are ohaps of loyal mood; And many a hulk go up in flames,
On Surrey hills live stalwart men, Ere foreign foe shall sweep the Thames."
On Kentish oliff, in Berkshire glen; • • • •
Father Thames gave an exultant whoop that set the Dog of Dogs yapping in joyous sympathy, and startled the distant
punt-angler so that he lost the first big 'un he had hooked that afternoon.
"Natheless, my Grand Old Man of Rivers," pursued Mr. Punch, " we must look well after you. As I said, you look
splendid in flannels, but we can rig you out in armour-plate at need. Neither you nor Britannia herself must remain
Unprotected. Whilst Scribes scribble, and Optimists orate, and Pessimists perorate, and Officials glose, and ex-Officials
growl, I Punch, mark, and meditate, and presently shall put my foot down. You know what that means!
"My eye, descending from my Den, surveys
Where Thames, gay-decked, but undefended, strays;
Thames, the best-loved of all our Ocean's sons.
Tbcy'd better watch it, our Unknowing Ones I
If they leave you unsafe from source to sea.
They '11 have to reckon, dawdling dolts, with Me' I
• # • • #
Oh, could they flow like thee, and make thy flood
Their great example; clear their minds from mud,
When quiet, be not quite so deadly dull,
Nor, when they move, so prompt to make a Mull!
"Shade of Denham, forgive me! What's that you've got tucked up there, Father Thames?"
"Well—8hem !—it's—hum !—in point of fact it's a Blue Book on National Defence!" I
"The dickens it is! Find it cheer your course, and eolace your solitude?"
"On the contrary I" cried Father Thames, with emphasis. "Fancied it might be nice reading for bad weather, j
when my patriotic heart aches, and there are no pretty girls about to turn the dull pain into a pleasing flutter. But, as far
as I can make out, there's neither point nor patriotism in it, and I'd put it aside for pipe-lights." ,
"Point? Patriotism! Be these your desiderata, dear old boy?" cried Punchius. "Then I think I can put you up
to a good thing. Pitch those ponderous pages to limbo. Here's something worth both your P's, and any number of others
into the bargain: such as PregDancy (of wisdom and wit), Pungency, Polish, Practicality, Pellucidity,—a very peck of P's
hummed up in one Big Big P—which is PUNCH!!! As to Defence, dear boy, it will arm you (against Dulness and other |
dangers) better than iron-clads in your estuary, or towers along your steeps. Take it—with my blessing 1"
And Mr. Punch banded to Father Thames his
IJinetg-JfMrtlj IMmne!

with " Maria"). What are they saying?

months before her execution."—A very fortunate escape!

the guillotine!
The H. D. So it do. Ah, well—that {desperately) was no doubt
on some other occasion.
Before a group among which Queen Elizabeth, Henry the Seventh,
and Sir Francis Bacon are represented. . . This is a very
dramatic and appropriate tableau, by the way, and, in the absence
of Shakspeare, almost solves the great problem.
A Visitor {referring to Queen Elizabeth s costume). You don't see
dresses like that nowadays.
The H. D. {to his Female). You've read all the fuss they're
making about that Bacon, haven't you P
His Female. No, I didn't see it. {She is the kind of person who
can read any paper all through and never "see" anything. He reads
a newspaper occasionally, and retains a general idea of the contents.)
What fuss?
The H. D. Well, I didn't read it very oarefully myself, but it
seems that Shakspeare wrote all Bacon's Cryptograms, and never
got the oredit for them.
His Female {indignantly). What a shame!
[They arrive at a group representing Bright, Cobden, Lord
Brougham, and Daniel O' Connell.
The H. D. {after examining them profoundly). Ah—andj.they
look it too!
[He has not the faintest notion what he means—nor has she.
They move on pleased with themselves and one another.
The C. C. (halting before an Elderly Gentleman who is sitting
down). He's not arf so well done as the others; wants cleaning up a
bit. They have let him get so shabby. They might stand him a
better 'at. Ugly old beggar too. Does it say who he's meant for?
The E. G. (angrily). Go away, Sir. What do you mean by these
remarks? You 're no gentleman, Sir I \ Rises.
The C. C. (moving off hastily). Well, if he ain't one of the nggers,
he ought to be added, that's.all.
In Hall No. 3.
The H. D.'s Female. Hennery, eome here, quick! (Hknwtsby is
engaged in mistaking Mr. George Odger for John Wyckliffe, but
tears himself away from this fascinating occupation). Hennery, this
(reverentially) is the idcntioal umberella Dr. Krnealy threw down in
the House of Commons.—Why did he throw it down P
The H. D. (with a confused recollection of Burke). Because he
said it was what would be at every Englishman's throat if they
didn't give the Claimant his rights.
His Female (critically). It's not real Alpaca.
The H. D. That doesn't signify. It '■ the principle of the thing,
he was arguing for.
A Small Child (who has discovered that her remarks cause grown-
up people to smile, and becomes more voluble in consequence). All the
Kings and Queens are only big dollies, and they look half asleep.
Mother, aren't the Kings and Queens big dollies, and don't they look
half asleep P Big half-asleep dollies, Mother, aren't they P I want
to see the babies—where are the babies, Mother P May I see the
babies? Will they be like Mart's baby? Will Mary's baby be
here t Why won't Mary's baby be here P Is Mary's baby a dolly,
Mother P Will Mary be here P
[And so on, until the proud Mother is afraid she will forget half
the clever things Petsy has said.
In the Chamber of Horrors.
The Ghouls do everything thoroughly, deriving especial satisfaction
from the sight of the identical knife employed in a celebrated case,
and a pleasing plan of a skeleton, with all the burnt and
missing bones indicated in shaded ink, after which they retire to
have a comfortable tea, and talk over what they have seen. The
Habitual Donkey i$ surprised to hear afterwards, that he passed
Napoleon's Carriage in the Napoleon Chamber. He had heard
it was there—but forgot to look out for it. The Comic Cockney
got into the vehicle, of course, pulled out all the drawers and
lockers, and made Polly giggle by pretending to be Napoleon.
So we are able to bring down our Curtain upon a scene of
universal contentment.

Angelina sat in her boudoir' pondering over her past.
She saw herself a child many, many years ago; then
a young lady just released from school; then a Parish
Visitor, a Hospital Nurse, an Authoress, and a Doctor.
And all through her life—her long life—Edwin had been
true 1 It was a sweet thought 1 She yielded herself so
thoroughly to the sentiment of the moment that she
failed to observe that the man of all others before whom
she would wish to make a brave show was standing in
the room in front of her. He had entered the apartment
unobserved while she had been lost in a reverie. With
admirable tact he stnmbled over a chair, and thus gave
her time to compose herself without embarrassment.
"Edwin 1" sne exclaimed, "how you startled me I"
"lam sorry to hear it, dear Angelina; for believe me
that 1 am conscious that persons at our time of life"
"Edwin I" she cried, beseechingly.
"Nay, hear me out, Angelina! It would be false
kindness, my darling, if I had tried to conceal the truth.
My own loved one, you will never see the sunny side of
sixty."
"You onoe used to say I was no more than fifty," she
put in with a pout that was half playful, half reproachful.
"You are right, my own soul 1" he cried, passionately;
"but that, darling, was fully ten years ago. But be that
as it may, all I would say is that at our time of life—
you hear, darling—our!—a sudden shook is most injurious
to us. Now, I would give worlds if you could guess what
I wish to say to you."

FELICITOUS QUOTATIONS.
Unemployed Party (who has not received the donation he begged for). "Yah!

"How can If" she asked, with a 'coquettish glance from beneath her
spectacles.
"I have been trying to prepare you for it for more than twenty years. Can
you not guess my secret?
She looked down and sighed. Then she put her finger near her mouth, and
smiled.
"How like the attitude in that picture of you, over yonder—painted nearly
half a oentory ago I"
"You are very troublesome with your dates, Edwin!" said Angelina,
rather tartly.
"My own, do not speak harshly to me. Believe me, if I did not suffer from
rheumatism, I would throw myself on my knees at your feet. My own, my
darling, will you be my wife?"
For a moment Angelina blushed with joy. Then she turned as white as
marble. "Impossible!" she said at last, in a harsh sad voice that sounded the
very utterance of despair.
Why impossible?" he exclaimed, with all a lover's tenderness,
"We must be worthy of our order," said the noble middle-aged person
firmly. "We must not do what they would not do. Hive you not read the
Registrar-General's Report?"
"I have,"he answered, gloomily.
"Then I need not argue the matter so ably advocated. Edwin, my own, my
soul, my darling, toe cannot marry because we are too young!"
And Edwin bowed his head in silence, because he knew that Angelina
was not talking at random—that Angelina was right.
And while these two fond hearts prudently pined away in single happiness,
the recipe for making wedding-cakes was lost to the world for ever I

PUQILATIO REDIVIVA.
(Bt the Ghost of Corinthian Tom.)
"I see, my dear Coz," remarked Corinthian Tom to Jerry
Hawthorn, as they conversed in The Shades, "that there has heen
a revival in London of the nohle Art of Self-defence." "IndeedI"
replied Hawthorn. "How well I rememher how we 1 dropped in'

upon Mr. Jackson in old days, and how you introduced me to the
Champion op England, who was blowing a cloud, and whose Jack
Boots weighed twenty pounds." "Yes," said Tom, "and we saw a
rather shady set-to with the gloves, the last time we revisited 'the
glimpses of the moon.' What say you to a trip to earth again, for
an investigation of Life in London of to-day P"
Jerky Hawthorn was agreeable, and he and Corinthian Tom
were soon in the midst of " Life in London," and lost no time in
calling on young BobLoqic, who was a "gay spark" like his father,
and quite au fait with all the sprees of the Metropolis. "Fashions
have changed* my dear Coz," said the Corinthian, "and the young
bucks and exquisites seem to us to dress strangely; but I suppose
their attire is ' all the go' now, and these are the swell suits made by
the Dickey Prtmefit of the day." "Right you are, old Chappie,"
said young Bob Logic. "And now, what is it you want to see?"
Jerry was rather scandalised at the " free and easy" tone of young
Bob towards such a 00 among the " Goes" as the Corinthian, bat
Tom merely smiled and said, " Well, Master Bob, we have heard that
the Ring or Stage of Pugilism is once more a feature of 'Life in
London,' and in search of Character we would oompare the Present
with the Past." "Nothing easier," said young Bob. "Let us look
in at the Flamingo Club some Sunday night, and you can see ' spar-
ring ' to your heart's content; in fact I think I oan introduce you to
a regular good ' glove-fight.'" The Trio went to the Flamingo, and
truly it presented a motley sight. It was fall of the most extra-
ordinary characters of Life in London, all jostling each other with
the utmost sang-froid. There were the Swell and the Snob—the
Mummer and the Mug—the Jew and the Juggins—the Flat and the
Sharp—the Tradesman and the Toff— the Comic (?) Vocalist and
the Cly-faker—the Turfite and the Welsher—the Black-leg and
the Pigeon—in short it was an epitome of " high" and " low" life,
while, as the Corinthian observed to his Coz, " Gentlemen seemed
to be scarcer than they were in ' old days.''' Everyone was drinking.
"8. and B.," "Whiskey and Potash," "Gin and Ginger-beer,"
"Bitter Beer," "Stout," "Port," "Sherry," and "Champagne,"
were much in demand, nearly everyone too was " blowing a cloud,"
and a great many of these votaries of Bacchus were three sheets in
the wind, reminding Corinthian Tom and Jerry Hawthorn of the
Oxonian and his inclination to get bosky,
A person, apparently of Irish extraction, who seemed to have a
"good conceit of himself," was then introduced to the company as
the Champion of the World, and proceeded to box with another
individual who had come in his wake." "Now," said the
Corinthian, "we shall see whether this supposed 'slogger,' is as
'handy with his mauleys' as my old friend Mr. Jackson." He soon
discovered, however, that this so-called "sparring-match," was but a
sham, for the individual who was boxing with the Champion, con-
tented himself with "warding off" the blows and never returned
them; or, if he did so, it was in a most half-hearted manner. On
inquiring of young Bob the reason of this, he said, "Oh, the
'bloke's 'his attendant, paid to stand up and be pummelled, don't you
know," whereupon the Corinthian expressed his high indignation
at what he termed " such prodigious humbug," and wondered that
H.R.H. should have condescended to patronise it.
There was no doubt, however, but that the Art of Self-Defence was
once more on the tapis, and Dame Rumour had given the office to
some of the "knowing coves" that two aspirants for pugilistio
honours were to meet in the Prize Ring. But it was said that the
battle was to be in France, and Corinthian Tom declined to witness
a fight that did not take place on British soil. "No," said he, "I
witnessed the memorable combat between Tom Crtbb and Moldteatjx
at Thistleton Gap. and if I cannot see a 1 set-to' in the Ring in my
native country, I will not do so elsewhere." Young Bob Logic,
however, who had the "tip," went off with some brother Flamin-
goes, and on an island in the Seine among the " Parley-voos," he
witnessed the "fistic encounter" between the representatives of
England and America. He came back in great glee at having
"queered the bobbies" on this side the Channel and " bothered the
gendarmes " on the other, and Corinthian Tom observed to his Coz,
that young Bob was evidently a "prime favourite" among the
Chappies and Gommies, and like a certain sprightly "nymph of
the stage," he could always " count upon the boys." It certainly
seemed also that this encounter had been full of "go." The
"Cookies" of the hearts of Corinthian Tom and Jerry Hawthorn
warmed as they heard and read of "fibbing" and " countering" of
"red-hot smacks," "left-handers on the nob," "rib-roasters,"
"upper-outs," "exchanges," " bashes," "knock-downers," "body-
punob.es," "spankers," "welts," "smashers," "whistlers,"
"rattling ivories," "Btingers," "bangs," "hot-uns," and of the
"tapping" of the "claret, and the flowing of "the ruby." It was
said by some cavilhrs that there was too much wrestling, or as they
called it "cuddling," but as Corinthian Tom remarked, "it was
the sort of ' cuddling' no man would care for who was not 'in train-
ing,' as it involved heavy punishment and hard fighting." Jerry
Hawthorn agreed with him, and said, " both men appeared to have
Bhown f>/ueA." "You are right," said the Corinthian, " both the
combatants showed skill, stamina, and manly intrepidity. They
were no feather-bed fighters as has been insinuated, and their game-
ness was proved beyond question. This meeting indeed will take
rank with the Olympian encounter between Sayebs and Heenan."
"Right you are," said young Bob ; "but do you think the Beaks
are going to stand a revival of the Prize Ring, or will the Bobbies
still be down on us?" "That," said the Corinthian, "is a poser,
I see that one Monitor of the Public warns us that we need not ' hug
ourselves with the delusion' that the days of the Ring will return.
It reminds us too of the 'plants' and 'crosses' and of the lowest of
the low, who supported pugilism. It seems to me then, that while
there is no objection to our practising the Noble Art of Self-Defence,
the Pugilistic Arena will not be open to our modern gladiators.
We shall no longer be able to carol as of old:—
"A Briton needs no poniards,
No bravos 'long his street,
His trust is in a strong-roped ring,
A square of twenty-feet."
"Ah, well," said young Bon; "I suppose we shall still be allowed
to have our private turn-ups, and I can tell you it's pretty warm
work sometimes." "I do not think," continued the Corinthian,
"that we shall ever see such scenes again as in the Augustan Age
of the Ring, but if we do, this combat is " up to sample." It was
made under the auspices of the best and most largely circulated of
Sporting Newspapers, whose boast is 'Nunquam Dormio,' which |

LANE AND GARDEN.
*■ Arm a virumque cano," must be the motto of Augustus
Druriolanus for this year's pantomime. Many an armour scene
have we gazed on before, bat never such a display as this. C'est
magnifique, mat's ce West pas la Pantomime. I am not sorry to notice

Augustus " in propria Puss-owner.'
that Druriolanus does not go in for a Grand Transformation Scene.
Madame Katti Lanner's Fairies, some flowers, and a barque, or
rather a pleasure-boat, in the distance, manned by children, is as
much as he gives us, and quite enough after the surfeit of gorgeosity
which the audience have had in the dozen or more foregoing scenes.
Messrs. Herbert Campbell and Harry Nicholls are very droll
as King and Queen, and though the "Old Gentleman and his
Donkey, by the Brothers Griffiths, may be a bit played out for
the seniors, yet the children, for whose delectation Pantomime is
primarily intended, will be delighted with the inimitable jackass.
The two Brothers of Jocelyn Marquis of Carabas will afford the
youthful playgoer much amusement, and Jocelyn himself, imper-
sonated by Miss Wadman,—whom, of course Uncle Toby will take
his nephews and nieces and all the little Shandean family to see, in
tender memory of the Widow Wadman—looks handsome, and plays
and sings charmingly. Master Lauri, the undefeated illustrator of
Darwinesque theories, is this year an agile cat instead of an acrobatic
monkey. To quote the Pote, to the tune of "Annie Laurie,"—
At funny little Lavki
We laugh until we cry.
The Silver Wedding balltt is to my thinking, the prettiest efleet in
the Pantomime, if not the prettiest thing seen for some years, even
on the st age of Drury Lane. Like all modem Pantomimes, it requires
condensation, for it begins too early and ends too late, so that our
old friend Mr. Harry Payne the Clown must be tired of waiting to
oome on, and his young friends have to be hurried off before he appears,
or are too fatigued to enjoy the real humours of the Harlequinade.
Miss Letty Lind, as the Princess Sweetarle, reminded me of
Miss Constance Gilchrist in " the palmy days" of burlesque at the
Gaiety—they are the leggy days now, and, according to newspaper
reports, even the Gallerians and the Pittites demanded " something
new" of their old favourites—but this by the way,—and also, in
some of her dances, of Miss Kate Yauohan "as she used to was,"
when she KaterM for the public at Christmas time and exemplified the
poetry of motion. Druriolanus is to be congratulated as usual, but I
am sure Mr. Punch will strongly urge him to institute a new departure
next Christmas, and, with one good spectacular scene, which should
not anticipate the glories of the Transformation, and one specially
"pretty" scene, let him give us lots of frolic, comic business, and
real pantomime fun, all to be over by eleven, and at ten let the
Harlequinade commence. Such a Pantomime would come, to quote
the poet, "like a boon and a blessing to men." I must not forget
to mention the pantomime heads and hands at Drury Lane, which
are works of genuine Comic Art.
In the Garden.—If it be a difficult matter to decide whioh is the
better of the two Pantomimes, The Lane or The Garden, the latter
can at least claim Conquest, who is the best Giant I've seen for a
long time. There are plenty of good things in Jack and the Bean-
stalk, from Jack, Miss Fanny Leslie, who is full of beans, down to
the little boys, the Noabetts (odd name, sounds like that of a bank-
rupt family, "No assets") who perform really wonderfully on
miniature bioyoles. The drilling scene of youthful soldiers—all
"Sons of Mars," of course, as you can tell by their "pas"—will
delight the children, as will also the very pretty mixed oostume
ballet and horseshoe music of the clever Village Blacksmith's family,
which last entertainment deserved its triple encore.
In the Butterfly Ballet at the Grasshoppers' Feast, the danoing of
Signora Sozo is anything but so-so. while "Fun on the Quiet" by
Messrs. Griffin and Ardell, attired as negro cooks—each a study in
black and white—is a most original performance, with real humour
in it. They do wonderful acrobatic feats with tables and chairs, but
always as if in the Giant's absence they were "snatching a fearful
joy." but a joy which knows no bounds, as is shown by their mar-
vellous acrobatic feats—and were afraid of making such a noise as
might wake the Monster, who would return and spoil their sport, as
his black looks would soon pnt even these two niggers out of coun-
tenance. Mr. Frank Hall as Old King Cole with some sparks of
fun in him, gets most of it, however, out of his make-up whioh
bears an absurd but striking resemblance to the well known features
of a certain noble Lord, not altogether unknown in the yachting and
theatrical world. Messrs. Wood and Wilkinson make two very comic
old women, and there are plenty of brisk tunes, singing, and danoing.
I must not forget the "Change Artiste, M. Cascabel, whose meta-
morphoses will delight Mr. Barlow's yoxmg friends more than those
of Ovn). His " Sara 15.," however, is a mistake.
Some of the scenes are charmingly painted, some by Callcott,
some of the rustio sort by Banks—" Mossy Banks." Perhaps the
best Landscape is the Exterior of Castle Terror, which is a work of
Hart.
Mr. Bruce Surra's Transformation Scene, might be effective with-
out the Moderator Lamps and coloured shades; as it is, it can only
be spoken of as moderately successful. In the Harlequinade, whioh
begins about a quarter to eleven, there are four soenes, a double supply
of Clowns, Columbines, and a pair of Pantaloons. Quite a surfeit of

Time! Jack before the Conquest.
Pantomimists with one Harlequin. I don't think little Sandy,
though advertised in the bill, was one of the Clowns, but there were
a pair of Pantaloons, thoueh only one was mentioned in the bill.
Which is the better? Whioh takes the Twelfth Cake P
But their merits who can measure—
Covent Garden? Drury Lane?
If in one you may find pleasure,
In the other you '11 find Paynb.
The verdict must be pronounced by the Children who will be taken
to see both. So Girls and Boys come out to the play, the moon it
shines as bright as day; and so, wishing a happy holiday-time to all
of my young friends, I am Yours seasonably,

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
Fbom Phince Grandolph of Bulgaria..
Moscow, Saturday.

H ear Tort,
I learn through the
usual sources of informa-
tion, that the heart of Lon-
don, beating in unison with
those of the capitals of the
Continent, is throbbing
with anxious curiosity as to
&/ \W I |y t he real meaning of my visit
i&SjS -"; 'kV to Alexander. You nave a
i fflygBJG1' ftm theatre burnt,Mr.Gl-dst-ne
m r^M \ has his birthday as usual,
\J £n ^ i fflBffilK 8,1 B-lf-r having put
asiAl O'Br-n in prison, carries
out the Plan of Campaign
by a wholesale reduotion of
judicial rents. These things,
of course, excite ripples of
interest; but I can quite
understand that what the
people are really thinking
of is my visit to Russia, what it means and what it may portend.
Whilst this in some sense gratifies me, I confess it also tickles me,
and now and again I break forth into the melodious laugh with
which my friends are familiar. As you wiU presently learn, the
journey has had its serious consequences, fraught with interest for
the civilised world. But in the privacy of confidential correspondence
I may admit for your ear only, that it was the merest accident that
brought me here. I had meant to go to Spain, to spend the winter
months before the Spring-time of the new Session. _ I had arranged
with a companion, and had definitely fixed our destination. Ol-v-r
M-nt-gc was the man, and Seville the place, where we promised
ourselves to eat the orange of contentment amid the groves of idleness.
Everything was settled for the journey, when it occurred to me that
it would be good fun to do exactly the reverse of what I had pro-
posed to myself and announced to others as a fixed intention. Look-
ing over the Map of Europe where was the place most absolutely
opposed to Spain in all its associations and relations? Russia of
course. If people expected me to turn up at 8eville, St. Petersburg
was the spot for me. They have not been talking much about me
lately, not nearly as much as was the vogue this tune last year. Tt
was time Jl did something. This sudden ohange of settled plan
would puzzle them. If I called on B-sm-rck en route, and pro-
ceeded to pay a morning visit to the Czar, here were all the elements
of that excitement which now agitates European politics. B-sm-rck
it was true wouldn't play. He declined to see me, putting me off
with H-rb-rt. (Strange that two eminent statesmen should each be
handicapped with the bright possession of a Herbert.) But I saw
the Czar, and though it was only in travelling between St. Peters-
burg and Gatschina that a certain happy thought occurred to me,
we settled it all at the interview. "Sire," I said, "you are in
difficulties about Bulgaria. You want a Prinoe. You have tried
two; both failures. Try me." "I will," said the Czar. "You
are the very man for the post." So I'm to be Prince of Bulgaria,
Toby. I'm to be Prince of Bulgare!
It has all been very sudden, and I can yet hardly realise the
absolute change in my position and prospects. But, to tell the
truth, I have been a little disappointed, and am aweary of insular
politics. There is no use disguising the fact that what followed
upon my resignation of the Chancellorship of the Exchequer was a
sad blow to me. I thought it would break up the Government: but
it did not even lead to H-nry M-tth-ws' retirement. Things
went on very much as before, if not more so, and I was left out in
the cold. An added sting of bitterness was given by watching the
growing prosperity of my old henchmen. B-lf-r, whom I used to
bully, has become quite a personage, and even dreams of perman-
ently barring me out of the Leadership of the House of Commons.
"W-lffy—who used to fetch and carry my glass of mediatised water
when I spoke in debate, used to sit on the extreme end of the bench, and
reverentially gather up the folios of my notes as I ran through them—
is now His Excellency, Minister to the Court of the Shah, and com-
fortably provided for for life. He sent me, the other day, a copy of
the sketch of himself he did for you, with his flowing robes, his
turbaned head, his jewelled fingers, his impossible scimitar, and his
hookah. W-lffy with a hookah! Reminds me of Silas Wegg, and
Boffins delight at finding in him '1 a literary mem with a wooden leg."
These things are bitterness to a soul not prone to placidity. _ And
then there's Gl-dst-ne revelling in another birthday, making a
fresh triumphal progress through the country, and delivering a new
series of railway-station speeches, only too sparsely punctuated
with snowballs. Travelling from Berlin the other day, I was look-
ing through La Nouvelle Htldise, and came upon a prophetio de-
scription of the foxy Old Man, with his way "de nier ce qui est, et
cPexpliquer ce qui n'est pas. Isn't that a perfect description of
his habitual manner, as manifested, for example, in his Dopping
letter P I am aweary of him and everybody, and, now I come to
think of it, even of you, dear Toby. The Czar's prompt adoption of
my suggestion removes me from associations which I regard with
growing dislike, and opens up quite a new prospect of usefulness.
Battbnberg the First, a pretty puppet, made things generally
hot from Sophia. Ferdinand, succeeding to the post, has got the
fat in the fire. Modesty prevents me from even hinting at what I
may do in so favoured a position. But you may take it from me
that I shall, generally, make Europe sit up. So no more at present.
But, if you 're waking, call me early, call me early, Toby dear; For
I'm to be Prince of Bulgaria, I'm to be Prince of Bulgare!
Yours faithfully, R-nd-lph S. Ch-bch-ll.
A SPIRITED POLICY.
My Bear Mr. Punch,
I find from a letter in {he Times that it has been suggested
to invent a universal language, to be called "Volapiik," and that the
writer of the letter objects to the proposal, on the score that an all-but-
universal language already exists. The aggrieved gentleman, plagia-
rising from one of your own immortal Happy Thoughts," says in
effeot, " Why not have a universal language—for choice, English P"
I echo, "Why not?" but with the love of fair play, the birthright of a
Briton, I cannot help looking at the other side. "Why not Vola-
piik?" let us ask, if only for the sake of argument. According to
the Times, a majority of its readers believe that Yolapiik is "the
language of the spirits," and this certainly seems a very plausible
explanation. Taking this interpretation of the term, would it not
be easy to construct a language that would be easily understood, and
would have the advantage of being shorter than ordinary English?
Yolapiik, or the language of the spirits, I take it, would have a prone-
ness to contract whole sentences into one word, and considerably
abbreviate nouns of more than three syllables. I can easily imagine
what this "language of the spirits" (which in a certain, or rather,
uncertain sense is a universal language) would be. Perhaps, better
to explain my meaning, I may be permitted to give a few examples.
The new tongue, it is proposed, shall be used for "Commercial and
Diplomatic purposes," and I imagine in the subjoined a conversation
between a Diplomatist and a Merchant upon a subjcot connected with
Commerce and Diplomacy.
Merchant. Gladseeyerolef'ler. ThingsheeslyhadCityolef ler!
Diplomatist. Treatybrlinbosholet'ler. Beeslybosholef'ler 1
Merchant. Tellyerwhat. Brish'dusty, goindooceolef ler I
Diplomatist. Allrightolef'ler I M'seSgoingbed — in m'boots,
olef'lerl Merchant. So'ml! Olefler!
I do not say that the above "language of the spirits " is better
than ordinary English, I merely say it is shorter. Ordinary English
too, to a great number of people, would mean a special training,
whereas the language of the spirits," as I imagine it, could be
secured by everyone after a rather pleasant and natural preparation.
The worst that could be said of the latter tongue would be, that it
was " too easy to begin," or "rather a rum language." But what
of that, movements in the cause of freedom are not to he killed by
ridicule, and I fancy that the movements necessitated by the
assumption of the "spirit talk" would be free as;well as easy.
I remain, with much respect, yours sincerely,
A Talker Unsuited to a Tea.

Question. Have vou kept Christmas in the customary fashion?
Answer. Certainly,.with the result of loathing the sight of roast
turkey, and hating the slightest referenoe
to plum-pudding and mince pies,
v . Q. Where did you spend Christmas Eve?
A. In the Gaiety Theatre, assisting at the
first night of a Melodramatic Burlesque, in
three Acts, called Frankenstein.
Q. Did you have a pleasant evening?
A. Not particularly. The denizenB of the
pit were in a had temper from the first,
because the space usually at their disposal
had been curtailed to increase the accommo-
dation of the stalls.
Q. Was this the reason why Frankenstein
on the first night was something un-
commonly like a fiasco f
A. No, because the piece itself was dull.
Music, songs, and scenery, were all that could
be desired, and the company could scarcely

Q. I suppose the evergreen Miss Nelly Fahren was sprightly,
^ r TT 1 1 ■ . . i ■ . 1 TI T'

Miss Marion Hood melodious and coquettish, and. Mr. Feed
Leslie quaint and amusing P
A. I see you have the stereotyped praise by heart. Yes, it will
do on this occasion, as it has done before. However, Miss Farben
certainly did not look her best in the character of a stage-coaohmau,
and I fancied that Mr. Leslie was inclined to " gag." For instance,
in the last Act he appeared in the disguise of a bear; and, when he
was followed by four others in similar oostumes who caused derision,
observed, "Here come some more low comedians." If the authors
wrote those words they wrote unwisely.
Q. Is it true that Mr. E. J. Lonnen sings an Irish song?
A. Strange as it may seem to you, that is indeed the case. You
oan imagine how mirth-provoking it is when I tell you that one of
the verses describes how a dispensary doctor mended a broken head
with a second-olass railway-carriage.
Q. I suppose this merry conceit had to go a long way P
A. Most of the way. Mr. Lonnen as a vampire depressed me.
Q. But did not he call somebody "good old Mary Ann t"
A. He called her thiB several times. It was funny—at first.
Q. Is not the last scene with its prooession of Planets well worth
seeing P
A. Assuredly, by those who have never been present at a satin or
armour parade arranged by Mr. Augustus Harris. The Gaiety pro-
cession was a faint reflection of the gorgeous original at Drury Lane.
Q. Have you been to see the World's Fair at the Agricultural
Hall?
A. That have L It was not bad. A wild-beast tamer was
wonderfully good, and seemed as much at home amongst lions, tigers,
and bears, as you and I should be enjoying a cigar in a Club smoking-
room. Then ther; were some new-fashioned roundabouts, and a
wonderful pantomime in Richardson's show, and a fat lady. I was
very much struck by the improvement in the musical instruments
attached to the show. Orchestrions have ousted hand-organs.
Q. Have you not also been to Dalston to see a Circus?
A. Yes. It was a beautiful Circus, but I do not want to see it
again.
Q. And Olympia, have you not also seen that?
A. "Good old Olympia ?"—yes, I have. The programme might
contain something new, without spoiling the entertainment.
Q. Would you like to go to the Victoria Palace of Varieties, the
Zoological Gardens, or an imitation'of the Wild West at the Albert
Palace?
A. No, I would rather not—far rather not.
Q. And why not P
A. Because this is Christmas-time, and should be a season of
pleasure for every one. 1 cannot help feeling that a visit to either of
the places you have mentioned would be indeed a sad
to the glad New Year.

PRESENTATION AT ST. PETERSBURG.
{From Our Own Correspondent.)
Tee Boshki Mir contains the following report of the
reception of " Mr. Spencer" by the Czar at a masquerade
and fanoy hall lately given by his Imperial Majesty:—
"Mr. Spencer" appeared before the Sovereign habited
in a costume considered by some spectators brilliant, but
seeming in some eyes to border on grotesque. It was a
uniform of the kind in English commonly called 1 motley,'
forming a pioturesque combination of colours, mainly a
symphony in white and red. In his hands he bore a
salver, whereupon lay a string of real Cambridge
sausages, which he respectfully presented, with the com-
pliments of the season, to the augUBt representative of
the Great Bear. His Majesty was graciously pleased to
receive the appropriate offering with his customary
condescension, accompanying his expression of thanks
with a significant wink of the eye, only asking, in
addition, 'But where's the Turkey?"'
The foregoing statement may be accepted as perfectly
reliable.

advancing the Negus, they would do much better to hurry

People. First-rate collection—(Do not like the word '' collection" as a
rule, because it reminds me of "going round with the plate," but in
this instance it means going round with the piotures)—specially
notable for the Dutch Room, whioh, as high up as immortal Dutch-
men oan go, is quite a little Dutch Oven below.
No 7. A " Turner." There are some fine specimens of Titrner
here, and this is one of the best. He was perpetually painting sun-
sets, and vet he was a subject of the British Empire, on which, as we
know," the 8un never sets." Consequently he never saw a sun-
set. What a wealth of imagination 1
No. 12. Portrait of a "Butler," with a query " (PT" after his
name. Evidently the Academicians didn't know whioh butler it
was, whether Toole Butler or Thornb Butler. It is by Sir Peter
Lely.
No. 33. A Curricle and Pair. Queer pair in the Carriole,
specially the lady in high feather. Stubbs, A.R.A., did it.
No. 43. It is called ".The Countess of Cork." Nonsense:
Countess of Burnt Cork perhaps, but undoubtedly a portrait of
Mrs. Stirling, the inimitable aotress, 1888. Anyhow, a sterling
work of Art, by Mr. Punch's old friend, "Mr. Briqqs," (R.A.)
No. 4-1. "Sea-Piece,or Sea-Tranquil." By Constable, R.A. This
is not an ordinary Constable, but a Speoial Constable. Sir Charles
Warren will be delighted with these first-rate specimens of Con-

No. 65. Portrait of Catherine Adams," by Johannes Ver-
spronck, highly finished. Although she evidently had said to the
artist, " You must take me in the ruff,—just as I am."
No. 72. "A Dutch Lady," by Ferdinand Bol. This picture is
so Rembrandtish as to suggest as a title a " Pol Masque"."
No. 74. "A Mill" a quiet, secluded spot, just the plaoe for a
Mill: no police near. Rembrandt knew what he was about.
No. 75. Mr. Barton McGuckin as the "Laughing Cavalier," by
Frank Holl ; no, beg Dutchman's pardon, Frank Hals.
No. 107. "The Fight Interrupted," by Jan Steen; probably
intended as a sequel to " The Mill.'
No. 109. Here is an "old woman " who lives in a frame,
She's painted by Rembrandt, what matters her name?
No. 134. "Europa." More American than European, and
suggestive of " Bull's Run."

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY.
Fkom Young England.
M.P.
Belvoir, Saturday.


eab Toby,
1 see by the papers that I am
again on the point of retiring from
public life in order to make way
for someone. I forget who it is
this time, which is a misfortune,
as that is the only touch of novelty
in the situation. Man and boy, for
the last fifteen years, I have, ac-
cording to the newspapers, been on
the point of retiring. Yet here I
am, Member for Melton, Chancellor
of the Duohy of Lancaster, and
Vice-President of the Committee of
the Council on Agriculture. As
Asm h-knk says, I am "always
Melton but never disappear." That
I understand is a joke, and goes
^^^L better with the assistance of Ash-
CL<h'~»' ™ b-bne's mellifluous vooal delivery.
But why should I retire more
than any other of the younger Members of the Ministry? I own I am no longer
as young as I was, but few of us are. Nature has been perhaps unkindly lavish
in endowing me with a venerable appearance. But I am still as young in heart
and mind as I was when I used to walk arm in arm with Dizzy to call on Lady
Bl-ss-ngt-n. How well I remember his ringlets redolent with thy incomparable
oil, 0 Maoassar I his tasselled cane and his waistcoat festooned with chains of
gold I I was a mere lad compared with him, and bo was George Sm-ihe. But
we both adored him, and I remember quite well one night Sm-the trying to
curl my hair like his. Only the other day I came upon a letter written by my
father to Lord Stb-ngf-bd, Sm-the's Papa. It is nearly fourty-four years old,
but I remember all about the time,' though of course I was not aware that my
father and Lord Stb-ngf-bd were in correspondence on the subject. The
Manchester Athenaeum was just going to be opened, and Dizzy had been asked
to deliver an inaugural address. Sm-the and I were going down in his train,
and our dear old fathers shook their heads. My father wrote in his stately way
to Lord Stb-ngf-bd: " I deplore as much as you do the influence which Mr.
D-sb-li has acquired over many of our young legislators, particularly over your
son and over mine. I have no personal knowledge of Mr. D-sb-li, and I have
not an entire respect for his talents, of which I think he might make a better
use. It is regrettable that two young men like John and Mr. Sm-tue should
allow themselves to be led away by a man of whose straightforwardness I have
the same opinion as yourself,—as I can only judge of it by his publio career.
The excellent dispositions of our sons render them only too susceptible to the
seductions of an artful mind."
Ah me! the days that are no more? Doesn't that last sentence hit us all
three off? The too susceptible youngsters, the mature young man, oiled and
curled like an Assyrian bull, and the alert artfulness under the magnificent
calmness of his pompous manner. But, really, I am convicting myself of that
old age which my enemies accuse me of. I remember how garrulous H-G ht-n
got in his old days, and so did Bb-gh-m and R-es-ll, sitting at the Scsean Gate,
always piping about old times-
Chiefs who no more in bloody fight engage,
But, wise through time and narrative with ago,
In summer days like grasshoppers rejoice.
fight against the tendency, and Bhall be truly obb'ged if you will not
le to give me a hint if you find me erring in that direction, either in
retpondenoe or conversation.
But I was saying, why should I retire more than
St-n-l-y, or Cb-nbb-k, or Cb-bs, or, indeed, G-bgy
E-m-lt-n? He was born a year or two after me, and is
my junior as time is reckoned. But you know him well,
and will, I venture to say, testify that he is actually an
older man than I, and has been ever since he left sohool.
He is one of the men who were never young, and I, if I
may say so, am of the kind who will never be old. On
the threshold of this New Year I feel as if I were only
beginning my career, ready to use my present position as
a springing-board for much higher flights. It is true I
am on the verge of three-score years and ten. But what
of that? Wasn't Shem a hundred years old when still
an active colonist? Or, not to go back so far, wasn't
Gl-dst-ne almost sixty before he was Prime Minister?
Wasn't Dizzy sixty-tnree? and wasn't P-lm-bst-n,
when he kissed hands on his appointment as First Lord
of the Treasury, fully twelve months older than I am?
and didn't he live and rule for ten years? What has
been done may be done again, and I feel like doing it. I
have lived through many changes, and shall see many
more. Take the House of Lords for example. When 1
penned that deathless line which devoted to destruction
our Laws, Commerce, and some other things which
didn't belong to me, asking only for the salvation of Our
Old Nobility, the Peerage was very differently constituted
from what it is now.
You know how they count the years of some trees by
the accumulated rings at their base; so I could count
my age by the successive additions to the Peerage. Why
I oount C-l-b-dge quite an old Peer to-day, and,
when I wrote about our Old Nobility, he was plain Mr.
C-l-b-dge. Cr-ss and Cb-nbb-k, Ab-bd-be. and even
Sh-bbb-ke begin, in my mind's eye, to gather round
their coronets the mistiness of respectable age. _ I do not
doubt that I shall live to see the day when, looking round
on newer batches of Peers, I shall regard as among our
Old Nobility Lord Add-ngt-n, Lora B-s-ng, and the
melodiously named Lord M-gh-b-m-bne. Till then,
don't you believe any gossip yon may hear about the
retirement of Yours Youthfully, M-nn-es.
HOW TO GET OUT OF IT.
The following hints may be found useful to any shy
and self-conscious person who, finding himself at the
present festive season involved in a jovial family gather-
ing that is expressing its hilarity by an indiscriminate
recourse to the modern " surprise" cracker, is determined
to escape the temporary humiliation of arraying himself
in the paper adornment it contains:—Go through your
dinner with a frown of melancholy anticipation. When
the crackers are at length produced, decline to pull one.
If foroed to, instantly hand over the contents to your
fair neighbour who holds the other end. If these happen
to be either a comic pig's head or a roomy bishop's mitre,
and she asks you just to try them on, smile benignly on
her, and say you " couldn't think of robbing a lady."
If addressed by your hostess with, "Now, Mr. Smith,
you really must wear something!" pretend not to hear
her, and tell somebody opposite, pointedly, how much
you prefer " a good old-fashioned Christmas."
If the son of the house tries to bonnet you with a
Turkish cocked hat, playfully pinch his legs and adroitly
tearing the offending head-gear in half, laughingly
observe that " you're sure it wouldn't have fitted you."
On the fun getting fast and furious, and everybody but
yourself assuming some form of ornamentation, endeavour
to damp it, by audibly remarking to your next-door
neighbour that you " can't conceive how a set of middle-
aged people can make such idiots of themselves."
If, notwithstanding this, your host determines to force
your hand, and says, "Come, Smith, put on something.
Why, you 're the only one of us who isn't bonneted 1"
get up then and there, and, giving him a bit of your
mind, leave the house with an indignant flourish.
Putting By for a Rainy Day.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CABINET OF CURIOSITIES.
"Now, my friends," said Lord Salisbury, taking
up his pen after the uaual New-Year greetings had
been exchangtd. "What shall we do? Has any
one a notion for the coming Session?"
"if you want an ocean," observed the Lobs
Chancellor, "you should apply at the Admi-
ralty."
"My good Halsbury," remonstrated the Pre-
mise, "pray be serious. Recollect we have im-
portant business to transact, and if you want to
re funny, reserve yourself for the House of Lords.
Presiding in the Peers you are always an amusing
spectacle. And now, onoe more, my dear col-
leagues, have yon anything to suggest f"
I suppose there is nothing fresh from Ran-
dolph?" queried Mr. Stanhope, who took an
interest in the movements of the would-be re-
former of the War Department.
"No," replied Lord Salisbury. "I fancy he
has grown tired of the idea of succeeding Prince
Ferdinand in Bulgaria. It has been said that he
purposes calling upon the Pope to put His Holiness
right on several matters of doctrine, but nothing
ceitiin is known about his movements."
"The point is—ha! ha! ha!" guffawed the
First Lohd of the Treasury, liberally exhibiting
the top row of his front teeth, "whether he will
bother us. He! he! he! Ho! ho! ho I"
"As he is said to intend to make a lengthy stay
abroad, it is more than possible that he may return
to Town to-morrow," replied the Premier. "Suf-
ficient for the day is"
"The Matthews thereof," put in Lord Haxs-
burt with a smile. "Then for the moment we
need not bother ourselves about Randolph."
Viscount Cross rose from his chair, and seized
the Lord Chancellor's hand.
"My dear Lord," he observed, with emotion,
"that is the most sensible—nay, I think I may
go so far as to add, the only sensible thing you
have said for months I Bless you!"
"Is it too early to consider the Budget ?" asked
the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
"No," replied the Premier, "if any one has
really any good notion for increasing the revenue
without an undue sacrifice of popularity."
"Seems to me that a licence should be required
for every Railway Bookstall," observed Earl
Cadoqan. "This would give the Government a
hold upon the circulation of treasonable or
libellous pamphlets. A licence might be revoked
in cise of misbehaviour."
"I have every wish to agree with the Lord Privy
Seal," remarked Mr. W. H. Smith with un-
customary gravity, "but I must protest, in the
name of the Press, against such an impost. Why,
if every Railway Bookstall were taxed, the civilisa-
tion of the last quarter of the Nineteenth Century
would be shaken to its foundation I Tax Railway
Bookstalls 1 Stuff and nonsense I"
"You do not happen to know the name of the
largest Proprietor of Railway Book-stalls?"
asked Mr. Matthews, the Home Seoretary.
"I am not quite sure 1" said the Treasury's First
Lord. "It may be a Mr. Brown, a Mr. Jones, or
a Mr. Smith, but I have a faint idea that someone
has told me that the principal Railway Bookstall-
keeper is a person of the name of Willing." _
No doubt he is willing to be so," put in the
I Lord Chancellor.
This sally caused such a loud chorus of
"Resign !" that Lord Salisbury had to interfere.
*' I am sure we all would regret the loss of our
excellent friend." Cries of "No! no!" "Well,
we should if he gave up the habit of making
pointless puns." A dead silence. "Thank you, I
thought so. After this expression of opinion, my
dear Halsbury, I do hope you will turn over a
new leaf, and keep any nonsense you want to
publish until you are able to incorporate it in
your customary abortive Lunacy Bill."
There was a pause, during whioh the Lord Chan-
cellor, with a comical assumption of wounded
dignity, left the room.

HAD HIM THERE!
Uncle Jim. "Here's half a Mince Pie for you, Tommy. I need hardly
remind a Person of your Classical culture that 'the Half is qrsatbr than
TBS WBOLBI'"
Tommy. "Quite so, Uncle. Bct, as I'm not very Hungry, I'll only take
a Whole One!"
"Now, that he's gone, we oan get to real business," observed Lord Salisbury.
"Well, my Lords and Gentlemen, what shall we do about Ireland P"
"Ah, to be sure," echoed all present. "What shall we do about Ireland?"
"Must do something," continued the Premier.
"Certainly," was the response, spoken in unison. "Must do something. Why
it's the subject of the hour!"
"Perhaps you would like to see a map of Ireland so that we could get at a
glance the physical features of the country. I can easily get it." This proposal was
received with enthusiasm, and Lord Salisbury left the room for a moment. And
now a strange thing happened.
When the Premier returned to the Council Chamber, he found it entirely empty.
Every member of the Cabinet had disappeared!
"I call that shabby!" said Lord Salisbury. "Well, I suppose Ireland must
wait; but we shall have to attend to the subject—some day." And with a frown he
returned to his own apartments, and only regained his habitual good temper after
indulging in a long inspection of some thousands of carefully-preserved caricatures of
Mr. Gladstone.
The Chairman of the Conference of the National 8ociety of Professional Musicians
has been lamenting the success of the Gilbert-and-Sullivan Operas. Apparently the
gentleman in question, whose name happens to be Dr. Heap, objects to the pile the
gifted Collaborateurs have been making on the score that, in the process, they have
demoralised the taste of the musical public. But, though the Doctor heaps up his
oharges, he does not suggest any way of solving the difficulty; indeed, could he do so,
and show how the British publio could be made to take a permanent interest in serious
opera, he would soon win the thanks of Mr. Carl Rosa, and that energetic impresario
would assuredly greet him with a gleeful shout of "HeapI Heap! Heap! Hooray!"
"Tempora Mutantur."—" Why change the head?" asked the Timet, in its
startling issue on the Centenary Festival Day, Monday, January 2, quoting from the
Times (of Times past), or Daily Universal Register, January 1, 1788. Quite so:
"Why change the head" now? Only if a title be required, why not 'Buckle's History
of Civilization' f"
A Perfect Ccre.—An impulsive gentleman, who was accustomed on frequent
occasions to utter "a big, big D," determined to break himself of the habit. He
reduced the big D to a little one, and for "I don't oare one 'D ,' he substituted
"I don't care one penny,"—i.e., "Id."
Note on a Recent Election.—Winchester voted Conservative before, and, in
doing so again, the constituents only followed the " Mos Majorum."

THE HOME AND "THE HOUSE;"
Or, Darby and Joan To-day.
"An administration of the law by which the old and the holpleaa are removed from
their children and their kindred into the workhouse, as a condition of relief . . . the
refusal of out-door relief, except on the same condition, whereby a family is sold up, their
home broken up, in all probability never to be reconstituted, and the whole family, old
and young, charged for ever upon the rates. This condition is known at this time to be
absolutely refused by an immense multitude of our suffering and deserving poor; they
will endure any privation of hunger and cold rather than break up their home."—From
"A Note on Out-door Relief," by Cardinal Manning. Fortnightly Review for
January, 1888.
Darby to Mr. Bumble, loquitur:—
"Comb into the House!" is your cry; "it's the Law, it's the Regular Rule,"
And 1 shrink, as I always have shrunk, and you call me a stubborn old fool;
And old I am surely
enough, and per-
haps I am foolish,
who knows P
But we've borne it
a weary loni
while, and we '1
bear it, I hope, to
the close.
Darby and Joan
they call us, my
foolish old
woman and me,
Because of our
clinging to-
gether; we're
Bixty years wed
do you see,
And parting this
side of the
churchyard is
what we oan
neither abide;
And all of them say it is folly, and some of them swear it is pride.
Pride! Well, we did know it once in our own little long-ago way,
Sixty years since, Mr. Bumble, when I was in work, with good pay,
And yonder old bedstead was new, and the eldest of seven just born,
And Joan had the light in her eyes, and a cheek like the breaking of morn.
But pride in these rubbishing rags, in our lonely half-sightless old selves,
The hearth that is empty of fuel, the bareness of cupboards and shelves?
Nay, nay, but it's foolish to think on; the pride that the parsons so blame,
Was long ago banished by hunger, burnt out of our bosoms by shame.
But obstinate ?—yes, I suppose so, for love is the stubbornest thing,
The weaker they grow, our old arms, why the closer and tighter they cling.
Our ohildren are dead — — «-> '—
And—you bid us"
kind.
"Sweet Home!" we have sung in our time,—eh, Joan, you remember, my
dear ?—
Bat that musio, no doubt you will tell us, would sound like mere mockery here.
Home I when there isn't a crumb-feast to tempt the lean souttering mouse!
Little of home-feel is here, but we doubt there'd be less in the House.
Ah, you may argue, and argue I Go argue the bird from its nest,
The dog from the side of its master, the babe from its mother's warm breast.
The nest may be torn, and the man may be poor, and the mother ill-clad,
But the instinct that olings is too strong for the reason that rates it as mad.
I'm mad, without doubt, in your eyes; and the Poor Law, of course that is
sane,
To crouoh by the Union Are, nothing empty, save bosom and brain,
No hunger, out that of the heart, no fear save that terror untold.
That creeps at the thought of "the House" to the breast of the helpless and
old:-
The fear that to you is as foolish as babyhood's dread of a ghost,
To linger unloved and alone 'midst an alien uniformed host
Of strangers alone and unloved, broken waifs that the world cannot miss ;—
You will tell us—and how shall we answer him, Joan P—must be better than
this!
Joan, my Joan, who would then be hut little more mine than the dress,
They would wrap round these rag-covered limbs, oan we hope to make gentle-
folk guess,
The terror, the tearing asunder, the wrenching from love's latest hold,
The void that's more awful than hunger, the palsy more dreadful than cold?
Our friend here is getting impatient. Perhaps, were no memories ours
Of the sunlight that shone on our prime, we should slink from the shadow that
lours
d or are fled, I am eighty years odd and nigh blind.
Come into the House!" and no doubt you consider it'
Into any retreat. We were taxed in our prosperous
days like the best,
And pride would scarce stay our old feet from the road to
a haven of rest.
But who calls the House suoh a haven? Not those who
have herded therein,
"Keep out of it, Darby," they ory, "whilst a coin or a
crust you can win."
Badged, brow-beaten, ranked without heed to the links
of a lifetime? No, no!
The road to the grave, though 'tis hard, is a road we
would far rather go.
So help to the helpless must come, say our Masters, or
come not at all.
A choice between heart-break and hunger for those fate
has thrust to the wall.
Is that a wise Country's last word to its aged ones?
Well, you have mine;
And you call me a stubborn old fool! Joan! Joan! be
content, I decline!
No, Joan, I am not to be taken. Be comforted, wife, I
am here, [then, my dear.
We scarcely can see one another; take hold of my hand,
Nay, I 'm not yielding, not yet; though perhaps were
you warm, and well fed
Ah! pardon, old wife; we 're together, the word that
should part us unsaid.
• • • • •
Mr. Bumble loquitur: —
Dead 1 In each other's thin arms clasped close, as they
wished, to the end!
Yes, I called him a stubborn old fool, and the fool
wouldn't know his best friend.
Pah! but the poor are as mulish all round, as though
beggars might choose.
If a voice could awake in him now, I suppose it would
wake—to refuse.
Maddening, folly like this, to a mind that's official and
clear! [for many a year!
Dead, in the damp, chilly den where thev've huddled
Whilst the Union gates are ajar, and the Union pallets
are spread,
With a Poor Law shaped all for their good, and they
spurned at its help, and they 're dead!
Wouldn't be parted, forsooth 1 Could not argue them
free of that scare,*
With talk of indulgence for age, or of Guardians' dis-
cretion. The pair,
Like hundreds of couples, seemed crazed on the point,
and persuasion was vain.
Bogey tales of the House arc the creed of the credulous
poor, and their bine.
Dabby and Joan! It is dismal. What good has it done
them to die, _ [but here, in this Btye?
Clasped close, but with famine-pinched faces, together,
It's folly; it's worse, it's a nuisance. And yet they
look peaceful-like. Come!
They've escaped from the House, after all, and, poor
fools, let us trust they 're—at Home!
• With reason or without, it is commonly imposaible to per-
suade the aged poor that they have any assurance of rot being
separated when once in "the House;" that the Guardians have
any discretion in the matter, or, having it, are likely to use it
in their favour. The old couple whom the writer has in his
mind were impervious to argument on this point.—Ed.
"Dot and go One," is Mr. Toole's motto in reviving
this effective Christmassy pieoe, which is far from being
in its dot-age. Dot and go like one o'clock it probably
will, until the new piece by the Partners Mkrxvale has
been sufficiently rehearsed. Mr. Toole as Caleb Plum-
mer (which in one paper's notice was misprinted" Cable"
Plummer, thus giving the comedian plenty of rope) is
seen to great advantage, and naturally considering that
the old Dickens-Bjuoioault drama would draw money
during the Christmas holidays, looks upon this Dot as a
"spec."

Rhyme for Babe!
POSTED UP.
Dear Mb. Punch,—I orave your sympathy and, if possible, your pro-
tection from a daily and ever-increasing nuisance that assails me. I
refer to the apparently inexhaustible stream of prospectuses, circulars,
stock and share lists, touting advertisements, charity applications,
stock-jobbers' letters, that flows into my letter-box with every post,
and which, did I not struggle against it with all my might and main,
would literally overwhelm me. Now, my dear Sir, I am a plain indi-
vidual, of no special notoriety, living in a quiet West End square, and
my name is down in the Court Quids, and possibly in a local Directory.
But it happens also to be down somewhere as a holder of a few
Mining Shares, and I am known to possess some Railway Stock. And
this is quite enough. Forthwith, I appear to be selected as a target by
the Secretary of every possible and impossible '' concern " that the folly
of the greedy speculator or the chicanery of the enterprising promoter
sets on foot. I am showered with Prospeotuses. They pour in on me
literally in hundreds. Silver Mines in Mexico, Gold Mines in South
Africa, Land Mortgages in Canada, all got up with entioing coloured
diagrams and maps of the various " estates," "lodes," and shafts,"
that are to secure me at once from 15 to 40 per cent, on my paid-up
capital, to say nothing of a thousand and one ventures nearer home,
in the shape of " Family Fog Signal" Companies, "Noiseless Draw-
ing-Room Cart-wheel" Companies, " Patent Automatic Double Tooth
Extracting " Companies, and I know not what other appeal to me
everlastingly for my finanoial support.
Nor is this all. Advertising stock-jobbers, as if my whole life
were one prolonged whirl of gambling in the Money Market, beset
me with entreaties to forward them any amount from one to five
thousand pounds in the shape of " cover " to enable them to have a free
hand for me and " realise handsome profits" in some " good thing"
or other that they, from special souroes of information of their own,
know is about to oome off. Nothing oan exceed the persistence and
push of these last-named advertising harpies. They pester me in ever
increasing shoals week after week. Then there are the endless
charity applications, generally accompanied by a small [novelette or
some other form of brief but stirring dramatic literature, and last, but
not least of all, the " circular " of the enterprising Tradesman who,
in his desire to escape a swift and direct transmission to the waste-
paper basket, purposely invades me in some artfully designed official
guise, and by either sealing his envelope with the Royal Arms, or
conspicuously printing on it some such superscription as " On Her
Majesty's Service," or" With the Prima minister's Compliments,"
deludes me into opening'it, and for a moment becoming familiar with
its touting contents—or rather, I should say he did, for I am on my
guard now, and am fairly roused; and for the last fortnight, driven
to desperation, have met the evil in the only legitimate way; viz.,
By consigning the whole contents of my letter-box, whenever they
have been brought up to me, straightway to the fire. As a matter
of fact, I have found that by so doing I have destroyed several
valuable and important documents, and among them a Demand-note
for Parochial Rates, a County Court Summons, a letter from an
executor enclosing a large cheque, and the lease of a friend's house—
the disappearance of all of which, I need scarcely say, is causing me
no little inconvenience. But what is this to the triumphant sense
of having for once been equal to the Prospectus-mongers! Not that
I have quite done that yet, but I will yet manage to evade them.
, Last Tuesday I nailed up my letter-box, and the Postman has
since shovelled the hourly consignment to my house down the area.
The Cook endeavoured to dispose of this yesterday, with the result of
setting the kitchen chimney on fire. I nave now some thoughts of
suddenly leaving my house, and changing my name, or even of

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Tut XlXth Century, "this so-called Nineteenth Century."
the Magazine, that is, for this month, is peculiarly interesting. Sir
Henry Thompson treats, sensibly and
cautiously, "The Progress of Cremation,"
which is not yet quite the " burning question"
that, later on, it is very likely to become. He
exclaims in a note, "What an opportunity
for a Campo Santo at Westminster I" Yes:
full of Br/Birs' Memorials. If it has ever
occurred to any readers of Mr. Frederic
(not "Frederick" which would be so
common, you know) Harrison's writings to
ask why this brilliant author has never
produced a comedy P or why, if unable to
construct a plot, has he never collaborated as
a writer of comedy dialogue P The anxious
inquirer will find a satisfactory answer in the second article of
this Magazine, entitled "The Two Paths," whioh recalls to
us the palmy days of Dr. Barlow, sweetly conversing with
Harry and Tommy, or the epigrammatic dialogues contained in
the Easy Lessons by Maria Edoewobth. We have one good word
to say for it, and with this he himself provides us; "the
word is" as the charade-players say, "Book-trotter," meaning
a "Variety reader" as distinct from a student. But wouldn't
"Book-skipper" be better? What cheer, Skipper! And isn't
the Skipper just the person who would keep a log, and when
anything remarkable was "found," wouldn't the Skipper "make
a note of it," and on he skips aeain? Still, Book-trotter is
good, and we thank Fbedebic-without-the-' k' (quite right
to get rid of all superfluous letters—only why not have sacri-
ficed the "o" and retained the "k"—thus "FrederikP") for
teaching us the word. Yes, Phreddtrik, we like book-trotting and
book-trotters: agreeable, superficial, sociable persons, and usually
good company. In the third essay Matt Arnold "goes for" Shel-
ley; in the eighth, Mr. Justice Stephen has round number three
with Professor St. George Mivabt; the Dragon always
had a poor chance with St. George, though apparently the
odds were on the monster. Mr. Justice wants to have the Professor
up before him, and sentence him out of hand. The Professor con-
ducts his own defence, and is able to take care of himself. A. C.
Swinburne, who in the Fortnightly for January, has such a difficulty
in rhyming to " babe," sends an article to The XlXth Century,
dated from Hanwell. The locality is its explanation and exouse.
Altogether, The XlXth Century Coach, Driver James Knowles,
makes a good start in the New Year. Apropos of Poet Swin-
burne and Hanwell, has the lecture of some eminent medical man
met his eye, treating of the melancholy end which awaits all
punsters, and, if so, has he in defiance of this eminent person written
this line in his Locrine—
"What boots it though thou plight thy word to boot?"
whioh the Poet clearly—that is, as dearly as possible—meant for a
pun, and a bootifol one, too, he thought it. If he didn't intend a
pun on the word boot, then that's quite another pair of shoes. Away
to Hanwell, where perhaps I may foregather with the Jubilee
Browning, and yet remain your devoted.

Air,—" The King qf the Cannibal Islands."
OHlhave you heard—but of course you have—
Of a curiouB creature, as stubborn as brave,
An iron-heeled kicker, a buck-jumping
knave,
Called the Irrepressible Donkey?
The " Blondin Donkey" is full of his trick?,
But the Irrepressible easily licks
His Music-Hail model in capers and kicks;
And the oleverest rider is found in a fix,
When he sidles up to the animal's side,
Flings o'er the saddle his legs astride,
And rides, or rather essays to ride,
The Irrepressible Donkey.
See him straddle, behold him rear!
The cleverest rider may well feel fear,
And cling to the neok, or hold on by the ear,
Of the Irrepressible Donkey.
This mischievous "moke" is an awkward
brute,
And apt from the saddle to suddenly shoot
The would-be Balaam who doesn't suit
The Irrepressible Donkey.
Many a Balaam that seat hath had,
Riders good, and riders bad,
But Tory, Liberal, Whig, or Rad,
This dreadful donkey has driven them mad.
Forster fuzzy, and Balfour tall,
Hicks-Beach, Morlby, each and all,
At one time or other, have had a fall
From the Irrepressible Donkey.
See him straddle, &c.
Balfour mounted as well as most,
And some of his friends are beginning to
boast
That he's a right Raret, who will not be
tost
From the Irrepressible Donkey.
Of Donkey-riding he has the gift.
Is up to each asinine struggle and shift,
Can make the animal feel his heft,
And prone on his back will never be left.
Balfour, they say. is a blessed boon,
He '11 treat as the Colonel treated the coon,
And make dance, soon, to a genteel tune,
The Irrepressible Donkey.
See him straddle, &c.
Well, that, of course, remains to be seen;
At present the oreature is prancing, I ween;
There still seems some "devil," and plenty
of spleen.
In the Irrepressible Donkey.
Round he goes with his hoofs asprawl,
His mouth gapes wide, and his teeth aren't
small,
With his ears laid back, and his tail to the
wall,
He doesn't appear a nice "mount" at all.
To brave Balfour and his "resolute" Chief
'Twill be a great joy, and a real relief,
To find there's one rider does not come to grief
With the Irrepressible Donkey.
See him straddle, and stamp, and rear!
Look at his grinders, and twig his ear!
He '11 still want a good deal of " riding," I
fear—
The Irrepressible Donkey!
"A SELF-EDUCATING PROFESSION."
In consequence of his distinguished suc-
cess at Berlin, Mr. Charles Wyndham, wLU,
it is probable, play David Garrick at St.
Petersburgh. The play has been already sub-
mitted to the Chiet of the Detective Police,
who is still engaged on attempting to discover
the plot. Mr. Wyndham; has assured the
Head of the Department that there is nothing
in it—meaning the plot not the head—but
this sounded so like Nihilism in it, that the
play will now have to undergo the severest
scrutiny. Mr. Charles Wyndham will play
the part in Russian. The title of the piece
will be Davidoff Garrickski.
It is understood in certain well-informed
ciroles that Mr. Henry Irving (who in spite
of all reports to the contrary, is quite well,
we are very glad to hear, ana doing first-rate
business. We always did think his business
very good, especially as Mephistopheles, Louis
the Eleventh, and Mathias) is studying Spanish
and Portuguese, in order to play a round of his
favourite characters at Madrid and Oporto.
Mr. Toole is studying Spanish in order to
appear at Madrid as Don Paulus Prios, but
Miss Linden has requested him to defer his
engagement in the Fiji Islands for another
week or two, in order to enable her to obtain
a thorough mastery of the language. Some
Sandwich Island men have already been sent
on in advance with the board-advertisements.

THE SHALLABALAH MAHARAJAH;
Or The Confessions of an Indian Prince.
I'll tell you the adventures of a Famous Indian Prince,
You needn't start as the news I impart,
I'm the Shallahalah Ma'rajah!
I've been lionised in
England, and haven't
sot over it since,
For the truth to tell, a
terrible swell
Is the Shallabalah
Ma'rajah.
I'm overwhelmed with
gold, and so can while
away my time;
My suite is large, my
costumes grand, my
jewels too sublime,
And I look like Harry
Nicholls in a Christ-
mas Pantocaine,
And you know how,
to curtsy and bow.
To the Shallabalah
Ma'rajah.
I came to London,—
S'rhaps I'd better say
ow I begun,
For no Nabob, was
half such a nob,
As the Shallabalah
Ma'rajah.
I took three spacious
Mansions and I threw
them into one.
With a door for you,
and the other two,
For the Shallabalah
Ma'rajah.
You asked me out to
dinners, and you wrote
the words "To meet

His Highness the Maharajah," on your cards for the elite,
And you gave me much to look at, tno' there wasn't much to eat,
And a ninepenny hook, whioh you placed in stock,
For the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
I was carted off to Pictures, Playhouse, Party, Concert, Ball,
And ho! the rush, of extravagant gush,
For the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
And oft to your House of Parliament—the greatest trial of all,
And once,—or more, you detected a snore,
From the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
Then crowds I asked to dine off Curry, Bombay Duck and Spioe,
With pounds and pounds of Garlic and a ton or two of rice,—
The latter very wholesome, and most filling at the price—
And I made them drink, the pure Indian Ink,
Of the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
I got so bored of Town—I thought to get beyond your reach
Of friends—a host—suggested a coast,
For the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
So I took a row of houses with a view of sea and beach,
But the mob was shrewd, and hotly pursued,
The Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
And nobles called from Hanley, Barnsley, Leeds and Preston Pans,
With Yarmouth Trippers, Cotton-brokers, Welsh and Highland
Clans;
And a swell whose name was Bfgoins, but who called himself
Bcjans,
Who broke his brace, while bowing with grace,
To the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
I was summoned to Windsor Castle, and I thought a lot of that,
A carriage saloon, was fitted up soon,
For the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
At the Castle I was kept awaiting hours on the mat—
With an aged Peer, who adopted a sneer,
For the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
I was shown some precious tapestries, some pictures and a jar,
Aud then I was invested with a precious badge and star,
And the aged Peer presented me with a precious bad oigar,
With a wink of his eye, he bade a good-bye,
'To the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
I've seen the glorious Million and the glorious Upper Ten,
And bear in mind, they were all of them kind,
To the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
And I've seen your splendid sailors, and your military men,
And a word of advice, I think will suffice,
From the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.
I've heard you do not want to fight—by Jingo if you do?
You'd better see your guns don't burst, or bayonets break in two,
And your ironclads, should rest upon,—not under the ooean blue.
I may be wrong—but that is the song,
Of the Shallabalah Ma'rajah.

in our pockets each a packet of sandwiches.
Pater. That is right, my dears. _ The joint spirit of economy and
self-relianoe should govern our aotions from our earliest years. And
now that you have seen that magnificent home of all that is beautiful
in Nature and Art, the Crystal Palace, tell me what glorious exhibit
most attracted your attention. Was it the Court of the Alhambra,
the Pompeian House, or the fine collection of plaster oasts P
Johnny. Not one of the three, dear Papa,—we were most pleased
with the Pantomime.
Pater. Was it a good one?
Maria. A very good one. It was oalled Robinson Crusoe, and was
written originally by the late Mr. H. J. Byron.
Pater. Dear me, it must have been the old Princess's Pantomime,
in which Espinosa appeared. He played, I remember, the part of
Friday.
Harry. Mr. D'Aitban takes it now, Papa.
Pater. And it could not be in better hands. And now, little
Georqy, what did you think of the ballet f
Oeorge. Booful, booful—booful ickle exter ladies.

understand that the ballet was perfect, from the premiere danseuse
down to the extra ladies.
Oeorge. 'Es—that's what ickle Georqie means. Booful, booful I
Pater. And the scenery?
Maria. Was charming. The dresses were also in excellent taste.
Mr. William Rionold too (who I think I have heard you say is an
exoellent melodratnatio actor) was capital as King Tyranny.
Pater. And were you pleased with the harlequinade?
James. It was not so refined as the opening. Some of the Clown's
jokes savoured more of the East than the West End.
Pater. And after seeing the Pantomime I suppose you hurried
away to revel in the treasures of Art?
Maria. That no doubt was our inclination, hut it being Christmas
time, we considered it better to postpone the revel you suggest for
the moment, and as an alternative pleasure to dash into an Enter-
tainment of a Conjuror and a lady oalled Astarte.
Pater. I trust that the excellence of the show compensated for the
loss of the rich intellectual treat you apparently sacrificed in order
to attend it?
James. The Conjuror had rather a melancholy manner. I feel
that should I ever wish to see him again (which is improbable), I
would prefer to renew his acquaintance during Lent.
Pater. And, after this, I suppose you all rushed to the Egyptian
Court to inspect the interesting mural inscriptions with their vari-
coloured hieroglyphics?
Maria. No doubt we should have done this, dearest Papa, had it
not now become too dark to identify them. So we went instead to
see Mr. Snazelle and some Dissolving Views, in another part of
the building.
Pater. And were you satisfied?
James. More than satisfied. We were so pleased with Mr. Sna-
zelle—who appeared to us to be an admirable tragedian—and his
Dissolving Views, that it was with the utmost difficulty we tore
ourselves away from them both to catoh a train. Our regret was
the more acute, as at the time of our departure Mr. Snazelle,
dressed as Mephistopheles, was singing a modern comic song.
Pater. Well, my dears, you seem to have enjoyed yourselves
thoroughly, and as, from what you say, you appear to take more
delight in intellectual prowess than mere scenic display, you shall
all pay (the only thing you will have to pay, as admission is gratis)
a long visit on Thursday to the Museum of Practical Geology in
Jermyn Street.
Omnes. Oh, thank you, dearest Papa! That will indeed be
delightful!

"0 Hymen, Hymen, reillumethy torch!"
So sorrowfully sighed the lovely Lady Psyche Featherflioht.'
There had not Deen a wedding worth calling a wedding in
England for full five years. The fashionable fanes of St. George's
and St. Margaret's were as deserted as the pillared aisles of Palmyra.
And the Lady Psyche was the unhappiest girl in all England.
She loved, in the fearless old fashion, of course,—but all fashions
of love were old now,—young Walter Wheatear of Rockferry
Farm. To all appearances she might as well have adored Mount
Athos, or worshipped Arthur's Seat.
"Psyche,," said her Mother, "I believe it is all the result of
Science, and Socialism, and Statistics, and things,—especially those
horrid Statistics, which seem to me to upset everything, and which
I think are most wicked and impious, besides being so shockingly dry
and boring. The world went very well before your Goschens and
Giffens went in for tabulating everything, from heart-throbs to
oorn-imports, from Unemployed averages to the Marriage-rate."
"Well. Hymen is the onief of the Unemployed now, Mamma, at
any rate, moaned the Lady Psyche.

the elder lady, flouncing impatiently away.
"If Statistics have done it all," sighed Lady Psyche, " I only wish
they were tied round Mr. Goschen's neck and oast into the •"
Nothing of the sort, my poor girl," answered a honey-toned
voice. It came from a handsome youth who—in November—might
have been taken for a sort of glorified link-boy, though more lightly
clad than that function in that season might seem to demand.
"Oh, you have returned, then P" cried Lady Psyche, recognising
him instantly. Where have you been hiding yourself P
"I've been studying Fair Trade with Howard Vincent,"
answered Hymen.
"The wretch 1" ejaculated Lady Psyche, viciously. "I don't
mean you," she hastened to explain, "but Howard Vincent, for
detaining you all this while in the interests of his most precious
fad."
"You don't understand," said the youth, pityingly. * "It is no
fad, but a fatality. Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus. Of course
you understand that. In the absenoe of Ceres and Bacchus, Venus
grows cold. Without corn and wine. Love loses warmth. And as
you've chosen to turn the cold shoulder upon Ceres, can you wonder
if she has chilled towards you P"
"What do you mean?" cried Lady Psyche.
"Simply that wheat is at so absurdly low a figure, that it doesn't
pay the British farmer any longer to produce it," answered Hymen.
"Verb, sap..'" And he vanished.

*' Ceres, to thee belongs the votive lay,
Whose locks in radiance round thy temple play,"
sang the Lady Psyche Wheatear.
They cannot play more radiantly round the goddess's temples |

husband, fanning her fair flushed face (flashed with mingled love
and August heat, as she bent over her baby's berceaunette) with a
copy of the Mark Lane Gazette.
Hush! Whisper not a word of even comparative disparagement
of the 'rich-haired, daughter of Rhea,' or nobody knows what may

OUR DEBATING CLUB.
An Evening of Incident—Duff wounds CockbulVs feelings —The
Hon. Sec. proves his acquaintance with the Rules—the Debate
is brought to a close in an unprecedented manner.
It is just about a year ago that one of our meetings was attended,
not only by most of the regular members, but also by an incident
of so startling and unusual a nature, that we are all of us a little
shy of alluding to it, even now.
The motion we were discussing was one which ever possesses a
strong fascination for the more speculative order of mind, being to
this effect: "That this House is strongly of opinion that the
existence of what are vulgarly known as 'O hosts' is sufficiently
established by credible testimony to be accepted as a positive fact."
Cockbull, who proposed the motion, after a most eloquent and
exhaustive speech lasting over three-quarters of an hour, and freely
punctuated towards its close by the President's bell, concluded thus:
And now, Sir, as far as was possible in the limits afforded me "—
{"ping-ping" from the bell)— I have quoted, I think, every instance
of a supernatural appearance recorded since mankind first began to
observe these phenomena with any attention." (This was no idle
boast; the number and variety of Cockbull's cases, and the masterly
manner in which he narrated them, had reduced almost every
Gargoyle to a condition of "goosi•flesh" and erected hair.) "I have
also mentioned a striking experience of a female member of my own
family." ["Ping-ping.") "I shall be very little longer, Mr. Presi-
dent. Without having the presumption to suppose that the few and
feeble"—{"No. no!" and another faint "ping )—" I repeat, the few
and feeble words I have uttered to-night will have had the effect of
froving Ghosts absolutely up to the hut—I do venture to think that
have succeeded in setting Speotres up before you to-night as solid
facts, deserving of our earnest, our reverent, and philosophical
attention and support. I do presume to believe"—("ping-ping-
ping.'")—"I have just done, 8ir—that the Hon. Member who is
down to follow me to-night will find it less easy than he imagines to
demolish, discredit, and explode a thing so rooted and intertwined
with our most oherished prejudices and traditions as what, to use the
terms of my motion, is ' vulgarly known as a Ghost.'" {Enthusiastic
applause.)
Plumley Duff, who had undertaken to oppose, got up with an
offensive assumption of bringing the disoussion down to a matter-of-
faot level. Doff is a good fellow, but he doesn't seem to know
when he is utterly out of touch with the general sympathy of the
meeting.
"The Hon. Gentleman," began Duff (with the heavy humour he
employs at times), " says, he doesn't believe I shall find it easy to ex-
plode one of his ghosts." {It was so like Duff to fasten on a verbal
expression of that sort—but we never consider this fair argument).
"No more do I. Let him bring me a ghost, and then, if the thing
will oblige me by remaining long enough to give me time to strike a
light, 1 don't mind attempting—for the Hon. Gentleman's satisfac-
tion—to ignite the gas, of which I should expect to find it largely
composed." {A slight movement of distaste among several Gargoyles
at this ponderous flippancy.) "I don't think I risk much in making
this offer, and I '11 tell you why,—I haven't the slightest belief in any
suoh rubbish." {Here a sharp rap sounded from the middle of the
table, just in front nf him, and the President called " Order," with a
slight frown.) "We've been told to-night of ghosts that moaned,
and warned, and beat drums, and threw furniture about, and other
gymnastics of the kind—but what I want to know is—what do they
da it with'i What is a ghost, after all, according to the evidence f
A gauzy, cobwebby affair, like an old veil- People tell us they have
looked through them, and noticed no internal apparatus, nothing of
what you may call ' works' of any sort or description. Very well—
but you can't make even such a simple observation as 'good even-
ing '—to say nothing of uttering a long and complicated warning—
you can't so much as gman, without a complete set of vocal cords,
m fair working order. You oan't beat a drum, or pitch chairs at
people's heads, without muscles. (" flap- rap-rap!" on the table
again.) "I must really ask Honourable Gargoyles in my immediate
neighbourhood not to play the fool." {Sensation, and warm disclaimers
from several Members, who, I may here state, were quite incapable of
sueh an action.) "If yon want to go anywhere, and see anybody, you
must exeroise some sort of volition, and, to exercise volition, a brain
(I don't say a powerful brain, because I never heard of any ghost
who gave any sign of even average mental power), but some brain is
indispensable. How do you get all that in a few feet of film?
No, no, Gentlemen—it won't do. We oan't have Mr. Cockbull
coming his ghosts over us. Then he tells us a long rigmarole—I do
not use the term in an offensive sense, but it was long, and it was a
rigmarole—he tells a long rigmarole about what an aunt of his by
marriage once saw, or believed she saw I Gentlemen, he should
have brought her down here"—{four very loud raps—at which even
Duff started)—"to tell us her adventure in person, and then we
should know what to think."
Here there was quite a scene; Cockbull sprang up, quivering with
emotion.
"I appeal to you, Mr. President," he said, "whether I am to be
subjected to these unseemly taunts! It is extremely painful to me
to explain that the reason why I am unable to bring my relative here
to-night, is, that," {here his voice broke)—" she—she is no more.
She was my great-great-aunt, and expired in the latter part of last
century."
A murmur of sympathy with him, and marked disapproval of
Duff, after whioh Pinckxey said: "Order, please. Mr. Pluklkt
Duff, I think it is not advisable to drag any member's deceased
relatives into this debate—they are scarcely relevant."
At this, Fabsell rose, with a oopy of the Rules: "I am very
reluctant to ohallenge your ruling, my lud—I mean, Sir—but may I
draw your attention to Rule 53, sub-section (6):—" A remark is
relevant, if it refers to a statement by a previous speaker, which the
President has not at the time declared to be itself irrelevant.' I sub-
mit, Sir, with all respect, that, as you did not rule the Proposer's
Aunt out at the time, Mr. Duff was perfectly in order in referring
to her."
[Outcry, and " Shut up ! "from one much excited Gargoyle.
"Well," said Piwcewey, coldly (considering Faddell a nuisance
—whioh, to be candid,'he occasionally is), "Go on, Mr. Duff."
{Here a perfect shower of angry raps proceeded from the table,
actually upsetting some of the ink, and spirits-and-water;
several members drew back their chairs and looked pale and un-
comfortable.
"I—I will just say something on the question of ghosts' clothes,"
said Duff {one resounding bang lower down the table, after which
we all glanced at one another, meaningly), "but—but after that
expression of opinion, I—I will sit down. . . I should like, before I
do so, to assure the Hon. Proposer of my deep sympathy with him in
a bereavement to which, had I known it earlier, I should not have
permitted myself an allusion." {"Hear! Hear!")
After this, we sat for some time in awed silence; little Bosher
was the first man with presence of mind enough to look under
the table, but he reported that he saw nothing but the ordinary
number of members'legs. We were all proceeding to satisfy our-
selves of this personally, when we were brought up again by a fresh
phenomenon—a tremendous blow, at the door this time. Poor
Bosher, who sat with his back within a couple of feet or so from the
door, grew almost hysterical, and I am not ashamed to admit that,
none of us liked to go and open it; we knew that the outer door
was securely fastened, and that it was, humanly speaking, im-
possible for any living creature to be in the ante-chamber at that
particular moment. Hartupp suggested that Duff should go—but
Duff retorted that he was not expecting any aunt just then, so the
matter dropped, and Geyser rose a little later in evident emotion.
"Gentlemen," said Geyser, "we have had a warning to-night
against being led away by the pride of intellect. If—if there be
reailv among us this evening, some invisible spectator from across
the Threshold—do not let us afford it—her—the indignity and the
pain of being present while her very existence is being exposed to
ignorant and irreverent soeptioism, such as" {with a reproachful
look at Duff, who was wiping his forehead) "we have heard so
recently. Do not let us tempt, by a further parade of inoredulity
some manifestation, which the nerves of some of us" {with a glance
at Bosher, who was obviously much upset) "might find too great a
strain for the intellect to bear. I propose, Sir, that we prooeed to a
vote at once, without further discussion.'
[Loud applause, led in a ghastly manner by the door.
Well, we did prooeed to a division, with the result that fifteen
voted for the motion, and none against it. Duff deolined to give a
vote one way or the other, having ascertained from the Secretary
that nothing in the Roles oompelled him to support his speech by the
ballot.
Then we broke up in a subdued manner, and our awe was in-
tensified, if anything, by discovering that the door of the ante-
chamber was looked as usual, and that no one was secreted in any
part of the passage. A strange circumstance, whioh Bosher, for
some reason, did not seem to consider as having any direct connec-
tion with the other manifestations, was that a long, and very
handsome ebony stick of mine, with a large round apple of agate at
the top, was, to the best of my belief, certainly not in the place
where I can almost swear to have deposited it on entering! Bosher
advised me not to mention this, as, owing to my being_ unable to
Bpeak quite positively on the point, critics might consider it the
weakest part of the case. It amuses me now to think how calmly
and philosophically Bosher could talk—after it was all over. He
was anything but calm and philosophical at the time 1

THE
LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
From Uncle Pcmblkchook.
Lyndhurst, Hants, Saturday.

ear Toby,
Hanoing with grooms
and porters on one of the
many bridges at Clapham
Junction, and having a
few minutes to spare, I
accepted the mute invita-
tion to try my weight ex-
tended by one of the
automatio machines which
leek, not to say dominate,
our railway stations. In
view of some suoh oppor-
tunity, I had in my waist-
coat pocket a leaden disc,
in size and weight some-
what resembling a penny.
I confess it was in my
mind to drop this into the
receptacle. But it was a
busy hour of the day. the
station was crowded, I
might have been observed
and the action miscon-
strued. Accordingly I inserted a coin of the realm of the proper
designation, and, having tried my weight, found it guilty of being
nearer eighteen stone than it should have been.
Whioh thing, dear Toby, your keen intellect will have discerned
is an allegory. What I picture to my fancy as having been done at
Clapham Junotion, I do dailjr with huge and natural satisfaction.
The Automatio Try-your-Weighter, if one may so name it, is Publio
Opinion, and I miss no opportunity of measuring myself by that
standard. The occupation is the more inviting because, as 1 have
hinted, the results are invariably satisfactory. Like Ebsktne, as
described in the Anti-Jacobin, " With respect to the extent of my
faculties, I consider myself in many respeots a finite being." Still,
m I sit and oaress my chin and smile softly to myself, I come to the
I conclusion, I trust not egregiously, that there are few men in
| England, not excepting the Grand Old One, who possess in fuller
measure the enthusiastic approbation of their fellow citizens. It is
true that there are persons in the House of Commons that assume
indifference to my excellent points, and even achieve the semblance
of amused contempt for my performances. _ Also the Times news-
paper as we call the journal, to distinguish it from the Times Four-
storied House, the Times Bathing-Machine, or the Times Beady
Keokoner,—the Times newspaper, I say, misses no opportunity of
goading me. _ But the reasons for this are obvious. In the House
of Commons it is either envy or apprehension that assails me. In
the Times newspaper it is disappointment. You will know that at
one time I was habituated to enliven its ponderous columns with
disquisitions having legal bearing upon the events of the day. I
have abandoned that habit, and the Times newspaper, angry and
disappointed, takes such revenge as is open to its capacity.
But place me on the platform, face to face with my countrymen in
thousands assembled. Is there anyone received with more enthu-
siasm f Is there anyone with lighter touch, with defter fence, or,
when need be, with heavier stroke P For suoh an hour's triumph as
vol. xcrv. b
from time to time falls to my lot when occupying the publio plat-
form, I count labour as nought. Many is the hour, pacing the
glades of the New Forest, that I have wrestled with Meditation in
quest of impromptus. You who have heard me will bear witness
that there is no smack of the New Forest in their delivery. Some
among the envious talk of a little ponderosity in leading up to the
flash of wit, a trifle too muoh humming and hawing, a too nervous
research in my coat-tail pocket. But there are no bounds to the
misrepresentations of envy. You know that my jokes, my quips
and cranks, seem to be born on the very platform where I stand in
face of men.
And how they live and spread till they become household words!
It sometimes happens that I am a humorist in spite of myself. I
suppose even the Times newspaper will admit that there is no phrase
of recent years that has become so familiar a part of the English-
spoken language as the "Grand Old Man." Who gave birth to this
empyrean flash of characterisation f It was I—mot qui parte. It
was at Derby, now some years ago, that, addressing my constituents,
I flashed forth this impromptu. It was quite true I did not at the
moment mean it quite as it was taken. Gladstone was at the time
emerging from a cloud. I saw it clearly enough, though I confess I
made a mistake in the summer of 1874, when I delighted the Con-
servatives by turning and rending my former leader. I really
thought at the time he was done for. He had but a year before
taken me from below the Gangway, knighted me, and made me
Solicitor-General. But it looked at the moment as if his power of
conferring benefits was exhausted. So I took him by the collar and
ignominiously shook him, whilst the Conservatives shrieked with
laughter and applause.
But it was different in 1879. His time had come again, and, a*
you know, even in temporary reverses I have never committed again
the mistake of that J uly night in 1874. It was with tears in my
eyes and emotion softening my strident voice that to my constituents
in Derby, I pointed with patronising pitiful finger to the Grand Old
Man. For the moment I felt like Mr. Pumbleehook contemplating
Pip in his hour of misfortune, "This is him as I nave rode in my
shay-cart. This is him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is
him to whom I have been earliest benefactor and the founder of his
fortun's—The Grand Old Man I" The phrase was not taken quite
iu the sense I meant. It was turned and twisted by unsympathetic
Tories, and instead of a tribute of aff eotion, became a term of derision.
But with the Liberals it is to-day an epithet of sincere and warm
affection. Thus genius, if I may say so, coins in • moment of in-
spiration a phrase that suits the manifold views and needs alike of
the Masses and the Classes. Never mind with what intent I invented
the phrase. "The Grand Old Man," will last as long as the English
language.
These things do not induce in me any feeling of self-elation.
Rather I am depressed with apprehension for my Party and my
country when the time comes to lose the benefit of my counsel and
advice. I read the other day some remarks on the infinite Heavens,
delivered at the Royal Institution by my friend Sir Robebt Ball.
The subjeot is one that curiously attracts me, being as I think, just
suitable to my range of thought and my style of oratory. Says my
friend Ball: "Were the Sun with his whole system to be suddenly
annihilated, an observer on a star in the distant realms of space
would only notice that a tiny star had ceased to twinkle." Mr.
Speaker,—I mean Toby. Sir; that may be all very well for the
Solar System. But when I drop out of political life I fear there will be
consternation in Aroturius, seriousness will settle down on Sirius,
and Betelgeuze, brightest, jewel in the belt of Orion, will momentarily
pale. Yours faithfully, W. V. H-rc-ri.
THE CAREFUL BURGLAR.
When the Winter nights olose in,
And the pleasant fogs begin;
When the moon's intrusive light
Is obscured from mortal sight;
He who burgles by sound rules,
Then should furbish up his tools.
As the surgeon whets his knife,
For preserving human lite;
As the sportsman oils his gun,
With the season's earliest sun;
So the burglar, cool and keen,
Sees his instruments are clean.
Wipe the jemmy, oft 'tis said
Harder than a policeman's head;
See that no corroding grit
Harms the wily centre-bit;
That no rust appears upon
Dainty keys, caJlcd skeleton.
Although hidden by the mist,
We shall need the shoes of
list;
And our modesty may a>k
Coy concealment from the mask;
Bull's-eye lanterns we, of course,
Carry, like our friends the
"Foroe."
There's the small revolver, still
Careful burglars do not kill;
Conscientious men like me
Operate in secrecy.
Some Directors do the same,
And we blush to find it fame.
Motto as a Reus of Glldabce for Metropolitan Board of
Wobks' Officials.—" ' Orders' is Heaven's first Law."

IN THE DAYS OF KING FOG.

January 9—13, 1888.
Kixa Foo be arose, and he slily tapped his nose, and he said unto
himself, said he,
With the croupiest of chortles, "0 you miserable mortals, 'with
your tortures I'm about to have a spree.
The horrors ordinary of a normal January, I shall do my best to vsry
in a style
That your best adepts at joking, midst their coughing and their
choking, shall admit is scarce provoking of a smile."
Then he ups, the sooty king, with an India-rubber spring, and a
foghorn he applies to his mouth,
As a friendly sort of summons to a set of cronies—rum 'una,—who
came from East and West and North and South.
They were habited as demons, some had skins the hue of lemons,
whilst others were as swarthy as their king;
And each drab or dingy devil seemed an Avatar of evil, and up to
every kind of horrid thing.
A bouquet of foul gases, such as Britons who are asses from their
chimneys and their chemicals let fly,
Their fellows to asphyxiate—such idiotio tricks I hate—and inter-
cept their sun and hide their tky,
Could scarcely be more nasty, and their faces, swart or"pasty, bore a
funny sort of horrid hectic glow,
As for mischief all agog, each one winked at old King Fog, as who
should say, "All right, old boy, / know."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Then King- Fog_ at once descended with the demon who
attended his intolerable Court, upon the Town;
And the day at once grew dimmer, and the sun ceased
e'en to shimmer, and the gas-jets seemed to glimmer
and die down.
All tints save blaek were banished, and the very
roadways vanished, yon couldn't see the lamps nor
e'en their posts;
Faded house, and tower, and steeple, and, as for the
poor people, they prowled about like damp and
dismal ghosts:
The shores of Styx were bland matohed with Fleet
Street or the Strand; you couldn't see your hand
before your face;
Your neighbour in the dark seemed aBoojum or a Snark,
who, five feet off, was gone, and left no trace.
A foul and foetid pall full over each and all; its
ingredients were mist, and muck, and smoke,
And smoke" includes, of course, stuffs from every
filthy source, that can irritate, and blind, and clog
and choke.
For the Fog-King, fiend sardonic, summoned aoid gas,
carbonic, also sulphurous, from chimneys and from
stills,
Playing capers demoniacal, with vapours ammoniacal,
and adding to the sum of human ills
la every sort of way. He abolished night and day, you
could only tell the difference from the docks,
He "retarded radiation," a malign abomination, and he
filled tho public ways with ugly blocks."
He muddled all the traffic, and the bard who 'd pen a
aapphio, and the painter swell preparing for next
May,
Were driven well-nigh mad, for no light was to be had
save the gas-lamp's dim and uninspiring ray.
He increased Monopoly, whioh, to the poor, if not the rich,
is a pestilent unpardonable crime:
For he made the gas-rate rise, and he got in people's
eyes, and he covered everything with greasy grime.
He made all crossings dangers; cosy citizens felt stran-
gers to their offioes and smart suburban villas;
Cabby wished he might be blowed if he could find the
road, and collided with the letter-posts and pillars.
He demanded ten-and-six. a fare too stiff for Styx, for
orawling from the Bank to Brixton-hill,
And he got exceeding drunk, put his fare in a blue funk,
and finished with a comprehensive spill.
Then King Fog he chuckled low, for all trams were late
and slow, fog-signals kept on banging day and night,
There were crowds on every platform, and the porters
were in that form that's produced by plaguing ques-
tions left and right.
The torches and the links made abominable stinks, and
the torcherers—I mean the howling boys,
Who stretched their leather throats and dropped pitch
upon your coats,—lent precious little help, though
lota of noise.
Fog led to rows and racket*, and he hindered the mail-
packets, and he brought the river-traffic to a stop.
He drove the mob to drinking, and the "publios" filled
like winking, for one couldn't see another sort of shop.
The theatres were void, which the Managers annoyed, to
the Law Courts clients oouldn't find their way,
And the children as a rule couldn't grope their way to
school, and they lost themselves when going out to
play.
Suoh misohiefs were not small, but, oh dear, that wasn't
all, for the death-rate was most dismally increased.
King Fog's a foe to life. Sadden suicides were .rife,
and asthmatio age's gaspings grew—and ceased.
Then King Fog laughed long and loud, and his
courtiers, a black crowd, gathered round their misty
Monarch, and he cried:
"0 my henchmen I this is grand; our strong hand is
on the land, and we rule this foolish country far
and wide;
Give Science my defianoe! there is not the least reli-
ance on one plan or one appliance she suggests.
Smoke-prevention? That's her joke, for her schemes all end
tn Smoke, as this sooty five-days' Carnival attests.
Her pretensions we oan squelch, whilst the chimneys
fame and beleh, and the Town's a blend of Phlege-
thon and bog,
All her pratings are but vain, and again and yet again
you shall hail the ruthless reign of King Fog I"

PUTTING IT OFF.
A Story 0; Stornoway, from the " Times" o/1988.
It is much to be feared that affairs in the North have at length arrived at
a serions crisis. News comes from Lewis th it last night the two millions, who
owing to the refusal of the crofters to emigrate, have in a century increased the
population of the Island to that formidable figure, and, who by the undefined
encroachments of the landed proprietors, have for the last nve-and-twenty
years, been dragging out an unoomfortable existence on the rocks and bathing-
machines that fringe the sea-shore, to whioh they have been quietly relegated
by the slow process of a complicated legislation, rose as one man, and breaking
through the granite barriers, whioh everywhere surround the coast, commenced
a raid on the herds of wild hippopotami to the preservation of which, at
the cost of the exolusion of the inhabitants, it is well-known that the soil
of the island is entirely given up.
The Summer lettings of the various runs to Caff re Millionnaires, who now
come over annually for the electric-shooting, bring a handsome sum into the
pockets of the absentee proprietors, and the islanders who look on while the land,
to the cultivation of which they count on for their support, is ruthlessly wrenched
from them, and handed over for the purpose of affording a few months sport and
delectation to the wealthy representatives of eivilised Niggerdom, have natu-
rally resented the invasion, and determined to resist it. The situation is not
new. About a hundred years ago affairs, though on a far smaller scale, had got
much into the same condition. Then, as now, tbe Government of the day had
let things drift on, without heeding whioh way the current was setting, and. had
waited till matters had come to a pretty pass, only intervening at the eleventh
hour, when they had arrived at a orisis and were almost past remedy. And suoh
has been the story ever since, and now the news oomes that every hippopotamus
through the whole length and breadth of the island has been driven over the
northern headlands into the sea, and that a wild population of two millions are
at this moment dancing a f rantio Highland fling around the smouldering embers
of seven proprietorial mansions, in whioh it is rumoured that as many Caff re Mil-
lionnaires, to whioh they appear to have been sublet, have been unfortunately
roasted alive.
In the face of this intelligence the Government have been obliged to take

ness to start with, five Marines) and a drummer for Stomoway at
a moment's notice. Meantime it is said that the Proourator-

disguise, hare managed to meet in seoret on the pier, but do not
exactly know what to do next in the peouliar and threatening
oiroumstanoes in which they And themselves plaoed.
The general opinion appears to be, that the whole question'of the
position of the Crofters and their grievances ought to have been
thoroughly gone into and sifted more than a century since. But the
policy of that time was to let things drift and drift, and gradually
get beyond oontrol; and apparently successive Governments have
seen no reason to depart from it sinoe. Hence the result that is
seen to-day in something little short of a Revolutionary Movement
in the North. And it is very doubtful even now, if the Government
will know how effectively to deal with it.
VOCES POPULI.
AT THE PANTOMIME.
Iir the Stalls.
Fint Paterfamilias (to Second ditto, apologetically). Oh, I don't
suppose I set foot in a theatre once in two years, in a general way.
I shouldn't be here now, if it hadn't been that but I thought you
never went at all P
Second P. Not to regular theatres—no; I consider their in-
fluence—ah—pernicious in many ways. I think it's almost a duty
not to enoourage such entertainments as—well, burlesques, and
musio-halls, and ballets, and so on. But there's no harm in a
Pantomime.
Firit P. No, of oourse not. So I say. Got up to please the
ohildren.
Second P. That's all. Your family here?
Fint P. {a little confuted). Well—no; faot is, I was just passing
the doors, and—and I'd nothing particular to do this afternoon,
and so—and to——Where are your ohioks, eh?
Second P. (with tome embarrassment). Er—at home. I thought,
before bringing 'em, I'd better see for myself whether there was
anything unfit for children to see, v'know, and, being in the neigh-
bourhood, why [They quite understand one another.
The Pantomime proceeds. Each Paterfamilias positively cries with
laughter at the comic parts, and then remarks apologetically to
the other, " Well, really, it s such ridiculous rubbish, you can't
help smiling at it!" The wonderful groupings and processions
of the Ladies of the Pallet rouse them to enthusiasm, and they
thoroughly appreciate the popular songs and Jests introduced by
the prmcipal performers. As they leave, they say, "After all,
I suppose you ought to be young to really enjoy this tort of
thing.'"
In the Boxes.
Unsophisticated Small Child (in much concern). Mother, is the
Donkey really angry with the Queen P
Kindly Uncle (to prim little niece). Well, Ada, enjoying it, eh?
Ada. As muoh as I ever do enjoy a Pantomime now—Uncle,
thank you.
Uncle (rather cruthed). Hal and Alice, what's your opinion of
the fairies, now P
Alick. I don't quite see what ute they are—but they don't dance
badly. How much do you snppose they get a week for it, Uncle P

The Harlequinade Begins.
The P. P. Look at them all walking on the street, 'ow natural
that is, now!
A Pittite (discovering a curious coincidence). That Chemist 'a got
a queer name, ain't he? "A. Pill,"—not a bad name for a
chemist, eh ? he sells pills. [He considers this as a Joke of hit own.
Clown on the Stage (examining large piece of meat). Oh, I say,
what's this?
The Simple P. (solemnly). It's a flap of beef.

a flitch of bacon.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The best book about the Eton of Keate's time, is Mr. Wilkin-
son's reminiscences published by Hurst and Blacxett. In tone, it
is thoroughly Etonian, and in spirit too.
The author is candour itself, or almost
itself, for as to some of the most mis- |
^flt^SPc?) chievous faults of the system he is
discreetly silent. His motto is, " Eton,
W&£F^^tig?W with all thy faults, I love thee still,''
and this sentiment all Etonians will
echo. '' Esto Perpetua," is Eton's own
motto, and thougn time has wrought
some changes, yet on the whole the
school Bee ma to have been much the
same in the reign of Keate as it was
under his successor Hawtret, and as, with oth*r modifications, and
let us hope improvements, it probably will be to the end of the ohapter.
For the benefit of nou-Etonian readers, Mr. Wilkinson's reminis-
oenoes ought to be supplemented with a glossary of Eton phrase-
ology. Every large school has its own peculiar slang, and what
constitutes the great oharm to outsiders of the conversation which
is bound to ensue when a few old sohoolfellows, whether Etonians,
Wykehamists, Westminsters, or Harrovians, get together,—but
Etonians are the best at it,—is the oonstant recurrence of words and
allusions whioh require ample explanation to be in the least intel-
ligible to the very-muoh-out-of-it stranger. By all Etonians of the
past and present, and to many non-Etonians who may be familiar
with the school, Mr. Wilkinson's readable reminiscences will be
I found uncommonly entertaining.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CHRISTMAS-TREE AT THE HAYMARKET.
Sib,—Distrusting the verdict on a first representation, I deferred
my visit until last Thursday, by whioh time I said to myself, every-
thing will be in proper working order, and I shall be able to
pronounce on the merits (if any) of Partners.
Whether the play be taken from a foreign novel or not, and
Partners is avowedly a dramatised version of Daudet's novel,
-* Jeune et Risler Ami, of which the majority of English

The Race for the Ledger.
playgoers know nothing, the question is, is Partners a good, an in-
different, or a bad play. My reply is contained in the middle term.
If the old story, of the confiding plodding commercial man " minding
his own business," and leaving his frivolous young wife an easy prey
to the too fascinating scoundrelly friend (and in this case partner)
of the husband, must be used again as a plot for a drama, it requires
strikingly original treatment, telling dialogue, and powerful acting,
to make it attractive to the public, which, from the days of Still
Waters run Deep, Ton Taylor's admirable dramatio version of
Charles de Bernard's novelette Le Oendre np to now, has had
rather a surfeit of these dishes made from French receipts, the
sauce piquante being generally omitted.
It is in five Acts, which, at the outset, courts unpopularity. Every-
one with the exception of Mr. Allen as the butler (another comic
butler! no wonder the one at Toole's Theatre has left his situation)
snivels at one time or another; even the villain, I fancied, pretended
to do so when deeply affected by being found out; and nearly all the
characters pass their time in rushing in hurriedly, remaining a short
time, saying nothing worth remembering, and rushing hurriedly out
again, aa if they were only "doing their turns" at the Hay market,

and had to fulfil other engagements elsewhere. A promising per-
formance is that of a little child in a night-gown, who is evidently
"more than seven."
The commercial details of the story "are brought into undue pro-
minence, and the oleverly oontrived scenic realism of the Counting
House only serves to bring out in strong relief the unreality of the
action and the weakness of the plot.
What is intended for one of the most striking situations occurs in
the Third Act between Mr. Tree and Mr. Kejjble—admirable as the
candid, well preserved, confidential clerk—is unduly spun out, or
appears to be bo, owing to the failure of Mr. Tree to "come up to
time." As is Mr. Tree so is the whole piece to be summed up in
the phrase," d peu pres"—almost, not quite. Meant to be startling,
it becomes commonplace, and the audience listen, passively interested
like so many Micaujbers, hoping for something to turn up, or for
something to come down, whioh something, eventually,is the Curtain.
Mr. Bj:ook fikld is amusing in what he has to do in the piece, thongh
he has nothing to do with it, and his, perhaps pardonable, exaggera-
~ of make-up and action take him quite out of the picture. I
have seldom seen Miss Marion Terrt to greater advantage, though,
considering the very ordinary type of character she has to imper-
sonate, this isn't saying very muoh. Why is the senior partner
a German ?—except that it gives Mr. Tree an opportunity of saying
"mein leetle child," and calling his
wife his "fran," and exhibiting in a
general way an acquaintance with
portions of an English-German
conversational phrase-book, I could
not see any reason why he should
not have been an Englishman.
Nothing turns on the senior partner
being a foreigner; nothing is gained
by it, and muoh, I venture to think,
is lost by it, since the senior partner
might have been far more effective
had a new type of English commer-
cial man been given us instead of
a conventional "character part"
whioh, in a short sparkling Ger-
han-Keed entertainment, would
be properly called " an illustration."
Perl aps if he had a song in broken
German-English, it would enliven
the piece a.bit.
Messrs. Buchanan-Tree's Hexn-
rich Borgfeldt (what trouble they
must have taken over this name!)
is a oolourless, shallow - pated
creature, whose emotion never gets
beyond a drivel, and whose weak
passion never rises above an ebulli-
tion of temper, in which he is frequently about to strike somebody-
once, the old olerk, who could have doubled him up like a shot;
once, his young partner, who could have bested him with one hand,
and the other tied behind him; once, his wife, who was on the
ground; and, once, his sister-in-law (Miss Achurcu decidedly
clever), who could have boxed his ears and brought him to his
senses,—but he never carries out his intention. And so is it with
the villanous lover, who is perpetually being foiled at the oritioal
moment. In fact, BorgfeldVs ineffectual attempts at a striking
situation are significant of the piece, and of the acting,—a peu
pres—almost not quite—a hit.
Quitting the Theatre, I murmured this little song, addressed to
myself as your Critic:—

A-part from the piece.
t some one
Address him thus, and say;—
"Good man, spare this Thee,
His partner and his frau.
Reduce fire acts to three!"
Too late to do it now.
Good man, spare this Tker,
Bent knees and startled"
The piece did not suit me,
It may be better now.
It was Buchanan's pen,
That wrote this fire-act play,
For my part, (whioh is a very small one and not in the piece) I
should give this advice to the Weeping-Willow-Tres,—merely
'Change Partners." Yours sincerely,
Little Jack nr the Box.

and under the patronage of Princess Christian; so it was quite
a Christian aot and a Koy'le entertainment.

Oh, what is it comes forth from its fastness in the North,
With its breadth and its hulk and its tierce if foggy form?
What shape is it that rears? Is't a Bogey's or a Bear's P
And heralds it a laugh, or portendeth it a storm P
From the ooldness and the dark it stands forward stern and stark,
Fierce as the Fenris Wolf with moist lip and gaping maw.
Oh. is it all a sham? Like some droll colossal lamb,
Has it put on a bear's hide but to move a moment's awe P
Bear or Bug-bear P Foe or friend? Parties wrangle and contend,
Divine Figure from the North with the merest shaggy ooat.
Or a big blood-thirsty Bruin, bringing war, red wrath and ruin,
As prompt to crush a friend as to rend a rival's throat?
If you'll take the Creature's word, all suspicion is absurd;
A benignant, Fathtr-Christmassy, soft-hearted Atta Troll,
Is this brawny big-toothed brute with the hairv Arctic suit,
A Noah's Ark-y beast, and as harmless as a doll.

I am not a Bear, my dear; I'm a Bug-bear, that is all; [malice;
The Mock-Turtle, my sweet child, wasn't half so kind and mild;

"As to spear, or sword, or gun; that, of course, is all my fun;

Like that Wolf who meant no good to poor dear lied Riding Hood;
I am not the sort of brute who on little girls could feast 1"
Meanwhile he standeth there in the likeness of a Bear,
And a brawny Bear at that, and a toothy and a tough;
And as far as one can see, he seems armed cap d pie,
Though he'll certainly declare—if you ask him—that's all stuff.
Oh, wherefore comes he forth, in this fashion from the North P
Is it mischief that he means P Are they teeth P Is that a sword P
From the shadows and the snow he will growl an angry " No!"
And they who 're so disposed may accept the Monster's word.
"INTOIRELY MOLLOYDIOUS!"
At a meeting of the Sarsfleld Branch of the National League held
recently at Limerick, a gentleman of the name of Molloy distin-
guished, or rather extinguished, himself by making certain observa-
tions not entirely in accord with the sentiments of those present. He
said that " their feelings as Irishmen were so aggravated that they
were all of the same opinion, and had about the _ same words to
express what they would like to do." No doubt anxious to hear an
expression of their inmost thoughts, his audience encouraged him with
a " Hear! hear 1" to proceed, upon which the speaker continued—
"He would tell them that he had always been of opinion, at least for a long
time, that Ireland would never be able to get anything from the British
Government until sbe was able to take England by the throat with one hand
and show her a rifle in the other. That was what Balfour and his minions
wanted, he supposed.''
Upon this " the Secretary" mildly remonstrated " that that would
be playing into their hands." Upon which the Molloy explained
"that because it was that they bad no chance that he would be a
party to moral force." After this the meeting was inclined to treat
"the moral force party" with levity, but still he insisted upon
attempting to urge his views. Baffled once or twioe in obtaining a
hearing, he at length managed to protest against a vote of thanks
being passed to Mr. Wilfred Blunt for kindly undertaking two
months' imprisonment. The report of what followed is so instructive
that it is as well to give it in full:—
"Mr. Molloy said that while he had no objection to passing a rote of
thanks to Mr. Blunt, he thought they ought not to put themselves very
much about in passing it. The English people had voted for coercion for
Ireland, and now, if the English people came over here, he did not see why
they should not get a taste of it.
"A Member.—You are a fool. Shut up!
"Mr. Molloy said he never interfered with any man expressing his
opinions, and he did not think he should be interrupted. The English
people had given them coercion, and he said now and again if they got a
taste of it they deserred it. A Member.—Nonsenss. Shut up!''

behind it), Mr. Molloy did " shut up." It is said " that music hath
power to soothe the savage breast," which refleotion recalls to mind
the fact that this eccentric exponent of moral force has a namesake
who is one of the most popular composers of the day. Could not the
author of "The Vagabond" try his hand, or rather lute, upon a
person whose name might prove a not incongruous pendant to that
justly celebrated sons;? It would be a great thing for Ireland could
Mr. Molloy be composed to silence—not only for Ireland, but pos-

THE BOW OF ULYSSES.
"The Bow of Ulysses," you say " is unstrung,"
0 Fkoude of the tiery and fulminant tongue 1
Well, your bow's at full stretch, but you shoot in the dark,
And your arrows, though pointed, fly wide of the mark.
There are mighty few get to the Bull's eye, and why?
Ton bow-arm is stout, but you haven't an eye.
Ah, Fboude, my dear boy, you 're a patriot bold,
But you really are horribly given to scold.
For the role of a Goody you re rather too good,
Clear-sightedness never combines with that mood.
It was not a morsel the style of Ulysses,
And whilst you shoot thus you '11 score little but misses.
You run round our Realm and find everything wrong,
Because we will talk. Now that's ooming it strong!
If " the eloquent tongue," is the devil, why then
How much better think you is the eloquent pen,—
Say yours, which for eloquence cannot be beat?
Your pictures are fine, and your diction's a treat,
But 'tis folly to try—if you '11 pardon the hint—
To drive men to Silence by Tall-talk in print.
"Palaver" you favour with many a wipe;
Is it really muoh better when set up in type?
The " Worthies of England" were doers," no doubt;
They fought, travelled, tilled. Did they grumble and flout?
Dear me! one might think, if one listened to you,
Bull was only a man whilst he quarrelled and slew.
If Demos were deaf and the Demagogue mute;
If the poor man were treated once more like a brute;
Were Palaver" a privilege kept from the crowd;
And confined, like mnch else, to the wealthy and proud;
If nobody talked save Prince Bismarck and you,
If all Blacks were made slaves, and all Radicals too,
If Gladstone were gagged, if Lord Cbubchill were burked,
Whilst the nobles all ruled and the people all worked;
If "Penelope Britain" alone on her isle,
Could find her Ulysses in—Tommy Carltle,
Would all go quite right 'neath the rule of the Strong One ?—
If that is the Bow you'd see drawn, it's a Long One!

(As this is, of oourse, not intended for publication, 1 pur-

letter avowing your undying and deep-
rooted hatred of the accursed country,
to the downfall of whioh we have
both devoted the remainder of our
natural lives; as also for the Postal
Order for two-and-sizpenoe, which,
however, I fear I shall find some
difficulty in cashing in this barbarous
locality. This is awkward, as though
I have been taking a little money by
showing myself dressed up in my
"jools," as our mutually honoured
friends in Dublin would call them,
still I haven't yet been able to nobble
the Governor here, and as funds are
getting low, every rouble is a con-
sideration. I am, therefore, seriously
thinking of applying to a travelling

Incapable Foo of England. terms with the proprietor, I shall then
and there offer to lay my life and its servioe at the feet of him whom
I shall henceforth regard as my Imperial Ring Master. My sword,
of course, is included in the bargain.
And that reminds me, if this scheme falls through, do you think

we have both

Couldn't the Management contrive to work me in somehow with the

and a comic song, with a bit of "go" in it, I am quite strong
enough to draw alone. Perhaps Maskelyne might see his way to
something?
Meantime, Honoured Friend, how about my getting into Parliament
for an Irish county? I should like to swagger in the lobby. I
suggest this, for, entre nous, I don't think this Russian business
means to pay. I 've blustered, kept up communications with several
distinguished Asiatio and European cut-throats, worn my " jools " on
Sunday afternoons and Bank Holidays, left oards on all the nobs,—
but somehow they don't bite. I don't seem to go down. So keep
your eye open, and as soon as you see anything to communicate,

"I'M AFLOAT!"
The Trials and Triumphs of a Tobpedo-Boat.
I'm afloat, I'm afloat, for the present at least,
Though on what may next happen wild fancy will feast;
But I say, up to now, I'm afloat, I'm afloat,
Which is something, you see—for a Torpedo-Boat.
It is true my fore-engine is all out of gear,
And the top of my feed-pump is busted, I fear;
But in triumph I gleam, and in gladness I gloat,
For—though leaky and orank—I'm afloat, I'm afloat!
It is muoh more than some of my consorts can say.
Twenty-four of us started one morning in May;
For a trial of steaming we stood out to sea,
And, by Yulcan! we had a remarkable spree.
Oh, the joy of the jolting, the pride of the pace
A few of us, though, were soon out of the raoe.
Twenty-six miles an hour—/or an hour—may do,
Till you run on a rock, and disable your screw!
One did so; of course she no more could be used.
Another broke down, for her crank-brasses fused:
A third made a show, but her pride was soon piqued
When her engineer found how her main-feed valve leaked.
Her fires were then drawn, and, no doubt, you '11 perceive
That with furnaces empty a ship's on sick leave;
But that was just nothing compared with the next,—
I 'm assured her commander was really quite vext.
For they let in her boilers the water get low,
And the furnace-crown caved in—a terrible blow!
And the steam all escaped, and it flew far and wide.
All the Staff were well scalded, and three of them died.
Seven boats were thus " boshed "; will't surprise you to learn
That an eighth—it's put vaguely—" broke down on return."
Well, some did return, which is something to boast,
Though a shaky, disabled, demoralised host.
And now you '11 perceive—it's as clear as a star—
What a terrible lot we Torpedo Boats are.
To whom? Well—ahem!—to—that is—I suppose,
To anyone handy, excepting our foes.
You see we go queer, and we get out of gear,
Go colliding like fun, being awkward to steer.
Blow up. boil our crews, run aground, ay, and sink.
Won't that frighten our enemies? What do you think?
My positions are proved, I am happy to say,
By Reports of those Trials the twelfth of last May.
Read them, and they '11 second my simple remarks,
And you '11 own that our trials are really great larks.
For myself, I feel shaky. They put me in dock,
But I haven't entirely recovered the shook.
Still do please recollect, when supplies you next vote,
That although of small use, I'm afloat, I'm afloat!

POETRY AND PASTRY.
Dear Mr. Punch,
I have written this pome about the
mince pies, thinking it might be a good
thing to have it printed. I have also put in
something about Elsie, because she made
them. I don't want my name put to the
pome, because the fellows are sure to see
Punch, and they don't understand things of
this kind, and would very likely laugh at
me. And one doesn't care to have one's
friends' names humbugged about in the
playground. Tom has looked over the
verses, and says they are very good, now he
has invested them with artio merit, and he
has put iu some of his own, which are
rather rot. He very nearly got "the New-
gate" (I always thought "Newgate" was a
prison, he says it's a prize 'un) at Oxford,
only he wasn't allowed to go in for the
Exam, for it, as he had to be in training.
I enolose a stamp, not necessarily for use,
but as a quarantine of good faith.
Tours truly, Ebbtcst Pumhho.
(My nom de "plum.")
P.8.—If you don't want to use the stamp,
you might send it back to me.
THE POME.
Elsie went down to the Kitchen
Where they made the Twelfth-Night
feast,
And it's oh, she look'd so betwitehing
That Cook from her cooking oeas'd,
And let her make tart, pie and cake,
And she wasted a pound at least
Of butter and flour; but Cook never look'd
sour.
And she's sometimes a surly beast.
Oh. the yule log, and the ewe, ewe lamb,
But and the yew-tree gray;
And a new year's coming up, my love,
For the old year's gone away.
[Ton made this up. Jit says it
gives a cachet.
She look'd so lovely as she sway'd
The paste with dainty fingers,
That round the pastry that she made
An endless glamour lingers,
Like the hidden light of a swallow's flight,
Or the silence of perfect singers.
How dull and beas'ly are our schools,
And starting is the worst day;
They always have new-fangled rules.
And give us French the hrst day;
And Elsie's face will till the place,
Like a mirage when you 're thirsty.
Aunt Post says that horrid boy
Will kill himself with eating,
But little wots she of the joy
That sets my pulses beating:
It's not the tart that shakes my
It's Elsie, pretty sweeting.
And why not die P What hope is mine P
She's now five years my sen'
In vain bright eyes upon you t
If rivals come between you;
Bat the holidays were all divine,
And Elsie was their genia*
Yes I How can boy make better end,
An end more sweet and sudden,
Than smiling die of Elsie's pie
After a course of pudding,
With teeth fast fix'd in the mince she mix'd
And her pastry, white and wooden.
Oh, the yule log, and the ewe, ewe lamb.
But and the yew tree gray;
And a new year's
For the old year'
* This is a female good genius.

OUR WINTER EXHIBITION OF THE WORKS OF YOUNG MASTERS.


CHARLE3 DOBDLER.
Born, 1869. Flourished, 1879—87.
No. 1. "Landing of Julius Casar." This Artist was unknown in
London until he oame up for the Pantomime, when he painted
No. 15, in this Collection which it appears, however, had been already
preceded by the " Landing of Julius Casar" and No. 6, A Bather;
all three it is surmised were originally portions of the same pioture,
as the three were discovered by Miss Trimmer, (engaged as day
governess by Charles Dordler, Senior) in the first page of
harles's Child's History of England, which he was studying at the
seaside.
No. 6. A Bather. By the same Artist. The picture is in admi-
rable preservation, as Charles Dordler always took care of No. 1.
No. 15, "Actors." By the same Artist. This was drawn when
he was seriously thinking of adopting the Stage as a profession. He
went so far as to buy a Theatre, with real lamps for wicks and oil, an
orchestra full of musioians in blue and red, and the side-boxes well
filled with a paying audience. But these theatrical speculations got
him into a great mess (specially with the oil-lamps and paint) and
he soon relinquished the idea.
No. 16. "Soldiers on Bridge." By the same. A fine composition.
JOHNNIE DOBBIN.
Born, 1869. Flourished, 1881.
No. 2. "Robinson Crusoe, his Pets, and Friday." We possess,
unfortunately, very few specimens of this excellent Young Master,
most of his sketches having been destroyed by his younger brother
and sister, who, in conjunction with the baby (aged two), out them
up for "scraps," which, after having formed part of the celebrated
Danusseri Collection, were summarily disposed of by the authorities
who guard these treasures.
It is probable that this picture was painted about 8*30, just before
going to bed, as it bears traces of his later manner. By way of aiding
the pathos of the design, the dignity of the Crusoe being apparent
in his noble though wild air, the Artist has given a certain aifeoting
significance to the figure of Friday. The animals, it is conjecturtd,
are by another hand, perhaps his left.
No. 7. A Sea Piece. By the same Artist. There ie, we 1

another version of this great work extant. Observe the breeziness of
the sails, the massive heaviness of what is miscalled a Light House.
Also notice the sky above and the sea below. This somewhat novel
arrangement has been largely oopied by servile imitators.
No. 11. "Blue Beard." By the same. A line conception. The
Savage Turk has seized his hapless bride, the twentieth victim, by
the hair of her head, and waves his flashing scimitar in the air,
while on the roof of the castle is seen the despairing figure of
Sister Anne as she scans the horizon and gives the latest intelligence
to her sister below. A curious circumstance is related in connection
with this picture. While Johnnie Doriiin was at work on it with
the bjx of paints that had been given him on his previous birthday
by his uncle Mr. Bolaine, his cousin, Billy Boi.aink, between
whom and Johnnie there had always existed considerable rivalry,
entered the apartment, and in the absence of Johnnie, took up a
brush charged with lamp-black and made a great "splosh" (as he
termed it) on Blue Beard's eye. Johnnie, on returning, exolaimed,
"Billy has been here and has given Blue Beard a black
eye." Whereupon he immediately sallied forth, and, overtaking
Billy in the street, produced the same effect on his cousin's eye
as Billy had on Blue Beard's. After this lesson they became the
greatest friends, and it is said that Billy lent Johnnib his own box
of paints and imparted to him many of the secrets by which he had
attained success in bis own peculiar line.

No. 3. Landscape, with horse, ducks, and figures. Silvery effect
of about eight o'clock in the morning anywhere. The animals have
given rise to soma discussion, but the general impression seems to be
that the Artist, who never depicted anything without a subtle mean-
ing, originally intended at least one of them for a oow. The small
figures probably represent members of the painter's family. There
is a good story told about the ducks in this picture, which we have
quite forgotten. It is a question whether the hand of his cousin
Johnnie Dorbin is not evident in more than one of his duoks.
No. 5. Hunting. By the same Artist. Full of life and move-
ment. That the Artist should have selected subjects from country
life is all the more remarkable from the fact of his never having left
London until long after be had given up painting. Our own Land-
beer, or any of the great Dutch painters, would have found consider-
able difficulty in representing a horse and hound* with the fidelity to
nature displayed by this Young If aster. Artists admire the lumi-
nosity of the background where the fox is visible. The fox is worthy
of his brush I This is certainly Bolaine'8 young-master-piece.
GEORDIE PORGEE.
BoaN, 1876. Flourished, 1886—7.
No. 4. The MacMarmalade of Dundee. Lent by the Artist's parents.
Gkohdik was. from a very early period, devoted to the Orange cause,
as represented by the Orange-women with whom, when walking in the
neighbourhood of Covent Garden, he was never weary of conversing.
He was at one time thinking of becoming an Oranee Boy, but was
deterred from this project by his maternal aunt, Mrs. MacToffie,
one of the Harpbakes of MaoCalmond Rook, who assured him that
the Sweets of Home were preferable to anything he could get abroad.
The pioture represents a distinguished ancestor of the Artist, The
MacMabmaladk of Dundee, from whom he inherited the peculiar
taste whioh kept his palette thoroughly employed. We hope to dine
with his excellent parents next Tuesday, and to be invited to have
a little rabbit-shooting near Bunnie Dundee.
HORHYD LYTTEL PIKKELL.
Horn, 1875. Flourished, 1887.
No. 8. Horse and Man.—For the first few years of his existence
very few persons had the slightest idea of the variety and extent of
his genius. Horhyd Lyttel Pikebll was a great animal-painter.
Several interesting stories are told of him in this capacity. "At
one time," an old lady informed us, "he was staying in my house,
where I had some sweet pets—Tibby, the white oat. Phibby, the
black one, Beauty, the pug, and a miniature King Charles.
Scarcely had Lyttel Plkkell been a day in the'house, when he
developed his extraordinary talent for animal-painting. 1 well
remember the evening. He said the colours looked better by candle-
light, and you can imagine my delight and surprise when I saw Tibby
covered all over with red and black spots, its face painted like
that of a wild Indian, Phibby all over Chinese white with a vermilion
tail, the pug coated with orange-pink, and the King Charles a bright
sky ■ blue. With the true modesty of genius Lyttel Pikkel denied
all knowledge of the work; but artistic power will oome out, and,
after some hesitation, the animal-painter stood confessed. On hearing
his avowal I felt I should do wrong to confine his talents to mv house,
and he left." _ There are many similar stories told of him. He never
stayed long in any one place, and rarely ever visited the same
locality a second time,—not, at least, to the knowledge of the inha-
bitants who would have been only too glad to have given him the
reoeption his merits deserved.
MASTER HARRY SANDFORD.
Bor.v, 1871. Flourished chiefly is the Christmas Holidays, 1836.
No. 9. Copy from memory of the celebrated portrait of an Ancient
Justioe known by his contemporaries as "Old Judge." This is not
from any private Collection, but has been taken from a publio hoard-
ing in the Metropolis. An acquaintance of the Artist informs us
that it was painted just before Harry Sandford went to the Crite-
rion Bar. Master Harry Sandfjrd lingered over this gem, this
Richmond gem, until he was seized with an attack of illness, whioh
resulted in the immediate attendance of Mr. Barlow with Dr.
Birch. This Artist is known as " Young Harry," and judging from
specimens of his peculiar work, Boms critics have conjectured
that he was not altogether uninspired by " Old Harry."
irrr bobby.
Born, 1879. Flourishing, 1888.
No. 10. Battle Piece. This spirited picture has never been
exhibited. Such works are scarce. Highly finished as it is, it waa
completed at a single sitting. Few military men can look on this
without feeling that Itty Bobby must have witnessed the scene he
so.vividly realises. Yet it is not so.
LITTLE THOMAS TUCKER.
Born, 1870. Flourished, 1880—1.
No. 12. Portrait of the Painter by himself. No work of Art
that we have ever seen conveys so foroibly the sense of absolute
loneliness as does this of Thomas Tucker by himself. His is a sad
history. He took to vocalisation in order to procure food, and, neg-
lected by his friends and an unappreciative publio, ohose to be a
recluse, and disappeared from artistic life. At one time, perhaps,
there were few Young Masters who had achieved greater fame, his
name, "Little Tom Tucker,' being a household word. Now we
soaroely ever hear of him. It is supposed, with what truth we do
not know, that the refusal of the well-known conceited and selfish
gourmand, J-ck H-rn-r, to shire any portion of his festive meal
at Christmas-time, broke T. Tucker's heart. We trust, for the
credit of humanity, that this story is not true.
8AMUEt, NO0DLEKYN3 (Tub Yoonobe).
Bobn, 1870. Flourished (for one day), 1887.
No. 13. "A Sentry of Art." One of the soldiers on guard at
the National Gallery. For this admirable, and, as we believe,
unique speoimen of this Young Master's work, we are indebted to
Nathaniel Noodlbkyns (the Elder). It was intended for the
present Exhibition at the Grosvenor Gallery, as illustrating "A
Cent'ry of Art," but the Artist's friends discovered too late for
the Artist, but not for Art itself, that at the Grosvenor Gallery only
the works of Old Masters were admitted. This unforeseen disap-
pointment embittered the Young Master's life, and at the beginning
of the New Year he exolaimed, I will paint no more I" a decision
whioh, while it was hailed with considerable satisfaction by his parents
and most members of the household, caused great grief to one
of his earliest and staunohest patrons, Mrs. Clare Stakcher, The
Washerwoman of Sope-Sudbury, who was accustomed to take away
with her, every Monday, the family pocket-handkerchiefs used by
the Artist in the course of his work, as well as his pinafores and
those of his little sisters, whioh^she treated with all the reverent
enthusiasm of a relic-collector.
TOMMY MERTON.
Born (Uncertain). Flourished—contemporaneously with
Harry Sandford, tub Younger.
No. 14. "Old Bogie. A beast— I hate him!" 'This is probably
a portrait of the Rev. Mr. Barlow, Jun., in full academicals. There
is a certain sad dignity in the features which commands ^respect and
inspires distrust. The misleading initials are evidently intended to
oonceal the authorship.
ANONYMOUS.
Born, 1876. Flourished, 1880—87.
No. 17. "Papa." The Motto, "It is a wise ohild that knows
its own father, is written at the baok of this picture. This is
evidently a cryptogram, ooncealing the name of the Artist. Several
amusing stories are told of this painter, for which we have neither
time, spice, nor patienoe, and, therefore, shut up the show.
A Lost Vocation.—The M.B.W., t.«., the Metropolitan Board of
Works, would have elected Mr. Hebb as its private Chaplain had he
not renounced all idea of taking orders. Though he professed him-
self perfectly willing to wear the M. B. Waistcoat.

"BRAYVO, 'ICKS!"
"I stand here for 'justice'—to Ireland."
NOT SO BAD AS IT SEEMS.
(An Echo from the Rue Faubourg St. Honor/.)
"What is now Lord Lttton's official residence has been allowed to fall
into almost squalid disrepair. The furniture and fittings would look shabby
in a second-rate petition."—St. Jamie'a Gazette.
The British Ambassador paced the room with thoughtful brow,
pausing only now and again when one or other of his feet caught in
a rent in the well-worn'oarpet.
"How can the signing of the Treaty be avoided P " he asked him-
self. "An hour's delay and the present Government will have
fallen, and we should then have to deal with their successors! What
do you do here?" The query was addressed to a young man who
had silently entered the room.
"I have to apologise to your Excellency," replied the new-comer,
respeotfully, for having presented myself before you without a
signal, but the last time I knocked on the door the panel cracked
beneath my knuckles. It is a wonder to me that you have been
able to entertain in this ruinous place."
"How I did it is my own seoret," said the Poet Diplomatist, nod-
ding half scornfully, half goodnaturedly, and by a gesture inviting
his visitor to place some papers he oarried in his hands on a table.
"Again, my Lord, I ask pardon," continued the Private Secretary,
for that was his position; "but I have my doubts about the advi-
sability of following the oourse you seemingly propose. I have good
reason for believing that were I to put anything on that table it
would not bear it."
"And this new Treaty is no light matter," laughed the British
Ambassador. "I wish therefore that I could delay its signature."
"The Foreign Minister is sure to be punctual. Ah 1 I hear his
ring," and the Private Secretary looked out of the window. Then
he stamped his foot with annoyance. "He has pulled the handle
with sufficient force to break the bell-wire!"
"And you by your thoughtless impatienoe have driven your foot
through the floor. See your leg is imbedded in the lath and
plaster 1 You should be more careful I" was the angry response.
The British Amhassador had not time to offer further expostula-
tion before the French Minister for Foreign Affairs presented himself.
"Your Excellency," said the Gallio Official, "1 have brought the
Treaty with me, which now awaits your signature."
"Are you quite sure it is all right?" drawled out Lord Lytton,
evidently bent upon prolonging the preliminaries of the interview.
"Quite sure, my Lord; if you will take a pen the matter can be
settled at once," and the Frenohman began an anxious search for
ink and paper.
"Are you sure you are authorised by your Government to do all
this?" asked the British Ambassador, carelessly.
"A thousand times yes," was the Frenchman's reply. Then he
continued, "See, 1 have laid out the document on that table, and
all you have to do is to seat yourself on this chair, and sign it."
"Seat myself on that chair 1 Never!" cried Lord Litton, with a
Bhudder. Never!"
"Then I suppose I must1 give you a lead ;" and the Frenchman
smilingly sat down on the anoient ohair. The Ambassador and the
Private Seoretary stood gazing at him transfixed with terror.
Suddenly there was a shriek and a heavy fall. The chair had given
way under the very considerable weight of the Frenchman, who was
now lying in an undignified position on the fL.or. The two English-
men immediately assisted him to rise.
"We really must apologise," began Lord Lttton.
'' Never mind apologieB," replied the Gaul; "let us sign the Treaty."
"Too late 1" said the English Ambassador, with his ear to a
telephone. "I regret to inform you that your Government has
fallen, and that you consequently are no longer in charge of the
bureau of Foreign Affairs."
"Baffled!" hissed out the Frenchman, as he took his departure.
"Just in time," said Lord Lyiton ; "just in time."
"That chair giving way under him was most fortunate," observed
the Private Secretary.
"Yes," returned Lord Lttton, solemnly, " the honour of England,
nay, the peaoe of the World, have been protected by our defective
furniture! Let us complain of it no longer."
And they did not.
UPON AMARYLLIS
Causing him some displeasure.

Her temper to deter, [child,
A bogey man, unkempt and wild,
Would run away with her;
That richest quarry soonest falls

Till wide through fashion's gilded

And now she tries the infant plan,

May carry her away.
"CELEBRITIES" NOT "AT HOME."
We have just seen the first number of Men and Women of the
Day, containing admirable photographs of Miss Maey Anderson,
Lord Haetington (Ex-Cabinet size), and Cardinal Newman, quite
the best we have seen of these Celebrities. If the series is equal to
this first sample, it will be historically interesting, and most valuable
as specimens of the Messrs. Babratjd's photographio art. They do
not say whether their intention is to give us one lady and two
gentlemen every month, or to vary this proceeding oooasionally, but
the arrangement in this first nnmber, with " Our Mary " between
the Cardinal in a brown study, and Lord Haetington, "himself to
the life," that is in rather an awkward position and looking some-
what puzzled, and neither of them paying the slightest attention to
charming Perdita, is decidedly humorous.
Cheerful!
Wasn't this a nice advertisement for the Christmas holidays? It
was in the Morning Post (not the Evening Post—don't let there be
any mistake about this, Sir Algernon) for December 30:—
GOVERNESS (English) for Three Children, eldest 15; must be a thorough
disciplinarian and well able to administer corporal punishment; good
salary; age about 24; write full particulars as to mode of inflicting punish-
ment, also salary required; personal interview in London necessary.
Isn't that pleasant. Dr. Birch? Such advertisements ought to
have a paper all to themselves,—say, for example, The Whipping
Post.

The gallant and genial Gbimthobpk—himself a rare dab with his

The lads that he got in the ring were a couple of regular crackers.
The " Fharmaooposian Pet"— teniores primes—a veteran,
Has got lots of fight in him yet, for a big 'un you '11 scarce find a
better 'un,
True he of late runs to flesh, is a trifle too beefy and lumpy.
And lovers of " science" may deem that his style's rather flashy and
jumpy;
But he still has " a damaging right," so his backers at least are
persuaded.
And quick "knocking out," his pet tactics, by weight and his
inches are aided.
Tn fact he's a sort of a Sullivan, gassy and rather vain-glorious,
Full of disdain for his foeman, and cocksure of being victorious.
Grimtiiofe's " Game Globule," au eontraire, is rather a light-weight
at present,
But quick on his pins as a cat, with a "left" far too hot to be
pleasant,
As promptly the P. P. discovered; the P. P. of course forced the
fighting;
He hasn't got muoh of a guard, so he goes in for rushing and smiting.

A Lubbocky tort of Fable.
"The familiar world which surrounds ua may bo a totally different place to other
animals; to them it may be full of music which we oannot hear, of colour which we
cannot see, of sensations whioh wo cannot conceive."—Sir JohN Lubbock on The Senate
of Animal).
The Fox and the Ass travelled along the blue roads running through pink
grass and shaded by white barked trees covered with rainbow-hued leaves that
towered miles high into the yellow-and-green-spots-plus-striped-raspberry-jam
coloured sky.
"Ass," said the Fox, in a voice of thunder, that sounded like forty million
bees singing an oratorio to the accompaniment of a double-barrelled^ steam-
worked ohuroh organ, "what are those Men?"
"Fox," returned the Ass, in tones that made an Elephant, who was having
a ehat with a Black-beetle, scamper away in terror, "I fanoy they must
be persons who gain a precarious livelihood by attempting to please the rioh."
The persons to whom allusion had thus been made were four in number.
One had an orange face, the second a blue one, the third a green one, and the
last, one of a colour it is impossible to describe, but which reminded the spectator
of earthquakes, thunderbolts, and brass nails mixed together into a sort of
mineral pea-soup with cough mixture and marmalade. They were seemingly
expanding and compressing their cheeks, with a view to filling some curious
looking instruments, miles long, with air.
"Ass," said the Fox, "these Men are what our Masters—ha! ha I ha! our
Matters!—call a German Band."
"Fox," replied the Ass, "and those fools, our Masters—Masters 1 hoi hal
hum!—think they are only making a noise. We, on the other hand, are able
to distinguish in this noise musio that Men can never appreciate!"
Laughing in tones that reverberated for millions of miles, the two animals
passed away frem the country and entered the town. It was now. quite dark
to Mankind, but to the Fox and the Ass the light of the
green moon shone as brightly as the sepia-brown sun.
They entered a Picture Gallery and stood in front of a
painting by Mr. "Whistler.
"What is it called P " asked the Fox.
\ " A nocturne in yellow and black," replied the Ass.
"Oh, what magnificent hues!" cried the Fox, in an
ecstasy of admiration; "look at that splash of pink
liquorice, that daub of shot puce-vermilion tripe, that
splutter of tawny-green-gamboge apple-tart!"
"Yes," returned the Ass, also in ecstasy,"and our
Masters—ha! ha! ha!—our Matter» ! can see in this
revelation no colour at all 1"
The friendly couple then left the Art Gallery and
entered a deserted reading-room. Instinctively (by a
sense not possessed by mankind) they became acquainted
with the contents of a thousand modern novels. Then
they took up the magazines and acquired them. Neither
of them went to sleep for a moment. Then they attacked
the newspapers, wading through pages and pages of cor-
respondence upon all sorts of the most uninteresting sub-
jects. Finally they possessed themselves of the com-
ments on the political questions of the day. They learned
how Twiddledum was a villain and Twiddledeb was a
knave, and that both were fools.
"Ass." said the Fox, "are you satisfied with any-
thin*?"
"Not with many things," replied the Ass. "I agree
with Mankind."
"But, Ass, are you satisfied with anything P " persisted
the Fox.
"Well, Fox, on the whole, I think I am satisfied with
myself."
And that is a sensation that Mankind—our Matters J
ha—ha—ha!—our Matters.' oannot oonoeive I"
But, in spite of what the Fox had said, the Ass had
a fellow-feeling for Mankind!

Managers of this Theatre are the leading French Actors,
who are also teachers of the histrionic art. With such
a "Dramatic College" the English Stage might be given

there were tears in his voice,—which can be produced by this great

he thanked me and began another speech.
"Stay," I said, politely interrupting him at the commencement.
"Let me tell you, before I go, where you may seek your goods and

Small Advocate. I am one of Mr. Jones's junior clerks, m'Lud.
First Judge. And what are your duties P
Small Advocate. Well, m'Lud, usually to assist in the sweeping
out of the office, the writing of the addresses on the envelopes and
such like. When I'm not doing that, I have the pleasure of address-
ing your Ludships.

your Ludship was kind enough to interrupt me—as I was saying, the
other day I was reading a law book in master's chambers"
Second Judge. Can you give the name of your authority P
Small Advocate. Well,'m' Lud, to tell you the truth, I quite forget.
I fancy it was Richards or Roberts, or somebody who had a Chris-
tian name for a surname. The book was all about "Substantial
Estates" I think. Yes, I fancy it must have been—Roberts on Sub-
stantial Estates. Something like that, you know. m'Luds.
First Judge. Could it have been Williams on Real Property t
Small Advocate. Why, I do believe, m'Lud, you have hit the nail
on the right head I Well, m'Luds, I read in this here book that
waste was quite different in Law than in faot. So I believe my
client was only exeroising his just right when he cut down the wood
in rear of the premises. He never wasted it, m'Luds, but sold it at
a good price. [Argues for an hour or so.

First Judge. As there appears to be nothing further on the paper,
we must adjourn, but I cannot help pointing out that the mixing of

question is this— Were they, in their youth, taken regularly to see
Pantomimet t If so, their estimate of the Police Force generally,
as exemplified by their and their followers' treatment of "Bobbies,
is distinctly traceable to these early lessons given them by Messrs.
Clown and Pantaloon. There is no such effective teaching as that
by example, and the example set, even in the most brief modern
harlequinade, by everybody's outrageous conduct towards the Police-
man, is simply sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind.
As in any rightly constructed melodrama poetic justice is always
satisfied, and the detective, however he may have failed during four
Acts, invariably succeeds in arresting the scoundrel in the fifth, so
a Pantomime ought to finish with the triumph of Right and Might,
in the person of the Policeman, over low cunning and outrageous
resistance to all authority, as embodied by the Pantaloon and Clown.
The influence for good that pantomimic teaohing might thus convey
is incalculable. Prevention is better than cure.: formation of 'cha-
racter is better than reformation. Let us begin' at the beginning—
with Pantomime.
LEGISLATION FOR THE SESSION.
Local Government mustn't stop the way. Let .there be one Bill
brought in for putting a stop to all such processions—including bodies
of Salvationists tramping about on Sundays with tambourine girls,
and band of music ("Music! ye Gods!")—as have not received
police permission for one occasion only.
Another Bill is wanted for dealing summarily with organ-grinders,
street-singers, and all other similar disturbers of the peace, so that
if a householder or some one acting as his agent, gives any of these
nuisances into custody, a paper signed by him and the constable,
shall be sufficient to warrant a conviction. Two sovereigns fine for
first offence, imprisonment with hard labour for second, and for the
third, perpetual banishment from England with the last penalty of
the Law in case of their returning with the same deadly purpose in
view; i.e., the destruction of the peace and quiet of Her Majesty's
subjects.
Also wanted, a Bill to fix certain spots outside a four-mile radius
from Charing Cross, where any open-air public meeting may be held,
of whioh the Commissioners of Police must reoeive at least a clear
forty-eight hours' notioe.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
MR. PUNCH'S EXAMINATION PAPERS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.

conviction has been borne in
upon Mr. Punch of late that—
whether from the engrossing
nature of modern girls' and
boys' occupations, or their pre-
ference for contemporary and
realistic fiction—the study of
Fairy Tale and nursery lore,
is fast falling into neglect—if
not (as is only too much to be
feared) into positive contempt I
The disadvantages to a child
in after-life of having been
allowed to grow up in complete,
or even partial ignorance of so
essential a branch of a liberal
education are too obvious to be
enumerated, and Mr. Punch is
anxious to do all in his power
to avert what he cannot but
consider a national calamity.
In these days there is but one means of stimulating or reviving a flagging
department of knowledge—we make it the subject of compulsory or competitive
examination, and so Mr. Punch, reluctant as he is to incur the resentment of
his young friends by proposing any addition to their doubtless numerous tasks,
feels it a duty, nevertheless, to suggest to parents that no child should be allowed
on any pretext in future to leave the Nursery for School, until it has passed
creditably some such examination as is indicated below. It would not be
necessary, of oourse, to require candidates to take up the whole of the works in
question, which would perhaps impose too arduous study upon the younger
generation. The best plan is to seleot such portions from each as will give the
young students a fair general idea of^the style and subject-matter of our
greatest nursery class-ics.
Mr. Punch hopes that no parent will think it necessary to send his children
to a "Nursery-Crammer " to be prepared for this examination, and that the use
of an abstract, or "memoria-technica" will be discouraged as far as possible.
It should be added that the candidate is expected to do these papers without any
book* whatever at his elbow, and that appeals to elder persons for their assistance
should be met with stern and unflinching refusal.
The following questions, thongh searching, will not, Mr. Punch considers,
prove too severe for students of any industry and intelligent.
(A) Set Subjects:—
"Jack the Giant-Killer" [first two chapters).
"Puss in Boots " (selected portions).
"Aladdin" [from commencement—to the Vanishing of the Magic Palace).
"Bluebeard" (the whole).
"Sindbad the Sailor " {Second Voyage only).
"Ali Baba " and "The Babes in tne Wood " {selected portions).
1. Mention and criticise the conduct of Morgiana after discovering the Forty
Thieves in the Oil-jars.
2. Should you be inclined to call Puss in Boots a strictly truthful animal?
3. What were the circumstances that led Cassim Saba to the conclusion that
Ali had suddenly become rich P What use did he make of his discovery';
4. Describe, as fully as you are able:—
(a) Bluebeard's Chamber.
(6) The halls and terrace where the Wonderful Lamp was found.
(c) The chief physical and geographical features of the country at the
top of the Beanstalk.
5. At about what time of the year did the Babes in the Wood perish? How
do you fix this from internal evidenoe P Is it stated that they had eaten any-
thing previously whioh was at all likely to disagree with them Y
6. Sketch concisely the main incidents in the life of
Aladdin, from the time he found the Magio Lamp to the
disappearance of the Palace.
7. State all you know of Cogia Baba, Haroun Aireu-
chid, Alice, the Mother of Jack and the Beanstalk, the
Marquis of Carabas, Sister Anne, Beauty's Father, Red
Riding Hood's Grandmother.
(B) Critical and General.
1. What is your opinion of the intelligence of [Giants
as a race P Of what substance were they in the habit of
making their bread P Would you draw any and what
distinction between (a) Giants and Giantesses, [b) Ogres
and Ogresses, (c) a Mamma Ogress and her daughters?
2. What is a Roc P What do Roos feed on? If yon
were on the edge of steep cliffs surrounding; an inacces-
sible valley, strewn with diamonds and visited by Roos,
—how would you proceed in order to obtain some of
those diamonds? Give the reply of the Slave of the
Lamp to Aladdin's request that a roc's egg should be
hung up in his dome.
3. Mention instances when (a) a Wolf, (b) a Bear,
(c) a Cat, (d) a Harp, are recordtd to have spoken, and
give the substance of their remarks, when possible, in
each case.
4. Write down the name of any hero you can remember
who suffered inconvenience from (a) the imprudence
[b) the disobedience, of his wife.
5. How would you aot if you were invited to go to a
party on the opposite side of the way, and had nothing
to go in but a pair of Seven-Leagued Boots P Compare
the drawbacks and advantages of going to a State Ball
in glass slippers.
6. State which family you would rather belong to:
One in which there was h.) a Wioked Uncle, (ii.) an
Envious Sister, (iii.) a Jealous Brother, or (iv.) a Cruel
Stepmother? Give your reasons, and illustrate them by
examples. How many Wioked Uncles do you remember
to have read of P Are Wicked Uncles ever sorry, and, if
so, when?
7. Give any instances that occur to you where it is
stated that the chief personages of the story " all lived
happily ever afterwards." Are there any exceptions to
this rule P
(C) Pantomime Paper. (Optional, and for those Students
only who may decide to "take up" this branch of
the subject.)
1. Did the manners, language, and general deport-
ment of the various Kings and Queens you have seen in
Pantomimes correspond at all with what you had expected
them to be from the books P
2. Mention any fairy tale in which (1) long- ballets,
(2) allusions to subjects in last year's papers, {■>) jokes
about ''drinks'' and "pawn-tickets," (4) comic duets
which you didn't quite understand, and (5) men dressed
np in women's clothes, occur. Mention (if you can) any
Pantomime in whioh they do not.
3. Were you surprised to hear at Drury Lane that the j
King who befriended the Marquis of Carabas was origin-
ally a Potman? Do you remember this in the original
texti'
4. Why do you suppose that the Wioked Brothers in
this year's Pantomime were frightened by green snakes,
pink lizards, and enormous frogs? Did their own ex-
planation that thev had "the jumps" convey much to
your mind P Did this scene make you laugh P
5. Give as clear and intelligible an account as you are
able of the story of any one Pantomime you have been
to, mentioning where—if at all—it departed from the
version you have studied, and whether or not yon
sidered suoh departures (if any) to be improvement
6. Investigate the principal peculiarities of Pant
Animals. How do they chiefly differ from other animals
Describe the effect of kindness upon a Pantomime
Donkey, and account for it.
N.B.—Not more than four questions need be attempted
in each of the above Papers. Candidates are advised not
to leave any question unattempted from a mere inability
to answsr every part of such question.
At the Vaudeville.—Heart of Hearts offered but
little attraction to the public, so Mr. Thorite is trying

Buchanan. What will be the Manager's next step?

A WANT AND NO SUPPLY.
Mb. Pusch, Sir,—Why should not the old days of Evans's Supper
Booms be revived? Yes, we know Clubs have increased and multiplied
since the days when Paddy Green flourished. Clubs were called and
Clubs have turned up. But Evans's is another matter altogether.
The Theatres are certainly not over earlier than they used to be, and
after the excitement of a drama and the atmosphere of gas, nature
is exhausted, and requires what it cannot obtain anywhere really
comfortably, though there is a notable exception to this at Rule's, in
Maiden Lane; that is, if Rule's can be an exception. Even here if
there be a crush and a rush, the hungriest and thirstiest are not
served first, and if you only arrive at 11°30, on a crowded night, you
find you have become a waiter instead of a customer, and just when
you are beginning to enjoy the long expected whatever-it-is, the
warning stroke of 12'30 tells you "Time's up!" and within a
quarter of an hour " out you go," with a digestion in about as in-
different a state as was Hamlet's Father's conscience when its owner
was hurried out of this wicked world.
We mention this exception, if exception it be, as the only one with
which we are personally acquainted. But Evans's was something
more than a mere supper-room, it was the place par excellence for
glee-singing (at an hour when it comes in pleasantly enough, which it
doesn't at dinner-time) part-songs and ballads. It was the place par
excellence for a chop and potatoes in their jackets, (we were in jackets
ourselves when we first tasted these luxuries) a small steak, devilled
bouts, grilled chicken and a cool tankard of stout. Only the male
sex were admitted, and in spite of there being no charge for entrance
(we are speaking of "long, long ago,") the company was orderly and
comparatively select. Why shouldn't some enterprising caterer
take such a place in hand f And before securing suitable premises
not too large—Evans's oame to grief when it was enlarged and ad-
mitted the feminine element,—in the'olassio neighbourhood of Covent
Garden, let him apply to the Police Authorities to grant the estab-
lishment tentatively for three years, say a licence with extension of
time up to 2 a.m., on condition that only glees, part-songs, and
ballads are performed, that the glees for which boys voices are re-
quired, shall cease at 11*30, and that to no part of the building (the
innovation commenced with private boxes at Evans's, consule Paddy)
shall any of the female sex be admitted. The seclusion must be as
strict as that of a Monastery. 'Twill he like a little Evans's below,
a Paradise without an Eve of dissolution in it.
We present this notion in the rough to London and the Provinces
generally. Country Cousins always formed a strong contingent at
Evans's, and its revival concerns the visitors to London equally with
Londoners. There is much to he urged in its favour: and not much
against it. You, Mr. Punch, remembering the jovial round, table in
the corner, the cheery, sociable, and harmonious evenings, and see-
ing that a considerable and influential class are dissatisfied with
Music Halls, will, we are sure, give us your vote and interest, if we
can proceed any further in this matter. Let our cry be, "Arouse

ROBERT AT THE CHILDREN'S FANCY BALL.
I wundebs if ennybody as has never seen it, ewer got within say a
hundred miles or so of ewer imadgining the site of about a thowsand
bootif ul children, more or less, all bootif ully drest in lovely outlandish
oostooms, all looking the werry pioter of appyness, and all dancing
to bootif ul muaio, or marohing round in state, or a setting in a great
oirole on the floor of the great City Palace of Delite, a gazing and a
larfing, with that little merry larf that belongs so naterally to little
ohildren when they 're all drest in their new clothes, at their old
favrite Punch and Judy, and ewen enourridging Mr. Punch in his
owdaoious behawiour. In my fortnit persition of coarse I've seed
about everything as is to be seen of a grand or scrumptious charack-
ter, but I never has no doubt as the Children's Faucy Dress Ball at
the Manshun House beats the lot in a oanter and the rest nowheres.
Weather it was the cold fog or not of course I don't know, but the
little darlingB soon came a dropping into the refreshment room and a
drinking most copiously of lemonade and oonsumin the sponge cakes
with great wigour. One yung feller, all drest in nioe warm white
flannel, and with about as pretty a little face as I ever seed, and who
I was told had oum all the way from Canterberry. aoshally arsked
me for a glass of Shampane, but werry properly added, "put some
water in it, please, as I don't want to get fate 1" Bless his careful
little art, muoh he knowed about that misterry. With the wally able
assistance the little dears reseeved from their Pars and Mars they
kept us all werry well employed 'till supper-time, when of course I
assended to the upper regions to attend to my more serious dootys.
I got a peep from the Gallery of the grand march round of the
children, whioh was the gem of the evening, as ushaL I shood
have liked to have had it all over agin, but of course I didn't dare
shout tout ancore, or they might have all looked up at me, and
how shood I have felt under such trying suckemstances!
There was a smart young chap strutting about, werry andsumly
drest as King Chaki.es the 2nd, as he tola me hisself, and a gent,
who must have bin jist a little behind hand in his Natral History,
arsked him how he could be a working about after his head was cut
off P But he was quite ekal to the occasion, and said, "That wasn't
me; that was my Father; and there he stands," pinting to a ancient
Common Counsilman who was filling up his lezzure time by drinking
sum champane cup.
The Gentlemen of the Press mustard uncommon strong, and
ezprest their opinonB as to the supper and the wines with great
freedom and wollobility, and I was pleased to hear from sitch
xperienced Critios that it was all fust rate, speshally the Bore's Hed
and the Mum. A natral fear keeps my umbel pen quiet, or I shoud
much like to menshun the names of jest a few. But there was jest
a rather wildish look about one of them as showed how thoroughly
he injoyed the seen, while another seemed to feel that he had to bear
the whole world on his broad shoulders. But they are a ginial set,
and always werry civil to a poor Waiter.
Praps the most poplar and suttenly the most owdacious part of the
hole proceedings, was the sham Lord Mare's percession. It was that
bootilul got up, and gone through with that degree of sollemnity,
that was most oredditable to all the yung Hacters and their Pars
and Mars, whose sons and dorters I'm told as they all was, tho'
them's misterrys as is not rewesled to Waiters, no, not even to Hed
uns. But what spiled the hole effect to me was the sollem thort that
we was aoshally looking at, and all a olappin our hands at, a burlesk
of that amost sacred hinstitushun, a Lord Mare's Perssession! How
the ribbold jester wood have rejoyoed, supposing such a irreverent
fust class misoreant had intruded hisself into that Agipshun All of
splendor! I trembled as I red the accounts in the nex day's papers.
But no; they past it by without no snear.
As I've bin a studying the French Tung lately, I thort as I'd try
my skill upon a yung French Gent, with his waste jest under his
arm-pits; so, after he had drunk a glass of Shampane Cup, I says to
him quite boldly, "Ancore du Shampane Cup, yung Mossoo?" At
whioh he larfed and said, "We, Gassong I" quite nateraL
I was a good deal surprized at one of the jewvenile royal
idges, a King, or a Erl, or summat of that sort, a asking me for sum
of that sossidge meat, and a pinting to a Bore's Hed! But in coarse
even jewvenile Kings or Erls oarnt know everythink. I remembers
the late Sword Bearer telling me, with a shudder, that wunoe upon
a time, when he was atending in state upon a Lord Mare who was a
going to call on the Prince of Whales at Marlboro Ouse, as they
were all a waiting for his Royal Iness in the All, little Prinse Gbobob
came into the Gallery, and when he saw the Sword Bearer in his
grand Fur Cap of State, pinted at him, and said, quite lowd, "Oh,
wot a funny Old Man!" The Sword Bearer, like the trew gennel-
man he was, tho muoh hurt in his f eelinx, as he told me he was,
took no notioe of the hinsult, but forguv him at wunoe. Praps
you've eard this afore P Well, it bears retelling.
I didn't notice quite so muoh diffrence as I should natrally have
xpected between the style of dancing of the royal and noble pus-
sonages, and them of humble degree, such as shepperdesses and
pezzants, but they suttenly all injoyed theirselves up to the werry
larat, and when the fatal hour of midnight struck 12, they seemed
no more tired than did the geenial Lord Mabe and his hansum Lady,
who had receeved ewerybody, and noticed ewerybody, and made
ewerybody feel theirselves quite at tome, tho they was at the
sillebratea City Pellis. Eoberx.
TEDIUM MEDICUM;
Or, What, if it doesn't Stop, it will come to in the "Times" of 1889.
Sib,—I have read attentively now every day for one year and
three months the six columns of controversy at first vindiotive, then
libellous, then scurrilous, and in these last times beyond all bounds
frantic, between the two rival schools of treatment that you have
persistently kept publishing for the benefit of your numerous
readers. The result of the perusal of this correspondence upon me
has been this. I have registered a solemn vow that under no com-
plication of diseases to whioh I might suddenly fall a viotim would I
ever again " call in" a medical adviser of any profession or sohool
whatever. No, Sir, I have determined to leave Dame Nature to do
her best or worst with me aocording as it may please her own sweet
will. Anything I feel would be better than to hand one's body over
to be juggled with by this screaming crew, who in ononis denouncing
eaoh other as quacks, liars, thieves, mountebanks, and out-throats,
have fairly and finally; soared out of their arena and, I trust, for
ever beyond their reach, . Your obedient but refleotive servant,
A Staogeked Lat man.
Sib,—One word more in answer to that just-created peer, Gbxjc-
thobfe. I did not, as he malevolently and with malice aforethought
argues, state that if you threw a bottle of stout into a gasometer full
of ginger-beer you would not" detect it." What I did say was that
I would defy anybody with his eyes blind-folded to taste it. This is
the 177th time I have had to correct this scandalous, outrageous,
and scurrilous perversion of truth in the course of the present
troversy. Need I say I am sick of it.
I am your obedient servant, J. C. B,
Sib,—One word to supplement my yesterday's letter, in which I
flatter myself I once more gave it hot ,to " J. C. B." and to all the
other bigoted, orthodox vampires who are yelping the same tune
with him. If I did not fairly flay them and put them and their
perjured nonsense into piokle after, all I can say is I don't know
what more they can want. Stay, though—I must not forget what I
had to say. It is this. If any one of the A. champions still wants
to have it out with me, let him come down here to me in Yorkshire
(where my family have been settled for more than fifty years),
and I shall be happy and eager to give him as good an argument or
two as he oould wish—with a horsewhip.

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY M.P.

Sandy, Bedt. Saturday.

[ sab Toby,
Obdxb, Order I I suppose as
we are now on the eve of the Ses-
sion, and yon will have other affairs
to occupy your time and attention,
the Letter - Bar will shortly he
olosed. Bat before yon pall the
string, allow me to drop in a brief
note. The Speaker of the House
of Commons is, after all, human—
or, as H-bc-bt might say if he
filled the Chair, in some respects
haman. In deferenoe to this weak-
ness, I feel a peculiar pleasure in
addressing you among all the 670
Members of the House. If they
were all like you, dear Toby, what

have I onoe had occasion to suspend
(Excuse me; bat 1 suppose, if in the troublous times ahead of us such a
misfortune came to pass, I should have to seize you by the tail P) Never onoe
have you moved the adjournment of the House, delivered a prosy speech, ques-
tioned the decision of the Chair, or behaved otherwise than as a model Member
of Parliament. I wish there were more like you.
But there are not, and we must take things as we find them. They have
been pretty lively sinoe I first sat in the Chair, and from all portents they are
likely to be still more so in the Session that opens next week. I observe that
Mr. P-rk-ll has been advising his Young Men to avoid obstruction and adopt
mannerly ways. That is all very well for Mr. P-en-ll, who has pleasantly
passed the recess far from political strife. But I can well understand some of
bis compatriots asking whether, heoause Mr. P-rn-ll has not been in prison,
there shall be no more cakes and aleP "W-ll-m O'Bb-n fresh from his plank
bed, T. D. S-ll-t-n just freed from gentler restrictions, and Mr. P-nb tired of
hanging like M-h-m-t's coffin between heaven and earth, are likely to take
another view of the situation. In and out of the Chair these fifteen years, I
know very well what it is for a Leader of a Party to discountenance obstruction,
and what effect it has upon the course of business. Sir St-ff-rd N-bthc-te.
when he led the Conservative Party, was honestly opposed to obstruction. But
that did not prevent Grandolph and his merry men stopping all progress.
Bl-dst-kf. is equally shocked at the adoption of any means of obstruction less
subtle than the occupation of two hours in saying what might well have been
uttered in twenty minutes. But, apart from the Irish Members, the Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate and some other Members who sit in that part of the House,
are certainly not to be accused of docility in following their titular leader.
B-lf-r is the only man who has a practical soheme on hand for oombating
obstruction. Of course if one by one the most truculent of the Irish Members
are cast into prison, the available forces of obstruction in the House of Commons
mast be diminished. Sir B-ylf. K-che had not this particular illustration in
bis mind when he made his famous declaration. Bat the application holds
equally good. B-lf-b has done his best, the only sign of maladroitness about
his proceeding being in the somewhat indiscreet haste with which it was
inaugurated. If Irish Members are sent to spend their Christmas Day in prison,
under sentences of two months' confinement, it is clear that their appearance in
the House of Commons cannot be postponed long after the commencement of the
Session. It is not for me even to hint at counsel in bo delicate a matter. I am
not responsible for the Chief Secretary's action, and am called upon neith> r to
prove it nor to disapprove it. But, viewed in connection with the question of
obstruction, there is evidently a ohronologioal error at
the basis of Mr. B-lf-r's proceedings. But he is young
and ardent, and experience may bring its lessons.
I daresay you will be glad to hear that I approaoh the
new Session in renewed health and I need hardly add,
with indomitable spirit. I am glad to be able to add
that Sm-th. who looked in the other day, is sIbo ready
for his work. He has just returned from Pau, whioh
he was a little surprised to find is, after all, not a river.
Otherwise his mind preserves its customary serenity. He
tells me that on some rare occasions, when there was
smooth water in the Mediterranean, he practised a new
pounce, which he believes will prove effective in pre-
serving the discipline of the House and supporting the
dignity of the Chair. He wanted to take his coat off and
show me how it was done, but I deoided to defer the
pleasure. I would rather share in the surprise which
awaits the House.
On the whole I am glad that Sh-th's removal to
another plaoe has been deferred. Of course if he had
gone B-lf-b would have come along, and that in some
particulars is not a pleasant prospeot. It is a very small
matter, and to you who sit on the other side of the
House with the view partially obscured by the Table,
it will be hardly comprehensible, but the fact is I could
not face without disturbance the prospeot of having
B-lf-b's legs in close proximity throughout a long sitting.
It is bad enough when it is part of his game of aggra-
vation to absent himself from the House as much as
possible, more particularly at the hour when Irish Mem-
bers want to put questions. If he were Leader of the
House he must perforce be 'in his place for something
like six parts of a ten-hours' sitting, and I am afraid I
could not stand it. It is impossible to convey to you a
full sense of the mental torture suffered alter many
hours' strained attention to debate by the recurrent in-
trusion of apprehension of what B-lf-r will next do
with his legs. Whether he will ever succeed in his life-
long attempt to kick Gl-bst-nb under the table, is a
familiar question I shrink from recalling in these days
of recess. Even now I tremble when I think of the
possible apparition in the course of debate of the feet of
the Leader of the House on the Table. It is not fair
that the already overburdened President of an assembly
like the House of Commons should be freighted with
petty cares of this kind, and I hope that Sm-th will stop
where he is.
I envy brother H-mpd-n the great advantage of having
had D-zzy so long the Leader of the House whilst he sat
in the Chair. Long before I had any notion that the
mattt r would have a personal interest for me, I have
from the Front Opposition Benoh watched D-zzy in his
place—the folded arms, the crossed legs, with the coat
tails brought forward placidly oovering the knees, the
downcast head, the half - closed eyes. Tkrre was a soothing
assistant to the Npeakkr in the discharge of his irritating
duties. The effigy of a Crusader supine on a tombstone
does not come more nearly to the beau {dial of a Leader
of the House as seen from the Speaker's Chair, than did
D-sr-lt. Gr-sd-lph when he was Leader, in his
comical way recalled this picture which he. too. had often
seen. He occasionally did it all, even to the orderly
arrangement of the coat-tails, wrestling with himself,
often ineffectually, to prevent his hands going up to
curl his moustache. As for Gl-bst-nb he was most
embarrassing. One had always to be on the look out for
his sudden incursion. Sm-th was an improvement in
despite of his tendency to pounce. But B-lf-b would
be worse than an appreciable addition to the Irish
representation.
I mention these things, as probably in reviewing the
difficulties of the position of a Speaker, they never
occurred to you. W hen you oome to sit in the Chair—
a position that may perhaps hereafter be forced upon yon
—you will understand all.
The Clerk will now proceed to read the Orders of the
Day, so no more at present from
Yours faithfully, Abth-k P-l.

FEELINGS AND FOOTLIGHTS.
Mb. A v. c h kk has, in the current number of Longman'», despatched
a second batch of arrows at the actor's art, and has certainly soored.
His article has covered a great deal of ground. That Mr. Wilson
Babbitt playing Hamlet shivering with the thermometer 14° below
zero should have assumed a comfortable temperature from strong
emotion as soon as he got on to the stage, and that Mr. Clayton after
representing Hugh Trevor has been so exhausted that he has lain
down on the floor of his dressing-room, and " feeling as though he had
been thrashed all oyer," said to his dresser, "don't come near me for
an hour," are certainly strange entertaining and even appalling
facts. So indeed are some of the numerous anecdotes about tears and
laughter, terror and blushes and other stage experiences, that he has
managed to collect by his catechetical method. Still there is more to
come, and he has promised a third and concluding article. This should
deal among other matters with the "emotions of Pantomime," a
singularly interesting subject at this season of the year, and though
we will not youoh for the perfect accuracy of every word, the sub-
joined brief extract may be taken as a fair [sample of the way is
which the whole matter will be handled.
Strictly observing my usual method of catechising, I have,
as a preliminary step, addressed to several noted Clowns and Pan-
taloons the following questions:—
In scenes of commotion in real life, whether you are a parti-
cipant in them (e.g., in a regular Police row yourself), or a casual
on-lot ker (e.g., in a street riot, in whioh legs of mutton, loaves of
bread, strings of sausages, bundles of turnips, babies, and Police-

men's helmets are flying on all sides in the air), do yon consciously
note effeots for subsequent use upon the stage? Have you ever tried
the effects of a red-hot poker on personal friends in your own
drawing-room, and so automatically registering on your memory a
phase of real life experience, been enabled to turn it to subsequent
professional acoount?
The answers to the above questions are very various. Some
Clowns deny that they have had experience of the red-hot poker in
their own houses, but in making butter-slides, filling their pockets
with perambulators, stray bonnets, and turkeys, they have, "as
casual lookers-on," like Miss Isabel Batsman, "noted effects of
real commotion, and stored them up for possible use."
A distinguished Clown at one of the London theatres who, with
Mr. Li on nr. Bbocgh, holds that "All scenes in real life are im-
Eressed on the mind of the real actor, and that, if occasion requires,
e will try to reproduce them," writes to say that he has so
thoroughly realised the necessity of this that he has often got up a
pelt in the New Cat, tripped up old gentlemen coming down the steps
of West-End Clubs, put the page-boy in his own kitchen oven, and
tried to jump through the front of a hairdresser's shop. He has thus
Gained his "emotions" directly from real life, and when hetrans-
ites them into action on the stare at night he does it with a force
and realism that fairly electrifies his audience. He never, for
instance, spares Pantaloon, but when he has either to trip him up,
collar him with a ladder, or knock him down, he does it so thoroughly
and effectively that in the present Pantomime in which he is now
playing, though it is only in its fifth week since Christmas, the
part of the Pantaloon has had to be refilled in turn by no less than
■even fresh representatives, five of whom are laid up injured in a
local hospital, while the other two have obtained summonses against
him for assault. The writer adds that only the other night he made
a great point in the representation of a street fight by hurling a
bundle of real turnips right into the face of the leader of the
orchestra, and with such good effect as to knock him backward off
his stool. The house was extraordinarily excited by the incident,
and showed by a prolonged burst of applause how it appreciated that
the actor was really feeling in his own person something similar in
kind, and almost equal in degree, to the vivid pugilistic passion he
was representing.
In a similar strain also writes a celebrated Pantaloon. Having
onoe travelled on the Metropolitan Line in a second-class carriage
with a third-class ticket, and having been detected and consequently
shouted at by a little vulgar newspaper boy, he affirms that when-
ever, in the course of a scene, the Clown falsely accuses him of
having committed some delinquency in the well-known stock phrase,
"I saw yer do it," he is so absolutely awestruck, and his doddering
gait becomes so tragic, that he fairly brings down the house.
It may be interesting to note, in conclusion, that a well-known
Harlequin, on being questioned to account in some degree for the
utterly unintelligible eccentricity of his movements, and the generally
pointless though sportive frivolity of his character as delineated in
action, admits that, like Mr. George Conquest, "he has on many
occasions gone to Lunatic Asylums and collected effects for use on
the stage." The article will also casually touch upon the effect on an
actor of playing to an empty house, or with uncongenial surroundings,
the catechetical inquiry taking some suoh shape as the following:—
A distinguished Actor informs me that on playing Othello in the
provinces, where his terms with the management were "shares"
after £15, on going on the stage and finding only eighteenpence in
the pit and five orders in the dress circle, he has felt a lump in
his throat that has nearly prevented his articulation. He also added
the Roderigo on the occasion in question was drunk, and so fre-
quently alluded to " Two Lovely Black Eyes" in the course of his
part, that he was ultimately called on for a horn-pipe, which he
gave, being eventually removed from the stage by the Doge, the
Gasman, and the Prompter. Do you consider that suoh conditions
would be calculated to stifle a tendency to a morbidly emotional
rendering of the character, and would you conceive yourself justified
in washing your hands of the performance, and after having it out
with the Manager, leaving the house then and there without waiting
to smother Desdemona t

Client. Dear me! I thought that now the two branches of the
profession are merged into one, all Of them would be able to help me.
[Leaves Mr. Brown's Boom, and wanders about the passages
until stopped by a door. He opens it, and enters a second
room.
Gentleman at Work at a Table. Well, Sir, what is itP
Client. Oh, if you please, I want to talk over a matter of business.
The faot is, I am a Trustee, and I am not quite sure
Gentleman at Work at a Table (cutting him short). Oh, I know
nothing about that sort of thing. My department is to prepare Bill!
of Costs.
Client. Well, Sir, can I see one of the Firm?
Gentleman at Work at a Table. I am one of the Firm. My
name's Robinson. Yon want my partner—Mr. Jones.
Client (angrily). No, I don't, Sir. 1 particularly do not want Mr
Jones.
Gentleman at Work at a Table (good-naturedly). Well, I'm afraid
no one else will be able to understand you. At any rate, I can't, so
good-bye. [Returns to his Bills of Costs.
[Client returns to Clerks' Office, and is ultimately shown into
Mr. Jones.
Client. I think it right to tell you, Sir, that as I hear you are
fond of fox-hunting (to which I have conscientious objections!
I thould have preferred seeing one or other of your partners.
Mr. Jones. Quite so. But never mind; tell me what it's all
about. [ Client tells him.
(Interval of Two Tears.)
Client (looking at his Bill of Costs). Why the amount is just as
heavy as it would have been in the old days, if not heavier 1 The
fusion of the two branches of the Legal Profession doesn't seem to
have made law any oheaper
[Scene closes in upon the Client's sorrowful reflections.
A BENEVOLENT ADULTERATOR.
Joseph Juggins, twenty years ago, a spanking fortune made,
Not by bulling, or by bearing, or by mining speculation;—
No; he drove a highly spirited, remunerative trade
In provisions, gently tempered by astute adulteration.
When his gains had mounted up to such a very handsome sum
That it took a dozen clerks a week to find out what he owed,
It befel him that his conscience, which had theretofore been numb,
Roused itself to do its duty as an active moral goad.
Its suggestions were not pleasant—nay, indeed, were the reverse—
At his very heart's core, night and day, incessantly they gnawed,
Pointing out with painful frequenoy that, probably, a curse
Would attend upon emoluments derived from wholesale fraud.
"I have done a deal too well, I fear," repentant Juggins said,
"With my oleo-margarine, retailed as Dorset of the best,
With my tins of slimy odds-and-ends, my homicidal bread,
And my sauces which from inexpensive drugs obtained their zest.
"I have made vast sums of money by those profitable teas,
Which acquire peculiar fragrance from the foliage of the sloe;
By my honey, manufactured independently of bees;
By my eighteenpenny " sparkling," and my ninepenny Bordeaux.
"I must make full reparation, and with all convenient speed,
To the much-offended sources of my evil-gotten wealth.
Let me do some highly creditable philanthropic deed,
Do it, too, exceeding promptly, and, if possible, by stealth!
"Shall I found an Institution for the permanent relief
Of my deeply-injured clients of the lower middle-class,
Who, in pocket or in health, have come to swift and hideous grief,
By consuming food and drink which I supplied to them, alas?
"'Twould be sure to be mismanaged 1—Happy thought! "—and here
a smile
Played about the lips of JuoorNS. "'Tis quite obvious how I may
Make the needful restitution to the victims of my guile,
In a far more thoroughgoing, yet less ostentatious way."
Straight he opened all his principal emporia once more,
And placarded his resolve to recommence the daily sale
Of the edibles and potables in which he'd dealt before;
But at prices unrecorded in the annals of retail.
At elevenpence a bottle, strange and wild as it may seem,
He supplitd East India Sherry, Comet Hock, and " Twenty" Port;
He adulterated milk with thirty-three per cent, of cream,
And retailed it to his clients at a halfpenny the quart.
Orange Pekoe and Young Hyson, sweetly flavoured and perfumed,
Could be bought at his establishments for one-and-four the pound,
And his fine old fragrant Mochas were extensively consumed
At the price which Juggins paid to have the berries burnt and
ground.
All the articles provided by this much-repentant wight
Were superlative in quality, and yet so wondrous oheap, _ [i
That his shops were thronged with customers from morning
While his business competitors had ample cause to weep.

As for him, his spirits regularly rose from day to day.
In proportion to the chronic diminution of his pelf;
He exulted in his losses, and was often heard to say,
That a dear and spotless conscience was a fortune in itself.
When the brand of black remorse was quite effaced from Juggins'
brow,
And the balance at his bankers wore the semblance of an 0,
All the ruined London tradesmen met. and registered a vow
To be bitterly avenged upon the author of their woe.
In their wrath they turned and rent him—badly, I regret to say—
Irretrievably, indeed, as far as Juggins was concerned;
For his fragments were collected and in triumph borne away
To the foot of Nelson's Column, where, next morning, they were
burned.
But the people, prizing Juggins as a man of antique mould,
As a credit to his country and an honour to his race.
In the precincts of the Abbey raised a pyramid of gold,
With the following inscription, deeply graven on its base :—
"In Memori am! This Monument commemorates the deeds
Of a singularly generous and philanthropic man.
Who expended all his substance to relieve his neighbours' needs,
And reversed commercial principles to carry out his plan.
"Human jealousy removed him prematurely from this earth
To a region where suoh sacrifice as his reward should find;
And a sorrow-stricken Nation thus pays tribute to the worth
Of J. Juggins, the lamented benefactor of mankind!"
A WATERY GRIEVANCE.
Mr. Punch, Sir,
As it is the last straw that breaks the poor Camel's back,
so it is the last arrogant, if not impertinent demand of the imperious
Water Company that condescends to supply me with the small
quantity of water that I require for domestio purposes, that breaks
down my powers of silent endurance.
Not content with charging me annually nearly as much for river-
water as I pay my Wine Merchant for my liberal supply of fine Old
Port, the Collector informs me that he purposes calling for the
Christmas account on the 2nd of January; or if I prefer sending it
before that time, he will be at home to receive it for one hour on two
days of the week 1 What lordly airs this mere Waterman gives
himself. At the back of the demand note I am furnished with suoh
information as is expected to explain to me why I am charged so
much, and this is what I learn from that wondrous document.
In the first place I am referred to the 15th and 16th cap. Vict.
160, section 3538, which of course, not being an Astrologist, I do not
understand. Anticipating, probably, this difficulty, the matter is
cleared up by the information that all the services they so kindly
render to me in the water line, if more than 160 feet above Trinity
high-water mark, are charged one per cent, per annum additional.
Now here I find a twofold difficulty. I do not know how high
Trinity high-water mark is, and, if I did, I have nothing wherewith
to measure 160 feet. I consulted my milkman, thinking he would
probably know all about it, but he was really quite angry at my
suggestion to that effeot, and professed utter ignorance on the
subject. A boating-man of my acquaintance tells me that he should
think that the Trinity House, on Tower Hill, stands about twenty
feet above the river at high-water, but I don't quite see how that
important information helps me. He tells me, if I happen to know
one of the Old Brethren of that Anoient Home, he could perhaps
assist me; but I don't, so I suppose I must yield the point.
I am next told that for every nigh service ten feet above the road-
way, 1 must pay extra, and for every fixed Bath 1 must pay extra,
so I have been measuring, with the assistance of a ladder, the outside
of my sober dwelling— and a fearful cold I succeeded in catching
during that risky operation—and find to my joy that by unfixing my
Bath and using it, when required in my baok drawing-room, lean
elude these two abominable charges. But now comes suoh an awful
ibination of outrageous swindles in the form of definitions of the
meaning ot the familiar word domestio, as I should think was never
before attempted, even by a Water Company.
I am informed that domestic supply does not include supplies for
Steam-engines or Railway purposes, which is quite unnecessary
information for me, as I have none in the house. But I also learn
it does not include water for warming purposes, or for baths, or
washing my little Brougham, or for watering my little garden,
twenty feet by fifteen, or for watering my little horse, or, cruellest
of all, for flushing a drain should it require it I
Can anything be conceived more monstrous? Here am I called
upon to pay a considerable sum for water, and I am forbidden to use
a drop of it for any of the above most necessary purposes. I must
not use any of it, apparently, for warming my nocturnal whiskey, or
for washing more of my person than my hands and face, and I must
not let my poor horse drink a drop of it I Why is this iniquitous
system allowed to continue?
_ Old Deputy Muggins tells me that when the grand old Corpora-
tion, as he always calls it, applied to Parliament a few years ago to
remedy these and similar grievances, the Directors and Shareholders
of all the Oas Companies, and the Railway Companies, and the
Tramway Companies, and the Dock Companies, and the Telegraph
Companies, who were members of the House, all met in the Tea-
Room, and, over a onp of that innocent beverage, vowed to combine
together for the protection of their brother Monopolists against the
common foe. The Corporation were defeated and routed on that
memorable occasion, although supported by the then Government, but,
I am delighted to hear that they are now engaged in undermining the
watery Monopolists by sinking an Artesian Well in the eastern con-
fines of the anoient City whence will shortly be seen bubbling up an
inexhaustible supply of beautiful pure water for the use of every
ratepayer of that fortunate locality, who may use it not only for such
purposes as an imperious Company may dictate, but for every use
that health, cleanliness, or comfort requires.
May their grand effort be successful, and their good example
imitated, Joseph Greenhorn.
TENNYSON IN SHOREDITCH.
So all day long the noise of prattle rolled
Among the brawlers of the Civic Board,
Until the Shoreditoh Vestry, man by man,
Had snapped their fingers in their Chairman's faoe,
The Vicar. Then because his wound was deep
(Inflicted by a pen thrown at his head),
A band of Ratepayers began to cheer,
Of Ratepayers, who hated all those rows,
And bore him to a friendly neighbouring pump,
A broken handle with a broken spout,
That stood in the yard beneath the Vestry Hall:
On one side stood the Vicar, and on one
Those ooarse-tongued brawlers—and their tongues v>»r» coarse!
Then spake the Chairman to the Ratepayers:
"The shindy of to-day exposes all
The apish antics of a Bumble crew,
The worst this town containeth. Straight it leads
To a Reformed Municipality." &o.
[And the sooner the better!
"Mat be to-dat bead o'er in Paul's."—Mr. Punch, as a oon-
tented Parishioner and Citizen of London, begs herewith to congra-
tulate the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's on the magnificent Reredos

great artist, Time, who, with his own method, and by the j udieious
use of London atmospherical effects of colour, will gradually bring
its tone into harmony with the surroundings.
A True Brett 'TJn.
The Master of the Rolls, in the
Firework Case on appeal last
week, was more brilliant than all
Mr. Brook's show. He quite

corusoated. And the lauehterl
He must be known as the'' Master
of the Revels," or "The Master
of the Roars - of - Laughter."
Impromptus tool apparently no
preparation. But there's concealed
art in these jooosities. What sort
of art P Brett Art, of course.
Mr. Biron, sitting at Lambeth
the other day, having been appa-
rently much surprised at the
conduct of a Policeman who had
suffered a couple of housebreakers
to slip rather too easily through
his fingers in the Walworth Road,
is reported to have mystified the
oonstable in question by asking
him whether he thought he was
living in Arcadia." Suoh language
from the Benoh suggests the pos-
sibility of giving quite a classio
ring to the Police Reports, for,
following up the Bironio method,
it would not be difficult to haul an
allusion to Bacchus and the Kleu-
sinian Mysteries into a drunk and
incapable charge, and adorn a
case of mistaken identity with a
referenoe to the dangers besetting
a passage between Scylla and
Chary bdis. Mr. Biron commences
well by boldly contrasting the
Walworth Road with Arcadia,
and no doubt he will effectively
follow up this happy lead. Mean-
time the Lambeth Police might
look up their Lempriire.

MR. PUNCH'S EXAMINATION PAPERS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
A Pathetic Protest from Master Passhore.
Mr. Punch prints the following characteristic letter without
comment:—
Dear Punch,—I've all ways rather liked you up to now, hecaus I
thought you stuck up for boys, but I do call it too litestly mean of you
to go ana set that humbugiu paper you did on Fary tales I How do
you expect a fellow to do a desent paper in things he hasn't looked
at sinse he was a kid P And giving it in holliaays too. My guv.
■aid he'd like to see what sort of a paper I made of it, and bo the
oonsequens was I had to stay in a hole morning, and swot at those
footling questions of yours! And all I got for it was that when the
Guv. read my ansers, he said there were too things struk him
forsibly—my injinuity and my ignoranse, which was a nice remark
for a fellow's pater to say! I don't beleive I did so very bad either,
considering I wasn't given any time for prep., and the Guv. was in
the Libry all the time, and I couldn't get a chanoe to crib, for
there' s nothing low in cribbing in Pass Exams., you know. But I '11
tell you some of the things I put, and you'll see. You said
"Mention and Critisize the conduo of Sforjianna after"—something
or other. I didn't mention it, hecaus I couldn't remember that part,
so I only critisized. I said: "The conduc of Morjianna, tho not
prapt all that could be detired, was such that unlets the had acted
diferently, could not have been otherwise." You see the tip is always
to write as if you knew all about it, and then they may think you
do and mark you,—praps—I did the same for the next one, which
was: "Would I call Puts in Boots a strictly truthful annimle?"
That stumped me at first, for I'd forgotten who Puss in Boots
teat, as I hadn't been to the Pantimime then—but I maneged to fox
up something at last. I put: " When tee considder the sircum-
ttentes, and the times she lived in and all that, which were barberous
compared to now, we must come to the conclusion of her being as
truthful a* the ordnery run of cats of that age, and prapt this, if
colt spoke now, which I have not met any that do it."
The next was—" How did Castim Barber discover Ally had become
riohP"
I shotted that, and stuck down": "By the swagger he put on."
"What use did he make of his discovery f" I said: "Sucked up to
him and asked him to dinner." Becaus, whether that was the right
anser or not, it's what most chaps would do, so .1 may have done
that right.
Then you said, "describe fully: Bluebeard t Chamber." I know
I did that right, I put it was full of haredies and machines and
things. How I knew was a long time ago, when I was a lower boy.
I went to the Gayaty where it was done. I muffed " the halls and
terrace where the Wonderful Lamp was," I said there was nothing
much to see there except oil-jars—which was wrong.
For " the fizzical and geografioal features of the country at the top
of the Benestork," I corked down "clouds,"—and chanced it.
In the B paper I did much better. To the question "if I con-
sidered Giants an intelligent race," I -used my Commin Sence, as a
form master we have, always tells us to when in doubt. I put:
"Oiantt pose sing big heads, we natully expect their branet to
corispond, and so we find, for it is quite common to hear people tork
of an 'Intelectial Giant.' So I consider they are."
The next was easy: "What.is aRooP What do Rocs feed on P."
I wrote:
"All rather big stones are termed Rocs, or (as it it more corecJcly
spelt) Bocks. Bocks live on the ground, and the Proverbian tells us,
they gather moss, but they do not eat it—it sometimes eats into them.
The rest of the question was such orful rot, I left it alone.
About the wicked Uncles I put—and I don't see now where I was
wroDg!
"1'he end of a Wicked Uncle [is he uthally diet, he is sometimes
sorry, when he reppentt."
I didn't try the one about the seven-Iege boots, beoause I thought
there was a catch in it somewhere. Another was: "Write down
any hero who has sufered iuconvenance from (a) the imprudense, (6)
the disabedience, of his wife."
I thought I'd better write something to that—just to say 1 'd tried.
So I said:
"The disabedience or imprudense of a wife is always inconvenant
to a hero, leding as it does to rows, which are disagribble to live with."
You see I didn't exackly anser the question, beoaus I didn't know
it, but I think anyone but my Guy. would have alowed me som marks.
I told him I 'd done quite as well as I genally did in other Exams.,
and he larfed a nasty larf, and said he quite bleeved me, but I
deserved plucking all the same. He turned everything I wrote into
fun, and told me a few ours quite studdy of Fary Tales would do me
a wurld of good. So I thought I'd write and ask you not to try to be
funny that way again, becaus it's grind enuff to have to go in for
exams., on usful subjios, without being bothered craming up boshy
nursry storys I I remain, Your disapointed Friend,
Marcus Cockshott Passmore.
P.S.—I tell you one thing, I'll take joly good care I see Punch
before the Guv. does next week. But I forgot—I shall be baok at
Skoolthen! M. C P.
LAMENT OF THE LATTER-DAY APE.
Respected once were we,
At least our fathers were,
Brought home from over-sea
In Solomon's galere.
Ah, those were merry days I
As monkeys may not sing,
We chatter of their praise—
When Solomon was King!
Apes olung amid the sails,
With gold about their necks,
Below, with gleaming tails,
Slim peacocks walked the decks;
But now their plumes sublime,
Men say, misfortune bring.
'Twas not so in the time
When Solomon was King I
Ah, now to organs tied,
Or prisoned in the Zoo,
Where vulgar orowds deride
What sorrows we go through!
Beseechingly we crave
For nuts, and sweets, and string,
Who did not so behave
When Solomon was King 1
Yet in those ages old,
When apes might honour win,
Man never had been told
The monkeys were his kin;
You know it now, and yet
You bid the Ape go swing—
The summers we regret
When Solomon was King!
Theft of Trade-Marks.—What is the difference, in point of

and merry England, the brand would have been imprinted on the
offender with an iron instrument at a temperature too high to be
tolerable; but modern civilisation prohibits that contrahrand pro-
ceeding. Would there be any cruelty, however, in the Merchandise
Marks Act if it rendered a counterfeiter of marks liable to be pain-
lessly but ignominiously branded with the Broad R. t

ISMAIL OUT OF EGYPT.

'—
Air—" Hi's all Riqbt wbes tou Ksow Him."
Newest Version, arranged as a Duet. As Sung by those clever Mammoth Comiques,
Mr, Marriott and Ismail Pasha.
Mr. Marriott tings:—
This Ismail is a party aa yer don't meet every day;
He liberal and hearty, nee and easy in his way.
You'd hardly call him scrupulous, bat in this bloomin' East,
Of all things parties oare about they oare for that the least.
{Spoken.) Ter know conscience ain't everythink—or else I might not have a look in, or so
my enemies say. You know what the aphoristio cove says about Conscience being like a
thorn in a cushion—only another term for discomfort. / like an easy seat to my couch,
bo does every sensible chap with an eye to—shall we say the Woolsack i Ah 1 (to audience)
yon don't know Ismail, neither did I till now. But he '< right enough 1
Sings:—
He's all right when yon know him, though the fellaheen he vezt;
You don't expect a Pasha too particular. Wot next?
He wouldn't hurt a beetle; he's a pal as you can trust;
He's all right when you know him, but you' ve got to know him fust.
Judge-Advocate's a lovely blend, my Ismail begs to state,
And if he had his way, he'd be both Judge and Advocate.
I sez, "pray chuok in Jury," but he answers "that's all bosh,"
And in the East—like many other things—won't never wash.
(Spoken by Ismail Pasha.) I'll lay a Palaoe on the Bosphorus to—Tewfik's brain, that
there ain't a better Judge nor Advocate in England nor what he is. He can shift it, can't
he? See what he's done for me I As the Times says, I'd piled up my claims to five
millions sterling, exolusive of maintenance charges. In course that was all bluff. I'd
about as much claim on the Egyptians I'd so successfully spiled as a pickpocket would have for
compensation for disturbance from the old bloke he'd robbed, and who had collared him in the
act and handed him over to the Crushers.
"In right and reason," sez the Timet agin.
'' I was an undischarged bankrupt.'' Right t
Ha, ha I Reason t Oho I In the Happy
Land on the shores of Old Nile, beloved of
Bondholders, ruled by "Toothpick Pasha,"
and guided, philosophered and friended by
Edgar Wincent and Marriott 11! What
a larks! But the Judge-Advocate-General
it a pal, if yer like
Singt :—
He's all right when you know him, though
he wot so down on Joe,
But, bless yer, they have made that little
tiff np long ago,
Lord Solly finds—as I do—he's a pal as
one can trust.
He's all right when you know him, bat
you've got to know him fast.
He's seed a deal of ohange, he has, he wos
a Lib: one time,
Well, he's a Liberal now—to me. One
Hundred Thousand I Prime I
He 'd never round upon a pal, for me he '«
spread it thick.
Cash, public lands, three palaces! By
Allah, he's a brick!
{Spoken.) I tell yer, yon don't half know
what the man can do. What does the
Timet say agin ?" His people still groans
under a load of taxation his scandalous
prodigality and avarice of gain accumu-
lated. . . He has been the source of most of
the misfortunes of Egypt." Ha! ha 1
That's Me 11 I—" And the iriends of Egypt
have to thank him for letting himself be
coaxed into taking an indemnity from its
penury of a couple of millions." Ho! ho!
Thanks! And who was the "Coaxer"?
Why, Marriott to be sure,—
Sings:—
He coaxed that there two millions from
young " Toothpick "—ain't he green f—
And "Toothpick " why he'll " ooax " it out

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Whirligig of Time is bringing about its revenges in this " so-
called nineteenth century," when the dusty papers of the Record
Offices at home and abroad, and the
Manuscript treasures, both of ancient
houses and of private collections, are
freely placed in the hands of lynx-
eyed experts, who, in the enthusiasm
of their plodding perseverance, are
continually cinder-sifting the dust-
bins and exhaustively inspecting the
waste-paper baskets of the past—not
to "make history," but to reveal truth
plain and irresistible. One of the
results of this laborious process comes
before us in the shape of the first volume of Gasqpkt's Henry the
Eighth and the English Monasteries, which stating only hard facts,
and dealing straightforwardly with the contemporary records,
justifies beyond question the opinion now gradually, but surely,
gaining ground, that some of the heroes of that epooh, suoh as Ckum-
wrll and his oreatures, Lequ, Litton, Af Kick, and London,
were unmitigated scoundrels, that their Royal Master was every way
worthy of them, and that the shape assumed by the Reformation in
England was made possible by Wolsky, of whose character Shaks-
peare. by the mouths of Queen K atherinb and of faithful Griffith,
formed so just, and yet so charitable an estimate. That there was
some basis for the modern popular notion expressed in the first verse
of a once well-known song, set to a catching tune, recounting how
"Many have told
Of the Monks of old,
What a joWal set they were,"
is oertain, as this first volume proves. But " of the many who told,"
very few were worthy of credit, and their stories, even then, were
onlv of " 'some' Monks of old," not all, just as Collegiate bodies,
Guilds, and even Metropolitan Boards, may become lax and corrupt,
and their conduct necessitate a commission of inquiry with a view
to correction of abuses. And at such a period how oonspioaously
stands out the incorruptible honesty of the honest men! How
virtuous it was at suoh a time to be virtuous I How difficult to be
constant t) a prinoiple I How easy to save a head by giving way
just enough to avoid the block! When a stroke of the pen might
ward off a stroke of the axe, the alternative between " Is Life worth
living," or Death worth dying, was not one whioh ordinary men
could choose without considerable sacrifice one way or the other.
Gasquet's Henry the Eighth is to be completed in two volumes, and
will be a valuable work for historical reference.
By the way, the publications of the Record Office and modern
researoh into these old letters and papers,—and "there are lots more
where those oome from,"—show that our old friend, Cobbett,
whose work has been shelved for some time, was pretty accu-
rate in his history, and had warrant for the strength of his oon-
viotions and the force of his expressions. There was an 'attempt
some little time ago—whose it was I forget—to whitewash Richard
the Third, but it was only theoretical, and did not deal with facts
suoh as are afforded by the litera script* of the Reoord Office, and in
reading the life of Lady Jane Dossier, transcribed from the anoient
M9. notes of Henry Clifford in Lord Dormer's possession, I find
that the Tudor Queen, whom we have all been taught to regard as
"Bloody Mary," was, in the opinion of her Lady-in-Waiting and
intimate companion, a oharming Prinoess, and everything that was
kind and considerate as compared with her haughty and violent sister,
Elizabeth, whose conduct as a girl seems to have been scandalous.
What will the Private History of our own " Viotorian Era" be when
a oenturv or two hence the cinder-sifters have taken the records in
hand I However, it will not matter to us of the present day, at
all events, who won't be there to contradict or applaud the verdict
whatever it may he. And now to lighter themes.
Having read Marion's, I shou'd say Marzio's Crucifix, and
recorded my delight in' no stinted terms of praise, I determined to
read Marion Crauford's Paul Patoff. It his lain on my table for
three weeks, and I have been perpetually trying to sit down to its
perusal. Something has invariably prevented mo. Once, having to
leave town, I took away a volume with me, whioh on settling myself
oomfortably in an arm-ohair, I discovered was the third volume.
When I returned I made a spare hour, and took up Vol. I. Soaroely
had I out its pages than a visitor was ushered in to see me on
important business. The next day I search -d everywhere for it: in
vain. All three volumes had disappeared. "Where, Madame," said I,
addressing the Baroness, "is my Paul Patoff—three volumes, blue
cover f" She explained that, thinking I had fioished it, she had
lent it to a friend. It was returned in three days: again and again
I tried to snatoh a few moments just to make a beginning; hut no.
fate was against me until one morning I exclaimed brilliantly, "If
I defer it any longer I shall oall it Paul Putoff," and seizing the first
volume I commenced reading, and as far as I have gone I a
by the style, and thoroughly interested in the story.
"Please look at this," said the Baroness, who is a novel-devourer,
to me, at the same time handing me a book by Rowland Gret,
entitled, By Virtue of His Office, in which she had marked oertain
passages In one of them there is deserved praise bestowed by one
of the oharaoters on The Children's Cry, whioh appeared in one of
Mr. Punch's numbers. But Miss Elizabeth Verity, the heroine of
the novel (whioh the Baroness informed me interested her, though
she is not sure if I should oare so much for it) blushingly takes to

not so? Connie, the minor heroine, observes that she "only reads
Punch and The World." A well-disciplined mind, evidently. But
in spite of these attractions, I must return to Paul Patoff, or I Bhall
lose the thread of the narrative. So no more, until I 've done with
these Russian Blue-books, from
Yours studiously, Baron De Book Works.
A BIT OF GRAPHIC.
(0/ the Regulation Pattern.)
The woodland ways, lately so golden-glorious in their radiant
array, are now sorrowful in their solemn silence. The poly-
chromatic Oread-haunted obscurities of October, the neutral-tinted
nymph-trodden nebulosities of November have given place to the
damp desolation and dreary drippingnesi of December, dismally
prolonged into what is ironically called the Opening Year I
Chili rain-pools lie in steely stillness in rnst-nued argillaceous
ruts. Here the broad slowly-circling wheel of the rustic wain has
weightily wound its deep-indenting way. Sparse and sodden spear-
lets of oonsumptive-looking grass droop limply along the reeking
sidewalk. Nature, indeed, seems stricken as with phthisis. Like
an almost pulseless poitrinaire, she lies limply on her tear-stained
couch, dying, dying dying!
A belated bluebottle, buzzing blindly athwart a leafless forest
vista, blunders incontinently into a broken rain-gemmed spider's
web. The emaoiated Araohne of the woods is all too weak
and woesome to spring with the old obese ogreishness upon its
prismatic prey. Bat the purblind, oold, palsied lump of azure
iridescence, erst the swift and sonorous offal-hunter of ardent
August, gives up the ghost nevertheless, too weak to whir a wing,
too weary to unwind one clinging manacle of mucilaginous
gossamer.
What is that lying at the gnarled serpentining root of yonder inky-
barked elm? A frowsy fungus, the foul-smelling "agaric of the
holt T" No! It is something of equal unsavouriness, of parallel
unpioturesqueness, yet of infinitely greater human interest. It is
the rusty remnant of a tramp's abandoned highlow. A discarded
shoe, no more I Yet how it teems with suggestion! Heel has it
none, of sole soaroely a sorap, its frayed "uppers" hint not even
distantly of Day and Martin, its gaping ankle-pieces ungainly gape
and unoomely curl and brutally bulge. Bat it once held a m
foot!
"You may break you may batter the boot as you will,
But the trace of' the human' will cling to it still,"
as a less meretricious and more genuinely graphio Moore might have
sung—had he been man enough.
It is the only suggestion of "poor humanity" within sight, this
damp and disintegrated highlow. Bat how it redeems mere Nature
from negation and nullity! That is because " the low sad music of
humanity" breathes throngh its gaping soul—I should say sole—and
age-worn eyes—that is to say, eyelet-holes. It transmutes the
languid lyric of Niobe-like Nature at once into a stirring epio of
soul-flashed Life! The Roman was right :—
"Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto."
—not even a human highlow! It speaks of poverty, it whispers of
the wars of Class, it hints not indistinotly of the Unemployed! It
bears a warning to the autocratic Warren, and the truculent
truncheon-bearers of Trafalgar Square I So here in the lonely slush-
sodden heart of the leafless wintry woods, there wells up from the
ohill, but oracular lips of unpleasantly damp and dtaggled. but ever
sublime and sympathetic Nature, a message to caste-ruled, cosily
housed, but alwavs despotically-disposed Man,—proud man, dressed
in a little brief (Tory) authority, whioh soon the indignant voice of
a too-patient, but omnipotent proletariat, shall hurl
[No thank you! This is " hoik in? it to some useful end," with a vengeance.
The article was evidently intended for a penny paper. A "blend" of
graphio gush badly imitated from poor Jirraaiss, and partisan spite of the
regulation political pattern, will not suit Mr. Punch.—Kd.]

"BOUND TO PART"
The Double Irish Jio as danobd (a la "Double Hobnfifb in Fetters,") by thosb
ACCOMPLISHED ARTISTES THE MARQUIS OF RlBBON AND THE "ST. JcST OF THE GLAD-
STONIAN PARTY,"—"WE THANE THEE, GOSCHEN, FOR TEACHINa US THAT word,"—last
week, at Dublin.
THEN, NOW, AND HEREAFTER.
[Three View) of the same Subject)
VIEW I.—The Probable Past.
Tex Cathedral was filled with worshippers.
The organ pealed through the aisles. The
stately procession of Monks wended its way
through the nave to the altar-steps.
It was then that the Prelate descended
from his throne, and leaning on his pastoral
staff, raised his right hand to bless the kneeling
throng before him.
The sweet tones of the Church mnsio died
away, and in a silence solemn and awe-in-
spiring, the Bones of the Martyr enshrined in
gold and precious stones, were plaoed in the
receptacle that had been reserved for them I
VIEW II.—The Positive Present.
The labourers pulled out the stones from
the front of the altar. One of the men
suddenly came upon a coffin. With an ex-
olamation of surprise he attracted the atten-
tion of his mate.
They had come at length upon the bones!
They were a little startled at the incident.
They had expected no suoh immediate dis-
covery. They just tumid over the remains
to see that they were not mixed with any-
thing more valuable, and sent for the
Authorities.
The Authorities hurried into the crypt, and
handled the bones with very natural curiosity.
To whom could they belong? Did they
belong to him P That was the question.
This long bone seemed part of a good-sized
leg. That cranium was evidently a portion of
a skull. Had the skull been cracked or
broken P Important questions these, and
some day to be answered.
But the remains were in a sad condition I
They were quite dirty. This was hardly a
reason for astonishment. They had laid un-
disturbed for centuries in their old-fashioned
stone-coffin. So the best thing to do was to
give them what they most needed—a good
washing 1 So they were washed!
When they were nice and clean they were
ready for the anatomist and the expert. But
where could they be examined P Not in the
confines of a Cathedral Crypt, then why not
in the neighbouring house of a local Official P
A board on a sofa in the drawing-room would
be the very thing I
So without a throng of worshippers, minus
the sweet musio of an organ, and in defiance
of what Publio Opinion might say about dis-
interring human remains, the Bones of the
Martyr were plaoed on the receptacle that had
been reserved for them I!
VIEW III.—The Frowning Future.
The Museum was filled with curiosities.
Here was a newspaper five hundred years old.
There was a gun that ages ago used to be
loaded with steel shot and gunpowder.
Yonder was a thing called an anchor that the
mariners of olden times were wont to em-
ploy to tether their water-boats to the sea-
bound shore.
Two men were handling some human re-
mains. A third held a book filled with en-
tries. All three expressed curiosity, and
closely examined the labels attached, to the
interesting exhibits.
To whom could they have belonged P
Were they once the frame-work of a giant P
Had they come from a battle-field P
The three men shook their heads. They
did not know! There was no one handy
to consult! No! Not even an anatomical
expert! No! Not even a prying member
of a Cathedral Chapter I The remains had
better be put in a case labelled "Miscel-
laneous." So without the smallest mark of
respect, without the least show of eooleBias-
tical splendour, without a chance of challeng-
ing Publio Opinion, the Bones of the Martyr
were placed in the receptacle that had been
reserved for them!! I
Mrs. Rah is going to take a class at a Sun-
day School. She told her niece, " I shall hear
the children their cataplasms and instruct
them in the three creeds, which my dear, as
the Bishop said in his sermon the other day,
are the Epistles' Creed, The Lyceum, and the
Farinaceous Creed."
Unprofitable. — Speculating on a "dead
oertainty."
A Popular Cry.—Palaces for the People!
A South London Palace, a North London
Palace, an East London Palace, a West
j London Palace—so many Palaces for the
People of London. Why not also so many
balls and sceptres, so many crowns, and
plenty of them for his Majesty the London
People P But then, for the multitudes of the
People unemployed that want bread, what
will, Palaces at all quarters of the compass
prove, but piles of stone that will not teed
themP

IN THE ARENA.
The "Parade" Before the Conflict.
Ho 1 trumpets blare forth bravely, ho I banners proudly flout!
Cool critics loll expeotant, spectators swarm and shout I
For lo! short truce is over, and lately sundered foes,
Once more in the arena will counter, clash, and close.
The echoes of the battle when last they trod the sand,
The tramp of eager horsemen, the clang of biting brand,
Seem scarcely to have left us, and now. before the Spring
Has come with burst of blossom, has filled with flush of wing,
Ere Valentine the Vernal hath trod the ancient tracks,
His burthens laid on lovers, and eke on postman's backs,
Ere suow hath left the branches, ere green hath lit the boughs,
We may look out for ructions, and we must list to rows.
Muse, this is scarcely classic, it smacks of Cockney slang,
Not thus had sung old Homer of battle's crush and clang;
Not thus sublime Alc^us had chanted the great day,
When " halls from floor to rafter glitter with war's array." [snow.
But now our "white-plumed helmets," shine not with unsmirched
And. though we've "shields emblazoned," " Chalcidian blades enow,"
And war's "well-tried protectors from hostile spear" and dart,
Heroes seem less heroic, with less of heart than art.
And classic exaltation, and chivalry's intense
Ecstatic high-faluting, and rapt magniloquence,
Require a little toning, in colour and in phrase,
To fit them to the fighters of later lesser days.
Yet in this huge arena heroic figures shine;
Suoh sure is thine, Gladstonius; C&ctxius, such is thine 1
Achilles and. great Hector might well have flushed with joy
To counter foes so worthy afar by windy Troy.
SOur Troy, indeed, is " windy "—in quite another sense;
Their jEolus meant power, ours mainly flatulence.)
Cjscllius on his war-horse full proudly pranceth round—
He doth not show like shrinking, nor look like giving ground;
And at his back, all brawny, and stolid, and serene
(An armour-bearer stouter hath been right seldom seen),
Comes low-lipped Hartingtontus, ready with shield, or crest,
Or sword, or spear, or javelin, as may be in request.
These eyeing stern and steady, as fighters foemen eye,
Comes wintry-lock'd Gladstonius, game still the lists to try
Against whatever comer, erect, and gaunt of limb,
With glance exceeding fiery, and jaw exceeding grim;
His armour-bearer, also, is ready at his heel,
With breadth of bossy buckler, and length of shining steel;
Parnellios the Placid, with pallid cheek and cold.
With calm eye ever watchful, and chill front ever bold.
When these anon encounter in full and fiery tilt.
Be sure that steel shall splinter, and ruddy blood be spilt.
"Who—who in the aforetime had ever thought to see
These heroes so attended?" museth the herald, P.
And other chiefs of valour though lower in their grade,
Array in the arena, and prance in the parade.
ComeB Smithius the smug-faced, him of the Bettled smirk,
Balfourius "the brave," too, one never known to shirk
Sword-thrust, or spare his foeman though prostrate and disarmed,
Goschenius, erst henchman of Gladstonius, till charmed
From him the white-lock'd Wonder, but now his fieroest foe,
Save Chajibeelantus, better beknown as Brummijo,
Who beards his ancient Chieftain with even more of ire,
And backs his ancient foeman with yet more zealous fire.
Not so the stout Harcourtius, him of the triple chin,
He backs the "Grand Old Manlius." as one who's bound to win,
Old Manlius Gladstonius, when others shy or sulk,
And loads the ancient war-horse with big complacent bulk.
And others follow after him of the snowy crest,
Morleius the mordant, bravest amongst the best,
Gallant Sfencerius Kufus, the loyallest of hearts,
And—but the clarion brayeth, the martial pageant starts.

"JACK'S ALIVE!"
Who killed John Maddison Morton P "I," says the Saturday Review, "in my
article on Labichx, January 28." But who saw him alive? "I did," says Mr.
Punch, "quite recently;" and we are informed that "the late Mr. Maddison Mor-
ton," as the Saturday Reviewest called him, is still "all alive 0," and is one of the
dispersed Charterhouse Brethren, quite cosy and comfortable. Not so very long ago
he was present as a visitor at a meeting of "The Urban Club." Long live John
Maddison- Morton J But d propos of Labiche, John Maddison Morton's Box
and Cox is something more than a mere adaptation of Frisette, — though, we
admit, that a small but telling portion of its dialogue is simply literally translated,
—because Maddison Mobton possessed an original style of dialogue, nihil tetigit quod
non Maddisonavit, and in this instanoe, unless we have been for many years much
mistaken (in whioh case '' the late Mr. Maddison Morton" will be in time to correct us),
he used two pieces besides the operetta Frisette (to which class of entertainment the
farce returned under the inverted title of Cox and Box, with Sullivan's immortal
music and an entirely new character, Sergeant Bouncer)—and J. M. M. "combined
the information" in the concocting of Box and Cox. But Maddison Morton
deserves literary and dramatic immortality if only for having invented the title Box
and Cox. Labiche's Frisette has long since been forgotten, but Morton's Box and Cox
lives and flourishes, and will live—as will also Cox and {the musical) Box—to delight
ages yet unborn.

House of Commons, Tuesday Night. Haying a rehearsal to-night
of our Opening Day on Thursday. Things a little mixed, as appears
from sketch taken on spot by Own Artist. But of course on these
occasions, when Strangers' Galleries are cleared, we do pretty much
aa we like. Speaker, as will he seen, is in high spirits. A little
conscious, I fancy, of advantageous set-off of his figure against Lord
Chancellor. But Habdinge Gifpaed doesn't mind.
"I approach opening of Session with easy conscience, Dear Tony,"
he said, just now. "Haven't held of lice more than two years, and
can lay my hand on my heart and say there's not an uncle, a

settling himself down to a comfortable perusal of the " Times."
He lexsurely surveys it for a moment, when he suddenly starts up
from his seat as if shot.

by France last night." "Gibraltar invested by a French Fleet."
"Fifteen ironclads and fifty torpedo-boats assembled at BreBt."
"The command of the Channel threatened!" Dear me, I dare say
now they don't know it at Portsmouth. This is really very awkward.
I wonder, by the way, what I did with that list of available ships.

heard the news? War declared. Channel threatened by the French.
Most awkward piece of business. It 'b all in the papers.
Well-organised Clerk (smiling). Really, 8ir P I haven't heard it
yet mentioned in the Office. War with France! It sounds quite
like a romance. [Smiles again.
Responsible Official. Just so. But I suppose the Board have had
some intimation of the fact. Though [reflectively), now I oome to
think of it, I don't suppose they have. You had better send round
the usual letter. [ Uproar without.
Well-organised Clerk. I scarcely think, Sir, that will be necessary,
as I fanoy I hear the voices of some of " my Lords," even now, upon
the stairs. [Opens the door.) Ah I here they are.
[A bevy of Lords of the Admiralty pour into the room gesticu-
lating wildly, and engaged in a fierce and recriminatory
altercation.
Lords of the Admiralty [in confused chorus, all together). Ah I I
knew what it was coming to! Well, why didn't you open your
mouth about it? What business is that of yours, I should like to
know! Who says we haven't got the guns ready? I said it was

[uproar), that you have come for some—some ar—information as to
how we are prepared—I might say, ready to meet it.
[Renewed uproar.
First Lord [getting a hearing). That's it. In the first place, how
are we off on the home stations for ships?
Responsible Official. How are we off P Ah! to be sure. Of course.
[Fumbling at pigeonholes.) I had a" list, I fancy, dealing with
something of the sort, here the other day, but I can't, for the life of
me, put my hand on it. Do you remember, Mr. Jonbs, what we did
with that list?
Well-organised Clerk (after some reflection). I fanoy, now you
come to mention it, Sir, that Mr. Robinson sent it to Sheerness a
few weeks ago. I think they wanted it for some reason or other.
[ Uproar.

we have a single ship available for the protection of the Channel P
[Jeers.

ably expect this Department to tell you everything. But I will
telegraph for information to Portsmouth. [Does so.

manders of the China, Pacific, and.African Squadrons?

Sixth Lord. Have we any guns at all? And if we have—will they
go off? [Roars of laughter.
Responsible Official [carried away by the general geniality, but
recovering himself). Really, my Lords, you overwhelm me with your
questions. Why, some of them, as you must be well aware, would
take months to answer. You can't expect a parcel of civilians, who
are responsible for these things, to have them at their fingers' ends.
Why, the Director of Naval Ordnance is the only one of us who has
any professional assistance to help him. We mayn't make much of
it, my Lords, but we do our best. (Cries of "Oh! oh!" jeers, and
uproar. Messenger enters hurriedly with several telegrams. Three
are from the Commanders respectively of the China, Pacific, and
African Squadrons, saying they have "just heard of the outbreak of
hostilities, that they are out of coals and ammunition, and are
waiting instructions, which must, however, be sent out by sea, as after
the despatch of their respective messages the wires will be cut" The
fourth is from the Admiral in command at Portsmouth.)

how we are prepared in the Channel. This is from Portsmouth. The

three of her guns, and the shell that's been put aboard for those she
has got is two sizes too big; but she has got a Nordenfeldt and a
couple of Catlings that only jam now and then; and though there's
something wrong with her crank that makes her only cover seven
knots in the hour, yet, take her all round, she's as tidy a craft as
has been turned out of the yard for some time now, and might have
a chance of getting safe up the Channel if there was a bit of a fog
on, and the enemy didn't keep his weather-eye too wide open. Wire

[Frantic uproar, amid which, after threats, imprecations, and

A LESSON IN LAW;
Or, Fusion and Confusion in the Future.
Scene—Interior of the Hall of an Inn of Court, Students discovered
seated at tables, more or less attentive. Enter two Porters, who
arrange a table surrounded by long drapery. They then retire,
giving place to Lecturer who is received with applause. He bows,
and gets behind his table.
Lecturer. Gentlemen, now that in the Legal Profession no distinc-
tion ia known between Barristers and Solicitors, a Lawyer must be
able to appear in many parts. It is not sufficient that he may know
how to address a jury or to draw a brief—he must be competent to
serve a writ, or possibly to become the Lord Chancellor. Naturally in
the latter character he would have many reminiscences of the days of
hi* youth. If you please, I will appear as the Lord Chancellor.
(Stoops down beside the table and re-appears in wig and robe.) H'm,
the Lord Chancellor. (Applause.) H'm, ha, h'm. This is a very im-
portant matter—so important that I fancy we must take time to con-
aider it and not give our decision—decision I say, until next term.
And that reminds me that once when I was engaged in sweeping out
theoffioeof someBarsolistor (I was junior partner of thefirmatthe time),
I found a draft of a brief that had never been delivered, and on account
of ito non-delivery the aotion had been won. No doubt my Brother be-
side me will remember the circumstance? (Altering his voice in reply.)
Certainly. (Takes off disguise of Lord Chancellor and reappears as
himself. Applause.) Having shown you one of the Prizes of the Pro-
fession,Iwillgiveyou another. I will introduce my friend. lfr.WBU.uP,
a Chief Clerk in the Chancery Division. This should be more in-
teresting to you than the other illustration, as it is easier to become a
Chief Clerk than a Lord Chancellor. (Laughter, amidst which the Leo-
turer dives beneath his table to reappear dressed as a Chief Clerk of the
Chancery Division.) Mr. Wrllup! (Cheers and Laughter.) Now,
let me tell you all, that I do aot advise anyone to do anything, but
if I am asked by the Plaintiff in this cause what he ought to do, I
can only say, that were I he, I should certainly take out a summons
which might be made returnable in a week asking for whatever
it ia. And if the Defendant in this cause were to make the
same application to me, I should give him the same advice.
That is what I should do were I »«( a Chief Clerk, but as I am a
Chief Clerk, I give no advice at all 1 (Lecturer dives beneath his
table and reappears as himself. Applause ) Having shown you
what you may become if you are successful, I will now give a
hint of a possible companion fate. My friend, Mr. Costkilt, having
become a Barsolistor, and entering into legal proceedings himself,
knowing the ropes, is anxious that everything should go right.
(Disappears and reappears in an old wig and tattered gown.) 11 r.
Cost kilt. (Applause.) Now tell me, because you know I do know all
about it, whether everything has had proper attention P Have you

got the third account vouched—and the letter for the surrender of
the lease posted, and the further observations to the Junior Counsel
sent out P And I do hope that the funeral I had to attend did not
interfere with my being properly represented when that point about
the binding of my wife's life interest was referred to the judge P And
you are quite sure that there is not more than five quarters rent to
pay for that farm we haven't been able to agree amongst ourselves
to Itt? And you don't think muoh harm was done by my absenting
myBelf to take my eldest daughter to the scarlet fever hospital when
that unsuccessful application was made to have some accumulated
income paid to me out of Court. And—(hesitating)—and—and you
don't think you could advance me five shillings to go on with P
(Loud laughter, amidst which the Lecturer resumes his every-day
dress.) And now, Gentlemen, I will conolnde my leoture with my
last illustration—Mr. Jonathan Busy man. whom we will suppose
is a Barsolistor who has not yet been able to secure a partner.
(Dives under table, and reappears in another character.) Now
let me see which shall I do first—argue before the Court of
Appeal, or finish that Bill of Costs P No; oan't do either, as I have
to serve that writ in Bayswater. But that won't do either, because
I have got to take the proof of that Detective in the Probate oase.
And yet how can I attend to him when 1 must be in Somerset
House searching for that will? Then if I do that, and don't finish
the engrossing of that marriage settlement, I shall stop the marriage
fixed for to-morrow at St. George's, Hanover Square. And then, if
I neglect the dying deposition of the witness at Charing Cross Hos-
pital, and he dies before I get to him, how on earth am I to conduct
that case at Bow Street, fixed for some time this afternoon? Not that I
couldn't throw over a criminal matter if it would have helped me to
appear in the running-down oase in the Q B. D., to cross-examine
the coachman this morning. And then, if I do either, the widow may
starve if I don't identify her in the Paymister-General's Department,
to enable her to secure her dividends 1 Not that she couldn't wait if
I had but the leisure to finish that opinion about the fraud on the
power which I promised should arrive in good time to enable some
country clients of mine to make up their minds before they com-
menced suits for administration over value, and improper convey-
ance. Well, I can't do all, and if I don't do all. 1 had better do
none; so, as it 'b a fine day, and I feel in a pleasant frame of mind,
I think I shall take a holiday, and go to Southend 1
[Roars of laughter, amidst which the Lecturer retires, and
brings the Scene to an agreeable conclusion.
Treating him Lightly.

The place stands in very sore need of a scrub:
And if yested interests in filth should talk tartly,
Just silence the knaves with a tap of that Club I
Dovra with a Difference.—Almost all over Europe it appeirj
that carrier-pigeons are in oourse of being trained for servioe in the
event of War. All pigeons are doves, bat the Continental carrier-
pigeon is evidently a bird of quite another feather than the ideal
dove that allegorioally bears the olive-branch. Perhaps, however,
it will be branohes of Bitter Olives that these War pigeons twill
carry.

House of Common), Thursday Night, February 9.—Saunderson quite
unhappy. Came down early this afternoon prepared for exciting doings. Air
full of rumour of war. Duncan, under cover of seconding the Address, came
down armed to the teeth. Parnellites
were to raise question of Privilege; Old
Morality was to introduce his new
Pounce; and Abthttb Balfoob had ten
olieemen disguised as waiters in the
dining-room. At given signal they were
to enter and arrest every Irish Member
on the premises. Hadn't been such a
glorious prospect for years. Nothing to
equal it—except the absolute flatness of
the night's events. No question of
Privilege; no arrests. The disguised
waiters had nothing to "take up" but
the dinner. Ministerialists brought down
by urgent Whip left the House by
scores when their Leader rose to continue
debate; before midnight whole thing
miserably died out.
Gladstone hope-
lessly infected with
prevailing spirit. Fol-
lowed Mover and
Seconder of Address.
"Nowwe'll have it." said Saunderson, shifting shillelagh
to left-hand coat-tail pocket. But we didn't have it at all.
Gladstone almost blessed Ministers, approved their pro-
gramme, and promised assistance in making it a legislative
Session.
"Call that a Grand Old Man?" the Colonel muttered
between clenched teeth; "J call him a Mild Old Muff."
Up to last moment some hope lingered round Pine. After
hanging out on his castle walls for weeks and months, turned
up to-day under the very nose of Abthub Balfour.
"So you've let yourseH down to this?" said Laicatta,
looking in to hear the writ moved for Dundee. "Better
where you were. As for me, can't approve the way Oppo-
sition is carried on, so gave up my seat. If you could spare
a quarter of an hour, I'd explain, in fuller detail, my reasons
for resigning."
"Excuse me," said Pirns. Whipped out coil of rope which
was wound round his waist; hitched one end over rail of
Peers' Gallery with neatness only attainable after long prac-
tice: went up hand over hand with amazing celerity.
"Don't wait," he said looking down on amazed ex-
Member for Dundee. "Think I see a Policeman coming."
"How very abrupt!" Laicaita said, gladder than ever "How very abrupt!"
"Duncan comes here to-night."
"The gracious Duncan!"
Macbeth.

he had left the House of Commons. Businest done.—
Address moved.
Friday Night.—"They've pioked Pine at last, I hear,"
said Wilfbid Lawson to Sage of Queen Anne's Gate.
"Well," said Sage, "he was getting,a little over-ripe,
don't you think? A man can't hang out for months over
his castle wall, even in Ireland, without goingto the bad."
Inoidents of the arrest quite dramatic When Purs
left House early this morning, Police on his track—but he
got away. Might have been all right if he'd stayed
away. _ But duty first So he took penny 'bos to bottom
of Parliament Street. Observed Police in charge of main
gateways to Palace Yard; skirted railings, descended
steps by Clock Tower. A few more steps, and he would
be safe within the precincts.
"I must dissemble," said the Chatelain of Lisfarny
Castle. So he
thrust his
hands in his
pockets, raised
his shoulders
in vain at-
tempt to hide
his face, and
vaguely whis-
tled "Erin Go
Bragh." But
all in vain.
Hawk eye of
policeman
spotted him.
"Mr. Ptne,
I presume?"
said represen-
tative of Law
and Order,
1'ust as if he
lad come upon
Dr. Living-
stone in the
wilds of Cen-
tral Africa.
Pine's hand
at his belt like
flash of light-
ning. In an- , „ ,
other moment A PJn*> who requires a great deal of forcing.
rope would have been unwound, and he would have been
half-way up the Clock Tower. But the Policeman too
quick for him. Seized the rope, which served conve-
niently for binding the prisoner, and so he was oarried
off to the lowest dungeon beneath the Castle Moat.
At least, that's what Joseph Gillis tells me. The
sketoh was taken by Our Own Artist, who was provi-
dentially on the spot.
This pretty well to begin with. But more to follow.
Soon as Speaker had taken Chair, Gilhoolt rose and
ve notice, "On Monday to ask for leave to bring in a
Bill for the better housing of the working-classes." A
seraphic smile crossed Abthttb Balfour's face as he
listened. "My dear friend," he sweetly murmured, " I
have made arrangements for your own better housing
long before Monday."
Chief Secretary was overheard. Report got wind, and
Gilhoolt was marked as a doomed man. Everybody said
he would be arrested when he left the House.
"Then why leave it?" said Joei B. "I'veslept on
two chairs in the Lib'ry meself. If you '11 be lonely,
we'll keep the House sitting all'night to wake you.
Only say the word."
Gilhoolt pressed the patriot's hand, but too moved to
say any word. Walked about the Mouse; took affec-
tionate leave of familiar places. House up at quarter-
past eleven. Gilhoolt walked forth with unfaltering
step. Crowd of Members followed in silent procession.
Big Ben tolled forth the half-hour. Most impressive
scene. Only wanted presence of Chaplain to complete
analogy that struck everybody. At the gateway Polioe-
n posted. At proper oue, Gilhoolt arrested, and, for
better housing, taken over to police cell in Whitehall
Place. Businest done.—Irish minority reduced by two.

"Haxl Masked."—Clever Mr. 8. Hall, of the Chan-
cery Bar, has just " taken silk." As a leader, he should
be on velvet."

Dear Old P.,
I must just begin in English. I '11 go on into Latin in a minute, only
I find I can't talk so freely in Latin. Here I am, back at sohool, and 1 're got

only I think he was some classical bloke or other—Lars Porsona, I think he
used to be called.
Well, your request that I should tackle the letter of Wykehamistt/s, who
strangely objeots to being called a Wykehamite, reached me yesterday, and
I feel no end flattered. 1 wish you hadn't said I had better answer it in Latin.

AN ANGEL'S VISIT;
Or, The Artist's First Commission.
As hour ago and the world was gray,—
A thoroughly Bloomsbury kind of day,—
When you think of the bills that you cannot pay,
And turn from beautiful thoughts away,
Like a sulky child from kisses,
And wonder how poets sweet things can say
Of a world so chilly and hard and gray,
Where the wise are gloomy, and fools are gay
With their sorrowful, sordid blisses.
My hopes were low, and my heart was sore,
For a soul's mosaio litter'd the floor,
While vile pot-boilers the easels bore,
And the kettle croon'd of the oheap tea-store,
On smouldering coals that waved of yore
In a graveyard antediluvian,
When there came a tap at the studio-door—
Such golden music ne'er heard before
The treasure-seeker who strikes a crore
Of buried rupees, or the hidden ore
Of Incas in vaults Peruvian.
The rain was lashing the windows high,
As if in spite of the brilliant sky
That lives in my pioture of last July,
My holiday record of last July,
My only relio of Summer,
When a wide-eyed welcome of brightest sun
Spread all the room over, and dwelt upon
The hyacinth's dusters of cinnamon
To welcome the sweet new-comer.
Then the veteran chair with a missing limb,
And all that was common and mean and grim,
Grew suddenly seemly, and fine and trim,
Like courtliest old-world lovers;
For a luminous beauty around her flowed,
And her face like the waking of morning glowed,
And her hair like crag in a hollow road
Where a leafy sunlight hovers.
Now I hear but her nightingale melody,
Though her brother, I think, talked more than she,
And they didn't say half as much to me
As they found to say to each other;
But every tone of her orisp, clear notes
Like a water-lily on silence floats,
Though dizzied memory vainly quotes
What she came abont with her brother.
She has taken the loneliness all away,
And only the grace and the oomfort stay;
And the light that she leaves is so pure and bright
That rain and wretchedness merely make
A beautiful rainbow for her sake,
Who found the room in a doleful plight

And a life hung oyer with shadows,
And ont of her bounty has made it gay,
As the lowliest cottage is brave in May
With the cowslip bell and the hawthorn spray,
And all the spoil of the meadows.
And I settle down to the sober light
When the glory is tidied away for the night,
And shy sweet odours can take the air—
Too delicate for the noonday glare
And the romping games of the burly bee—
And, marring the calmness greatly,
Hard chafers suddenly seize your hair,
And bats zig-zag like a tailless kite.
And solemn owls with their silent flight
Winnow the dimness that soon will flee

TESTIMONIAL TO THE SITUATION.
Oir the opening of Parliament (when the last Term of the Silly
Season expires) a crowded Meeting was held to express the thanks
of the Silly Season Subjects for the very efficient aid rendered to
them during their session by the European Situation.
The Chair was taken by the Sea Serpent, who was supported by
the Gigantic Gooseberry, and several members of the great Vegetable
Family, Messrs. Mumpsimus and Sumpsimns, the Weather and the
Parks, Dr. Odium Medioum, Shaoon and Bakespeare, who looked
very much worn out, and a number of well-known habitue's of the
Silly Season.
The Chair-Serpent said he was very glad to see so large and so
thoroughly representative a gathering of his fellow subjects. They
had this season been relieved of a certain amount of hard and thank-
less work by the noble endurance, the unexampled staying power, of
his honoured friend, he was proud to call him a friend (he hoped he
might call him friend), the European Situation. He was perhaps
the doyen of the herd, but he saw around him to-night many who
had served the Press and the Puhlio well for more years than he cared
Ito remember, and they were all treated like snakes, a thing that you
first make use of and then kick. * This was not the treatment they
deserved. They were all fathers of families. They were all fill-up
pen, at any rate. {Laughter.) He begged to move a vote of thanks
to the Situation—a Situation whioh it was not too muoh to say, above
all other situations, was the situation—he said, this Situation—well,
he might not be muoh of a speaker, but he hadn't dined yet, and he
didn't mean to be laughed at. {Dead silence, in which the Speaker
joined.)
The Eclipse of the Moon, who spoke rather hazily, said it was his
privilege to second the proposal. He was not a very regular member,
but from circumstances over whioh he had no control he had lately
oome a good deal before the public The European Situation rather
resembled his own; it was cloudy—{laughter)—but the clouds had
not prevented his going on eclipsing, and he was sure that no clouds
however threatening, would prevent the European Situation, from
continuing to situate in a good old European way. (Loud cheers.)
The Weather and the Parks rose together, and as neither showed
any determination to give way, they spoke in unison. They begged
the indulgence of their friends, for taking a prominent part, but the
fact was that they (the Weather and the Parks) represented a large
number of kindred subjects—Primroses in Devonshire, Whirlwinds
at Kilburn, Blizzards, and a Remarkable Atmospheric Phenomenon
—and had been deputed to support the resolution.
A Bird did not want to interrupt the harmony of the meeting, but
he had made a nest in a Cat's cradle, and. he thought if they wanted
a situation that ought rather to suit them. It wasn't exactly
European, but it was precarious.
At this period some disturbance was oaused by the appearance of
the Irish Question, accompanied by Mr. O'Bheen 8 es.
Mr. O'Bkikn's es protested against this toadying to a mere
European Situation. They (Mr. O'Bkirh's es) didn't care a
button for the Situation. {Cries of" Question!" during which the Irish
Question put its thumb to its nose, and extended its fingers towards
Messrs. Shaoon and Bakespeare, who hadn't the slightest idea what
the disturbance was about.) On the Chair-Serpent endeavouring to
restore order, Mr. O'Bbxen/'s es called out. "What's that
anny way? Did ever ye hear of St. Pathriok now? {Loud cries of
"Order!")
The Sea Serpent said he was in a very painful position, as snakes
were not accustomed to chairs in private life. He was reluctantly
compelled to name Mr. 0'Brian's unmentionables, if they would
excuse the paradox. They were not on in this scene at all, and had
not a leg to stand upon.
The Speed of the Race Horse, and the Habits of Ants concurred,
and the intruders were bundled out.
The Gigantic Gooseberry, who was very warmly received, said it
was all very well to talk about the Silly Season, but for his part he
considered one paragraph about the wonders of nature, even if they
were purely imaginary the meant no disrespect to the Chair), more
interesting than a column of speeohes about what the speaker didn't
understand, addressed to listeners who didn't want to hear.
(Applause.) He supported the motion.
The vote of thanks was carried unanimously, and briefly acknow-
ledged by The Situation in a few well-chosen phrases, and the
company disappeared into oblivion for the Parliamentary Session—
except the guest of the evening, who is understood to be preparing
a surprise for the Special Correspondents.
ONE DEGREE BETTER.
"The honorary degree of Mua. Doc. is to be conferred
on Herr Joachim by decree of Convocation on Tues-
day."— Time j.
Some difficulty was experienced in fitting the
cap on the Herr. Afterwards, instead of simply

Scarcely assuaged by endless S-and-6's,

Bacchus and Barbarossa somehow blends,
Thor and the god of Thirst.
The oration ends,
And thunders of applause the Thunderer hail.

Which never faltered, never lisped or hung.
In weakness or in wandering. Mighty Vox.'
Strength of the lion, shrewdness of the fox,

Fust at its every utterance year by year,
Whether it lashed to pride or scourged to

Peaoe! But the "covert enmity" of hosts,
Who counter menaces and bandy boasts,
"Under the smile of safety wound the

With eye keen watchful, jaw prepared to

ROBERT AND CARL R03A.
Our "Robert" is an awful temper, that is if we may judge of it
by a brief and hurried note in penoil which he left at our office just
the last moment before going to press, and
then hurried off before any one could inquire
of him what he meant by it. We give the
note in extenso:—
"Just erd of advert, in Times, edded 1 Karl
Roser Oprer Kutnpny,' as sez, kwotin from
the Liverpool Hekker, 'Robert the D I'
(wieh I blush to menshun) 'at the Eort The-
ayter.' Then it goes on a praysin hevrythink
and hevryboddy, and speshully 'Maddum
Burnses fine singing of "Robert, O my beloved
Robert."" My better arf's horful hashy-
tatered about it. She asks me hoo's Maddum
Burns, and what she meens by singing of
"Robert, 0 her beloved Robert." Xkuseaste,
wioh is the konskenoe of urry an wurry, as I'm
orf to insult a Solister. More nex week on this
subjik. "Robert."

PLAY TIME."
"All work and no play makes Jack a dull hoy,"—and some works
and some plays 1 could mention would have the same effect on Jack,
for the matter of that,—and so a little play now and then, say an
occasional tragedy in four or five Acts, is just the thing to enliven our
poor, Jack who found the very thing in the dramatic sensation pro-
duced last week at the Opera Comique —need I say Mrs. Campbell
Praed's four-act drama of Ariane. The production of the work is a
sign of the times, and, whether good or bad, opens up a discussion,
on problems of dramatio Art and moral teaching, not easy of solu-
tion. But of this anon—or "in our next"—as it may chance.
Ariane! Who gave her that name? Mrs. Campbell Praed.
Whence came it? Evolved from her own inner consciousness—
Ariadne with the little "d" left out. Coming to know who and
what Ariane is, the name is happily chosen for its suggestion of
Greek humanism. For this English play—not yet to be correctly
described as " so English, you know"—is but a phase in the gradual
development of the Naturalism of the Age,—Naturalism not pure and
simple, but impure and complex. It is a powerfully interesting
drama, played by a set of characters none of whom are conscious of
their responsibility to any power, outside themselves, higher than a
legally authorised tribunal.
In this play, not to speak it profanely, "there is none that doeth
good, no not one,"—and yet who, that has any "knowledge of the
world," as the phrase goes, can doubt but that the authoress has
given us very real types of charaoter, and in order to prevent as far
as possible the objections of the English Pecksniffs aniPodsnaps,
and to suit the dish to Philistine taste, she has spiced it with an
artful dash of subtle foreign flavour by oalling her worst villain,—
the scoundrelly old father,—the Chevalier ae Valence, and the
second blackguard, the would-be co-respondent, Sir Leopold aVAcosta.
Bolder and worthier of her purpose would it have been, had Mrs.
Praed called her heroine's father and lover by plain English names.
Except that no one can help ohuokling at the manner of that
atrocious old reprobate,—the Chevaliei—admirably played by
M. Marics— there is nothing to relieve the sadness of the piece. Its
"Society " characters, who are merely accessories of the picture, talk
too like real "Society people" to be amusing, and, indeed, such
dialogue in the drama as is not essential to its aotion is tedious, and
this in proportion to the interest aroused in the spectator by the
acting of the principal characters. Mr. Leonard Boyne, in spite
of a slight Irish brogue,—hardly perhaps in keeping with his some-
what Italian Hebraic title "D'Acosta,"—is an intensely earnest
"lover" —profanation it is to use suoh a word for suoh a ohiracter!
For Mrs. Bernard Beere as Ariane—" not a moral woman, not a re-
ligious woman—I would I were!" she says of herself—I have
nothing but praise. Absolutely, her impersonation is faultless. I
can think of no Actress on the English Stage who could even rival
her in this sad, pitiful, miserable part. The Actress awakes our
compassion for Ariane in her trials, our sinoere regret that the life of
such a woman, who might have been so good and true, should have
been so utterly thrown away. Mrs. Beere's is a realistio perfor-
mance of the very highest order. And so too is Mr. Henry Neville's
impersonation of the sodden sot of a husband. I do not know in
whioh of the four Acts he is best, so excellent, without the slightest
exaggeration, is he in all. And the audience from, stalls to gallery
were with this poor wretoh of a husband, the viotim of |a eruel plot,
when he vowed amendment, implored forgiveness, and then turned
fiercely on the man who stood between him and his wife. But pace
the inevitable disoussion whioh must arise, and quite understanding
the objections to it, I like th« play, though I doubt if it will ever be
popular. What I do say. emphatically, is this, that any one who
wishes to seriously study the art of aoting, should see Mrs.
Bernard Beere, M. Marics, and Mr. Henry Neville, in Mrs.
Campbell Praed's Ariane.
It is difficult, though possible, to have too muoh of a good thing,
but I must return for one evening to The Winter s Tale at
the Lyoeum, beoause I read that our Mart Anderson is leaving us.
All, therefore, who want to see what Perdita ought to be—should
haste to the Lyceum. Who was it said that " the danoing on the
stage at present might be described as ungraceful or disgraoeful:
the merely graoeful has vanished,"—who said this? It has been said;
but there are some people who will see nothing and say anything,
and most oertainly as long as Mary Anderson can danoe as Perdita
at the rustio festival (it is all good every step of it), so long will there
be the very model of artless unstudied grace in danoing on the stage.
Never was there danoing so unstagey. The moral is, haste to the
Lyceum and, before she is off to America, oatoh our Mary on the hop.
Yours, Jack-in-the-Box.
EX-AUSTIN.
It appears from the Tablet that a Correspondent has paid a"visit
to Canterbury on the " courteous invitation" of Mr. W. J. Austin,
Surveyor to the Dean and Chapter (whioh he aooepted with " con-
siderable pleasure,") to inspeot "the recent find of bones supposed
to be those of St. Thomas of Canterbury." He writes that he was
ushered into a drawing-room where he found a complete human
skeleton "almost reverently laid out." "Almost,"—not quite,—
then the skeleton must have been laid out with something less
than reverence! Further, it appears that the "find of bones"
(" the find of bones!" ) was placed in a drawing-room "in old times
a hall." It has also transpired that the remains were at first laid in
the dining-room, where they must have been a veritable skeleton at
the feast. It is to be hoped that, to conoeal their suggestiveness,
they were not hidden amongst the oontents of the oellarette. If this
were indeed the case (and there is no limit to " less than reverence "),
the house of the Surveyor might be appropriately labelled for the
future, "Deoanterbury."
OPERA CROP PROSPECTS.
Is it because the West End cannot support two concurrent panto-
mimes, that Jack has cut down his Beanstalk in the Garden and left
Puss-in-Boots in possession of the Lane? Or is it that the stage of
Covent Garden Theatre is required at once for the extensive pre-
parations already occupying the mind of mighty Druriolanus, who,
t rejoices Mr. Punch's heart to hear, is bent on restoring the good
old times, and the good old tunes too, of Italian Opera,— Good: old
Operas "—as they used to be, when Pater Augusti Druriolani
ruled on the stage and Sir Michael Costa was King of the Winds
and Strings in the orohestra. Already first-rate names are announced.
"A" stands for Albani, always "A 1." and also for Arnoldson.

A»1 <^ r—
SIR CARDINAL AND THE BIG BIG "G."
MISERY AND ITS MEASURERS.
The Views of Jade Calliper, Operative out
of Employ.
"There is no doubt that different opinions are
entertained with reference to the extent of want of
employment, and of the distress which exists. Borne
allege tbat it is exoessive, and vast in its extent;
others that it is no more than is normal and inevit-
able in a great town with varying employment."
—Lord Uersehell, in introducing to LordSalisbury
at the Foreign Office a Deputation from Earl
Compton't Committee on the existing Distress.
Exceptional or normal? Well, you see,
I do not know that it much interests me,
That mighty question;
Tramping; long hours through London's frost
and mire
An " Unemployed,"—no work, no food, no fire,
I raise my plaint, and these great men—In-
quire,
Form deputations, talk, but no suggestion
Yet greets my ear
Of help immediate, practical and clear.
Clear! After reading all they say, I find
That rather more than ever my poor mind
Is in a muddle.
Perhaps 'tis cold and hunger makes me dense.
Words will not warm when chilled in soul and
sense
Sheltered by some dark entry, aroh, or fence,
Like birds in winter, half-starred creatures
huddle.
Or lounge and lurk
About this busy Babylon, "Out of Work."
I'm out, whoever's in—that fact is dear;
And careful " averages," I greatly fear,
Won't mend my trouble.
What is the "normal" quantum of distress,
That none need fuss about, I cannot guess.
Whether 'tis what now reigns, or more, or
less, [double.
The sum of last year's woe, or half, or
Hebschell may ask,
I have no heart, my Masters, for the task.
It may not be "exceptional," perhaps,
That many thousands of us labouring chaps
Can find no labour.
Goscuen may see in arithmetic quest
No end of " intellectual interest;"
I know there's misery in my own home-nest,
That in that misery I have many a neigh-
bour;
And that's enough
To make me siok of mere statistic stuff.
When Salisbury was out he held, I think,
That it was Government's duty not to shrink
From boldly tackling
This demon of Distress. Well, now he's in,
'Tis time the taokling business should begin.
But I suppose he finds—how "Outs" will
grin!—
That ties of office are a trifle shackling—
At least, it seems
He holds his own old promises wild dreams.
Then he "would do his utmost to promote"
Our views about relief works. Worth a
vote I—
But is he planning
Practical carrying out of those same views?
Nay, now 'tis quite another pair of shoes.
Countenance to heresy he must refuse,
And with a sneer he's down upon poor
Murirnfo,
Help on whose pattern
Would only do in Jupiter or Saturn.
There's no such difficult subject, so he says,
The Cardinal's "humanity"'s a craze.
To think of more law
Borrowed from counsellors who can't agree
Upon one single point, save that in Me
They have a difficulty,"—well, you see
How the sneer fits! Fall back upon the
Poor Law,
That blessed thing.
That to distress lends its most dreaded sting!
And Capital P And Caste? To seek the
cause
Of misery in cold hearts and callous laws,
Mere Mammon-clutching,
Sweaters and speculators, slaves of sport.
Dives who, lest the banquet-spree''
short, [Court
Stints e'en tne OTUmbs,—Cabinet, Churcu, tnd
Will tell us there be themes that won't tear
touching;
The State they'd fi>e.
No,—we'll " consult our colleagues,"we'll
"inquire."
Inquire, inquire, my Masters! And mean-
while
We in blank Misery 's face must stare, and
smile
Till inquest formal
Finds out if the Distress that racks our hearts
Means over-population, failing marts,
Our own unthrift, paupers from foreign
parts;
And whether, after all,'tis more than " nnr-
Who'd fear to fall [mal."
Crushed by a Curse that's "not excep-
tional?"
Whether we have a "natural right," or not,
To anything beyond our burial plot—
To life, or labour—
Our masters do not seem at all agreed,
Some hold that the sharp pinch of utmost
need,
Gives to the starving valid right to feed,
Some moral claim upon his happier neigh-
bour.
Others again,
Oppose the idea with all their heart—or brain.
"Headless and heartless!" cries the Cardinal;
Then on him tooth and nail the pundits fall;
He's "sentimental,"
A fault that caps all crime, and that must
bring
A " cataolysm" down on everything.
So to Sooiety's good our suffering,
Seems something absolutely incidental!
The Poor's impiety,
May one day doubt thy right, divine Society!
Thy right divine to tax our toil and tears,
For some unknown " infinity of years,"
Just to keep stable
Thy precious pyramid whose spreading base,
Is raised by the crushed helots of oar race;
Wealth crowns the lofty peak with gold and
grace.
Beware my Masters, lest, like a new Babel,
Headlong it fall,
When misery really gets "exceptional!"

AN IMPERIAL CATECHISM.
Intended for the use of the Myttificd Colonist.
Q. There has been in a recent number
of the Times, some stir created by a refer-
ence to the granting by Hkr Majesty of a
charter to the Organising Committee of the
"Imperial Institute." In the article dealing
with the subject, it was stated that the out-
come of the enterprise was held to be " the
knitting more olosely the ties which unite
the various parts of the Empire, and the
promoting its industrial and commercial in-
dustry!" Can you tell me what steps the
aforesaid Organising Committee have taken
to give practical effect to this desirable
result?
A. They have collected a good dale of
money, held several enterprising meetings,
cleared a site at South Kensington on which
they are about to ereot a red brick building,
with a large tower and rooms intended for
the reception of raw and other Colonial
produce, and passed some general resolutions
of a happy and hopeful, if of an airy
character.
Q. Quite so. Then you do not think,
though the Organising Committee are in
process of getting a Charter granted to the
Imperial Institute," that they have any
very definite idea of what sort of an under-
taking they are endeavouring to set upon
its legs.
A. No, I do not. I believe they entertain
some vague fancy that now and then an
occasional intending emigrant or Colonist

the " knitting more olosely the ties which unite the various parts of the Empire" that the
Organising Committee propose to effect.
A. No. Honestly, I cannot say that I think it will.
Q. But there is allusion made to " Special Exhibitions," which will be held at the Institute
annually, with a reference to the fact that " they ought to be made to pay for them-
selves" from the money taken at the doors. As the public will hardly crush in to look at a
few second-hand Colonial Maps and products, can you conceive what sort of an entertainment
the Committee have in their eye to propose, with a view to drawing a crowded audience f

AN EYE FOR PROPORTION.
"Comb in and have some Lunch, Professor. My Husband
WILL LEND YOU A PaIE OF TfiOUSBRS, IF YOURS ARE WET."
"My dear Mrs. Poyntz 1 Why, I'm twiob your Husband's
size!" "Two Pairs then!"
A. No. I own that the problem is one that has fairly pnzzled me.
Q. I am not surprised. Do yon think, however, they will again
have recourse to the Coloured Lights, Military Bands, and general
tea-garden attractions of the good old "South Kensington Ring"
times, or that, failing the outdoor accommodation for such a pro-
gramme, they will fall back upon some well-considered soheme, that
would at one and the same time maintain to a certain degree the
dignity of the Institute and yet tickle the public taste'?
A. Yes, now that I come to reflect upon the matter, I should say
they would decidedly do this, and probably inaugurate their experi-
ment with at least a series of appropriate dissolving views accom-
panied possibly by a oomio song or two for the purpose of investing
the whole with a little lively interest. They might even introduce
judiciously a little Nigger Minstrelsy,
Q. That is an excellent suggestion. May I ask what has induced
you to make it f
A. Certainly. I noted that the name of the Archbishop of York
figured prominently among those of the distinguished but hetero-
geneous crowd of gentlemen who constitute the Organising Com-
mittee. I naturally associated his Graoe with that sombre and re-
spectable form of reoreation thatisoharaoteristicof the dissolving view.
Q. And the introduction of the "comic song or two," and "the
little Nigger Minstrelsy." to which you referred?
A. Was inspired solely by seeing the name of the Lord Mayor,
Q. Quite so. You refer, however, to the names of the members of
the Organising Committee, and you have doubtless read some of them
with astonishment, if not with pleasure. Can you tell me, for
instance, why that of the President of the Royal Academy should
figure on the list P
A. No ; I cannot for the life of me imagine any conceivable reason
why it should.
Q. You do not recognise any oonneotion by which the discharge
of his functions as the acknowledged head of the artistic world in
the country marks him out specially as a fitting representative of a
soheme organised for the purpose of " knitting more closely the ties
whioh unite the various parts of the Empire "?
A. No; I most certainly do not.

Q. Then you regard the constitution of the Organising Committee
as a little bit "mixed"?
A. Yes, as I do their ideas of the undertaking they are orga-
nising as a little bit " muddled."
Q. And you do not look very hopefully on either the near or
remote prospeots of the " Imperial Institute "?
A. No, I cannot say that I do. I regard it in the present as a big-
sounding name, meaning nothing, to conjure with, and nothing more.
Q. And what effect do you think, when fairly started, it is
likely to have on the Colonist of the future.
A. I should say that, when fairly started, it would mystify him
considerably.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
No, no, Paul Patoff won't do after Marzio't Crucifix. It may or
may not compare favourably with Mr. Marion Crauford's other
novels with which I am unacquainted,
but it is a novel so distinctly inferior
in style and construction to Marzio't
Crucifix, that it might have been
written by a different hand. It
begins capitally, and the interest
of the story is well sustained up
to the discovery of ''my long lost
brother" without the strawberry
mark on his left arm"; but after this
it is. as it were, one long anti-climax.
Of Marzio't Crucifix you can, indeed
you must, read every line, but with
Paul Patoff the habitual novel-reader may take plenty of
in the way of skipping almost all the pages where he does not tee
any dialogue leading up to a situation. J. proves of dialogue, Pro-
fettor Cutter'8 opinion (whether it be the author's or not. I cannot
pretend to say) on "puns" might have pleased Dr. Samuel John-
son, but would not have been considered flattering by Shaxspeare.
A. mere pnnster who is perpetually punning in season and out of
season, is, of course, as great a nuisance as the stupid person who
has got by heart a considerable portion of Shakspeare's plays,
and who interrupts every conversation with inopportune quota-
tions; but such puns as Sheridan, Hook, Hood, and, m our
own time H. J. Byron could make, were mirth-moving, and
frequently the occasion of their utterance gave the word-play
all the condensed force of a neatly-turned satirioal epigram. "Those
who cry out against the play on words as an unnatural and affeoted
invention," says Schxegel on the Jeux de mott of Shaki'PEare,
"only betray their own ipnoranoe of_ original nature." The
characters, including this Professor, who is unintentionally a bore,
are not drawn with a Marion CRAUFORD-like touch, vigorous and
incisive, but are rather ordinary puppets from the stock-in-trade of
the professional novelist. They are not Craufordian figures, hut
common Marionettes.
The Author of By Virtue of hit Office, writes to say that he did
not make his Miss Verity claim to be the author of The Children's
Cry in one of Mr. Punch's numbers, but that when this young
lady blushingly owns the soft impeachment of having written some-
thing, at all events, in the particular issue alluded to in the novel,
she didn't mean The Children's Cry by one of Mr. Punch's dear clever
Boys, but the poem in which there was as much soul as in Browning's
Cry of the Children. I hope this is perfectly clear to somebody.
The second volume of the Henry Irving Shakspeare. whioh is
being issued bv Messrs. Blackte, is just out. Unfortunately I was
"just out" when it arrived, and could only glance at its contents
on my return to office. The illustrations by Gordon Browne seem
to me excellent compositions, dramatic but not theatrical. The
plentiful annotations, prefaces, histories, and explanations, are by
Mr. Frank Marshall, assisted by Mr. P. Z. Round, so that, as
Mr. Marion Crauford's Professor Cutter might say, "we have the
statements and facts duly Marshalled, and the result should be good
all Round."
I 'ye read two out of the Four Ohost Stories, by Mrs. Molesworth.
The first is commonplace; I've known the ghost of that old lady
in the lumber-room for years, but Mrs. Molesworth's description
of "brushing past a ghost on the stairs," suggests a new sensation;
otherwise it did not make my flesh oreep, as the immortal "Fat
Boy in Pickwick" said—(fancy a set of ghost stories by the Fat
Boy!)—and as to the second story,—well, 1 had heard it before. I
began the third Qhost Story last night, but the interest it aroused
up to the sixteenth page was not sufficient to keep me sitting up
to finish the tale. Just wait till I bring out my Haunted House
with ten Ohost Storeys and a Lift / that will make ynur hair
stand on end like quills—no, like steel pens in the "reversible pen-
cleaner," a most useful invention, by the way. More in my next,

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHAEIVAKI.

THE DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS.
THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.
(Before Mr. Commissioner Punch. )
A Newspaper Proprietor~introduced.
Commissioner. Well, Sir, what can I do for you P
Witness. I would ask you to assist me in amending the libel laws
C. Certainly, if they are unfair. But first, of what have you to
complain?
Jr. If you will allow me, I will tell you first what we [oonsider
just, and then what we feel to be unjust.
C. Ifyoi please?
W. We have not the slightest objection to any statute that really
protects the publio from unwarrantable and unjustifiable attaoks in
the columns of a newspaper. It is manifestly to the interest of
every journalist who has the dignity of his profession at heart, to
I lend every assistance to the crushing of really scurrilous publications.
C. Yes. And you think that the libel laws go further than this P
W. Unquestionably. Their present condition is such as to offer
| a direct incitement to unscrupulous and needy adventurers to com-
mence frivolous aotiong against respectably conducted journals, for
the obvious purpose of extorting black mail. Only the other day
one of the Judges remarked that this class of actions now formed
the most important branch of the work oarried on in the Courts.
C. I fancy Mr. Justice Manisty made that observation.
W. I think so, and Mr. Justice Day delivered himself of words to
the same effect. But these actions which come into Court form but
a fraction of the total number of proceedings either commenced or
threatened. In many instances proceedings are initiated by specu-
lative solicitors, who look for their reward in the costs they obtain.
It is a known tact that some of these gentlemen actually watch the
columns of various newspapers, with a view to ferreting out personal
allusions likely to be productive of libel proceedings.
C. Really! This is a most extraordinary statement.
W. But one that can be substantiated. There is a case on record
in which an action was actually commenced before any authority to
proceed had been given by the person alleged to be libelled.
C. I suppose this affects country papers more than London ones P
W. Possibly; for in the Provinces, where journalism (especially
in remote districts) is not so prosperous as in the Metropolis, a mere
threat of an action for libel has the most disquieting effeot. Many
a proprietor, sure of the justice of his cause, pays a sum down to
avoid further litigation.
C. But surely if he-persevered he would gain his cause, plus costs,
from the plaintiff who nad been so unwise as to sue him P
I W. But suppose that plaintiff is a man of straw, without a penny
I in his pocket, what remedy has the unfortunate defendant then P
| C. I see your point. Well, what do you suggest P
W. That matters may be made better by the passing of a Bill, in
troduced by Sir Algernon Borthwick, and which will come] on for
i Second Reading on the 28th of the present month.
C. What are the provisions of this measure P
W. 1. The extension of absolute privilege to accurate reports of
meetings or official notices, which it is right and proper should be
Wished. 2. The limiting of the sums to be recovered (when
neither malice nor gross negligence can be proved) to such damages
the plaintiff can show that he has really sustained by the publica-
of the libel. 3. The prevention of repeated actions for the same
and 4. The enlargement of the power of Judges to order un-
ions plaintiffs to nnd security for costs.
How about Criminal Prosecutions for libel P
. By this measure this would also be restricted, and a defendant
id be allowed to appear as a witness on his own behalf,
ft The proposed Act seems in every way reasonable. I hope it is
supported.
vol. xexv.
W. It is backed in the Commons by suoh representative men as
Mr. John Morley, Mr. Lawson, Mr. Jennings. Dr. Cameron, and
Sir Albert Rolltt. I am glad to say that Mr. Dwter Gray (a
distinguished member of the Nationalist party) is also giving the
measure a most cordial support.
C. Good I With suoh persons to back the Bill, it should be passed
without any difficulty. What can I do for you P
W. I should be very glad if you would kindly inform the publio
that Sir Algernon's measure does not in any way lessen the respon-
sibility of proprietors to keep their newspapers free from real libel;
but merely protects them from vexatious proseoution and conse-
quent black-mail.
C. I will see that the matter is mentioned in the proper quarter.
[The Witness, thanking the Commissioner for his courtesy,
then withdrew.
THREE VIEWS OF JUSTICE.
In England.—Prisoner before a Police Magistrate.
Prisoner. Please, your Worship, I wish to tell you that
Magistrate. Stop, I can hear nothing from you without warning
you that anything you say may be taken down in writing and used
against you at your trial.
Pris. But, 1 must insist that I really did do
Mag. No, no, I refuse to hear you! It is contradictory to the best
traditions of our law, that you should incriminate yourself.
Pris. But I insist that it was I who
Mag. Silence 1 I will not hear you! I tell you that you are
doing yourself harm. It is the aim of Justice to give every one in
England a chance of getting off, whether guilty or not guilty.
Pris. But it is not a question of guilty or not guilty. I frankly
Mag. Confess! The man must be mad!" Let him be removed.
In France.—Prisoner before a Jnge.
Prisoner. I can assure Monsieur that I am innocent.
Juge. Pig! Scoundrel! Liar!
Pris. But I am not a liar, for I say I did not commit the orime.
Juge. I will not hear you tell such a deliberate untruth! It is a
soandal—an infamy!
Pris. But, Monsieur, I protest
Juge. Did you not say when we dined together that'you had done
the deed P
Pris. No; Monsieur, a thousand times, no!
Juge. But I say a thousand times, yes 1 There was a shorthand
writer taking down your confession, concealed beneath the table.
Pris. Oh, my mother!
Juge. It is of no service to you to appeal to your mother! Your
mother has a scoundrel for her son!
Pris. Oh!
Judge. You need not weep—it will avail you nothing!
Prts. But at least tell me when I made this famous confession P
Judge. After you had taken four bottles of brandy, and were
attempting to wind up your watch with a corkscrew. Let him be
removed.
In Utopia.—Prisoner before a Representative of Common Sense.
Prisoner. To avoid expense and anxiety I wish to confess.
Representative. Certainly I will not stop you, if you are Buffering
from neither hysteria nor dementia.
Pris. I am perfectly sane, and was never calmer in'my life.
Pep. Have you witnesses who oan corroborate your statements P
Pris. Assuredly. But not only this, everything I did connected
with this sad affair was in the presence of third parties.
Pep. Very welL Let him be removed.
Mr. Punch's Congratulations to Two Rising Young Men.
Mr. Jeune, the well-known ecclesiastioal counsel, has "taken
silk." His persuasive addresses in Court were always delivered in
a taking silky tone. He is now Q.C., and will in future fill the
role of Fort Jeune Premier."
Mr. Montagu Williams is also a Q.C. His work at Greenwich in
relieving the sufferers during a time of exceptional distress, shows of
what excellent stuff this new Silk is made. .The poor in his district,
who may not have so far availed themselves of the School Board's
kind offices as to adapt Shaispearb to their purpose and say,

LENTEN DISCOURSES.
Among other valuable works for this penitential
ason is a treatise on Gout by Dr. Robson Roose,
which has already run through several editions—a feat
remarkable in a gouty volume—and soon there will be a
new truth in a re-adaptation of the old proverb, " Chacun
d fa Ooutte." Not the least useful are the foot-notes, as
might be expected, and if the rules herein given are rigidly
obeyed, any gouty subjeot of Her Gracious Majesty will
be cured of the malady in toe-toe. Diet is everything, or
nearly everything, and in order to keep this well before
his patients, Dr. Roose might start a set of Chambers for
Gouty Persons in the locality where " Scrubinda the
Fair" once dwelt, namely, "Dyott Street, Bloomsbury
Square"—if still existing. One cure, old-fashioned,
perhaps, but none the worse for that, the learned Doctor
has omitted, which is, in the words of the old song—
Punch cures the gout,
The colic and the phthisic.
In fact so efficacious has the remedy been in the last-
mentioned case that the latest dictionary marks the word
as " obsolete." When will the gout be obsolete P Sup-
Sressed gout, forsooth! suppress it altogether. Dr.
Iobson Roose's antigouty (or ain't-I-gouty!) menut are
becoming the order of the evening, and will supersede
all others, as, par excellence, "dinert d la lioote."

EXPERIENTIA DOCET.
The Vicar of Sheffield has been trying a new departure.' Having
interested himself in procuring work for the Unemployed, in order
to teat its quality he has taken a turn in the Stone-yard himself.
He appears not particularly to have relished the experiment, yet, as
a contemporary has pointed out, it seems to be one that might be
imitated with muoh advantage in many quarters. Fancy Lord
Salisbury, for instance, practically testing the working of the
Coercion Acts by passing twenty-four hours, with a plank-bed
thrown in, in an Irish gaol; or Sir Charles Warren, purposely
disguised as a Trafalgar Square loafer, summarily run in by one of
his own irrepressible underlings; or, for the matter of that, imagine
Mr. Gladstone boycotted in Ireland by mistake by his National
League friends, who, according to his teaching, don't know the
meaning of the word " outrage," and never have recourse to it at all.
The fact is, most men have a great deal to say upon matters con-
cerning which they have no sort of experience whatever. What
doe* " G.," the confident Timet Correspondent, know about the pre-
vailing distress? Precious little, at least the smaUness of the
quantity makes it precious. It is for the teaching and enlightening
of such outsiders that the recent conduct of the Vicar of Sheffield
calls for special commendation. For his turn at the Stone-yard he
deserves the best thanks of all those who are earnestly interested in
finding some practical solutions for the many staggering and per-
plexing questions that are just now occupying public attention.
A NOTE AND A QUERY.
There were three first-rate speeches on the occasion of the
Theatrical and Musioal Sick Fund Dinner at the Metropole last
Wednesday, as there could not very well help being, with young Mr.
Lawson, M.P., in the ohair, and Mr. Sala and Mr. Edmund Yates on
their legs. We quite agree with the general sentiment there ex-
pressed, that all these Theatrical and Musioal Funds should be
amalgamated in "one great whole." At present it appears there is
one very great hole—in the purse of this particular charity, whose
funds, according to the Chairman, are at a very low ebb.
We trust that "a meeting like this" will "make amends,"
and mark the Turn of the Tide. There is only one question,
whioh we ask in no carping spirit, with regard to all oharitable
banquets, and that is, Is a "big feed" absolutely neoessary to
insure attendance, donations, and subscriptions P It is, of course,
'so English, you know." But would it not be a custom "more
honoured in the breach than the observance," and would not an
afternoon or evening gathering, with popular Chairman and Speakers
in their places, cost far less, and then the money which would
otherwise have been spent on the eating and drinking should of
course go to replenish the coffers of the fund r Is the argumentum
ad itomachum essential P It ought not to be. Are there no other
means by whioh a still more satisfactory result may be obtained,
except by these fare methods P

QRANDOLPHIAN RUMOURS.
Culled from the Continental Press.
_ Lobs Randolph Churchill and the Czar.—Still farther revela-
tions are now forthcoming which put the nature of the great free-

Grandolph wandering.
handed English politician's negotiations at St. Petersburg beyond a
donbt. Russia giving the signal by taking Vienna by a coup de
main, a combined Anglo-Russian Fleet will bombard Constantinople,
and several Mediterranean ports. This will bring Germany into the
field, and give Franoe her chanoe to cross the frontier. She will be
assisted in this by England, who throwing 250,000 men into Belgium,
and as many more as she can spare into the Baltic provinces, will
wheel down on to Berlin from the North. A re-division of Europe
will be the result, in whioh half of Germany and the whole of the
Balkan States will disappear altogether, ilia Lordship has not yet
communicated his scheme to Lord Saxisbdby, but he is confident
that, though not exaotly on the lines of his traditional polioy, he will
"talk him into it" in less than ten minutes.
Lord Randolph Churchill and thh Grand Llama of
Thibet.—The distinguished English statesman, it is now confi-
dently reported, met the great Asiatio potentate, who happened to
be paying a visit the other day to Moscow in disguise. An animated
conversation is said to have ensued, in whioh the Irish question, in
whioh the Llama appeared to take a lively interest, the last Report
of the London School Board, the overland route to China, and the
booking for the Drury Lane Pantomime were exhaustively discussed.
On his Lordship promising to secure the Llama a good engagement
at the Westminster Aquarium in the event of his ever paying a visit
to London, the latter undertook to settle the little difficulty that has
recently arisen at Sikkim, and the meeting terminated on both sides
with an expression of the most oordial sentiments.
Lord Randolph Churchill, and the Reno op the Cannibal
Islands.—The clever and enterprising British diplomatist was intro-
duced to His Majesty yesterday, and the interview is said to have
been in every way satisfactory, the King, on the conclusion of the
palaver, insisting on investing the distinguished statesman in
question with a collar of human noses. A commercial treaty,
granting reciprocal advantages, inoluding the right of natives to
nave the free run of the southern shores of the Isle of Wight, where
they shall be at liberty to devour each other, the local Coastguard,
or other inhabitants, was rapidly drawn up, and Lord Randolph
warmly expressed his confidence that the Premier would sanction
its signature with cordial enthusiasm.
Lord Randolph Churchill and the President of the
French Republic.—It is thoroughly understood in well-informed
oiroles that the meeting of the brilliant ex-Cabinet Minister and Pre-
sident Carnot has led to the happiest results. An offensive and
defensive alliance, the cession of the Channel Islands, the neutrali-
sation of Malta, and the evaouation of Egypt are said to have
been the prominent items of a treaty whioh Lord Randolph had no
hesitation in assuring the French Government he .could get Lord
Salisbury at any moment to accept. Though speculation on the
subjeot is still rife, the youthful statesman is said to have expressed
himself, both publioly and privately in all circles, with such
thorough assuranoe in reference to it, that no surprise is expressed
on the Bourse at the continued downward tendency of all foreign
securities.
Lord i Randolph Churchill and the Pope. —His Holiness
yesterday granted an audience to the young English statesman, and
after an interview that, report says, lasted five hours and a half, was
pleased to express himself as highly gratified with the result. It is
understood that a couple of Nunoios will forthwith be appointed to
St. James's, and that a British representative will be sent to the
Vatican. It appears that His Lordship assured, in turn successively
thirty-seven Cardinals, on whom he subsequently called, that if
Lord Salisbury did not immediately "see" the arrangement, on it
being explained to him, he would undertake to make him do so
"in two twos."
Lord Randolph Churchill and the Shah.—The interview
whioh was of a most interesting oharaoter, came ofi to-day, His
Majesty stipulating partly in baa French and partly through an
interpreter, that, in consideration of his undertaking certain
obligations in regard to Russian action in Afghanistan, Lord Ran-
dolph should open negotiations with the Alhambra Company,
Limited, with a view to the despatch of their entire corps de ballet to
Teheran by an early mail. It was also understood that in the event
of the Shah paying a visit to London in the course of next year, and
there being some difficulty about putting him up again at Bucking-
ham Palace, his Lordship should arrange to hire the Agricultural
Hall or some other suitable building affording the required ac-
commodation for His Majesty and his attendant suite. Lord Ran-
dolph having received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Blue
Hyaena in paste, and assured His Majesty that it would be "all
right" with Lord Salisbury, who had given him carte blanche to
aot as he thought best, then withdrewiin boisterous spirits, and the
interview, that had been characterised throughout by a great deal of
good-humoured badinage, abruptly terminated.
A subsequentfreport announces that His Lordship was also about to
visit the Chief Archimandrite, the Emperor of Brazil, the Ring of
the^BELOiANS, the Sheik-al-Islam, the Ex-Khedive, Mwanga, the
Ameer of Afghanistan, Prince Bismarck, and the Sultan of
Morocco; and that, owing to his exuberant intellectual aotivity,
and boundless confidence in his ability to twist the present British
Cabinet round his little finger, the liveliest interest was already mani-
fested in the diplomatic outcome of the various projected interviews,
the details of which will no doubt be forthcoming in a later edition.
BONNY DUNDEE!
New Version, as sung by Lord S-l-sb-ry.
Before the Election.
To the Dundee Electors our General spoke: -
"Ere the Queen's crown goes down I will strike a good stroke;
And let every man who loves Union and me,
Poll for General Daly at Bonny Dundee.
Then up with Coercion, and down with the Plan!
Let every true Voter do all that he can;
Send Firth to the right-about-faoe, and put me
At the top of the poll, boys, in Bonny Dundee!"
After the Election.
Hurrah I Their majority's down by a fourth I
There are Unionists, Gladdy, you see, in the North,
More than four thousand of them, my Gladdy, you see,
Have followed our Standard at Bonny Dundee.
Then up with the Crimes Act, and down with the Plan!
E'en the Soots are deserting their own Grand Old Man.
Ah 1 tremble, false Rads, in your premature glee,
You have not seen the last of my Tories and me.
A LIBERAL UNIVERSITY APPOINTMENT.
We see that W. S. Lilly, the Huxley-tackier in the Fortnightly
Review, has been appointed by the Cambridge Senate one of the
"Lightfoot" Examiners. We do not wish to paint the Lilly, but
really he must be a most accomplished gentleman, unless we mis-
understand the nature of his new duties. "Lightfoot Examiner"
must surely be a Terpsichorean Professor, who examines those
Undergraduates who are studying for the ballet as a profession. Or,
§erhaps Lightfoot is a " derangement" of syllables, and it ought to
e "Footlight" Examiner, who would have to set the papers for
suoh A.D.C. Cantabs who may be thinking of going on the Stage.
Will Girton follow suit, and appoint Madame Kattie Lanner as their
Lightfoot Examiner, and " The Jersey Lily" as the Footlight Pro-
fessor? Clearly, steps in the right direotion. But we 're progressing
by leaps and bounds nowadays.

THE 'SLOGGER."
'Twas the voice of the " Slogger." I heard him exolaim,
"Is there no one in England who 's clever and game P"
As the lion aroused, from
his lair stalking forth,
So he threw up his head and
snorted with wrath.
"Just one big triumph
more; then to rest at my
leisure.
How happily living in
feasting ana pleasure
I'd pass all my time, but
I'm now foroed to train,
Why tempt me with flat-
tery, weeds, and cham-
pagne?"
I journeyed to" Windsor,
and saw in his suite
Every manner of man bow-
ing down at his feet:
Where he goes a triumphal procession is made:
"Though in train, not in training," says I, "I'mafraid."
I paid him a visit, for I thought, "While I can.
I '11 endeavour to see this most marvellous man.
He told me his hopes, his exploits in the ring;
And thought a " pug" far better off than a king.
Then thought I, "Well, from this I a moral oan glean.
What that hero's now, why might I not have been P
If my parents had trained me for combat, not clerking,
I'd be fighting and feasting, not starving and working."
A WORD IN SEASON.
That Charles Drams, the British Sailor's Poet Laureate, should
lack a suitable Memorial, that his modest and little-known tomb,
even, should be in danger of disturbance and desecration, are things
shameful in themselves, and doubly disgraceful to a country whioh
professes at least, like the lass in a song, to " love a sailor." Every
wind that blows would breathe the shame abroad, did England allow
it to be perpetuated. But only "lubbers and swabs" could con-
tentedly contemplate such a scandal.
"Since he died in honour's cause,
'Twas all one to Jack,"
was the characteristic sentiment of one of Dibpin's typical tars,
a sentiment which, like enough, Debdht would have shared. But 'tis
not all one to John, whether the remains of his favourite Sea Singer
are treated with honour or dishonour. On Dmoor's gravestone in
the cemetery of St. Martin's, Pratt Street, are the following lines
from his own often sung, ever-applauded " Tom Bowling" .—
"His form was of the manliest beauty,
His heart was kind and soft;
Faithful below he did his duty,
And now he 'a gone aloft."
Yes, Charles Dlbdin "did his duty," in a fashion that laid sea-
girt England under an eternal obligation. Now let England do hers!
SEVEN HUNDRED A YEAR,
A Ballade for the Hesitating Bachelor.
Would you ride in trim Hansoms, and go to the stalls,
Oive your nice little dinners, indulge in champagne,
Accept all your invites; show at crushes and balls,
In the Morning Post s columns perhaps see your name?
Would you friends with the style of your mSnage impress,
Keep a good set about you, hear people admit,
That your wife is a woman who knows how to dress,
And conjecture she costs you an average bit P
You may manage this somehow 1 But this is quite dear,
That you won't do it on Seven hundred a year!
But should you to fair Tooting, or Hackney, or Bow,
Steer your course and avoid all Society's rooks;—
The gay omnibus use, and the theatre but know,
As revealed from the gloom of the mild upper box:
Not mind the cold mutton, get your clothes ready made,
Oo to Margate in June when you yearn for the sea,
And regale all such friends as your household invade,
In the limits afforded by five o'clock tea:
You may plunge 1 Take a wif e; faoe the goal without fear I
You '11 not fail—if you boast Seven hundred a year!
PLAY-TIME.
The axe, the hatchet, and the pruning-knif e have been at work at
the Haymarket, and Partners—
our advice, be it remembered, was
"Change Partners "—has been
improved, as we are informed,
almost off the faoe of the earth.
Mr. Gkrman-Christmas-Tb.ee
has been reduoed to a shrub, a
rum shrub, and as the other
parts gain by his loss, an audi-
ence has no longer to accept "the
part for the whole," and so may
find more variety in the enter-
tainment than there was before.
But when all 'a said and done—
and of course there is even less ymte
said and done than at first—Partners can never be a good play, and
there's an end of it.
Evidently there are some Managers who are so 'umble as to take
critical slashing cheerfully, and profit by the process. Within the
last two months Frankenstein and Partners were slashed—a slashed
doublet—and straightway the Managers bowed to superior judgment,
made some alterations, and then by judioiously letting the critics
know that their invaluable suggestions had been adopted—highly
flattering; this to the Critical Faculty — the astute Managers


Criticism is not beneficial P Only it rather unsettfes the faith of the
public in their guides, if one day they read that a piece is "in-
trinsically bad," and that " the sooner it is off the stage the better,"
and then within the next three weeks they hear of the same piece
that "it has now been worked up, and goes capitally," or con-
siderable alterations have been made, and the piece, as now repre-
sented, is likely to have a long run." Why not do away with
premieres altogether, except for the critics, who, each individually,
deliver his written judgment as to whether the piece was a dish to
be set before King Public or not, and if not, what alterations would
make it so? Then criticism might do some good. The premiere
should be heard in camera, and one week at least should elapse
before it was brought before the Supreme Court of Final Appeal,
the Public. There are a great many objections to this plan, which 1
have not time nor space to consider now.
Mr. Toole re-appeared on Saturday. There was joy in
King William Street when "Johnnie oame marching home,"—
although perhaps a trifle halting—" Dot and go one —after his
severe attack. Never mind an occasional halt, as long as he stops
where he is, and is as droll as ever.
I paid a seoond visit to Ariane, and see no reason for modifying
in the slightest degree the favourable opinion I expressed last week.
I have seen it stigmatised as an " immoral play." A play is not
immoral unless in some way or other it makes vice attractive. Had
the dialogue in this piece been as brilliant as that of the School for
Scandal, and had the death of the husband set Ariane free to marry
the would-be co-respondent, and live'happily ever after, then, indeed,
the piece would have been justly styled immoral." As it is, how-
ever, the wretched set of dramatis persona lead a miserable ex-
istence, and two of them come to a wretched end. I should like
Mrs. Campbell Praed to omit two short speeches, of whioh one is in
questionable taste and absolutely unnecessary. I should also like
Ariane to "die and make no sign." Her last words are, I admit,
consistent with the character of her life, but here, I contend, that
silence would indeed have been golden. Let me recommend everyone
to see The Ticket of Leave Man, at the Olympic, not for the sake of
the aoting generally, but of Mr. Wlllard particularly. His disguise
and his assumption of character in the Seoond Act are admirable.
Mrs. Stephens is as old and as good as ever—not a day older—and
Mr. Smedlet Yates makes the most of that highly absurd and
old-fashioned comic character Green Jones, in fact makes him a very
bright Green Jones.
Suggestive of A Cell.—Some of the Members who have been
entertained at the expense of the country seem to be anxious to
appear in the House of Commons in prison costume. The idea was
anticipated some time since in the streets, where sandwich men were
employed to advertise certain pieces by appearing in the garb of
convicts. Thus the notion is not new. Besides this, will they not
be suspected of drawing the long-bow when they begin to speak, if
they are found wearing marks of the broad-arrow P
Historical.—When was England a real Sporting Country?—
When the entire Nation had one great Bet on the throne.

edition of her husband's Arabian Nights, prepared for household
reading by Justin McCarthy, M.P., has now appeared. Sir Rich-
ard's edition is the " Strong Burton" not for household consump-
tion; while the Lady Isabel's is "Burton drawn mild," pure in

quality and clear as unclouded amber. The "Terminal Essay,"
which being unadulterated Burton treble, or rather Basso-profondo,
must have made My Lady shudder and Justin McCarthy clear his
glass, is especially interesting, discussing as it does the date and
origin of the Tales, and giving a panegyrio on Al-Islam which will
afford Canon Isaac-Taylor—the eoolesiastical Sartor Resartus—
orientally inclined, some considerable insight into Mohammedanism,
which may be of use to him at the next English Church Congress.
H. E. Cardinal Manning will be pleased to find that Mohammed,
besides abolishing the use of wine and denouncing gambling, was
"the first to establish a poor-rate."
In the Second Volume of the Henry Irving Shakespeare. Mr.
Frank Ma mm at.t. has " warbled his foot-notes," not " wild," and
certainly not "tame," but carefully considered, and most welcome
to the critical student and to the uninstructed casual reader. Of
these notes I prefer those on the historical plays in this volume to
those on the Comedies, among which latter is to be reckoned, according
to Mr. Frank MA»«wiT.T.—who is always most frank—The Taming
of the Shreto, a work that in the opinion of " F. M. the Duke," is
not "an outrageous farce." Isn't it? Read the "business" of the
scene, and then imagine all that must be done on the stage besides
what is set down. In action it is a rough-and-tumble farce, which
no doubt a considerable portion of a sixteenth century audience,
accustomed to bear-fights and brutalities, were quite capable of
appreciating.
F. M." terms the repartee between Petruchio and Kate, Act ii.
So. 1, "bright and lively." Well, perhaps it was so considered in
Shakspearian and Jonsonian (not Johnsonian)
days, when punning was a fashion; but at
the present time such word-playing would
be as dull to a nineteenth century audience
as would be the horse-play, except when in-
troduced in its legitimate place, a pantomime.
As a comment on Mr. Marshall's opinion,
two-thirds of the lines in this scene are
marked (in this edition) as to be advan-
tageously omitted in representation. The
play is farcical, with the exception of
Katherine's speech in the last Act; but
perhaps it was altogether quite up to the
mark of the enlightened audience for whom
it was intended, namely, Sly the Cobbler,
who drops off to sleep during the very first
scene, wakes up once, and is then " in the arms of Porpus " till the
conclusion of the play, when he is supposed to be taken away and
put to bed.
Mr. Gordon Browne's illustrations have the great merit of
being dramatic, and untheatrioal. The Dance of Clowns in the
Midsummer Night's Dream is conceived in a truly humorous
Bpirit. F. M.'s notes to Richard the Second—a play full of
strikingly beautiful passages—are excellent, especially the one on
the awfully tragic scene of the death of Cardinal Beaufort, who, as
a matter of historical fact, made a truly Christian end. But genius
is above history, and such stubborn things as facts must be kicked
out of the way for genius to have its true course. If Shakspiabi
had sacrificed a grand dramatic effect to plain unadorned truth, the
world would have been deprived of this great scene in Richard the
Second. Once more our congratulations to the Frankest of Frank
Marshalls for Volume Two. "We're a getting on," quoth, still
at your service, The Baron de Book Worms.

(Virginibus puerisque.)
"Why, Toby, you look like a Cherub 1" "What is a Cherub?'
"Oh—a Cherub is a—a—a sobt of converted Cupid I"
SOMETHING FISHY!
[The Story of a Great Success.)
The Statesman sat in his study pondering over the difficult problem, the
solution of whioh had been the cause of his expatriation.
"What shall I do?" he asked himself. "I cannot disagree with both, and I
refuse to agree with neither. What shall I do f"
He looked at his glass, crowded with cards of invitation to banquets. "They
are all over," he murmured. "My task is done! Not one left! and here am 1
alone I Here am I. with my seat in the House vacant, for am I not far away,
and unable to fill it?"
Then he touched a bell, and requested that the Representative of the Dominion
should be brought before him. The Representative, obedient to his call, appeared.
"My good friend," said the Statesman, clasping the other's hand, "you
know how I feel for you, how anxious I am to serve you, how I would, theoreti-
cally, saorifioe the last drop of my life's blood to protect your interests."
The Representative wiped away a tear. It was very touching! Painfully
touching I
"Best and bravest of men!" exclaimed the Representative, when he had
mastered his emotion. "We know your value. We weloomed you as the
defender of our liberties. We regard you as the sweet pledge of affection sent
to us by the dear Mother Country, which shall bind us to her with bands of steel."
"Nay," said the Statesman, gently, "do not speak of steel—brass is more
appropriate. And now let me hear von urge your case once more."
Then the Representative repeated the arguments that had already been pro-
duced. He showd conclusively that it was a matter of life and death that the
Dominion should not give in—that the future of a mighty people depended upon
a firm front and victory.
"Your eloquence unmans me," cried the Statesman. "All you say seems so
true, so very true."
"It is indeed," was the rejoinder. "Ah, it was a happy hour for us when
you were chosen for our arbitrator. We know that everybody wanted you in
England; that all our fellow-subjeota beyond the seas parted with you with the
greatest reluctance; that every moment of your absenoe was grudged to us!
Oh, it was kind, good, unselfish of the dear Mother Country to spare you—to
allow you to come to us!"
"It was indeed," admitted the Statesman, and then
he pondered once more, knitting his brows and burying
himself in deep thought. Deep thought I The very
deepest I
"And you tell me that the fate of your adopted oountry
depends upon my decision?" he asked, at length.
It does indeed," was the reply.
"You say that the other side will not give in?"
An affirmative was again the answer.
"Eureka!" the Peacemaker oried, after a pause; "I
have it! If the Government of the United States will
not give in, there is but one way out of the difficulty. If
they won't give in, you must I"
And handing the Representative a faded orchid as a
memento of his visit, the Statesman wiped the tears from
his eyeglass and started for Europe!
COMING TO THE POINT.
Palmam qui meruit ferat! Of course
That maxim, when read with the caution that's proper,
Applies with exceptional force to the Force.
Punch has often to cry " good as gold is the1 Copper,'"
But when his peouliar metal seems brass,"
And when he indulges in lies and foul lingo,
And shows he's a bully as well as an ass,
The Public gets doubtful, and Punch ories Distinguo!
An Endacott is not for ever a joy
(Though cooky might deem him a true thing of beauty).
And though Wabren swears, "I believe you, my Bloy,'
Unquestioning faith is not Punch's sole duty.
His business is into the truth to inquire.
Remember one thing—it will spare much disastt r —
That is, your Policeman is rather like fire—
"A very good servant, but very bad master I"
"AGAIN, WE COME TO THEE, SAVOY I"
A bright little Operetta, called Mrs. Jarramifs Genie,
the music by the Brothers Cellieb, has been added to
the programme of the Savoy with good results. The
plot is not very novel, and strongly suggests one of the
oest of the German Reed's Entertainments, The Indian
Puzzle; but for all that the trifle is amusing. Perhaps
the best aoted character in the Operetta is Ben-Zoh-Leen,
a part which seems to suit Mr. John Wilkinson down
to the ground, or rather under it, as the Genie is supposed
to have had a rise in station when he became connected
with the Jarramie household. His parlour magic was
most amusing, and, after a song descriptive of a parlia-
mentary career, his exit, although evidently modelled on
"the Teapot Shuffle" of Tea-Cup-and-Soroerer Gbos-
smith, was decidedly funny.
The Operetta is a trifle light as air, but quite suffi-
cient to raise the wind, and give that extra puff to the
sails of H.M.S. Pinafore, refitted, and thoroughly sea-
worthy, that is, well worth seeing, of whioh Captain
D'Oyly Carte evidently thought the good old ship
—("Good Old Ship" suggests Brighton, also Bacon and
8hakspeabe !)—stood in need. Another season will pro-
bably elapse before a new vessel is launched from the
dookyard of the Gilbert and Sullivan works.
"LEG BEFORE WICKET."
"... Whether any undue advantage rests with the batsman
or with the bowler under the existing laws of cricket, and, if so,
what steps should be taken to remedy this defect."

Dr. Punch hastens to BUggest an obvious "remedy.'

Bradlaugh " wants to know."
Might have judiciously stayed away, as Hartlngton did. But
there he was, and must needs come to assistance of his friends, the
victims of Pabnell's successful strategy. This brought down upon
him a personage more wrathful even than Don Diego Picton.
Business before House precisely of that pettifogging character to
stir the lowest depths
of G. 0. M.'s nature.
Quite dangerous to sit
near him as discussion
went on. Leaned ex-
citedly over John Mob-

be done that way.
Turned round with
lightning speed, seized
coat-tails of retreating
statesman, pulled him
baok on bench. Finally rose to pulverise Henry James. What
a glorious ten minutes he had; his eyes flashing fire, his figure
trembling with indignation, his voice breaking through the toils of
weakness, and his right hand passionately smiting the palm of the
left, as if he had literally got his old colleague in Chancery, and was
making the most of the opportunity. Pabnell looked on with
mingled, admiration and disappointment.
"Picton's very well," he said, "but this should have been our
Don Diego." Business done.—Privilege Debate.
Tuesday.—Peter O'Bbien, yesterday a hero, to-day a disregarded
nonentity. If Members accidentally'catch his eye, they wonder why
he is not in prison and out of the way.
"I think, said Wilfrid Lawson to Joseph Gillts, "there was
a little too much fuss about it. As Balfour says, when an Irish
Member is to be arrested what matter whether it happens to be
Gilhooly or O'Brien? In these days, when we are hardly rid of
the Shaxspeabe-Bacon controversy, it is a little hard to have a
Gilhooly-O'Brien debate."
"I don't know muoh abont Shakspeare," said Joey B., with
engaging frankness; "but as to bacon I'm oh revore, as they say
at Parry. I don't see what it's got to do with the arrest of
O'Brien."
Trevelyan resumed debate on Address; brought "up'Saundebson,
who had real good time for space of an hour. Wasn't a head peeped
out anywhere from beneath the tents of the enemy opposite, but—
Whirroo 1—the Colonel's shillelagh came down on it. Gladstone
dancing mad on Front Opposition Bench. Parnellites worked up to
oondition that made them capable of something like 'a howl; faint
eoho of habitude before days of regeneration, out still encouraging
and hopeful for the future. T. W. Russell attempted to give
serious aspect to conversation by delivering carefully prepared
address, very good of its sort: smote the Parnellites hip ana thigh,
but occasionally turned round and gave a slight rap at Government.
"Russell," said David Plunket, whom every one is glad to see
back in renewed health, "reminds one of a phrase they have in the
North of England. When a man has had a drop too much and goes
rolling home, they say he 'has business on both sides of the road.'
Russell, staggering along under the weight of his argument and his
advocacy, may be said to nave business on both sides of the House."
Business done.—More debate on Parn ell's Amendment to Address.
Ash Wednesday, so didn't meet till Two o'clock, hours of sitting
being thus reduced to four. Ellis (J. E.) and Klng-Harman appro-
priated between them two hours and a half.
"A little long, weren't you?" A kf.rs-Douglas hinted.
"Longer than usual, perhaps," said King-Harm an. "But now
I'm going to have a salary, I shall have to show I earn it."
Herbert Gladstone agreeably astonished House by capital speech,
admirably delivered. Been shut up during recent years on Treasury
Benoh, but has practised in the country, and suddenly blossomed
into experienced debater. Something to say, and said it well, with
free gestures and fine voioe. Young Stafford Northcote, passing
out behind Speaker's Chair, paused and stared in amazement. He
and Herbert had started Parliamentary life together. Their maiden
speeches delivered on same evening from opposite sides of House,
with distinguished and delighted fathers, sponge in hand, ready to
give each a knee after the final round.
"And now," said young Nobthcote, "he's commanding the
listening Senate, and I'm not even a Surveyor-General of the
Ordnance." Business done.—More debate on Address.
Thursday.—O'Brien just finished his'three months of Balfoub at
Tullamore. To-night Balfoub has
hour and forty minutes of O'Brien at
Westminster. Diflioult to say which
the harder to bear. O'Brien in tre-
mendous force. At last

way through the torrent, but, as Joseph uit.lis observed, the smile
was rather "gashly." House, with its appetite whetted, wanted the
finishing touch given to the drama by Balfour rising to reply.
But, on the whole, he thought he would wait, and crowded assembly
broke up.
Habcoubt affected almost to tears. "Come.GoRST,"
he said to the Under-Secretary for India, sitting on
the Treasury Bench studying new Rules of Procedure
just out, "you must admit that that was a fine touoh
in the last sentence, where he lifted up his voioe,
and blessed Balfour and his policy."
"Yes," said Gorst. "Reminds me of one
of Marryat's stories — Peter Simple, I
think; or is it Percival Kean f Anyhow,
there is an angry bat converted Bo'sun in

the error of his ways, now, when he wants

now, O'Brien, with uplifted hand, and
through clenohed teeth, blessed our brave
Balfoub."
Business done.—Debate on Address.
Friday.—Bubble of peaceful Session burst to-
night. Exploded under feet of Goschen: nearly
shattered him. A few tendencies in that direction
all through the evening. When G. 0. M. sat down
after speech two hours long, Irish Members, leaping
to their feet, stormed around him in jubilant en-
thusiasm. Seemed enough for one night. But
when he came back after dinner, there was another
enthusiastic reception. Ten minutes later came the
news of Liberal victory at Southwark, and this
time the whole Opposition were on their feet, cheering, waving
hats, and clapping hands.
G. P. Fuller Laughed to see' suoh fun, and Goschen wished he

The Bethell Case.—Poor little child of Tee-poo, alias _.
Mr. Justice Sterling decided against1 its claims, which somehow
doesn't sound like sterling justice. Had it come before three Judges
who had taken the same view, there might have been good ground
for appeal on account of ecclesiastical bias on the part of the Judges
who had been unanimous against a "Little Bethell"—nemine

Sir,—Any impartial reader who has followed the con-
troversy that has recently taken place in the columns
of the Times, between Canon Routledge and Father
Morris on the nature of the blows inflicted on the head
of St. Thomas, must admit that in his latest rejoinder
the worthy Canon has decidedly the advantage of his
ingenious opponent. "Let him," asks the Canon,
bringing: matters to a practical teBt, "try the experi-
ment on some one,—not with a sword," he considerately
adds, "but with a stick." That this is what the Canon
has been doing, and has probably had a Yerger, or
perhaps even the Dean himself, down "on the flat of
his stomach," as the Saint was said to have been, and
has been whacking .vigorously at his head, there can
be no sort of doubt. For he relates his experience
under the circumstances, adding that anybody who
makes a similar attack, will find that a blow aimed
vertically at the crown of the head would glance down
either the right or the left side."
This appeal to practical experiment for verifying
antiquarian theory nas struck me as most happy, and,
taking quite a morbid interest in the late controversy,
I have already _ acted several times on the Canon's
spirited suggestion, and have felled in turns my grand-
mother, the butler, two unoles, and a tax-collector with
an umbrella, with varying results; yet though I have
always aimed the blow "vertically," to the best of my
ability, at the crowns of their respective heads, I cannot
ray that in all cases I have succeeded in hitting them.
Hence my experience has been hitherto somewhat in-
conclusive, but I am hoping that a few more chance
trials will afford me an opportunity of perfecting it.
Meantime, I shall be interested in noting whether
Father Morris acts upon the Canon's hint. I have no
doubt, could he persuade his superior, or even a lay
brother or two, to let him "go for" their heads with a
hockey stick, he might throw to much light upon the
matter as to considerably modify the rather limited
view to which he has as yet. as far as I have interpreted
his letters, confined himself in relation to it. Trusting
we shall hear still something f urtherf rom him,—I am, Sir,
your obedient servant, A Practical Antiquarian.

PLAY-TIME.
I "suggested last week a course (to which I admitted there were
many objections) for ameliorating the generally unhappy conditions
of theatrical premieres. By presenting plays first to an audience of
experts, many of the otherwise inevitable disadvantages of First
Nights might be avoided. An excellent oritioal confrere, who is one
of those whom Matt Arnold styles, "the young lions of the Daily
Telegraph," roars with laughter at this notion of mine as .being
"curious and comical."
Perhaps so: yet what, in their original intention, were "private
views," in artists' studios, of the pictures before they left the easel,
but appeals to critical judgment, professional and amateur, so that
any defects might be remedied, previous to their appearance on the
walls of the Academy, Grosvenor, or elsewhere P Mind, I don't say
that this was the only private view that occurred to the artists who
initiated the idea. Have I not been present at genuine " private
views " (not one of those idiotio fashionable Sunday gatherings whioh
are the abuse of the original purpose) when a thoughtful suggestion
has been made, and has been subsequently adopted by the artist to the
manifest improvement of the pioture? Certainly I have.
Has not my excellent friend, as a professional critio, any expe-
rience of being asked to read a play, and advise upon it P Well,
this is one step towards the production of a piece in camerd. And
the next step r has it not been frequently adopted P Are there not
Operas to which musical and dramatio critics are admitted before
the work is made publio P "What are they there for? If merely
to write a notice, or for other journalistic purposes, no criticism is in
question; but if it is to assist themselves in writing a more thoughtful
criticism than usual, then I contend that this preliminary hearing
is an aid towards an honest discharge of the critio's duty. But if the
critics, among whom I include a variety of experts, are there for
the purpose of presenting their notes on what they consider errors
and defects to those responsible for the production, then in many
cases the publio, and all concerned in bringing out the work, would
be the gainers.
Ton Taylor's Hidden Hand was heard in camerd, and so have
been, I dare say, many other pieces; but this case I happen to

remember, having witnessed it, and having heard many sugges-
tions made to the author, though, if I remember rightly, as next
night's performance was the publio one, this interval did not give
sufficient time for rectification. All torts of possible faults in
scenery and costume might be set right if the piece were given one
week before production in the presence of an audience composed
not only of dramatio critics, but of other artistio experts. There
is nothing very_ "ourious or comioal" in such a proceeding; but
there is something both "curious and comical" in the supposition
of publio opinion being in any way influenced by a oritioism written
in "hot haste" for the mere sake of being among the first 'in the
field with "an item of news." Jack-in-the-Box.

light. At the finish of Ayesha's fifth and longest speeoh, the stage-
direction is, ''Curtain falls for an interral of two thousand years."

IN VINO VERITAS!
The following curious dooument, which has fallen into Mr.
Punch's hands, and has been "done into English" by one of his
Young Men who "knows the language," is evidently an extract
from the notes of the Clerk of a French Juge d'Instruction. It
would seem that the Magistrate, with the subtle and insidious design
of eliciting some damaging admissions from the accused person, had
invited him to dinner during the interrogation. Then, when he con-
ceived that the moment was ripe, he suddenly brought to bear upon
his unhappy guest the full power of a trained legal intellect—a
device which can only be excused by remembering that a Frenoh
official is apt to take somewhat wide views of his duties in the course
of a criminal investigation.
We may Buppose that the Clerk was previously concealed and in-
structed to make a faithful record of the transactions, in which it is
abundantly dear that the parties were by no means on an equal
footing.
Whether the preoedent is worthy of being followed or not, will be
sufficiently gathered from the official account of its working which
begins thus:—

"WHAT A (DRAWINC-ROOM) DAY WE ARE HAVING 1"
The following letter, which has been7received at 85, Fleet Street,
is published for identification:—
Mr dearest Flora, Saturday, February 25.
I ah sure that you must be dying to hear how the function
went off yesterday. Oh, my dear, we had such a dreadful time of it I
It was so bitterly cold that we nearly didn't go at all, and Papa, who
accompanied us, you know, in his Deputy-Lieutenant's uniform,
looking such a—well, you know, not looking quite his best—was in
such a.temper, and used such awful language, that it was perfectly
dreadful I The night before we didn't go to a " first night" at the
theatre because we didn't like to take the horses out into the cold,
and yet on Friday we kept the poor creatures waiting in the Mall for
hours—literally hours! Of course it is awfully nice going to a
Drawing-room and being presented, and all that; but in February,
my dear, this kind of thing has its drawbacks.
How, knowing you, I feel that you would like to hear everything
from the beginning—now wouldn't you f Well, I think I told you
that it was decided that I should go to Buckingham Palace this
year because Mamma thought that the Queen might be annoyed if
I stayed away any longer, especially as Plaktaoenktia Smithies
was presented in time for the Jubilee. Papa was rather against it,
and said it was "nonsense" (he is dreadfully vexing sometimes!)
but of course Mamma had her way, as she always does. Mamma
and I had to choose our dresses. It didn't take me long, as a
dSbutante, you know, dear, always wears white, but Mamma was
ages over it! I really think we went to a dozen places to get the
stuff for Mamma's train. Mamma got at last some velvet, em-
broidered with pomegranates and tinsel. Then we had such a fuss
about whether it should be from the shoulder d la Watteau or not.
It was settled that it had better spring from the waist, whioh was
only putting it a few inches lower, after all. Then we had such a
lot of visits from and to Madame Peixord, trying on and altering,
and all that sort of thing, that I was quite weary of the affair, and
should have liked to have backed out of it. But Mamma wouldn't
The Art of Warre.
No apology was needed from the Head Master of
Eton for lecturing before the Aldershot Military Society
on "Taotics." Why, if ever there were a man for the
work, it is evidently Dr. Warre. The Reverend Doctor's
name is suggestive of the Church Militant. He said he
"felt timorous before such an audience." Of course
"Warre's alarms." Ah! how many a lower boy could
give an aocount of what the "sinews of Warre" are
like! He will next lecture on "the Block System," and
on the attitude of boys in the Head Master's presence.
Success to Dr. Warre, Pax Doctori Bello! He has made
some of them "bellow!" and, when his next birthday
arrives, here's swishing him many happy returns of the
day.
2 pbopos of Overworking Touhq Hofhasw.—
"What's the odds as long as you're Abbey P"
let me, as she said that the dear Princess would be so annoyed if I
didn't come, and it would be in such bad taste, considering the sad
news from San Remo. So I persevered, and I have been. It is all
over! But I must say, thank Goodness I
Well, dear, it was awfully cold on Friday morning when I came
down to breakfast. It had been snowing a little in the night, and
the pavements were quite white. Papa was very cross, because he
said it was " such (something very naughty) nonsense!" And that
my mother was old enongh to know better. I couldn't help saying
that 1 thought it would be useful to me if I went afterwards to any
foreign Court. Papa in an aggravating tone asked " Why?"
"Because," I explained, "our Ambassador would have to ask us
to all the Embassy dinners and parties if we had been presented."
"Oh, would he!" replied Papa, in a most aggravating way. Well,
I did not stay long, but rushed upstairs to dress. Passing Mamma's
room I found her standing on a sheet with the whole strength of the
establishment putting her together. I was rather vexed at this, as I
thought it a shame to take Lucy, my maid, from me to dress
Mamma. However, I was quite ready by the time the carriage
came round for us—a little alter twelve. It was such a business
getting in! Both Mamma and I were lost in a perfect sea of velvet
and satin surmounted by two bouquets, and were just riding off
when John touched his hat, and asked if Papa wasn't going to
accompany ns? Fancy, darling! We had entirely forgotten him!
However, the oversight was repaired, and we were soon packed up
together in the carriage as olose as that dreadful Medical Student,
Cousin Peter, oalls " Sardines in a box."
We got down to Buckingham Palace before one o'clock, and would
you believe it ?—even then the Mall was full of carriages! We took
up our position on the ranks, and then, my dear, our martyrdom
began! On the whole, I thought it rather fun, but Mamma was
dreadfully angry. A number of rude boys would stand looking
through the carriage-window making personal remarks. They would
insist upon giving Mamma advice about her nose (whioh certainly
was very red), suggesting that we had better rub it with snow'as a
way of getting it baok to its original colour. Then they would
laugh at Papa's spectacles. He got outside and walked about to

keep himself warm, but was driven back into the carriage by their
criticism. Oh, it made him to angry I Well, we pat down the
blinds, but that didn't do much good, as they "talked at" us from
the outside. For nearly two hours, my dear, we had to wait before
a move was made,
and then by fits
and starts we
fouod ourselves
in the courtyard
of the Palace,
haying run the
gauntlet of
crowds of rude,
grinning, sneer-
ing nobodies!
Speaking of nobo-
dies, we saw the
Tkmpf.ksons (to
whom we soarcely
nod in our place
in the country),
and were so glad
to find anyone we
knew that we
were quite cordial
to them. And, oh, dear, the cold was dreadful! "When we opened
the window for a second we were nearly frozen!
Well, of course Papa caught his sword in our gowns, and then we
took off our wraps in the cloak-room, and one of the servants
gathered up my train for me, and showed me how to hold it over my
arm. Then we hurried up the staircase, and, after giving up one set
of our cards, passed into the first room. My dear, it was quite foil,
and we saw lots of people in a saloon beyond! Well, I won't weary
you by telling you how we had to fight and push our way from
apartment to apartment (sometimes getting a chair near the fire,
when we were roasted, and sometimes a place on a settee under a
window, when we were frozen), but will come to my presentation.
I was thoroughly tired and wretchedly cold, when I saw all the
ladies who were with us (I kept close to Mamma, but Papa had dis-
appeared, as he was only "accompanying the ladies of his family,"
and wasn't going to pass before Her Majesty) getting into single
file. Suddenly I found myself alone with two persons in Court
costume spreading out my train behind me. I walked along, had my
card taken from me, heard my name called out, curtseyed several
times, walked sideways, backed, and found someone was going through
exactly the same performance in my place I It was all over 1
Well, no, not quite: for Mamma and I had to wait two hours,
while Papa found the carriage, as that stupid John, instead of
up and looking for us, had remained on the box.,
With best love, ever your affectionate Cousin, Millie.
P.S.—Papa is laid up with bronchitis, and Mamma is in bed to-
day speechless from influenza. I am just sending off for the Doctor.

5. Pat the youngsters who preoede me encouragingly and good-
humouredly on the back.
6. For form's sake, pull their Motion amiably to pieces, to show
them what amateur debating comes to in "real Parliamentary hands."
7. Spring on them an entirely new and original definition of the
"Irish Question," that will give them something to talk about.

10. Make sure that the Timer reporter is there, and that they
mean to give me at least four columns the next morning.

direst Ttlegraphio communication with the Emperor of
China to give a series of Representations of the grand and highly
successful Pantomime, Puss in Soots, at the Summer Palace,
Pekin, respectfully begs to inform his Patrons, the Public, that, as
he has reason to believe that the takings of the newly-projected
enterprise will be simply enormous, he feels that they will instantly
understand that no apology is needed from him for withdrawing it
in the full tide of its present gigantic success.
TOOLE'S THEATRE.—No Performance this Evening, or till
further Notioe.
^RE BUTLER.—Postponed Representation.
MR. J. L. TOOLE, having just received the august oommands
of His Majesty the Emperor of Fiji to give a performance of
the highly successful farcical comedy of the Butler in those remote

which he is now endeavouring to do with his entire oompany, t>y
devoting the whole of his leisure time to its study with the aid of
an Ollendorff, he is bound to withdraw the representation of the
pieoe till further notice. As, if Mr. Toole finds his Fiji experiment,
as he has every reason to believe it will be, a success, he intends, if
he oan acquire a sufficient mastery over the local dialects, to give
several representations in the Solomon and other groups of Cannibal
Islands in the neighbouring Archipelago, he begs to state that all
fees for places already booked will be returned, unless the latter be
changed for some date at which Mr. Toole devoutly hopes to see
himself back again, and whioh will be announced by cable as soon
as oircnmstanoes will possibly admit of its being done.

retired Missionary or experienced adapter who would be com-
petent to furnish him with a free translation of the above popular
farcical comedy into the language of the man-eating Karawejees.

The temper of both parties was impnmd for the time being.
When Mrs. Gamp, having cleared away, produced the tea-pot from
the top shelf, simultaneously with a couple of wine-glasses, they
were quite amiable.
"Betsey," said Mrs. Ga m p, filling: her own glass, and passing the
tea-pot, "I will now propoge a toast. My present pardner, The
Opposition 1"
Which, altering the name to The Government! I drink," said
Mrs. Pbio, "with love and tenderness."
Mrs. Prio, whose remarkable voice was not wholly incapable (as
was well known both to her friends and her foes) of the more strident
inflections of anger and scorn, absolutely " cooed " out this senti-
ment, with a seduotive softness that would have done no discredit to
"the Dove and very blessed Spirit of Peace" itself.
"Mow, Salrah," said Mrs. Prio, after a due interval, "joining
business with pleasure, wot is this case in whioh yer wants my assist-
ance P" Mrs. Gamp betraying in her face some intention of returning
an evasive answer, Betsey added, "Is it that Irish case of yours?"
"No, Betsey Pkio, it ain't," was Mrs. Gamp's reply.
"Well," said Mrs. Prio, with a short laugh, "I'm glad of that,
at any rate."
"Why should you be glad of that, Betsey?" Mrs. Gamp retorted,
warmly. "The case is unbeknown to you, except by hearsay: why
should you be glad? That is a oase, Betsey, in whioh I should not
think of seekin' your assistance, seeing as our notion of treatment
thereof is as opposite as yaller and green."
"Peroisely so, Sairah," responded Mrs. Prio, with portentous
emphasis.
The best among us have their feelings, and it must be conceded of
Mrs. Prio, that if there was a blemish in her disposition it was an
aggravating habit she had of subtly suggesting, whether by oracular
word or significant expression, a great deal more than she aotnally
said. This subtle trick of hers, whilst it made her many cover
enemies amongst her ostensible friends, prevented her oftentimes
from securing temporary friends amongst her normal enemies. It is
certain that her countenance became about this time quite Sphinx-
like in its significance,-, and that she sat with her arms folded and
one eye open, in a somewhat offensive, because obtrusively intelli-
gent manner, as who should say, "Mild I may look, and mother's
milk I may speak, but I am a very Old Monthly Hand, and you
don't get over me."
"You think aperiently, Betsey Prig," said Mrs. Gamp, "that
my treatment of that same Irish oase is bound to be weak. Excnge
me if I makes remark, that it may neither be so weak as people
thinks, nor people may not think it so weak as they pretends; and
what I knows, I knows; and what you don't, you don't; so do not
ask me, Betsey."
"Who's a asking of you, Sairey?" Mrs. Prio inquired.
Mrs. Gamp returned no answer.
"Who's a asking of you, SaibetP" Mrs. Prio inquired again.
Then Mrs. Prio, by reversing the question, imparted a deeper and
more awful character of solemnity to the same. ." Sairey, who's
a asking of you?"
It seemed the nearest possible approach to a very decided differ-
ence of opinion between these two ladies; but Mrs. Frio's impatience
to know more of the contents of that tea-pot being greater at the
moment than her impatience of contradiction, she did not push the
question too pertinaciously, and when Mrs. Gamp replied rather
evasively, "Nobody, if you don't, Betsey," she sombrely but
silently acquiesced in that peace-making process known as " drop-
ping the subject." For a quarrel can be taken up at any time, but
a limited and uncertain quantity of, let us say refreshment, in a tea-
pot cannot.
As to the particular ingredients whioh constituted the mixture in
that tea-pot, Mrs. Prig felt and displayed a devouring curiosity. So
muoh so that she presently counterfeited that abstraction of mind

whioh hat its origin in excessive attention to one topio, and stretched
ont her hand in the direotion of the tea-pot. It was more than Mrs.
Gamp could bear. She stopped the hand of Mrs. Puis with her own,
and said, with great feeling—
"No, Betsey! Play fair, wotever you do!"
Mrs. Pais, thus baffled, threw herself back in her ohair, and,
closing the same eye more emphatically, and folding her arms
tighter, suffered her head to roll slowly from side to side, while she
surveyed her friend with a peculiar smile.
She said nothing. Bat (as husbands and Members of Parliament
well know) there are ways of saying nothing which are more sug-
gestive, and more provocative, than the most exuberant verbosity
can possibly be.
In this attitude, and with this demeanour, did Mrs. Prio await
results. Whether those results were destined to be as amioable and
mutually satisfactory as certain more or less friendly passages
between the two ladies had seemed to promise,—well that, of course,
remains to be Been. But it is proverbial that " The best of friends
—must part."
• •••••

A FIRST NIGHT AT THE PLAY.
{By Our Oum Impressionist)
Bstore the First Act of the new piece oommenced, I found the
theatre crowded in every part. Certainly there were gaps in the
stalls (subsequently filled to the consider-
able inconvenience of the earlier theatre-
goers) and also a box or at most two
unoccupied, but these again received their
allotted tenants before the opening scene
was over. I may safely say that the
house was_ full, and now I will, as re-
quested, give my impression of the audi-
ence. For once let the play stand over
as the Judges have it, "for further
consideration," and let me confine my
attention to those who had come to pass
judgment, and who remained to be in-
spected.
To begin with the Gallery. Perhaps it
contained the most genuine portion of the
public in the whole building. By genuine
publio I mean persons who go to the play
to enjoy themselves, and have no objeotion to paying for the privilege.
The Gallery cheered and laughed and did just what they pleased.
When they detected what they may have thought was favouritism—
when there was an unnecessary cheer for the Manageress for instanoe
—they hissed. But on the whole they were pleased and not ungener-
ous. In a like manner the Upper Boxes were equally fair and
appreciative. But when I come to the Stalls, Private Boxes, and
Pit, I have a very different story to tell. They^shall have a new
paragraph.
The " better parts " of the house were full of what are technically
known as " dead heads." They were very nioe and intelligent and
proper "dead heads," but still "dead heads," and it is the rule of
dead heads" never to applaud anything; so the dramatio critio of
this organ of publio opinion, and the dramatio critio of that, pre-
served a discreet silence, only broken when.they whispered a profes-
sional jest to a neighbouring colleague. Of course, they had a
perfect right to be there, as it was their business to notice the piece
before them. But I question whether this and that lady of mature
charms had an equal right, and whether it would not have been
better for the piece had they been oonspicuous by their absenoe.
However, the denizens of the Stalls and Private Boxes behaved
themselves, and, if apathetio, were at any rate not uncourteous.
But the Pit I I really must give a fresh paragraph to the Pit I
In .years gone by. when Stalls were unknown, the Pit was the
place for critics. Even now it retains some of its old prestige,
thanks to the attendance of the average middle-class playgoer: but
onja First Night it is intolerable. The Pit is leavened by a dozen
unpleasant-looking persons, who generally contrive to secure places
in the front row, and whose object it is to oreate a disturbance. No
doubt these dozen unpleasant-looking persons during the day have
been engaged in the congenial employment of measuring flannel or
weighing cheese under the superintendence of a head shopman, but
at night they are the masters of the situation. It is customary to
permit them to interrupt the performances with foolish remarks and
unprovoked hootings. If anything goes wrong in the excitement of
a first night's performance, these illiterate individuals strive to make
Sf. go " wronger." If an actor stumbles over an unexpected ohair,
r jeer: if an aotress finds a door fastened when it should be open,
'howl; if a scene sticks for a moment in the hands of a carpenter,
'hoot. During the day, no doubt, they have been subjeot to tie
i of the shop or the clerk's office, but at night
they throw off all restraint, and require a polioeman to keep them in
order. They are, after all, only a small minority, and it seems a
pity that the majority of pit-goers, who presumedly have paid their
money to enjoy rationally an evening's entertainment, do not turn
upon these ontios of the counter, and insist upon their silenoe or
expulsion.
And now, having had my say, I turn to the pieoe for a moment.
It was oalled The Mystery of a Hansom Cab. I certainly saw
the Hansom Cab, and in the First Aot noticed that it drove off
deliberately with a lamp-post. What it did with that lamp-post
appeared to be the mystery. But then I frankly admit I gave
attention to the audience than to the performance.
"ANY ANSWER?"
Dear Mr. Punch,—Accidentally taking up a quarterly, not The
Quarterly, which is rather too heavy to be taken up without an effort,
I found the following passage among its "Notices of Books " :—
"We read also of a people which, in spite of foreign occupation, and in
spite of systematic Governmental efforts to stifle the national life, clang with
dogged tenacity to its nationality; and at last after centuries of oppression,
won for itself its legislative and executive independence. The wrongs from
which — suffered under the rule appear to have been the confiscation
of land for settlers, an absentee aristocracy, an impoverished peasantry,
a'close official class ruling the country according to notions and in —
interests, to., &<>., to."
Is this about Ireland and England? Anyone who should think so
would be very much abroad, seeing that the above is only a compre-
hensive summary of; Professor Astairrus Vambkrt's book, entitled
Hungary. Only about Hungary, you see, and the blanks I have
left in the quotation, where the words "Hungary," "Austrian,"
"German," "German," "German." occurred, may be filled up
acoording to the taste and fancy of the reader. Some theorists assert
that Hungary has not been benefited by its National Parliament,
but, they have the Professor's opinion and experience of aotual faot
against them. Once the late Mr. Kinoslet wrote a memorable book
entitled What then does Dr. Newman mean f which had the one
invaluable effect of drawing from the eminent person to whom the
inquiry was addressed that marvellous specimen of _ plain English
under the Latin title Apologia pro vita" sua", which effectually
silenoed the unfortunate interrogator I Now wouldn't it be a boon
to a majority of puzzled Englishmen, if someone would publish a
pamphlet entitled What then does Mr. Gladstone meant if this
would have the effeot of elioiting suoh a lucid reply as was given
in the instance above quoted. What an opportunity for an
Apologia pro vitd sud, by " Mr. G." with a preface succinctly, and
without any sort of ambiguity, explaining what he does mean and
what he does not mean, and what he does not intend to mean by
Heme Rule. I should suggest this sort of friendly arrangement
viz., that Mr. Chaplin should put the question—a game not unlike
"putting the stone,"—which Mr. G." should! at once proceed to
answer. "Magna est Veritas," as Mr. Labouchere says when the
circulation of Truth goes up half-a-dozen or so.

SUGGESTION FOR RE-ARRANGING A SCENE IN COURT.
From a report of the Walden-Borrowes assault oase we extract
this:—
"Mr. Partridgt. Tou said I prejudged the case. Tou took me to task,
implying that there was favouritism.
Mr. Haley. No, Sir. I beg your pardon.
Mr. Partridgt. If you are ever on .this Bench, *c, 4c."
And then the worthy Partridge-beak went on pecking at Mr.
Beslby, giving him a leoture. Now, if the wounded Partridoe had
been quite alive to the situation, the dialogue should have run thus:
Mr. Partridge. Tou took .me to task, implying that there was
favouritism.

ON THE CARDS.
Sib,—That is certainly a curious faot recorded the other day in the papers,
of the thirteen tramps all being; contained in one hand at Whist, hut _ is
soaroely less strange than the experience of having dealt thirteen successive
hands, not one of which contained a single trump. Yet this very thing happened
to me quite lately. Travelling the other day from Portsmouth _ to Limdon,
three perfeot gentlemen got into the train at Winchester, and, palling down the
window-blinds, proposed that I should join them at a rubber of Whist. I
consented, and we had a most enjoyable game for guinea points. Bat by some
curious chance neither I nor my partner held a single tramp the whole time,
and, as oar opponents marked four by honours, and seven by cards every single
deal, I found myself, on arriving at Waterloo, indebted to a Captain Deuce ace to
the amount of £147 3s., for which, not having, of course, so muoh cash about me,
I gave him, at his suggestion, an uncrossed cheque. This, however, bjr the way.
I only mention it in connection with the curious run of ill luok to whioh I have
referred, and whioh, as it is a complete puzzle to me, I
must leave to your readers, if they can, to explain.
I am, Sir, yours, obediently, Peter Simple.
Sib,—The chances of the thirteen trumps falling to one
hand at Whist, are nothing like 1,308,902,716 to 1 as
somebody says. Why 5 to 1 is nearer it, or for the matter
of that, you may call it evens, and make it a certainty.
You have only to prepare a pack and keep it under the
table, and there you are. Take my case. I am in the
habit of playing three-handed! whist every evening with
a couple of short-sighted invalid unoles for half-a-crown
a rubber. Whenever I have the deal I whip the pack off
the table and produce the one I have prepared. The
result is I score all the honours and all the tricks. My
uncles were at first astonished at the phenomenon, but
they are now quite accustomed to it, and taking it as
a matter of course, frankly admit that I have "re-
markable luck." 1 should rather think I had.
Yours, quite wide-awake, Tommy Shabfk.
Sib,—Your Correspondents have furnished you with
some interesting experiences in connection with Whist,
to whioh, if you will permit me, 1 will add one of my
own. Being invited the other evening to join a party
at a well-known West-End Card Club, I found myself,
after passing in through a back entrance, soon seated
playing in turn Nap, Unlimited Loo, and Poker, and
drinking Champagne in tumblers in a room secured
against the sudden irruption of the Police by locked
double doors. After three hours at this 1 fancy I must
have settled down to Whist at ten guinea points, and
only rose from the table on finding 1 held apparently a
double set of everything in my hand. Protesting against
this extraordinary phenomenon and knocking over a
lamp, my partner, and several chairs and tables to em-
fhasise my objection, a melee ensued, the details of whioh
cannot distinctly call to mind, but at the end of which
I found myself in a back street near the Haymarket, with
my pockets turned inside out, my watch gone, my dress
coat slit up my back to the collar, and a portion of an
umbrella-stand in my right hand. I managed to reach
my home in Bayswater owing to the timely assistance of
a friendly policeman, but 1 have not yet solved the mys-
tery of the double hand." It was certainly remarkably
curious. Yours enigmatically, Double Dumby.
Sir,—That thirteen-trump deal can be managed, and
I've had recourse to it myself—on occasions, very suc-
cessfully; but it's too flashy for good steady advantage
play. For this I have always found marked hacks with,
of course, a little attention to the turn-up, the safest and
most useful method of procedure in thoroughly respect-
able and unsuspecting circles. Of course, there's
Hanky-Panky 'suitable for all games; but, speaking
for myself, 1 never feel quite so at home as 1 do at

TWO STRIKING TESTIMONIALS.
Upwards of three hundred persons presented Mr.
PoLiiTZEB, the eminent violinist with a testimonial in
the shape of a gold repeater. Was the gift a delicate
reminder to him to he as correct in his time as in his
tune P If so, it was scarcely complimentary. Or was it
to intimate that Mr. Pollitzer should follow the ex-
ample set by his new repeater, and always take an encore
when pressed? "Brother" Parkinson, Grand All-sorts-
of-dignities of the North, South, East and West, also
received a splendid repeater in recognition of his
valuable services rendered to the Drury Lane Masonic
Lodge. Every act the Band of Brothers perform is, or
ought to be, symbolical, and so the presentation of a
valuable gold repeater, should mean that a Brother in
distress must never forget that he has anUnole ever
ready to assist him: that, if in trade, one Mason should
be always willing to "tick " another Mason: that "good
works" are absolutely necessary: that "Hands" must
never strike,—that not being their department; and
finally that by constantly wearing the repeater, the
richest, the strongest, of us will be perpetually re-
minded that he ought always to keep a good watch on
himself. Such are the words of wisdom from the mouth
of The Universal G. M. Punch. So mote it be! . Now

Howie of Commons, Monday Night, February 20.—Cubhing-
hame Graham back to-night. Gallery crowded, in expectation of
spectacle. Graham had half promised tableau vivant representing
the Pruoner of Pentonville. Was to have entered in gaol clothes,
clanking chain at heel, with howl of skilly under left arm, and
munching chunk of bread. Nothing of the kind. Put on his best

that he "did not intend to imperil existence of the present patriotic
Government." Old Morality reassured. Gobchejt gratified.
After this, debate naturally lapsed into discussion on Indian

this subject, strategically occupied earlier hours of sitting in

the Knight of the Star of India was trying to go to sleep. Tim
had plaoed on paper notice to ask Mr. Speakkr whether he regarded
this as a ease of "a rest within the, precincts of the House." Saw
his error in time.
Tkm r-LE tells me that this phenomenon, which sometimes paralyses
orowded House, is an exercise something of the massage kind, only
much more efficacious. Wonderfully refreshing, he says, and wants
R. N. Fowler to try it. But, as FoVi.hk says, it's a matt< r of neck
or nothing, and Nature has given the Alderman more nothing than
neck. Business done.—More debate on Address.
Tuesday.—Arthur Balfour really in low spirits to-night.
Keeps up appearances before the House. But in private intercourse
with a congenial soul discloses despair. Ttlls me he never quite got
oyer the Sage of Queen Anne's Gate's announcement of himself as a
disciple, a oonvert to that great woTk entitled A Defence of Philo-
sophic Doubt. Always thought pretty well of the book till then.
Now views it with secret horror. Furtively buys up stray copies,
and burns them at midnight. Heavier still the blow fallen upon
him to-night. The Sage having hailed him
as a Master, the Sage's colleague at Northamp-
ton now claims him as a disciple. By some
fatality, as if he had not enough to contend
with in Ireland, Arthur got himself entangled
to-night in debate on condition of the Crofters.
Delivered luminous speech, tracing the cause
anally to over-population; whereupon Brad-
laugh gets up, recalls his own life-long
ornsade against over-population, rapturously
welcomes his new and unexpected colleague,
and holds out across floor of House a more or
less "'orny 'and."
"It's too much, Toby," said Balfour, in
a weary voice, and placing his feet among the
other ornaments on the chimney-piece in the
Chief Secretary's private room. "Labbv gave
me a sore stab with his approval of my
pamphlet. But Bradlaugh has given me a
death-blow. I shall give up politics, retire
from Parliament, and take to writing articles
in The Nineteenth Century." Said what I
oould to cheer him, and hope he '11 reconsider
his determination. But is evidently hard hit.
House busy to-night diccussing sad condi-
tion of Crofters. Cameron moved an Amend-
ment in a* carefully-prepared speech, which
The Cameron Pibroch, told a melanoholy story of hopeless destitution.
It was this that led Arthur Balfour into the pitfall. It was all,
he said, due to overpopulation, and the only remedy is emigration.
"Same policy in destitute Scotland as in distressed Ireland," says
Tim Healt, who hasn't left us yet "' Register! Register!
Ri-gister!' used to he a political shibboleth. Now it's ' Emigrate!
Emigrate I Emigrate!'"
Business done.—Crofters' Amendment
to Address rejected by 194 votes to 133.
Thursday.—In the Lords, Strath-
fden - AND - Campbell turns up quite
fresh after long silence of Recess. It is,
as usual, Europe that concerns him.
Can't sleep o' nights thinking of Bul-
garia. Suggests a Conference. Hints
that now the Markiss is too much en-
gaged in home affairs to undertake the
duty, perhaps he (S.-and-C.) might find
time to attend Conference as British
Commissioner. Usual thing, when
Stratheden-and- Campbell succeeds

of Stratheden? Czar promulgated this morning his views about
Bulgaria, and the Markiss finds S.-and-C. useful for once in his life.
Talks to him and at the Czar. Really very pretty."
"All very well, my Lord," said Rosebbrt to Markiss, when they
met in the cloak-room. But you '11 have to suffer hereafter.
You've wound up Stratheden-and-

Shaw-Lefrvre, tells of his hair-

force of mailed men. quailed before

"SHIVER OUR TIMBER8!"
A CiCivERiNc, shivering aspen, and a weeping willow,
are no marvels, bat a Groaning Oak is something new.
Strange, if true. According, however, to some corre-
spondence in a Hampshire piper, there is, or lately was, a
Groaning Tree at Lymington, which astonished the natives
of the New Forest. A similar prodigy, within the
memory of man, for eighteen or twenty months together,
at the village of Baddesley, created amazement and con-
sternation in the country round. This portent is
recorded to have been a large elm, which grew in the
garden of a poor cottager. Apparently it was young and
vigorous, but at intervals emitted a strange noise, like
that of a person in extreme agony. Its owner at length
bored a hole in the trunk of it, and after that it never
groaned again. He finally rooted it up, but found nothing
more to account for its doleful utterances than the philo-
sopher discovered when he cut his bellows open to see
where the wind came from. We've all heard of the
Mahogany groaning on the most festive occasions. Con-
sidering that the oaks of Dodona gave out oracles, and
that trees of classical antiquity were tenanted by Hama-
dryads, the Psychical Researon Society may perhaps con-
sider it worth while to investigate the weird, eerie, and
uncanny manifestations exhibited by these groaning
trees, unless they class them with the Hoax of Dodona.
A Plucky Pais and a Golden "Wedding.—A short
time ago what was described as " A Romantic Marriage"
took place. When the Dutch Emigrant Ship, W. A.
Scholten, was lost, a Miss Gold showed immense pluck,
and begged all the English aboard to join hands and
sink together, One T. Mitchell of Van Buren, U.S.,
had advertised in England for a wife. Miss Gold was
among those who had replied. Real pluok again. As she
couldn't go out to "join nands" with him, the advertiser
travelled to England and "joined hands" here. Which
was the pluckier of the two? Can any husband be
wished better luck than that his bride may be as good as
Gold?

You must have existed for ages,

No medical man can ignore. _

An eminence high may attain;
Yon pull down the head of a nation,

Though some folks deny your existence,
Though fierce physiologists fight,
With painful unpleasing persistence,
Professors bring new ones to light.
Each boasts of the one he detected,
Its beauties will gladly explain;

While knowledge is power, recognition
Of such horrid atoms as these,
Each like a malefic magioian,
Can scarce be expeoted to please.
Although we've endeavoured to quiz it,
It smiles vibrionio disdain;
But don't bother us with a visit,

A Memento. My Masters. — The Ter-
centenary of the Spanish Armada is to be
commemorated by an elaborate sculpture
erected on Plymouth Hoe, representing
Britannia with banners and other acces-
sories; medallions also of Drake, Raleigh,
Frobibher, and Hawkins, and a bronze
tablet illustrating the destruction of the
enemy's fleet, coupled with an inscription
attributing its dispersion to the winds.
Certainly, the winds did blow, and the in-
vaders were scattered; but that was a con-
tingency by no means likely in the time of
need to occur again, and the only complete
commemoration of the Spanish Armada re-
mains to be effected by the formation of
suoh a Navy, as, with adequate coast
defence, will suffioe to blow any future Fleets
of combined foreigners out of the water.

"A very good name indeed," said Mr.
Punch, wholly unable to repress a smile.
"Yes, I think it is," resumed Mr. Bar-
rett. "There's a good name before it, too,
you will observe . .. There—' Wilson Bar-
rett' sounds well, I think, Sir P"
"Very," said Mr. Punch.

Melnotte—ani ' Wilson Barrett as Claude
Melnotte' is an attractive advertisement,
I think. Sir?"
"Certainly," said Mr. Punch.
"I appear now and then as Claude Mel-
notte, and it pleases my friends very muoh."
"It is calculated to afford them the highest
gratification, I should conceive," said Mr.
Punch, rather envying the ease with which
Mr. Wilson Barrett's friends were enter-
tained.
"Now, Gentlemen," said the Acting-
Manager, approaching them. "All in to
begin!"
Gracefully Mr. Wilson Barrett bowed
to Mr. Punch, as the latter stepped into his
hansom and was driven off in the direction of
Fleet Street.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
REAL FREE TRADE j
Or, the "Service of Men."
[The "Halfpenny Letter Post Company " is promising to give the publio,
by means of " a novel system of advertising," an envelope, a sheet of note-
paper, and a penny stamp, for one halfpenny, "without any loss to the
revenue."]
R. V. Winkle, Esq., a member of that eminent City Firm known
as Messrs. Schneider, Schnapps. & Co., rubbed his eyes, stretched
himself, and aaid, in a curiously husky voioe, which he hardly
recognised as his own:—" How long have I been asleep? It must
be time to go to the Office."
He put on his coat and set off for the Railway Station. He was
startled when he arrived there to find everything seemed to be
changed. Instead of a grimy, draughty, little room, with a floor of
wet planks, where he had always been accustomed to take his ticket
for Town, he beheld a Gothic building, with marble pillars, and a
portico ornamented with priceless statues of all the Directors of the
Company. Stepping inside, he could hardly believe that that
Hall of Dazzling Light was in very truth the Booking-office. From
the hand of a bronze Naiad in the centre of the building, a flashing
stream poured into a porcelain fountain, illuminated by hundreds of
electric lights.
He looked for the pigeon-hole where an over-worked olerk had
been in the habit of angrily dispensing tickets to travellers.
The pigeon-hole had disappeared! There was a handsomely dressed
man walking about the hall, and R. V. Winkle, utterly dazed at
the changes which had taken place, thought he would inquire where
the ticket-office might be. The handsomely dressed man was. as he
discovered to his intense astonishment, a porter 1 R. V. Winkle
could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the well-known buttons
on his best Melton coat, and the embroidered gold-band round his
plush cap, denoting his status.
"There is no ticket-office, Sir," he replied, in apparent surprise;
"there was one here, I believe, twenty years ago. But that was
before my time."
"Then how am I to get my ticket for London?" exclaimed Mr.
R. V. Winkle, hopelessly bewildered.
The Porter pointed politely to one out of a number of curiously
shaped machines standing in a row along one wall.
"Put the amount of your fare in the slit," he continued, " and pull
out the drawer."
In increasing astonishment, the Merchant did as he was'told.
The old fare used to be half-a-orown, "return, second-class." He
was just about to hunt for that coin in his purse, when he saw the
words "One half-penny," inscribed on the apparatus...
"It must be a mistake," he murmured to himself. Still—this is
a morning of wonders—I will try a halfpenny." So saying he
dropped that modest coin into the slit. Pulling out the drawer, he
was surprised to find a jiacket of railway-tickets presented to him,
elegantly tied round with red silk: they were first-class return
tickets to London, enough to last for a fortnight; but they were
much larger "than he had known before—and on every side they were
covered with advertisements of cheap soaps, patent braces, furniture,
sewing-machines, feeding-bottles, sensation novels, and a host of
other articles.
Mr. R. V. Winkle turned to the Porter for an explanation.
I see, Sir," remarked that official, "that you are not acquainted
with the system which is now in vogue in all departments of social
and domestic life. Everything is provided gratis, or almost gratis;
trade is revolutionised; advertisements pay for everything—they
have paid for this Station, which although decent in point or archi-
tecture, is nothing to the Cannon Street Terminus, the f acade of
which is said utterly to eclipse that of the Cathedral at Milan, and
which is solely composed of alabaster inlaid with precious stones."
"You surprise me," said R. V. Winkle. "I must really go to
the Post Office to get a stamp in order to write an account of these
marvels to my friends elsewhere."
"You need hardly take the trouble to do that, Sir," replied the
Porter. "Touoh that button—no, you need not put in any coin—
and yon will have enough letter-paper and stamps to last you for the
rest of your life-time.''
It was quite true. Staggering under the weight of the stationery
which had been jerked out at him from the mouth of the machine,
Mr. R. V. Winkle exclaimed:—" Why, then, the cost of living
must be materially reduced by these arrangements."
"Cost of living 1" the Porter responded. "Then you are not
aware that the butcher now presents us with prime joints without
asking for any payment, because the paper in which he wraps his
meat is covered with tasteful advertisements, which return him an
ample profit without the necessity of charging his customers any-
thing. _ The baker and greengrocer proceed on the same principle,
happy if they are merely enabled to introduce into a sufficient number
of private houses the advertising paper-bags in which their'goods are
enveloped."
"Dear me I" said the staggered Londoner; "this must be very
gratifying to the poor!"
"The Poor 1 We have none. Sir. I believe there were some poor
in London when I was a lad—but, bless me, poverty and discontent
are unknown. Automatic delivery and an extension of the_ adver-
tising system have converted England into a teres trial Paradise."
"Dear me 1" said R. V. Winkle, again. "This really surprises
me. My sleep must have been much longer than I thought,"

SETTLING THEIR SUNDAY.
At a recent sitting of the Upper House of the Convocation of
Canterbury, according to a contemporary it appears that—
"The Bishop of Exeter laid
on the table a petition, said to
be signed by one hundred and
four persons, including Members
of both Houses of Parliament,
clergymen, and others, setting
forth that there had been of late
a marked increase in the em-
ployment of the afternoon and
evening of Sunday in amuse-
ments of various kinds by the
upper and fashionable classes of
Bociety."
It adds, moreover, that the
Sunday Out." "pastimesof recent date"are
said "to comprise formal dinner-parties, smoking concerts, theatrical
and semi-theatrical performances, comic recitations and amusing pro-
grammes of fun and frolic, exhibitions of jugglery," and other highly
reprehensible and wicked forms of dissipation, including " boxing at
the Pelican Club," lawn tennis, and even the enormities of visiting
the studios of artists perpetrated annually under the appalling title
of " Show Sunday." Why these hundred and four persons should
take upon themselves to meddle with the nature of the "amusements
of various kinds" to which the fashionable classes of Society choose
to devote their Sunday afternoons, or what good on earth they hope
to get by handing in a petition to the Upper House of the Convocation
of Canterbury on the subject, is not very clear. They might, how-
ever, throw some light on the matter by a little further and. fuller
definition of some of the " pastimes of recent date" to which they
more particularly object. It would be interesting no less to know
precisely what sort of an entertainment would fall under the cate-
gory of a "semi-theatrical performance," as to be informed at what
particular point of humour a recitation might become too " comic"
for a Sunday rendering. Muoh mystery is again suggested in the
prohibition put on an "amusing programme of fun and frolic."
I '.What, too, is meant by the dead set made at exhibitions of jugglery P
Is this aimed at a little innocent leger-de-main, or is it destined
only to crush the professional wizard and his stock apparatus? Of
the "boxing at the Pelican Club " with which the hundred and four
petitioners appear to be familiar, it is more difficult to speak; but
the attempt to abolish "Show Sunday" may fairly be characterised
as rather impertinent. Our English Sunday is none too lovely or
lively an institution, but as yet neither the upper nor the lower
classes of English Society have shown any tendency, publicly, to
desecrate it. When they do, it will be time enough, if not for the
Upper House of the Convocation of Canterbury, at least for the
Public Opinion of the country to express itself upon the matter.
Meantime, grandmotherly interference had better let it alone.

ROBERT ON SPELLING.
Well I must say as the respect as I receeves from my Cozens in
Amerrykey is sumtbink as is most agreeable to my feelinx, more
partikler as I haven't the plessuxe of
knowing not none of 'em. Fust they
sends oyer reel gennehnenof the Press to
interwiew me, as they oalls it, and then
to tell all the natrally inquisitive
Amerrycan peeple all about the silly-
brated City Waiter as he called me.
Then I has a inwitation from all the ten
thousand Waiters in New York to go
oyer there and read my in treating and
emusin letters, as they oailed 'em, which
I shood most suttenly have accepted if
they wood have garranteed me a nioe
smooth passage all the way there and
baok, but that they wouldn't do, and as
my one trial, when I went to the Ague,
proved the .faot, that a rolling, and a
gambolling, and a pitohin, and a tossin
ea don't agree with the stummaokof an
Hed Waiter, I felt competed to decline the inwitation tho' it might
have gained me lots of money.
But both of these honorable distinktions was as nothink when
compared to the great honor as has jist bin oonferd on me by the
Spelling Reform Assosiation of Amerrykey. I have just reoeeved
from Boston, free gratis for nothink, post paid, a nice little gray
book, which I am told is their ofishal horgan tho' it don't look like
one, and the reoeet of which intemates to me that in consequence of
my long long efforts in the grand cause of reely good Spelling I am
unannymousely eleoted one of their Counsel I When I menshuns as
the rest of us inoludes 8 professers of Hinglish, and Frensh and
Germen, and four Edditers of warious Noose Papers, and a late
Chanceseller of New York—who I shoud think must have done a good
stroke of business therein that partickler line—peeple of powerful
emadgination may try in wane to guess what my feelinx of pride
and gratyficashun must be. As I has before obserwed, everything
cums to the man who can Wait, but I suttenly did not include such
a staggerer as this here. I have dewoted a good many spare hours,
in this rayther slack season, a trying to understand my free gratis
trezure, but 1 am bound in honor to oonfess that my honorable
oolleags has gone suoh a jelly long ways ahed of me in their eger
attemps to himitate me, that I finds it considerable diffioult to read
their book, muoh less to hunderstand it.
For instance, when I finds an House spelt Houz, and " to snatch a
glimpse above at my Beloved," as the poet sings, spelt " to snach a
glimps abuv at my Beluvd," and suoh orful looking words as these
here, "I skecht two men on the river one sculd and one rowd,"
I feels jist a leetle bit ashamed, of my brother Professers and
Edditers for their werry hugly spelling.
However, I'm quite reddy to make all nessessary allowances for
yung beginners, and daresay they '11 do better when they 'ye had as
much xperienoe as I have, but I must protest with all my art and
with all my strengh against hinsulting a butiful Rose by spelling it
with a z, Rozel (whioh I heer as they've just giwun the fair
Songkstress a testermonel before her dipartcher, which I dipploar);
praps one of the Counsel scraoht his fingers with a rose (nun with-
out thorns noweres) and this was the rewenge as he took, and Apl for
a poor happle ain't muoh better. I can't too quite agree with Per-
fessor Walter Sxeat when he spells wittels, vittels, I declines to give
up my dubbleyou tho he is a Pertesser. And sum on them does cum
it rayther strong. Perfesser Owen, for instance, says, without a
blush, that he can spell " Face " in 952 different ways! one of 'em
being "Gheighsoh"!
I don't feel at all sure that its quite right for my " Spelling Reform
Association," as we calls ourselves, to try to make eweryboddy.'spell
xactly alike. As a trueborn inglishman I claims my right to spell
my own native Langwidge xactly as I likes. And that same freedum
as I clames for myself I am ginerous enuff to grant to hothers.
There's a noble sense of true British freedom when we orthers sets
down to write with the fine free feeling that we ain't never obleeged
to stop in the middel of a fine flow of langwidge jist to wunder how
sum long wurd is spelt. Why I werrily bleeves as sum of my werry
grandest thorts, such as my description of the nature of Winks, for
instance, beginning, "Winks is rum things. Winks is," and my
grand deaffimtion of Eddicashun, ending thus: Propper Eddicashun
don't mean Sohoolin, but shoud teach us all, Waiters and all, to
learn and labour trewly to get a good Living, as the poor Curit said
to his Bishop," wood ha been hutterly lost to the world for ewer and
ewer if I had stopt in the middle on 'em to wunder how sum think was
spelt, and then where shood we all ha bin?
No, as at present adwized, I gos in for freedom in everythink.
Spelling and all, and tho I'm werry prowd and werry muoh flatterd
at being heleoted a Counseller of that "Spelling Reform Leag,"
in Culumbia Collige, New York, Amerrykey, yet I must at present
deolyne to take the pledge that I will well and trewly try to spell
as they spells, acoordin to their ewidenoe, and as I have bin so good
a frend to their great oaws, praps they may be iniuioed to make a
xample of me, and let me go on as usual, free as the hair and with-
out no tyes. Robert.
Po Sorip.—I incloses a' copy of Verses as I sent to my fare Neeoe,

ST.-JUSTIFICATION.
Master Jomnrr Morlet says he doesn't like being called "the
St.-Just of our Revolution." He complains of Master Oeoroib
Joachim Goschen's having so nicknamed him, and he won't stand
it. At least, so he protests, lucidly and logically enough, through
the medium of this month's Nineteenth Century. Mr. Punch
thinks Master Georgia's phrase ought to have been " the St.-Just
of the Gladatonian Party," because, thus expressed, "St.-Just" is
so craftily qualified as to suggest a certain resemblance without any
attempt to establish a complete parallel. Master Johnny oalls atten-
tion to M. Taink's highly charged and laboriously finished portrait
of St.-Just, and says, "Look here I am I like this P" No, replies
Mr. P., certainly not; but having looked on that picture, look at
this sketch by Carxyle—" More like a Student than a Senator."
So, Johwht, there you are! You who " have written books," as
Carltle says of St.-Just, cannot complain of the comparison, so far.
Carltle indeed calls him "Young St.-Just," "A youth of slight
stature, with mild mellow voice, enthusiastic olive complexion, and
long black hair." If this portrait, with the heading of a " Hundred
Pounds Reward," were posted by the Police all over the country,
we readily | admit that Master Johnnt Morlet would never be
arrested as the missing lad answering in every respect to this
description. No one appreciates Master Jon jtnt at his St.-Just value
more than does Mr. Punch, who perceives, and he has already put
on record piotorially, this striking resemblance at the present time.

An Earlt Bird.—That rara avis, a Goldfinoh, was hopping
about on the shore near Heme Bay—(why didn't the Goldfinch take
a fly P)—and suddenly found an elephant, or rather all that remained
of one, whioh was only a tusk. The Goldfinch, a very learned bird,
was sure that the tusk was that of a hairy elephant on a visit to this
part of Kent a few thousand years ago, more or less. We have not
yet heard the opinion of those experts Messrs. Sanger, who oan
give some particulars as to elephants having been seen at Margate
within the last few years.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
I own with compunction to not having read Little Lord Faunt-
leroy until last week, and it " made me Bit up ; " that is, it kept me
up late, and caused me to snivel joyfully (I believe my cold next day

was entirely due to my tearful emotion overnight), over the pure love
of goodness,—not" goody-goodincss," nothing of the kind,—without
cant or affectation, therein displayed. It is a book that takes you
a long way out of yourself, so that you return to the world and
wonder where you've been. From a real emotional point of view I
liked Dickens best in) his Christmas Carol; but I envy Mrs.
li uknett the pure inspiration that has given us Little Lord Fauntle-
roy. And to one thing I have made up my mind, and that is,
I will not go to see Little Lord Fauntleroy on the stage. Even the
illustrations, good as they are for the most part, endanger the story.
Let me imagine Little Lord Fauntleroy, and the Earl, and Dearest,
and Mr. Hobbt, and Dick, but don't show them to ne on wood, or
steel, or oanvass, much less impersonated (how impossible!) by
comedians and low comedians, and by a preoooious child—little girl
to represent boy, of course, as is the invariable stage-oustom—with
the inevitable cockney twang.
I gather from the notices in the papers, of a piece recently pro-
duced called Little Lord Fauntleroy, that the adapter repudiates
nearly all his obligation to Mrs. Burnett's book, and protests that
Am Little Lord is not Mrs. Burnett's Little Lord. Most probable;
but at all events he doesn't sign himself Burnett, and attempt to
pass off the sham for the real,—a proceeding for which the unfor-
tunate name of Fauntleroy might afford a precedent. Also I see
that this adapter, for the sake of keeping the Little Lord's
mother before the public, has made her accompany her son to the
Earl's Castle, where she passes herself off as the boy's nurse. If
this be so, then such an expedient utterly destroys the simple,
straightforward, independent character of both mother and child,
who become a pair of humbugs, with a sordid purpose in view.
However, this is not the place to discuss dramatic matters, except
quite incidentally: all I say is that, whether successful or not, the
adapter's or Mrs. Burnett s own child on the stage must be vul-
garised, and the whole romance of the charming work destroyed.
If Mrs. Burnett has not already dramatised it, I am sure Mr,
Punch's immortal advice might be once more advisedly repeated,
and that is, "Don't!"
_ But for a certain paragraph in the Lancet, I should have muchly
liked to review a few books on Gout and Rheumatism; for, as
Mr. Labouchere recently observed in Truth, "they are really
cheerful reading," or words to that effect. If the Lancet
objects to Mr, PunchXor Mr. Punch's Prime Minister, noticing
any professionally medical works, who am I that I should offer
an opinion on a leoture delivered by Dr. Burnet Yeo, recently
published, and placed by a friend in my hands P The only thing
interesting to me in such works is the opinion of every doctor
on what to eat, drink, and avoid,—the second being the most
important I agree with Dr. B. Yeo—Yeo ho, my boys I yeo ho!—
that real good wine is the thing for .. . well, for me. This treatment,
of course, in the case of those who can only afford to have poor man's
gout (such is my modest lot), necessitates dining out, as frequently as
possible, with all those who possess first-rate cellars, and who are
willing to assist in your cure. This treatment takes a long time, but
it is, I believe, in most instances successful. I do not, as yet, speak
from experience, but I hope to do so. Adopting B. Yeo's idea I
■hall become a regular Yeoman, and perhaps a Centenarian I
I've just seen second number of the Barraud-Bentlby series of
Men and Women of the Day. Not quite so interesting as No. 1. A
friendly reader will ask, "Can anything interest the Baron so much
as No. IP" He may pause for a reply: I wish he may reoeive it.
Passons! Buskin's portrait comes first. The chief Ruskinite is
seated, pen in hand, ready for some one to bring him the ink. Then
follow Mr. and Mrs. Kendal, in'charaoter,—which is a mistake,-^
Lord and Lady Clancarty. Lord Clankendal is Btaring at something
or somebody out of the picture, and is evidently asking his wife,
sotto voce, "Who's that just come into the third box there P" and
she, with her head resting on Lord ClankendaVs manly breast, her
half-dosed eyes turned in the same direction as his, gently purrs
the answer, I don't recollect his face, but it's a very good house
to-night." Then comes, all alone in his glory, John Bright, looking
very truoulent, evidently muttering to himself, "Idiot! fool!"—of
course speaking of somebody else at a distance, to whom he has
just written one of his straight-f rom-the-shoulder epistles. Another
Grand Old Man, says Baron de Book Worms.
SOMETHING NEW FOE ALEXANDER!
[If he had been discovered in England.)
"Dear me, this is most interesting," said the Canon; "very
interesting indeed. Just give me his skull."
"Better let me look them over again, Sir," interposed the Sexton;
"perhaps I may find something more valuable than human bones."
Well, I am not sure," continued the ecolesiastic. "You see, I
do not fanoy that muoh treasure is usually discovered in a sarco-
phagus."
"Right you are. Sir," returned the Gravedigger, who had com-
pleted his work. Only bones—and terribly dirty ones, too I"
"They must be washed," observed the Canon, decisively, after
closely inspecting the skull of the great conqueror through his eye-
glasses. "In their present state they are soaroely fit to be seen.
But where shall we put them P"
"I shall be very glad to give them shelter in my drawing-room,"
suggested a Surveyor.
Now, that is very good indeed of you," put in another Church
Dignitary. "Very good ofjcixl, indeed; but are you Bure that you
don't mind P They may be moonvenient P"
"Not in the least, if they are nice and clean. I could put them
on a board resting on a sofa and two chairs. How would that do P"
"Admirably!" said the Dean and Chapter in chorus.
"But we must have them photographed!" cried one.
"And get Professor Huxley to examine them!" exclaimed
another.
"With pleasure," acquiesced the Surveyor.
So the bones of Alexandre the Great were washed.
And the bones of Alexander the Great were photographed.
And then they were placed on a shutter resting on a sofa and two
ohairs in the drawing-room of a dwelling-house.
And then Professor Huxley examined them.
And then some one wrote to the Times to say that they only
belonged to a common soldier, and had nothing whatever to do with
the mighty son of Philip.
And then some one else contradicted some one, and re-affirmed
that the bones were genuine.
And then there was a mild remonstrance from two or three of the
Puhlio, who were not quite certain that it was either legal or
advisable to take a hero, or his cousins, or his aunts, from conse-
crated ground into the drawing-room of a dwelling-house, however
stately.
But nobody seemed to care a brass button about it! So the matter
dropped, as dead as Alexander himself, or the late Queen Anne, or
even the once-venerated remains of St. Thomas a Becket!
Prophetic—Poet Tom Campbell foresaw " She" when he com-
menced his Speech of the Chorus with,
"0 Haggard Queen!"
And, in another instance, there must have been a beam in his eye
when he wrote " O'Connor's Child," clearly indicating the rise of
Tay Pay's Star.
"Niagara—and AfterP"—For reply, ask Mr. John Hollings-
head, who, aided by M. Philipoteaux— has accomplished the
unprecedented feat of bringing Niagara to London. The Aquarium
will be naturally jealous; and the Water Companies won t quite
like it Rather a fall for the Falls to come down to the slightly
dull locality known as York Street, St. James's Park, whioh requires
a "fillip-or-two" to start some amusement.
We wish the Clerk of the Weather, following the excellent ex-
ample of LordVWoLSELEY and his military friends in condemning
".the march past," would just make a salutary change in the Maron
present and future.

Fragments of a Lay sung on the day when the Patriot Sinner (and Lord
Mayor) S-lUv-n was released from durance vile, to " The Harp that
once in Tullamore the soul of music shed," in strains of mingled
patriotism and parody (some way, apparently, after Macaulay's
"Virginia."
Ye good If en of the Commons, with loyal hearts and true,
Who stand by us bold Irish, who now will stand by you,
Come, light your weeds around me, and mark my tale with care,
Of what poor Ireland oft hath borne, and yet may have to bear.
• • • • « •
Of all the wicked Tories still the names are held aooursed,
And of all the wioked Tories black B-lf-r was the worst.
He stalked about the Chamber like a Bonthorne in his pride,
Or sprawled with lank and languid legs entangled or spread wide.
The Irish eyed with anger, not all unmixed with fear,
His lifted chin, his curling month that always seemed to sneer:
That brow of brass, that mouth of scorn, mark all the species still,
For never was there Tory yet but wished the Irish ill.
Nor lacks he fit attendance: for ever at his heels
That most notorious renegade, his Sub., K-no-H-rm-n, steals,
His written answer ready, be the question what it may,
And the smile nickering on his cheek for aught his Chief may say.
• •••••
Just then, as in a cloudless gap in a long stormy sky,
Shining with hope in her blue eyes a fair young girl came by;
A four-leaved shamrock in her hand, and, as she danoed along,
She warbled gaily to herself snatches of Irish song,
With reference to Rory, and allusion to Kathleen,
And now and then a stanza of " The Wearing nf the Green;"
A bit from Samuel Lovkk, and a stave from Tommy Moore
(Not forgetting Lord Mayor 8-ll-t-n, who as a bard can score).
The maiden sang as Irish maids alone such songs can sing,
When Hope is in its budding-time and Love is in its Spring.
Black B-lf-b heard her sweet young voice, and saw her sweet young
face,
And hated her with the black hate of his old Tory race;
And watching close to see where she would go, and whom she'd meet,
His vulture eye pursued the trip of those bare glancing feet.
• •••••
So blithely young Hibernia came smiling from her home.
Ah I woe for young Hibernia, the best beloved of Rome!
She mused of that great Forum for which all patriots pray,
And just had reached the very spot where it snail stand one day,
When up the varlet B-lf-r came; not such as when erewhile
He lounged in far St. Stephen's with cock'd heels and simpering
smile;
He came with lowering forehead, fierce features, and clenched fist,
And strode across Hirkrnia's path, and caught her by the wrist.
Hard strove the frighted maiden, and screamed with look aghast,
And at her scream from left and right the folk oame running fast;
The old money-changer, Gl-dst-ne, with his thin silver hairs,
And H-RC-HT of the stately form and glittering " Rhodian " wares,
And the strong smiter, M-rl-y, grasping a half-forged brand,
And L-bbt, the unruffled, with oigarette in hand,
All oame in wrath and wonder; for all knew that fair child.
And as she passed them by—of late—had kissed their hands and
smiled.
And the strong Old Man Gl- dst-ne, gave B-lf-r such a blow;
The long one reeled three paces back, and let the maiden go.
Yet glared he fiercely round him, and hissed in snaky tone,
"Law's law, and Order's order; I claim her for mine own.
I wait on swart-browed S-l-sb-rt—he's almost like my sire.
Let him who thwarts the nephew's will beware the uncle's ire 1"
So spake the varlet, B-lf-r; and dread and silence came
On all the people at the sound of the Cecilian name;
For now there was no tribune—no eloquent J-hn Bh-giit,
To make the rich man tremble and guard the poor man's right;
There was no sturdy H-ht-not-n—no honest Ch-mb-rl-w;
For most of the old champions flocked in the Tory train.
Yet ere the varlet B-lf-b again might seize the maid,
Who clung tight to stern M-rl-t's skirt, and sobbed and shrieked
for aid.
Forth through the throng of gazers the Grand Old Gl-dst-ne pressed,
And stamped his foot, and thumped his palm, and smote upon his
breast,
And sprang unto that rostrum by many a poet sung,
And where, aforetime, many a year had pealed his silvery tongue,
And beckoned to the People, and in bold voice and clear, [hear.
Poured thick and fast the burning words which tyrants quake to
"Now, by your children's cradles, now, by your father's graves,
Be men to-day, ye Liberals, or be for ever slaves!
For this did Cromwell give us laws P For this did Hampden bleed P
For this was the great vengeanoe wrought, upon the Stuart's seed P
Shall a oat's snarl alarm the race who braved the lion's roar P
Shall we, who beat great B-c-nbf-ld, crouch to the bland B-lf-b P
Oh, for that ancient spirit that curbed the nobles' will I
Oh, for the men of Thirty-two, who passed the famous Bill I
In those brave days our Liberals stood firmly side by side,
They faoed the Tory fury, they tamed the Tory pride
Shall what their care bequeathed to us, our madness fling away P
Is the ripe fruit of three-score years all blighted in a day P
0 crier, to the polling summon the eager throng!
0 tribunes, breathe the word of might that guards the weak from
wrong I
No, by the earth beneath us. and by the sky above,
We will not yield to B-lf-h's hate, Hibernia, whom we love.
A little late we show it, but oh I 'tis true and hot;
And if the Tories doubt that truth, we '11 show them what is what.
Leave, leave, to poor Hibernia, her dearest tie to life,
The hope that springs midst all her woe, and after all her strife;
One gentle speech—O'Br-n's—a century's hatred cures;
The yoke of love Hibernia courts—she will not brook B-lf-r's!
No, let the Maiden's Home be free, its Rule be hers; with pride
She who now loathes ye—as a slave—will love ye—as a bride.
Spare her the inexpiable wrongs, the unutterable shame
Of being shackled and coerced to suit your Party game:
Lest, when her latest hope is fled, her friends are in despair,
Ye learn by proof, in some wild hour, how much the wretched dare 1"

So far the Old Man eloquent I What further P—well, I find
The harp that once at Tullamore wailed forth on every wind
Is just a thrifle out of tune, my throat a little dhry;
Not Tullamore could tame my Muse; the tyrant I defy I
But how they dealt with black B-lf-r. ana how, after the fray,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

House of Commont, Monday Night, February, 27.—First day of
early closing movement. Up to verge of midnight everything went
admirably. Ordinary votes fairly discussed. Irish vote talked about
at large. Everyone satisfied. Old Morality popped out to see that
the shutters were all right for closing promptly at midnight. Divi-
sion taken on Irish vote. Ten minutes left for unconsidered trifles.
Courtney began running through votes. Reached that for National
Gallery, when from below Gangway on Ministerial side, there
flashed a luminous breadth of crumpled shirt-front. A head
of rumpled and now, alas 1 shortening hair, presented itself; a
familiar voice sounded through Chamber, and Committee became
sensible of fact that Cavendish Benttnck was on his legs wanting
to know about most recent purohases for National Gallery.
Deep groan went up from Conservative side. Opposition ironically
cheered and joyously laughed. Hadn't seen Cavendish for weeks.
Certainly was not in his place through sitting. Evening dress showed
he had been to meeting at Exeter Hall or Jerusalem Chamber. Now
dropped in ten minutes to twelve wanting to know about "the
Murder of the Innooents, two panel pictures by Mocetto," of which
the nation had become possessed.
"Does the Right Honourable Gentleman." he asked, liberally
promoting Jackson to the Privy Council, "know who Moketto
was?"
From angry way in which name was pronounced, Joseph Gillis
thought it must be that of a Resident Magistrate, and called out
"Tan, yah!" Thus encouraged, Cavendish went on with his
indictment. There was another picture, a Dutch portrait, painter
unknown, price £50.
"As representative of British taxpayer, I object to portraits by
painter unknown," said Cavendish, his words tripping each other
up as they tumbled out in hot haste.
Loud cheers greeted this declaration. Cavendish next proposed
to read extracts from gilt-edged book borrowed from Library. But
volume always turning up wrong end first, he finally tucked it under
his armpit. To this day no one knows what it was about, or what it
ought to have proved. Excitement growing. Opposition increasingly

hilarious. Treasury Bench taking: on fresh dolour. Completion of
Supplementary Estimates, apparently within reach of hand, and all
arrangements to be upset in this way. If it had been Irish Member
bad enough. But Cavendish Bentinck, of whom no one was
thinking, suddenly to pop up with
his gilt-edged volume (author un-
known) and his anonymousDutch
portrait, was hard to bear.
Presently it turned out by his
own admission, that Cavendish
hadn't seen the pictures he was
condemning, and as gilt-edged
volume continued to be obstre-
perous, he suddenly sat down,
leaving three minutes for Finan-
cial Secretary to explain and
Committee to pass four Votes.

tee's work left uncompleted.

still going on wonderfully well.

tion. Seems all a dream to Old Moralitv. Can't believe things could
possibly go forward so smoothly. Has formed habit of gently
pinching himself, to Bee that he is really awake. This led to
momentary unpleasantness. Just after Bule 6 agreed to without
division, one of Arthur Balfour's legs straying about Bench,
0. M., getting rather mixed, pinched it in mistake. Explained
the error, and profusely apologised. All very well, Arthur
Balfour says; but can't see how by any possibility his leg could
have been mistaken for Smith's.
Nearest approach to animated debate arose on Bule 3, whioh
makes things unpleasant for Member guilty of grossly disorderly
conduct. Old Morality moving it, observed that Rule must
recommend itself to good feeling of all Members of House "—whioh
it didn't. Tat Pat, appropriately assuming the character of
champion of dignity of the House, protested against suoh a penal code.
Debate brought to a conclusion by Joseph Gillis. Been very
quiet since Session opened, but subject under discussion infallibly
drew him. Remembered how, in days of sin, when he used to
be suspended, was accustomed to mount to topmost Bench in
Strangers' Gallery, and frighten New Members by staring them out
of countenance, or making faces. New
Rules proposed that Members suspended
should not be permitted to enter precincts
of House.
"Sir," said Joseph, waving a friendly
hand towards the Chair; "It seems to me
that the moral influence of the Speaker
is quite enough to keep order with-
out these 'ere Rules."
Hardly a dry eye in the assem-
bly as these tremulous notes fall
on its listening ear.
"Beautiful!" cried Plunket:
"Since Mr. Pecksniff appeared
in light attire on the landing at
Mrs. Todgers's, and besought the
assembled boarders to join him in
being moral, nothing so touching
as this."
Not a word said after J. B. had
spoken. House at once divided.
Pretty in the lobby afterwards as
Joky B. strolled along, his head
bent in thought, like the bowed
head of the ripened grain, to see
James Watson, Magistrate for
Staffordshire, Salop, and Worces-
tershire, and natron of the living
of Berwick, involuntarily, as it

the retreating figure with reve-
rential glance. Business done.—Further debate on New Rules.
Thursday. Great case of Right of Publio Meeting argued before
Speaker, and Jury composed of some 500 Members. Russell, Q.C.,
for Plaintiff; Matthews, QC, for Defendant Waddt, Q.C.,
tucked brief under arm, .and awaited his opportunity. Other

Counsel appearing were Bradlaugh (C.) and Coutts-Burdett—or
is it Br/RDETT CouttsP Whichever it be, he succeeded in eliciting
murmur of approval from Jury-box by delicate reference to West-
minster Abbey. When, he said, he contemplated the possibility of
lawlessness running riot in the streets of London, he thought of
Westminster Abbey. "Like Mrs. Gummidge, thinking of the
Old 'un," said Lockwood, just baok from Cirouit. "Suppose he
has a vested interest in the place. But his concern for it certainly
seems a little premature."
Also Charles Hall, Q..C, Attorney-General to the Prince of
Wales, of whom Harcourt says, " He has the gravity of a judge
with the figure of a light comedian." His speech bright, lucid,
convincing, and oommendably short—that's Hall, and quite enough
to make a House of Commons reputation.
Wilfrid Lawson so pleased with speeoh that he knocked off little
pome to tune of song familiar in his. hot youth called " Sam Hall."
Here's the first verse:—
My name it is " Chaklss " Hall, Q.C., and what they call
Joy erince! (Bis.) At-tor-ney Ge-ne-raZ
My name it is Charles Hall, To my Prince! (Bit.)
Bradlaugh wound up night's'proceedings in vigorous speech,
listened to with attention by] orowded House. Strange how
whirligig of time (whatever sort of conveyance that may be) brings
its revenges. Not many years ago Members crowded the Lobby to
see Bradlaugh kioked downstairs. Now they throng the Benches
to hear him reply to "his learned friend," the Home Secretary
Before this came on, Sage of Queen Anne's Gate raised question of
Chamberlain's expenses in his Mission to United States. £3900
asked for. Sage, bringing out slate and pencil, works little sum to
show that this comes to £30 a day, whioh, considering, as he says,
hotel expenses in the States are at price fixed is staggering.
Joseph Gillis, who, as Paymaster-General of the Parnellite forces,
knows something about expenses, quite depressed.
"Look at that now," he says. "Thirty pounds a day! Why,
there isn't one of the bhoys who wouldn't contract to take as much
a month, and think himself well off."
No bounds to Gladstone's quite appalling generosity. Comes
forward to defend Chamberlain's Mission. Isn't quite sure of the
£30 pound a day, but has nothing save honeyed words for the errant
Joseph. In contrast with this speeoh comes Tat Pat, frothing and
vapouring, bellowing abuse of Chamberlain, as if the Speaker were
stone deaf.
"Always seems to me." said Randolph, reflectively twirling his
moustache, "that Tat Pat's oratorical accessories are incomplete.
Never see him stand up and shout, but miss something."
"What's that?" said Brodrick, anxious to learn from the
Master.
"His harrer, dear boy—his barrer, with its enticing load, whether
of the shy retiring winkle, the rose-tipped carrot, or the coyly curle d
green." Business done.—Debate on Sir Charles Russell's Motion.
Friday.—Russell's Motion'on again. More legal lore. Nearly
every Member now speaks of his neighbour as "my learned friend."
Henrt James openly calls Speaker " me lud." Sergeant-at-Arms,
the spirit of the Usher strong upon him, has greatest difficulty to
Erevent himself calling out "Silence 1" At five minutes to twelve
rother Pickersgill rose, spread out his brief, and proposed to
answer the Attorney-General, who had just sat down. Only five
minutes before division must be taken, if at all, to-night. Suoh a
roar filled the Court, shook the leaves of brother Pickersgill's
brief, and set his wig awry. Brother Smith came to the rescue.
Pounced with extraordinary agility. "Me lud " then submitted the
case to jury, who by considerable majority returned verdict of Not
Guilty. Home Secretary promptly left dock; was met at gates by
company of friends, who took him off to supper.
Business done. — Russell's Resolution rejected by 316 votes
against 224.
A Matter of Course.—The Committee for the Waterloo Cup
consists of one noble and seven distinguished sportsmen ; the Judge
Mr. Hedlet,_ and the Slipper Mr. T. Wilkinson. When weather
doesn't permit the ordinary coursing to come off, the Committee
have healthy exercise within their reach by staying at home and
playing at hunt the Slipper,— Wilkinsonio non obstante.

"IX THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING."
Yes, Sir, "The days when we went Gipsying:, a long time ago,"

beating time to the ballad tunes with all the fervour of youth, as
the fresh strawberry mark on her arm was discovered, and Arline

Now "a tanner," which, within the present century, was always
"sixpence" ("two bob and a tanner'' was the cabman's half-
crown), was perhaps equal in Shaxspeare's time to about four
times that amount. Yet, even if this be so, what could the price of
everything have been, and what could have been the Gravedigger't
estimate of Hamlet, when he expressed his opinion that a couple of
shillings (if that were the Elizabethan value of the "tanner.") would
him "nine year"?
VOL. XCTT.
OUR REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.
Be/ore Mr. Commissioner Punch.
A Journalistic Specialist introduced.
The Committioner, Well, Sir, you look pale and ill. What can
I do for you?
Witnest. I am a Dramatio Critio on a morning paper, and my
pallor is caused by incessant labour.
Com. Really I was under the impression that your post was a
light and pleasant one.
Wit. Ah, that was many years ago. In the Sixties a new piece
came out about once a month, and there was plenty of time to see it
and think it over before sitting down to write a criticism.
Com. And now, I suppose, a greater demand is made upon the critio?
Wit. Certainly. There is a great deal of competition amongst
the dailies, and little important as a Dramatic Critio is considered,
his notice must be published as soon after the performance as
possible.
Com. Is this your only complaint?
Wit. Certainly not. After all, Art suffers rather than the writer,
when a notice has to be done at express rate speed. So, as a pro-
fessional journalist, I should find little fault with the exigencies of
the machine-room and the publishing office. But our great griev-
ance is that whereas a morning performance was in the olden times
nearly as scarce as a blue moon, nowadays they are as numerous as
blackberries in the Autumn.
Com. Do you object to morning performances P
Wit. Most strongly. Occasionally they give us a sort of dress
rehearsal for the piece intended later on to form a part of the
evening programme, and on these occasions they are defensible but
not welcome. But when they are merely vehicles for the exhibition
of "vaulting ambition over-reaching itself," and crass conceit
enjoying a field-day, it is time to remonstrate!
Com. You speak warmly 1
Wit. Have I not reason so to do? Will you believe it, Sir, but
last week I went to the theatre eleven times 1
Com. Really 1 Well then, perhaps you can tell me what you
thought of The Power of Love of Miss Lindley?
Wit. I would rather not say. The name is not new; it served as
a second title of Balfb's Opera Satanella.
Com. Was The Power of Love funny P
Wit. Some of it was very funny. For instance, there was a dram-
taking Doctor, who, after poisoning his " best patient," went about
crying for someone to buy him a practice. We screamed at him 1
Com. Was the heroine funny too?
Wit. Well, no, she was good, but her part was absolutely ridicu-
lous. It speaks well for her that the audience did not hiss her,
Because she is bored with her home, she attempts the life of her
father—believes she has killed him—enjoys balls and suppers
without the least remorse, and ultimately " takes up " with a gentle-
man who looks like a country fair giant with a turn for dentistry 1
Com. And is she hanged in the last Act?
Wit. Oh, no 1 Because the poisoned draught, by an accident, does
not reach her father's lips, she is hailed as an innocent woman by all
the dramatit pertonce with every sign of rejoicing.
Com. Dear me, this sort of thing seems rather trying P
Wit. I should think so I But the Power of Love was rather above
the average. It must be remembered that Miss Lendlet dramatised
a novel—nearly always an unsatisfactory labour. Sometimes "the
new and original pieces "produced at Matineet are simply intolerable.
Com. And I suppose they are usually " slated."
Wit. Of course. That is one comfort, they are crushed and never
appear again.
Com. I can quite understand the feeling of annoyance their per-
formance must create; still it seems to me a little unjust that there
should be no appeal.
Wit. There would be, were they played in the ordinary way—in
the evening—and removed from the Dills if they failed to please.
Com. What is your remedy P
Wit. I would abolish morning performances, except for charities.
Com. I am obliged to you, 1 will make a note of your suggestion.
[ The Witnett thanked the Committioner, and withdrew.
The Odds in ouk Favoub.—We have come to be a large and
liberal generation. Our noble selves are not as were our narrow
progenitors. They used to boast that every Englishman could beat
any three Frenchmen—that was to say, foreigners. We have oeased
to be so insular. We don't say that. No, but haven't we been
acting as if we thought so still? Don't our preparations and pre-
cautions for national defence against possible hosts of allied enemies
appear to have been calculated_ on the presumption asserted in
the above sometime popular sayiDg^as to the proportion of three
to one?

THE SWEATER'S FURNACE: OR, THE REAL CURSE" OF LABOUR.

"All the circumstances of the trade, the hours of labour, the rate of re-
muneration, and the sanitary conditions under which the work is done are
disgraceful ... In the 'dens' of the Sweaters, as they are called, there is
not the slightest attempt at decency. . . . In the vast majority of cases work
is carried on under conditions in the highest degree filthy and unsanitary. In
small rooms, not more than nine or ten feet square, heated by a cuke fire for
the preseer's irons, and at night lighted by flaring gas-jets, six, eight, ten,
and even a dozen workers may be crowded . . . The stench and foul vapours
about the place are very bad ... As regards hours of labour, earnings, and
sanitary surroundings, the condition of these people is more deplorable than
that of any body of working men in any portion of the civilised or uncivilised
world."—See Lord Dunraven's Speech on the Sweating System.
Its horrible
"In the sweat of thy brow thalt
thou eat thy bread!"
What hideoua echo from mock-
ing lips
Rings through this den of despair
and dread,
Where the hot fume mounts and
the dank steam drips P
What devilish echo of words di-
vine?
Oh, gold hath glitter and gauds are
fine,
And Mammon swaggers and Mode
sits high,
And their thrones are based on this
human stye 1
"That hole of sorrow," the last
dark deep
Of Dante's dream, may no longer
keep
eminence. Singers
sweet
Of buds that burgeon and brooks
that fleet [Spring;
Beneath the touch of the coming
Come here, cast eyes on this scene
—and sing!
Sing, if the horror that grips your
throat
Will leave you breath for one
golden note;
Rave of March in a rhythmic rap-
ture;
Rhapsodise of the coming of May,
Seek from the carolling lark to
capture [lay
A lilt of joy that shall fire your
With a rural jubilance strong to
drown
The maddened moan of these
thralls of Town.

"Could I command rough rhymes and hoarse!"
The Florentine cried. What keen fierce flow
Of lyric fervour hath fire or force
To search this scene of woe?
The long; hours dull and slow
Beat heavily here, like the pulse of pain
In a famished wanderer's failing brain.
Corpse-like gleameth eaoh pallid cheek
Through the lurid flare and the loathsome
reek.
'Tia a fight for life, but eaoh laboured breath
la one step more on the road to death.
Pity the slave in the pathless swamp,
The clutch of pestilence, cold and damp,
Closing, closing, closing still
On panting bosom and palsied will!
But these poor thralls of merciless Trade P—
Sentiment may not contend with law.
Here is a plague that cannot be stayed,
Iron doctrine and learned saw
Bar the way
To a better day.
These slaves must sweat for their pitiful pay.
And the Sweater is heaven-born — so they
say!
Heaven-born! Yes; who shall dare decline
To vield to Economy's right divine,—
That latest incarnation
Of Ccesarism in sordid flesh?
For souls once tangled in Mammon's mesh
There's no emancipation.
Sew on, sew on, in the glare and reek,
Ye men unmanned, and ye women meek.
With back low-crouching, and bloodless
cheek!
Sew on, sew on, whilst the gaslights flare
Through, the stifling steam and the tainted air!
The jungle-scourge's loathsome lair
Is scarcely fouler. What doth he care.
The Sweater smug—so the good round gold
From his human furnace is hourly rolled?
For him ye toil, for his gain ye tire.
Your lives are fuel to feed his fire.
His the new Alchemy—Mammon's own,
Trade's trick is transmutation.
Commerce hath found the Philosopher's Stone;
The poor man's need
Is the source and seed
Of Wealth's accumulation.
Fate hath its formula, life its plan:
The many must, 'tis the few that can;
Man's cheapest tool is a helpless man.
Can Justice contend with Supply and
Demand?
So the Sweater heateth throughout the land
His furnace fierce.
Yet a cry will pierce
Now and anon through the tainted air
From the tortured creatures in torment there;
A moan of sorrow, a piteous prayer;
Questioning faint if the bloated purse
May claim to alter the primal curse
At its own sweet will and pleasure;
To shift its weight by an artful gloss
Till Poverty's share is the pain and loss,
And Wealth's the ease and leisure:
Till, in Sweater's fashion, the text is read,
"In the sweat of their brow shall] they earn
my bread 1"
Mrs. B. ok the Scene Again.—Mrs. Ram
knows nothing of whist, and therefore it is
quite intelligible why she fails to see the
force of a proverbial expression which in-
volves some acquaintance with the game.
She remarked the other day, " I never could
understand the sense of the saying,' When in
doubt, play a trumpet 1' Why 'a trumpet'('
No, my dear, there are some proverbs I think
foolish, and that is one of them." On another
recent occasion she observed, alluding to some
of the pleasures of a country life, "Ah, I
love fowls. I remember when we lived in
the country, and used to keep a lot of Bant-
ings."

A Rise in Waterfalls.—11 Niagara in London" is unquestionably the best panorama
that has yet been seen. The deception is perfect, and it is difficult in the extreme to decide
where the real ends and the canvas commences. The scene is quite a " rus in urbe" with its
woods and flowers, and particularly its poles, although the last are telegraphic and not
human. Attached to the view of the great waste (if anything can be called a waste where
a shilling is charged for admission), of waters is a restaurant a la carte or otherwise. So
that diners or lunohers have no difficulty in discovering what should come after the deluge,
and, as they pleasantly discuBs the good things provided for them, they can murmur (with
Shakspeare), " What a fall was there!"
Scotch Mixture.—The Sootch Becky Sharp seems to have taken in even the astute
Professor Blackie, who has written to say that this was no wonder, as (we quote from
memory, intending to quote from Blackie) "she would have taken in the Deil himself."
And yet the latter personage is not so Blackie as he is painted. So whioh ought to have the
best or worst of it, Auld Clootie or Auld Blackte?

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Common), Monday, March 5.—Grand attack to-night
upon Government in respect of system of National Defences.
Opposition almost exclusively conducted by warriors seated on
Ministerial side, and usually regarded as Friendlies. Mixed forces
drawn from Army and Navy; appeared to be acting on individual
account; conducted attack in guerilla fashion. But the whole
force under secret command of General Lord Grandolph, Y.C.,
who occupied a safe position on an eminence above Gangway, and
cultivated the expression of Napoleon crossing the Alps.
Captain Oolomb led off. Was in faot, as Brodrick said, "the
advanoe Colomb." His tactics extraordinary, but'not new. Very
old story, especially in Asiatic warfare, for attacking party to
advanoe with loud cries. Colomb adopted this strategy with un-
qualified success. Began his speeoh at topmost note of powerful
voice, and kept it up for nearly an hour. "If the Monument could
speak," said Arthur Balfour, patting his hands to his ears,
suppose its conversational tone would be something like Colomb's
when addressing House of Commons."
Effeot remarkable. Completely cleared space immediately round
him. At early hour of engagement shouted Childers clean off
Front Opposition Bench. A volley of sentences 'delivered in rapid
succession at the shout, struck Home Secretary in the abdomen like
a piece of old red sandstone. "Subsequent proceedings interested him
no more."_ Even General Lord Gbandolph, Y.C., though not imme-
diately within range, so alarmed by ricochet of violently flung
sentences, that he took early opportunity of retiring to his tent.
Only for his wig, which deadened1 sound, Speaker would have gone
to his chop stone-deaf. Old Morality, writing letters in his far-off
room, so stung by one of Colohb's observations, that he sent in
word to offer Select Committee at once, if Colohb would shout no
more about Royal Commission. Stafford Noethcote entrusted
with message; could not stand the blast when within speaking dis-
tance, and after gallant effort retired, leaving Colohb erect, solitary,
and triumphant, in the waste he had created. Finished up with a
terrific tornado of peroration, and amid the profound silence that
seemed thereafter to reign, the few surviving Members thought they
heard faint echo of voice calling attention to present condition of
our Military and Naval resources.'
This was Walter Barttelot bringing up reserves, and moving
for Royal Commission. Colohb had had the first place with Amend-
ment, which duly appeared on.the paper. One of earliest victims of
the terrific storm was this Amendment. Pulverised, shattered,
blasted into space; not a trace of it left. So Barttelot got bis
chance. As piece of strategy, this move thoroughly successful.
Ministers so unnerved and shaken by continuous tornado, hadn't
nerve for anything. Opposition also silenced. So Grandolph, V.C.,
brought up his men one after the other, including Bbbesford, who
pounded away at Treasury Benoh till there wasn't a sound timber in
its construction. But honours of the day remained with the rever-
berating Colohb.
Business done. — Skirmish
round Army Estimates.
Tuesday. — Quite a Scotch
debate to-night. Lively, too.
with commendable absence of
jooularity. Geoboe Cahpbell
began it. Moved addition to
New Rules providing for Sootch
Grand Committee. Convincing
speech, but not nearly bo elo-
quent as the way in which Sir
George subsequently wrestled
with his knees as speaker
after speaker followed,
and casual conversation
enlarged into set debate.
It was Gladstone set
the ball rolling. Not
often a chance of pre-
senting himself before
House in capaoity of
Scotch Member. Sud-
denly remembered to-
night has Scotoh blood
in his brains, and
represents Sontoh con-
stituency. Unfortun-
ately Harcoubt absent.
Otherwise he, too, would Mr- Bolton 8 c°8ltatl4n-
have recalled his descent from the Stuarts, and urged appointment
of Sootch Standing Committee.

It was Mare Stewart who brought up Gladstone. A quiet
thoughtful man is Mare. Perhaps a little funereal in manner.
His habitual woe aggravated to-night by a sudden gift of second
sight. Campbell's Motion plain and practical enough to ordinary
men. Stewart Marked much below surface. Under Campbell's
muffler he saw the "peard" of Home Rule. Behind that he saw the
Disestablishment of the Church. Bolton, who had been furtively
thinking .of voting for the Motion, relapsed into' state of perturbed
though tfulness. Gladstone joyously jumped up and threw himself
into the fray.
After this the armies were set in battle array. House summoned
to consider' Procedure Rules, launched forth into Home Rule
Debate. The Front Opposition Benoh filled up with young men
eager for the fray. George Campbell's knees were raised higher
and higher, and hugged in increasing satisfaction. The louder the
controversy raged, the higher his exaltation. Repeated to himself,
in sort of ecstasy, a long-forgotten stanza:—
"0 what a parish, what a terrible parish,
0 what a pariah is Little Dunkel' I
They hae hang-it the minister, drowned the precentor,
Dung down the steeple, and druoken the bell!"
As midnight drew on, Courtney could stand it no longer. Had
ten minutes of wild delight. Turned upon Treveltan, battered
Brtce, and nearly snapped off Campbell-Bannerhan's head because
he had presumed to shake it.
"Well, well," said Cahpbell-Bannerhan. when he had recovered
from temporary fright, "you shouldn't grudge Courtney an occa-
sional fling. Think of all he must suffer when he sits in Chair,
closely follows a debate, and feels the temptation to rise and show
successive disputants what fools they are, and blind. His secret
sufferings must be terrible. Can't grudge him a little blood-letting."
Admirable debate, but—
Business done.—None.
Thursday Night.—General Lord Grandolph, Y.C, girt ononis
sword, put on all his medals (including
the Jubilee), tightened his belt and at
beat of drum, being on the stroke of
half-past four, stepped into the breach.
A gallant sight that stirred all hearts.
Special interest in manoeuvre, it being
whispered that Gbandolph, having
strategically ordered Barttelot on in
advance, would take an opportunity of
shooting him in the back. As for Minis-
ters they were sure to be peppered. Only
people who felt safe were the natural
Opposition on benohes opposite. Every-
one near the General felt uncommonly
uncomfortable. On the war prance for
an hour and a half. Bullied Stanhope,
jeered at Goschen, and made the white
teeth of Old Morality shake in their
sockets. But Barttelot somehow
esoaped. Probably Grandolph forgot
him, or by accident shot the wrong man.
Pretty to see the face of the Colonels and
the Captains as Grandolph prattled of
bayonets and fought his battles o'er again.
Didn't know whether to laugh or cry, sat
gloomily silent. Hamlet bo unnerved
that, presently rising and being met with
cries for division, silently and reproach-
fully regarded the House and sat down
without a word.
All this fine to to see. But nothing to
later appearance of Old Morality in quite new character as Man of
Mystery with proposal about alternative inquiry which should
supersede Barttelot's demand for Royal Commission. Sort of
thimble-rigging business. There was pea in the shape of sheet of
note-paper on which proposal was written. There were three thimbles
represented by as many confused statements attempted by 0. M.
"Under which thimble is the pea?" Old Morality asked, looking
as Joseph Gillis said " more moraller than ever."
Childers said it was there; Cahpbell-Bannerhan declared it
was there I Walter Barttelot was certain he could spot the
thimble. As for Grandolph, waxing his moustache so as to look at
least like Napoleon the Third, he said there was no pea at all.
Old Morality very angry. Scene of general confusion. Speaker
put Amendment. Barttelot didn't challenge division; seeing
which, Irish Members obligingly pressed for a division. That man
of war, Grandolph, Y.C, suddenly stricken with great fear. If
House divided, poverty of his resources would be disclosed. The
Colonels and the Captains would stand by the Government, and his
Grand Army would be revealed, as men in buckram. At olose of
hour and half's speech he had solemnly declared must vote for

An Eloquent Speech.

Amendment. Now by way of postscript blabbered out "Don't

two or three minutes; then allowed Amendment to be negatived.
So the great battle ended in smoke.
Business done.—Grot into Committee on Army Estimates.
Friday Night.—Kihg-Habkan walking' about Lobby in rather
low spirits. Bill for his salary on again to-day, and again blocked
by Irish Members. "What makes incident peculiarly embarrassing

exposition of his scheme for conversion of National Debt. King-

cess in your American tour, and will rejoice to welcome you on your

ANOTHER ODE TO MARCH.
[Being a Counterblast to Mr. A. C. Swinburne's rhythmical rhapsody in
the "nineteenth Century." By one who has certainly "learned in
sujfcring " what he endeavours to "teach in song.")
I.
Eke frost-Blush and snow-slopping dried up and went, and the
horrors of Winter had slid out of sight,
The ways of the wood pavement fouler were far than a olay-country
lane on a mucky March night.
The breath of the month of the winds had stabbed us through top-
coats and mufflers, and made us afraid.
Such bronchial bothers, such blossomy noses, such frost-bitten
fingers for man and for maid 1
The sea was not lovelier then than the land, each appeared in a
dismal and desolate plight;
But the Winter is not so much worse than the Spring-time; each
plays up the mischief with pleasure and trade.
March, master of winds, is a flatulent fraud, a marshal of banes and
a bringer of blight.
n.
And now that the rage of your rhythmical rapture, your revel of
rhyming has finished its flow,
Oh, incontinent Algernon Charles, what the dickens you mean by
such rubbish I should like to know.
How. how can you love and rejoice, you, leader and lord of the
lyrists of curses and scorn,
In a beast of a month that half drives one to madness, and makes a
man wish he had never been born P
Have you shaken the snow from your Bhoes on a doormat, with frost
have your nose and your lips been aglow P
Save you met a March wind coming sharp round a corner, your
mackintosh drenched and your gingham all torn,
And tried to take breath in the nip of North- Easters P No,
Algernon Charles, or you 'd never talk so!
m.
Fain, fain would I have but again all the health and the comfort
March blasts have dispelled and consumed;
I tell you, my lad, if you tip us suoh drivel, your fame as a bard is
decidedly doomed.
Come, candidly, Algernon, now, do you relish these nose-rasping
winds, and these shoe-soaking showers P
Get out! 'tisn't possible, Swinburne, my boy; you are longing,
like us, for the sun and the flowers.
Why tell taradiddles concerning a month, when one only is warm
when in bed he's entombed,
When pneumonia's rampant, bronchitis about, and rheumatics!
pangs are our lot at all hours P
One smile of the sun when the sweet June wakes him is worth all the
"snow-flowers " that ever have bloomed.
rv.
When the sunshine quenches the snowshine—suss it!—when April
hooks it, and June follows May,
There may be a little look in for the poet, and then, if you like, my
dear boy, have your say.
Midst the leaves we may dream, and desire, and rejoice, with a
song for our smiles and thanksgivings. But now P
You're as mad as its hares for this maddest and saddest of months
to kick up such a rhythmical row.
And somewhere surely the sound of the laughter of mocking demons
must echo your lay,
The imps of Lumbago and Influenza, the wheezy chest, the neuralgic
brow,
Must chortle loud in their Arctic empire, to think they have nobbled
one bard anyway.
v.
Are your feet at ease in a pool of water, when winds blow cold from
the waste North Sea P
Oh, it's all very well in a flowery lyrio, you know that in fact it is
fiddle-de-dee.
Does the East wind suit your eyes? Does the blast of an iceberg's
breathing assist your breath P
Is March, with the wild North-easter raging, as fine a thing as your
poem saith P
Is there not some rot in your rapture of passion, reiterate mellowly
though it may be P
Our hearts revolt at the blast of your^clarion, Charles. Upon winds
we 're aware you are death;
But leave to Rengsley the "brave North-easter;" from fudge like
this let the world go free.
VI.
For the " breath of its lips " is bunkum, and bunkum the fulsome
praise of your flowing soDg.
"Glad god of the North-east wind?" Great Cssab I 0 Swinburne,
dear boy, that is coming it strong!
Its kingdom is—terror, and turpentine plasters, mustard poultices,
ipecao. wine.
Night lit with the flame of the night-light dismal, the roupy cough—
Jrou should just hear mine I
eep for the gaspings that deepen and quicken, for fevered fancies
a fiery throng,
The world knows well that the month's a nuisance, and you may
depend will at once deoline
To be diddled e'en by your dithyrambio; because, old fellow, we know
your're wrong.
vn.
The body is drenched one dismal moment, the next one's skin is as
dry as starch.
Its rains that chill us are most disgusting, and equally so are its gales
that parch.
What! kindle mortals to love and laughter by lauding the beastliest
winds that blow P
Arouse our fondness for wintry wetness, for choking dust or for
blinding snow P
No, no, your lips are eloquent, Algernon, set in Apollo's own
genuine arch;
But neither the flame that fires your tropes, nor the fervour that
setteth your figures aglow,
Shall gammon us into the fatuous folly of making a god of the wind
of March!

Stricken with sorrows as with dart on dart,
With folded pinions, but unfailing heart,
The Teuton Eagle sits, constrained to mark
That splendid sun sink in the deepening dark.
So glorious a course should have a olose
As calmly gradual as the twilight rose
Of a long day of June that softly blends
With hastening night, and in hushed silence ends.
Not so the Fates ordained. Tempestuous clouds
Surround the sunset, lowering sorrow shrouds
Its latest gleamings, golden, yet, and grand.
It sinks, and sadness strikes across the land.
When Thule's king his golden goblet hurled
To the grey depths that wash around the world,
What thoughts possessed his vassals as it sank
To lodge with shattered wrecks and sea-wrack dank?
"He drank no more," that monarch old and brave,
Worthy crown-wearer, "leal unto the grave."
An older, mightier King, as stout, as leal,
Erect as some tall pine, and tense as steel,
Has bowed to the last foeman, and at last
The well-won oup of conquest from him cast—

Waits with bent head and silent sympathy;
And England, from her isle beyond the foam,
Looks to that high but sorely stricken home,

JOSEPH JOKING GOSCHEN.
(Chez Lui.)
Tee great success of the Chancellor of the Exchequer as a
punster nas been so marked that 85, Fleet Street has been absolutely
flooded with inquiries as to the ways and means adopted by the
Right Hon. Gentleman to produce his brilliant effects. The excel-
lent jeu de mot about Mr. Windham being "on the Spree " * while
staying in Berlin (a pun which, it is said, has been translated into
every European language) appears to have been thrown off as a care-
fully prepared impromptu; but the companion plaisanterie about the
Court Theatre being " no Criterion " t shows traces of greater elabora-
tion. It is, of course, against etiquette to answer the question
whether Mr. Goschen writes for the periodical in which these lines
appear, but it may be safely conjectured that nothing from his
accomplished pen has ever been published in these pages. We hope
on a future occasion to fully explain the manner in which the " Comic
Chancellor" concocts his amusing conceits, but at present (as our
scheme requires a great deal of tact and bribery) we must request our
readers to rest satisfied with the publication of the following quaint
cranks and oddities that have caused endless merriment during the
past week wherever they have been related.
The Chancellor, the other evening, was witnessing the per-
formance of Miss Anderson in the Winter's Tale, at the Lyceum,
when he called his Private Secretary's attention to the fact that the
charming young actress appeared in two roles. "This makes me
believe," said the Bight Hon. Gentleman, "that our delightful
American visitor must be very well bred!" The Private Secretary
had to leave the box in convulsions of laughter. On reaching the
lobby, however, the young man gave a proof of his insincerity by
orying like a child.
Lord Halsrury, in conducting the Lunacy Acts Amendment
Bill through Committee, was heard to murmur to himself, "This
measure should have been introduced in Paris rather than in London.
* The Spree is the river on which the capital of Prussia is situated. To be
"on the Spree " implies that the person so described is in a cheerful frame
of mind.
t "The Criterion " is the name of Mr. Wyxdham's London theatre.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
It would be more likely to hold water there than here." "Why?"
asked Lord Hobhousk, on the broad grin, who had overheard the
muttered remark. _ "Because," replied Mr. Goschen, promptly, "it
not only deals with lunatics, but is also intended to protect the
Seine!" Lord Herschell was so much amused at the pleasantry
that he forgot to urge half the amendments of which he had given
private notice.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer the other morning, sitting in
the House of Commons noticed that the mace was as usual on the
table. Turning to the Marquis of Harttngton, he pointed out the
beautiful workmanship of the weapon that was once designated by
Cromwell "a bauble." He added, with a smile, "Really, that
Mace is very spicy." Mr. Labouchere said it was the best thing
he had heard in his life, and commenced a lively conversation on
the value of Egyptian securities.
Is is needless to say that the introduction of the Conversion Scheme
gave the satirical statesman an opportunity of making a most mirth-
provoking remark. Lunching with Mr. Bradlaugh and the Arch-
bishop of Canterbury (who nad just returned from a visit to the
Pelican Club), he observed, "I am afraid you fellows think that I
am fond of talking shop. Not a bit of itf But you see this Con-
version scheme of mine is the' percenter of attraction.'" This excel-
lent quip was received with roars of laughter fTom under the table.
But perhaps the gem of the collection is another joke, whioh was
delivered only a few days since. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
was sitting in his room at the Treasury when he noticed that the door
was not quite closed. "Why is the door not a door? " he asked, sud-
denly of the messenger who was bringing in his luncheon. "Because,
Sir," was the prompt reply, " it is a-jar." "Not at all," returned
the witty Cabinet Minister: "because it is an egrets (a negress)."
Some dynamiters in a cellar who overheard the remark were so
amused with it that they then and there abandoned, their dreadful
purpose and adopted the principles of the Liberal Unionists.
Other puns are expected hourly. They will be recorded on their
arrival in our next. One, turning upon Mr. Gladstone being " axed"
something, is nearly completed.
COMIC CLERICS.
Whether one of the results of that mysterious Association which
entitled itself "TheChuroh and Stage Guild" (does it yet exist?)
may have been to enrich the rSpertoire of the Stage at the expense
of the Church, I am not aware, but certain it is that, within the last
few years, we have had more Comio
Clergymen on the boards than at any
previous time in the history of the Drama.
The warm-hearted, ready-witted Irish
Priest was at one time inseparable from
any Irish play after the striking sucoess
of Father Tom in Boucioault's Colleen
Baton. When this oharaoter was played
out, there entered upon the scene the
Muscular English Clergyman, ever ready
to knock down an aggrieved parishioner,
to foil a villain, and protect virtue in
distress; and, indeed, until some more
recent Dramatists came to the rescue, and
revived the gallant Sailor, it seemed at
one time not improbable that the ex-
tremely gentlemanly but decidedly Pug-
nacious Parson would supplant the British
Tar in the affections of the theatre-going
Sublic. But at the Adelphi, under the
eservedly successful regime of the
Messrs. Gatti, the T. P. (not "Tay
Pay ") Cookian spirit has been summoned from the vasty deep, and,
having become embodied in Terriss Firmis, is once more the people's
darling,—no allusion being hereby intended to that marine Btore,
Deptford.
The Belle of Hatlemere chime in with the notions of the Adelphi
patrons^ and it would now be difficult for any author less mellow
dramatic than Pettitt, Sims & Co., to break what Mr. Sydney
Grundy, when some few years ago he couldn't get a piece of his
produced anywhere, used, in the bitterness of his soul, to call " the
ring." So the Stage-Sailor once more finds his home at the Adelphi,
and the Muscular Minister only puts in an occasional appearance;
but the Comio Cleric is ubiquitous. Who began it? I rather fancy
Mr. W. 8. Gilbert was the first to start him, when he turned Mr.
Rutland Barrtngton into a Reverend Vicar in the costume of an
Archdeacon,—the arohest of Archdeacons,—telling us, in a tuneful
ditty, of his bonnes fortunes as a "pale young ourate," though of
course this recital of his success with the ladies was not of suoh a
nature as to bring the blush to the oheek of "the young person,"
no matter how much or how little cheek she might possess. The same
put a Bishop on the stage of the Haymarket, and, not

Mr. Punch welcoming the
Bev. Johnnie Toole, M.A.
to mention other examples that will occur to the habitual playgoer's
memory, there was Mr. Penley as that ridiculous little parson in
The Private Secretary, who revelled in "Ba-ath buns," and
"didn't like London," and the late Mr. John Clayton's Dean—a
Dean every inch of him, poor fellow I—in Pinero's Dandy Dick.
who got into all sorts of scrapes, was taken up by the pohoe, and
was forced to submit to every kind of indignity. I believe Mr.
Wilson Barrett is also playing the part of a Clergyman just
now, but as I have not yet witnessed his performance, I can only
suppose that the humour of the, part would probably be more
subtle than in the instances above-mentioned, though this would
not necessarily prevent the impersonation from being classed with
them as one among such genuinely comio creations.
And now our old favourite, Mr. J. L. Toole, adds one more
picture to the clerioo-theatrical portrait gallery, and appears as
the Bev. Mr. Milliken, M.A., Dean and Tutor of St. Mark's College,
Camford. He isonly called Mr. Milliken, M. A." in the play-bul;
and though in some Colleges the Dean may be a layman—I remember
an instance in point, where the office was only temporary and
nominal—yet it is not so in this piece, as the olerioal character
of Mr. Milliken is emphasised by his pointing out to his fellow-
tutor, that there is a College living vacant, to which he should like
to retire on his marriage.
To see Mr. Toole in cap and gown with Oxford M.A. hood,
looking quite the type of an old-fashioned College Don, is exquisitely
funny in itself, and he is supported by a really good working
company, for whom the piece seems to have been written, as it
would be diffioult to imagine a heartier landlady of the " Bull and
Mitre" than Miss Emily Thorne, any one more suited to the
lively young-lady-like part of Kitty than Miss Violet Vanbrugh,
or a better than Miss Marie Linden for the ingenuous Dora, who
is suoh an artless thing as to be utterly ignorant of College life,
although quite up to making a very good pun about "first-class,
and who sets so nigh a value on truth that she only lets it appear,
as some unique jewel is worn by its fortunate possessor, on very rare
occasions.
Mr. Buxinoton is another exoellent Fellow—of a College, I
mean; scarcely a type of any recognised species of the resident
University Offioial, but the sort of Fellow that a retired Indian
Colonel might be expeoted to make. The young men, Messrs. Gar-
diner and Lowne. are both very good, the latter being a life-like
representative of the 'ordinary Undergraduate; and youthful Mr.
Aubrey Bouctcault looks and acts as the boy he is and is meant
to be. Mr. Shelton gives us a fair specimen of the College gyp, as
accustomed to familiarity with his youthful masters as was Sam
Welter with the Piokwickians, and of course his manner with the
Dean is permissible in the broadly farcical situations invented by
the joint authors, Mr. and Mrs. Herman Merivale. Miss Rate
Phillips acts in her sprightliest manner, looks her prettiest,
and dresses splendaciously, as she is bound to do in Commemoration
Week; but the part presents no special characteristics which can
differentiate it from the stock "lively widow," so useful in comedy.
So muoh for the individuals. The dialogue is sometimes epigram-
matic and generally amusing. The repeated Equivoque struck me as
rather forced, and all that I could clearly make out was that Mr. Toole
was a Dean in difficulties—whioh, after all, is quite sufficient when
you go to enjoy Mr. Toole's peculiarly rich and broad humour.
By the way that any Undergraduates oould possibly, for one minute,
mistake Miss Linden in cap and gown over her ordinary dress,
without even a shirt-collar and tie, for one of themselves, exceeds
even the limits of faroical improbability. This defect can be easily
remedied by the lady herself.
I liked The Butler better than The Don, as far as intrigue goes,
but perhaps the latter has the advantage in dialogue. Anyhow it is
well worth seeing, for the sake of the Rev. Johnnie Toole, Dean—
(ah I I was just going to write "Johnnie Dean," and to those
who remember him what a genial olerio he would have made!)—
Dean of St. Mark's College, Camford, whose portrait as the drollest
Don imaginable will be another welcome addition to the Gallery of
the Comio Clerics of the English Stage. Jack in the Box.
Capital Names in the Atlas.—Last week that distinguished
Afrioan explorer, Mr. Joseph Thomson, taking leave of his friends,
left London by the Oceana, to spend some time in the Atlas Moun-
tains and Morocco. The dangers of the expedition are shared with
him by Lieut. Harold Crichton-Browne, the son of the admirable
Sir James of that ilk. If the proverb " Like father, like son" holds
good in this case, the young Scottish Borderer will not be long
before he has benefited the human race. It appears that the Duke
of Cambridge, reoognising the merits of Mr. Harold Crichton-
Browne, has given nim a year's leave of absence to prosecute his
inquiries. An excellent book may be expected as the outcome of
these leaves bound in Moroooo. Everyone must wish the gallant
explorers sucoess in the wild lands they are about to traverse, and
Bpeedy return home to their native country.

First Well-informed Briton. Well, I've read the Report through, and I'm
blest if I can make head or tail of it. Portsmouth seems to be in a bad way.
Second Well-informed Briton. Oh, no, Portsmouth's all right; or rather, it
will be. Look here, what it says. [Refers to paper.)
"The two ironclad forts should be armed with heavy guns, and made in every respect
secure. The armament of all the forts on this side requires considerable improvement.
It is also necessary to erect a new land-battery."
And then it goes on about the works at the "eastern entranoe," that it says
ought to be carried out with the least possible delay. Here nothing's clearer
than what the Commissioners have to sav about them. Look here. Here are
their very words {again refers to paper) " When they are completed," they say—
"And the minefields have been protected by machine and quick-firing guns, they
believe that the imminent risk to which the dockyard at Portsmouth is at present
subjected will be mainly averted."

a familiar home truth.) Why, what do you think he 'a
Chancellor of the Exchequer for, except to swamp the
country and please the taxpayer?
First Well-informed Briton. If you'll allow mo to
correct you, I think you 're wrong. I certainly saw
somewhere that the Government were prepared to do
something at once. Whether it was £800,000, or
£2,000,000, I'm not quite dear [refers to paper); any-
how, I know they don't mean to let matters slide.
Second Well-informed Briton. Quite so. The Gov-
ernment are fully alive to the gravity of the following'
paragraph from the Commissioners' Report, which says
that:—[Refers to paper.)
"It is not too much to say that the destruction of our great
dockyard at Portsmouth—and in a less degree of that of Ply-
mouth—might be decisive of the issue of a great war; while
the defence of the Thames and Medway is likewise of para-
mount importance. After inquiring carefully into the con-
dition of each of these ports, the Committee have no hesitation
in stating their conviction that deficiencies exist in the defences
of each of them which render our position dangerously insecure."
I have no doubt but that a moderate sum will be set
aside to put the matter in hand to provide against the
possibility of the occurrence of such catastrophes, and, I
should say, without an instant's delay.
First Suggestive Listener. It's a strong Commission.

Second Suggestive Listener [dubiously). I can't quite
say. But I've heard that ten millions is about the
figure fixed by experts as the sum really necessary to
supply the country with an efficient scheme of home

Not that that would be any use as things stand. Where
should we be to-morrow, if this country were suddenly
to be involved in a great Naval war? Why, nowhere.

France is more than a match for us with either, and
before the end of next year will be able to knock us
into a cocked hat. What's the good of "Commis-
sions" and their "Reports"? The administration has
gone to the dogs, and that's the long and short of it.
A Roused Optimist. Stuff, Sir. England was never
better able to hold her own at sea than she is at the
present moment. What if a big gun bursts here and
there, or an ironolad or two turn bottom upwards 1 It
wasn't with big guns and ironclads that we licked the
French at Trafalgar; and what we did then we can do
again, Sir, for we've got the same stuff to do it with.
Bless me, as if I understood all this "Defence" scare.

Casual Outsider {who has a general but vague grasp of the subject). Oh, I

his unavoidable improvidence amongst the "Unemployed."
There is also a Society for the Aid of Discharged Prisoners;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"A strange thing happened."
Haggard Passim.
MR. PUNCH'S VERY QUEER STORIES.
BLACKWOOD'S TALE; OB, A MA8TEB OF BLACK ARTS.
Chattek L
My nom de plume is Blackwood, but I oome of a very ordinary
stock. My father was an Omnibus Proprietor, my mother a Margate
Bathing-woman. I had sixteen brothers and sisters, and we were
generally regarded as an idiotic family. I was no better than the
rest. But I differed from them all in one
special respect. I had a will of my own.
This early developed itself. On one occa-
sion, when an attempt was made to
administer a dose of castor-oil to me,
though both my parents and the rest of
the household held me hand and foot, and
knocked out three of my front teeth in
the struggle to foroe a wine-funnel down
my throat, they never got me to swallow
a single drop. After this I sulked. But
I secretly nursed my will-power. By
assiduous practice it grew to gigantio
dimensions. Everything gave way before it. I tried it on my father,
and willed he should not move. He was instantly pinned to his chair.
The curate called. I made a mental resolution that he should try to
turn a double back-somersault. He at once did so, falling heavily
in the attempt. Then I overturned an omnibus, full inside and out.
Nor did my experiments end here. I found that by my will I could
control inanimate objects as well. With a scarcely expressed wish.
1 split the kitchen-table in half. With equal facility I wrenched
off the front door, and had the drawing-room piano whisked through
the roof of the house, and deposited in the back garden. Feeling
myself thus gifted, 1 recognised the necessity of providing myself
with a wider field for the exercise of my peculiar powers, and I
resolved to go to the University. In almost as short a time than it
takes to relate the fact, I had, by sheer foroe of will, gained an
Oxford Scholarship, taken up my quarters in my College rooms, and
commenced keeping my terms as an Undergraduate.
Immediately on entering into residence I lost no time in testing my
powers of control over the Principal. The very first night I willed
that he should screw up all the Dons in their respective rooms. I
had scarcely framed the resolution when he emerged from his
quarters, dark lantern and appropriate tools in hand, and proceeded
stealthily to execute the task I had mentally allotted to him. The
next morning in ohapel I made him sing, " Two Lovely Black Eyes"
in the midst of the service. My control over him was evidently com-
plete. I felt that I had the Principal well in hand.
And now occurred a circumstance,'which, as the sequel will show,
had a marked influence on the events of my life.
Among my fellow students at St. Anselm's was one named
Gullytoff. He was a dark, middle-aged, long-haired, and swarthy
Asiatic, of repulsive and forbidding appearance, whose wild gestures,
rolling eye and demoniacal expression instantly fascinated me and
absorbed my attention. Something in my appearance struck him
also. We became great chums. He told me his story. It was not an
uncommon one. Connected by blood with a travelling Circus, that
had, by the machinations of a wicked great uncle, been decoyed to the
wilds of Asia Minor, he had one night, after his customary feat of
bursting through several paper hoops in spangled tights, been left
behind on the road, and from that day .to this he had never been able
to trace or even hear anything of the missing troupe since. Under
these circumstances he had seen nothing before him but to journey
to England, enter himself at Oxford for the purpose of studying the
Blaok Arts, by a profioienoy in which he hoped to reoover a clue to
his lost relatives.
I explained to him my powers, and we agreed then and there to
join our forces, and prosecute with all our might and main the object
of his search together. The very next night I made a bonfire of the
whole of my classical library, and supplied its place with a few care-
fully selected works on magio, and was soon deep in the mysteries of
Noctes Diabolica of Hebpiahus, Jobah's Pankleptikon, and the back
numbers of Zadkiel's Almanack.
I found the study of the new "soienoe" all-engrossing. I stuck
to it day and night. For a whole fortnight I cut ohapel, hall, lec-
tures—everything—uninterruptedly. My Tutor and the Principal
sent for me. I took no notice of them whatever. At last the evening
arrived on which we were to hold our first mystic stance. My room
was prepared for the occasion. A huge witch's cauldron bubbled over
a flickering blue flame in the centre; this was encircled by a double
row of human skulls; several alligators were suspended from the
oeiling; a tripod surmounted by an Arabian dish of steaming
aromatic incense stood in each corner, while a night owl was
perched over the bookcase, and a couple of ten-foot snakes wound
themselves noiselessly in stealthy ooils about the floor. My scout's
boy, who brought in my tea, noticed these, and seemed anxious to
quit the apartment.
And now Gotxytoit commenced our incantation. Spiritualistic
phenomena were new to me, and I was at first startled at being
banged on the back by a phosphorescent accordion. Baps followed.
"This is nothing," said Gullytoff, "to what you will see!"
He was right. Scarcely had he spoken before a troop of gibbering
skeletons poured out of the cauldron and flooded the apartment. A
corpse in its shroud sat on the mantel-piece. A crowd of hideous
goblins careered about the staircases and frightened men returning
late to their rooms (after attending a Union debate into fits. Claps
of terrific thunder resounded above the College walls, and the whole
buildings swayed to and fro as if they had been a labouring ship
struggling against an overpowering sea. The Principal came out
into the quadrangle to see what was the matter. He found it peopled
with ghastly shapes, and was immediately seized by a headless illu-
minated ape, who perched itself upon his neck, and clinging wildly to
his College cap, caused him to stagger heavily in the direction of the
gate-porter, crying aloud for help.
At this moment a big blazing balloon of blue fire settled over the
cauldron. In the midst of it sat a little old Jew money-lender with
a frightful grin distorting his malignant features.
"You want .to find the Circus troupe!" he screeched, addressing
Gullytoff in a piping treble. "Ha! ha! ha! Ho! ho! ho!
We '11 see about that to-morrow 1"
Then breaking forth into a wild can-can, he dashed through
the window, where, followed by the now frantio and howling
throng of spirits, ghosts, and goblins we had conjured up, he dis-
appeared, muoh to the surprise of the local fire brigade, who had
been summoned by the authorities, now fairly alive to the fact that
an unusual commotion was occurring within the College precincts^
among the chimneys and spires of the neighbouring public buildings.
So our incantation ended. But I passed a sleepless night.
(To be continued in our next.)
JUSTICE TO THE LADIES!
[By our own Prophetic Descriptive Reporter.)
The House of Commons was in a ferment of excitement. The
great question of the century, "Should Women have the right of
Voting f" was under discussion. Upon the decision of that evening
the matter rested. The Government and Opposition were mixed;
some were in favour of the measure, some against; and all were
anxious. The Grand Old Man had made a grand old speech, which
would have been grander had anyone been able to clearly comprehend
the conclusion to which it pointed. The Tribune of the People, now
the leader of the Tories, had had his Bay, but still Tthe question
remained unsolved. How would it end? Those who had good
memories recalled the fact that the great Earl of Beaconsfield had,
shortly before his lamented death, espoused the cause of the ladies.
But for all that, there was a feeling of uneasiness that, given votes,
seats would follow, and that then the House of Commons would lose
its well-established reputation for being the most comfortable Club
in London. What would become of the husbands, if the wives saw
them home? How would it be possible to plead the excuse of " par-
liamentary duties " for absence from the country house, if man and
his better half were admitted to the same division lobbies P That
was the rub 1 ■ ■
Many of the younger Members had urged the plea that, it was
rude and discourteous to make an invidious distinction between the
sexes; but these juvenile legislators had been laughed or coughed
down by the greyheaded fathers of families. It was all very well
for bachelors to talk, but let them wait until they became married
men, and then the matter would present itself to them under quite a
different aspect. So the debate progressed, speech after speech was
made, and the cloture was ignored in the all-absorbing interest of the
topic under discussion.
At length there was a pause, and a deep silence reigned. All eyeB
were turned towards the Treasury Bench, before which was standing
a Minister, white and trembling with emotion.
"Sir," at last cried the Statesman, struggling with his sobs, "it
is a painful moment, a very painful moment, but I am bound to do
my duty. I must confess that women are superior to men in intelli-
gence, tact, and everything that fits a human being to be a Member
of this honourable House."
Again there was a deep silence, and all present hung upon the
speaker's words. He wiped his eyes, and continued,
"I must remind the House, Sir, of this memorable fact. Many

THE COMING RACE.-A PROPHETIC VISION OF 1988.
"SLAVES OF THE RING."
Old Style.
Yesterday the long-expected mill between Job Brown and Jack
Smith came off before about five thousand patrons of the Noble Art.
Most of the House of Peers and all the House of Commons were pre-
sent, and there was a good sprinkling from the two Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, the Bar, the Army, the Navy, and the
lowest slums. In another part of our paper we have described the
Battle in detail, but here it will suffice to jot down the first round
and the last.
Round 1.—Both men came up smiling. Joe struck out well with
his left, and landed upon Jack's right peeper, whioh immediately
assumed rainbow colours. Upon this Smith retorted with his right
on the snuff-box, breaking the bone, and produoing a fine flow of
the ruby. Smart countering following, until Job went down from a
sledge-hammer blow from Jack. First blood and fall to Smith.
Mound Last.—Both men were groggy and had to be placed faoe
to faoe. It was unsafe to eay which was which or who was who,
aa their features were so mixed that it was impossible to distinguish
them. In spite of this they still struck out, Jack catching Joe a
blow on the side of his head, which severed bis remaining ear. This
seemed to rouse Joe, who made one last effort, crushing Jack's chest
in, and turning his eyes into pease-pudding. This was too much for
Jack, who dropped senseless, and could not be recovered.
It will be seen from the above that both men suffered severely.
The fight is considered one of the best on record.
New Style.
Yesterday the long-expected encounter between Joseph Bbown,
Esq.. and Mr. Zachabiah Smith took place in the presence of six
specially appointed representatives of the sporting world. Amongst
those who would have liked to have been present, had they not been
prevented by engagements elsewhere, were the proprietors of many of
the leading Metropolitan Music-halls. It is an open secret that both
the gallant gentlemen who so nobly fought yesterday are in great
request and can pick their engagements. Mr. Joseph who had just
come from a dance, was in evening dress, while Mr. Bkowk wore a
fashionably-cut shooting suit. Alter smoking some cigarettes, sip-
ping their coffee, and glanoing through the papers, the opponents pre-
pared for the encounter, divesting themselves of their upper clothing.
The battle was of so much interest, that we give it in txtento.
Round 1.—Both gentlemen advanced smiling. On seeing his
opponent's clenched list, Mr. Bbown retired, and was followed round
the ring. Wearying of this manoeuvre he raised his right arm as if
to give a blow, when Mr. Smith went under.
Round 2.—Both rather out of breath from their late exertions.
Mr. Smith touched Mr. Bbown on the shoulder, upon which the
last called out, "Yes, Zachabiah, do you want me?" To which
Mr. Smith answered, "No, Joseph, the touch was accidental." Mr.
Smith raised his fist threateningly when Mr. Bbown went under.
Round* 3 to 36.—These took tome time. There was nothing par-
ticular in any of tbem, save in Bound 43, when Mr. Smith slipped
anH fell, irjaring his note. First blotd to Mr. Bbown.
Round Last.—The tw9 men came up yawning. Mr. Smith was
wearing a piece of sticking-plaster on his nose, and Mr. Brown had
a piece of rag round his wounded little finger. Upon an appeal from
the bystanders the battle was declared drawn, and the combatants
resumed their clothing and fraternised.
It will be seen from the account that both men suffered severely.
The fight is considered one of the best on record.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
I'vf. nothing to say about books this week. I've gone from cover
to cover, and drawn blank. But I think I am on the right scent
now, having just taken up The Prima Donna, by Sutheblahd
Edwards. More of this anon. Its appearance opportunely—or
operatunely — anticipates the coming Season of Drubiolasus
Opkbaticds.
Most newspapers have an " Agony Column," and 'the Illuttrated
London Newt now has a " Payn Column "—a double Payn Column
—every week. In the latest Payn Column, "J. P.," alluding to
the recent story of the Sham Nuns in France, declares that the
dramatic possibilities of the tale "make the poor British novelist's
mouth water." Now, J. P. is not by any means a "poor British
novelist;" but I think I see through him in this case as dearly
as if he were a Payn of glass, and to save him the trouble of
commencing a plot with this material, I beg to inform him that
the story has already been done. It occurs as one of the many
incidents in a French novel which I read within the last three years,
but what its name was, or whether it was written by Boisoobst.
Moktepin, Maupassant, or some other free-and-easy romancist, I
cannot at this moment remember. In this novel the nuns were
mostly sham ones, they had some lambs among them to be fleeced,
and their director, the Abbe somebody, was no clergyman at all,
but a swindler who ultimately fell into the hands of the Police. I
am inclined to think it was one of Boisoobey's, but at all events it
has been done. However, never mind, Mr. James Pain, keep up
your "high spirits." After all, it'b only one "holiday ta*k" the
less, says the Babon ee Book Wobms.
A GOLDEN EGG AGAIN.
Anotheb Great Auk's Egg has turned up, been put up to Aukshun,
and knocked down again, without being smashed, fortunately, frail
a curiosity as it was to come under the hammer. Mr. Stevens, of
King Street, Covent Garden, lately " sold a very line egg of the
Great Auk for £225." It came into the possession of its late owner
in 1851, who then bought it for £18. His name was Wise, and he
was not only to called, but was so. This one egg was ultimately taken
to a good market, and was sold for the sum abovementioned. We hope
it has reached its destination in safety. An accident might happen
from mere Aukwardness. Some of us will be wishing that we had a
private Auk, of a sporting turn, who would lay heavily occasionally.
We wouldn't kill him to see how the trick was done.

we should. Who is it, Shakspkabe or Dr.
Johnson, or somebody, that said taxation
without representation is tyranny? Not to
mention conscience-money, what conscience
can we have to pay any taxes that we can
avoid at all? Allow us votes, and then the
Government will see whether we shall be con-
scientious taxpayers or no! Ever yours,

THE RETURN OF THE WANDERER.
[Mr. Cameron, on resuming his seat, eat on his hat]
Back to the House! Every man, Jok,
Mast own that you came in good time,
Though they who are eager to ban Joe,
May count that to you as a crime.
Well, Joe, yon may e'en let them hammer on,

The Speaker at onoe squelched poor Cameron,
Doubtless he found it a bore.
He fancied, depend, Joe, upon it, you
Turned up to the moment most pat;
What he wished, my dear Joe. was to bonnet you;
What he did was—to sit on his hat!
OYSTER CORNER.

CAUTION.
"so careful, so economical, my dear wlfe is! she always locks cp

vants, YOtJ KNOW 1 He! HE ! . . . She doesn't know I 'ye oot a Key too!"
It seems that t wo or three large firms, Proprietors of
the Whitstable Oyster Grounds, have clapped another
■25 per cent, on to the wholesale price of "natives." Bat
these so-oalled natives of England are said to be really
natives of Franoe, imported hither mostly from Arcaohon,
and only laid down at Whitstable and other places, to be
cultivated and fattened. These molluscs, therefore, in
this country, are not natives at all, but only naturalised
foreitrners. Because an alien oyster has been educated
at Whitstable, it is no more a native the a a man is a
horse because he was born in another stalie. The exor-
bitant price of oysters appears to be mainly owing to the
operations of an Oyster Ring, in which, as in the Betting
King, there is muoh at work like jockeysbip. In the in-
terest of oyster-eaters, with a view to counteract that
kind of practice upon the market, what do financiers say
to the formation of a Native Oyster Company (Limited).
"Oh, for an hour of brave old Dandolo!" That is to
say, with a slight abbreviation and alteration, Oh, for the
return of the good old days of Dando! Then the abun-
dance of oysters enabled that once illustrious oyster-eater
to eat his fill of them at a cost which would have been
unnecessary for him to count, and he never did. Let our
ory be, "Down with the price of Oysters!" and let us
form a bold Company to beard the Oyster in his Shell!
Motto, "Solvitur Dando."

NOTES OF THE WEEK.
Went to hear Oratorio, The Rose of Sharon, by Dr. Mackbnzie
—not Sir Morrell, but the composer—on Tuesday night, Maroh 15.
Very fine—the Oratorio, not the night—as snow was falling and
making slush. Blizzards were about. What a splendid title for an
Oratorio, The Blizzard. That is to say it
would be a splendid title, if its sound were
not slightly suggestive of Buzzard. Still,
there's something weird and German
about the notion of The Wizard and the
Blizzard. "Gizzard" ought to be in it
somehow. So ought "Lizard." Will copy-
right title. To return to St. James's HalL
The night was a very bad one: Mackin-
tosh outside, Mackenzie within. With
Madame Nordica as the Sulamite, all
were Sulamitily pleased. Lloyd's notes
are still unchanged, but jokes about" un-
wrapped up in the music, and all°y'd " pleasure quite played out, ex-
quite carrried away by <*Pt. perhaps, by G--RGEJokin G-8CH-N.
Madame [Schumann. Miss Hope Glenn — romantio name—
looked majestic, and yet as womanly as
"a woman"—for that was her rile among the dramatis persona—
should, who possesses her rare contralto voice, not so rioh, perhaps,
as rare. Santi.ey looked uncommonly sapient as King Solomon, ana
took no part in any duet or trio. I suppose in this he showed
the proverbial wisdom of the character, as his Solos were given in
the best style of this King 'Solo'-HON. Throughout the perform-
ance, he kept his eyes fixed on his book with the pertinacity of a
musioal St. Anthony. But for the subject, which of course cannot
be placed on the stage, what a spectacular opera it would make 1
Supposing the subject ohanged and the libretto secularised and accom-
modated to the score for Btage purposes, introductions would still
na necessary lor the sake of variety. Wiihont scenery, costumes,
and dramatic action, it is difficult to fully realise the gorgeous
Eastern tcene iu iheir mind's eye. Oratorio; which make so great a
demand on the unaidtd imagination are the kind of thing whioh, to
quote the once populariwrf Dundreary, "no fellow can understand,"
but whioh, evidently, No-vello can understand. An enthusiastic
admirer of Madame Schumann said that, in spite of his having a
terrific cold, he must go and hear her play at St. James's Hall, add-
ing that he felt quite secure against a chill, as, whenever she
performed, he was always entirely wrapped up in the music and
carried away. In fact Madame has no warmer supporter than this
influenzial amateur. But—will some one compose an orchestral
work with grand effeots to be called The Blizzard t
KAISER WILHELM.
After the Funeral, March 16th.
It is said, in days of Summer, when the moonlight on the Rhine
Floods with scintillating silver all the land of hill and vine,
That the shadow of a monarch comes to visit earth again,
And that great imperial phantom is the ghost of Charlemagne.
Not in anger comes the Kaiser from his tomb at La Chapelle,
But his eyes are fain to look on all the scenes he loved so well;
And upon the Bridge of Moonbeams, lo I the spectre takes its stand,
With the palms of benediction o'er the ancient Fatherland.
So the olden legend runneth. Now once more the Teutons weep
For a paladin as peerless, who has won eternal sleep;
Though they mourn the mighty Soldier that his God has ta'en away,
'Tis the Father of his People that his children miss to-day.
Brave in battle, sage in council, with no thought of praise or pelf,
On the altar of his country he had immolated self;
And the up-hill path of duty with a steadfast foot he trod,
Single-hearted in devotion to the Fatherland and God!
May we not then, looking forward to the years that are to be,
When all living men have vanished like the sands beneath the sea,
Dare to presage of a presence, will be seen of man onoe more,
A twin-spectre in the moonbeams with the Charlemagne of yore.
And the children of those ages shall look out upon the night,
And with awe-struck whispers murmur, as they see the fearsome sight,
"Lo 1 his great sword flashes upward for an everlasting sign;
Kaiser Wuhum comes to hid us keep with him the Watch on Rhine!"

DEUX BEAUX YEUX BLEUS!
Moksietjb, Clermont-Ferrand, 19 Mars, 1888.
Though I have not your tongue at the ends of
my nails, I flatter myself 1 can, in it, express myself
sufficiently to ask of yon yonr sympathy, British and
generous, in my present position, which is at once both
tragio and grotesque. Tragio, because I have been placed
by traitors in a position of non-activity by the retraite
d'emploi. Grotesque, because my pieces of conviction
have been one pair of blue spectacles, a "ulsterre," a
orntcb, whiskers d la cotelette de moulon, and a felt hat.
But what has been mv crime f I applied to the Minister
of War for leave. He refused it to me. Was I, the
great Boulamgeb, the child of the Caff Concert, the
hero of the Boulevards, to accept this insult Y No, Mon-
sieur; a thousand times, no! So I took the leave,—that
immortal birthright of all true Frenchmen, "Frenoh
leave," myself. But aa I wished to bring upon the Govern-
ment no regrettable embarrassments, I assumed the
disguise, simple and unique, which I have indicated
above. And my blue spectacles are already enshrined in
the hearts of my compatriots, who having had recourse
to your famous chanson comique, are gaily greeting me
with the refrain, sympathetic:—
"Deux beaux yeux bleus,
Ah! que o'est affreux!
Ainti de montrer un homme qu'U a tort!
Ah! deux beaux yeux bleus!"
Do you think I have been indiscreet Y Then, I ask
you. what would be the event, if your Milord Voolsley
or Duke-Cambrigg demanded the permission of your
Mr. Smith to visit their hotels in London, and were re-
fused? Would they not instantly leave Portsmouth-
Dock-yard or Dover-Castle, disguised as the Chinese, the
Bed Indian, or the English Milord with yellow hair,
and a boule-dogue under each arm, and defy the treason-
able order which deprived them of their liberty P To this
question there can be only one response. And this sug-
gests to me, Monsieur, that if I can no longer appear on
horseback, and win the applause, thrilling and grateful,
of the admiring populace, I may perhaps be driven to
follow in the footsteps of your great Woodin, and give a
whole entertainment in disguises, with ventriloquial
accompaniment, that shall assist materially their deve-
lopment If among these personages that I may then
present to the public notice there should figure the
"Dictator," I feel that, after the outrages of March 15,
it would oreate not much surprise. Deign to receive the
assurance of my most distinguished consideration,
General Boum-langeh.
ROBERT'S DOMESTIC TRUBBLES.
I sever rites wen I'm ina temper, leastways I don't
send mv luckybrashuns to your pages when 1 'm bilin
over. No; I gives meself time to koul down. Some
weeks ago I sor it, after it had been menshunnd by you
whose egel eye nothink askapes—I sor it—I mean I werry-
tide the kwotashun, and found myself discribed in a
most respectfool Paper as " Robebt the D ." This
were pretty well to begin with, without its going on to
speak of me as a meer Play Acter 1 And then to have
to bear the horful Borcasms of my much bigger and
better arf when she read of the reelly passhonet and
familyiar way in which Maddam Burns sung of me aa
"Robert, 0 my helmed Robert.'" was more tnan I ooud
well bear, and so I sort relief from my hagitated feelings
by rushing off to a Lawyer, down in the Hold Bailey,
and consultin him all about it, and how muoh dammages
I shood ask Mr. Charles Rosy and Maddam Burns for.
And I'm bound to say as Mr. Benjermtn behaved
most strickly honnerabel in the hole matter. In course
when I began for to tell him as I wanted to bring a
Hacahun for hevvy dammages against two werry rich
peeple, male and female, he natrally rubbed his hands
and showd the Lawyers Glee by the customery grin.
But when I showed him the noosepaper, as I had bort
by the way, his face resoomed its old familyear dun
brown look, and he said in his fine legal frasiology, "it
ain't no go, Mr. Robert, for they didn't mean you, but
sum forren Gent as asoomed your name, so they can plead

I was that thunderstruck that I was dum; but I paid the money like a man.
and sort in a naybouring Pub that quiet and that mild refreshment I so much
required. And in that little baok parler over a quiet glass and a pipe, I rewooed
my persition. I had been shamefully hinsulted by being publikly called a
orful name, I had arowsed the gelosy of the partener of my joys and sorrers,
without the prowd sattisfaoshun of having deserved it, I had xptnded the
rayther considerabel sum of 6s. 8d. without nothink to show for it, and I had
now to return to my gelous spowse and endever to conwinee her that Maddam
Btjbns, when Bhe xclaimed with all her art and with all her woioe, "Robert,
O my beluved Robert!" did not mean me. but some forren gent as made use of
my onered name for some bass puppuss of his hone 1 What a sittywashun I I
don't know as how it was ewer ekailed, xoept praps wen a Alderman as had bin
reglar elected by his Ward had to go home and tell his xpecting Missis as the
other Aldermen woodn't have him at no price, as they had wayed him in the
Scales and found him wantin. I was that lorst in my thorta that I ordered
another glass, amost without knowin it, and sat there sippin and thinkin, and
thinkin and sippin, till I felt as the kindly sperrits had given me due courage
to go home and face my angry partner.
Fancy my estonishment when I reached my umbel dwelling to find as Mrs.
Robert wasn't in, and hadn't left no messidge with the backparler, as ushal.
However, I hadn't werry long to wait before she hentered, and to my most in-
tensest surprize of all, acshally came up to me and kissed me! saying in her
werry sweetest and most winningest way, jest as she used to tork when we was
a setting in Grinnidge Park afore we was married, "Robert, dear, I has to arsk
your parding for my foolish gellosy this morning, for I 've bin and found out
as the acount in the paper is all f awlse, for I've bin to the Court Theater to have
it out with that Maddam Burns, and I finds as there ain't no Court Theater left
as there used to be at Slone Square, for they've bin and gorn and pulled it all
down I" And then we sat down and had our teas, and in honner of the ocasion
we had six pennyworth of muffins, which I nose is a weakness of Mrs. R.'s, and
then we went to the Globe Theater, and both had a good hearty cry at the Oolden
Ladder, which we both werry much in joyed, and then home to a nice little hot
supper and jest one glass of somethink nioe, and then to bed. And we both agreed
that if ewery base inwention against h injured hinnocence brort forth fust such a
bust of gelous affeoshun, and then such a nappy reokonsiUayshun, might they
appear in the daily papers about wunoe a week till further notice.
I did not think it necessary to menshun that it had oorst me 6s. id. for nothink,
and somethink more for s)methink, or what I had heard from the Lawyer. Com-
mon Sense and common prudence alike dicktated to me not to wake the sleeping
Lioness. I never woke one yet, and at mv timeof life Ithinksas it is jest ahttel
too late to begin.

VOCES POPULI.
AT A LEGAL LUNCHEON-BAR.
Scus—A Restaurant in the neighbourhood of the Courts of Justice.
At the Bar, members of both branches of the Legal Profession
discovered lunching on high stools; behind Bar. buttling staff of
barmaids, kitchen-maids, and small boys in white caps, super-
intended by_ Energetic Manager, of a cheerfully familiar
disposition.
Voices behind the Bar. 8<nall roast beef cut lean, Robkbt! . . .
When does that mutton mean to comeP . . . plates, Jkhsy, look
alive there! . . . Were you the dumpling, Sir? Oh, the sausage
and plain; I beg your pardon! . . . More prongs!
[This last from the Manager— a pleasing synecdoche for forks.
Solicitors' Clerks before the Bar. Can't.let you have that further
abstract yet, but it's being attended to . . . We ought to have had
notice of that last affidavit they filed I . . . Costs on higher scale . . .
Not the practice to give copy affidavit without the jurat—told 'em so!
Notice to produce all their books for last sixteen years, &c, &c.
Shower just ceasing. Enter a Surly Man, umbrella-less and drenched.
Barmaid [to him, pleasantly). The rain has been coming- down,
Sir, hasn't it?
The Surly Man. Never saw it coming up—did you P
. [Barmaid subsides, pouting.
The Energetic Manager {to S. M.). Good morning, Sir, you've
brought the sunshine in with you! {Savage growl from the 8. M.)
But that (politely) I'm sure you always do! New or stale bread,
Sir? {Presenting plate with two squares of bread.) Stale is this chap.
Let me see (with the air of a man who studies all his customers' little
peculiarities), it's oawfee you like with your little lunch, isn't it, Sir P
The S. 31. Coffee P No I it's poison to me. Stout!
The E. M. Stout, of course it is! You shall have it, Sir! (As if it
was a rare and costly beverage; but he would search the universe to
procure a drop or two.) Oh, you shall have it!
Enter a Young Barrister with a Country Client. The Young
Barrister has just lost his first case in Court, and would much
rather not lunch, but is anxious not to offend hit Client, who, so
far, has "taken it very well—considering."
The Country Client (with a sigh). Well I I did think the Court
would have been with us—but there, I suppose it can't be helped.
[He has been saying this for the last ten minutes.
The Young Barrister (for the twentieth time). You—you oan never
tell beforehand what view the Bench is going to take. (As if he had
had years of experience.) I did my best. {A little defiantly, in faint
hope of forcing a compliment.)
The C. C. (with rather offensive magnanimity). Oh, I'm not
blaming you, my boy—though {he has been trying to keep from
taying this ever since the Court rose) it was a pity you gave the other
aide that opening by re-examining as you did. Didn't you see that
note I passed up from the well P
The Y. B. (not liking this). Which? You passed up such a lot,
you know!
The C. C. I wish you had paid more attention to them—I know
that.' Well, never mind, I do think Allabye, Q.C., might have
found time to look in, instead of leaving you to fight it alone. I told
Staplk avj> Veruxam I must have a leading brief given—and this
is the result! By the way, that was a smart young fellow against
you—know who he is?
The Y. B. (with a pang of jealousy). Oh, I don't know. (With
affected carelessness.) Some Common Law fellow, I believe. (After
pause—more candidly.) Prisk, his name is.
The C. C. Very sharp the way he took you np oyer the registra-
tion point—why, bless my soul! (with a pleased recognition)—he's
coming in now. (Enter Mr. Prisk, with a jaunty self-satisfied air,
and an eye-glass; the C. C. makes room for him with marked defer-
ence, while the Y. B. assumes a stony abstraction.) Allow me, Sir,
we've met before to-day—Potter v. Kettleby, y' know—we oan
afford to shake hands over it now, eh?
Prisk. To be sure. You acted for the plaintiff, didn't you? Oh,
it was a walk over for us—you hadn't a leg to stand on!
The C. C. I don't know that. I was strongly advised to rely on
".Hugger and Mugger"
Prisk. Cuts both ways, that case. I put that to the judge—then
your own witness—what was his name? Puddlbbt, did for you;
that answer I got out ef him on the re-examination—that gave me
all I wanted!
The Y. B. (who has been listening to all this on the other side of
his Client, and thinks it time to strike in and change the subject).
Are you—a—going biok to Yokelford this afternoon?
The C. C. (testily). Eh, what? Oh, forgot you were there!
Going back? Yes, yes, of course! What is there to do here, now t
{Turns to Mr. Prisk in a marked manner.) Yes, I am glad to have
this opportunity of telling you, Sir, how very much struck I was
with the way you conducted your case. I may say so, now it's all
over. I can recognise ability {with a disparaging glance at the Y. B.},
when I do happen to come across it!
Prisk (nonchalantly). Delighted to hear you say so—hard-fought
case—er—{recognises the Y. B., and thinks he can afford to be
generous)—on both aides. {To Attendant.) Here! J said mutton.
The C. C. Well, we had a good case—on paper. I suppose Mr.—
er—Prisk, thank you! I suppose you don't confine yourself to
any particular class of practioe P
Prink. Bless you.no! Take anything that oomes in my way—
trouble you to pass the salt.
The C. C. (pompously). Ah, just so, I shall remember that—
Prisk, and your address is in the Law List, I daresay P
Prisk. Ought to be—been there for six years now. (To Barmaid.)
Get me some oheese and butter, will you?
The C. C. (to the Y. B.). You don't seem to be getting on—I must
be off soon.
The Y. B. {feeling forlorn and neglected). They haven't brought
me my chop yet {plaintively).
The C. C. (palronisinply). You should assert yourself more—
that's the way to get on in this life. (To the E. M.) When is this
gentleman to nave his chop P
The E. M. Waiting for your chop, Sir? Sorryyou didn't mention
it, Sir—work of time, a chop is, Sir. {Loudly.) Here—'urry up that
grill-chop there! (The cry is taken up, and carried down into the far
distance, until the Y. B. feels thoroughly ashamed of his chop, and
wishes he could sneak off and desert it. The E. M. to small buy with
plate.) Roast beef and Yorkshire—right! there's a good bo-oy!
Now, then, my dear, don't take all the room there! (Putting his hand
on Barmaid's shoulder and turning her round, which she appears to
resent privately.)
The C. C. Well, I can't stay here all day. Good day, Mr. Prisk,
glad to have made your acquaintance—hope we shall find ourselves
on the same side, next time I By-by, Tim m human! (To Y. B.)

find that out when you've been at it a little longer!

wild thoughts of " chucking-up" the Bar, and going in for
ranching or diamond-digging.
E. M. (returning briskly). Your chop at last, Sir! (in a tone of
deep mystery and confidential congratulation, as if it didn't occur
every day), and a hot potato, Sir!
[In his vivacity he slams the dishes on the counter with a force
that upsets the Y. B.'s beer into his plate, and shoots a very
floury potato into his necktie.
The Y. B. (with a sense that nothing will prosper with him any
more). Oh, it doesn't matter—don't bother about it! (He smiles in a
sickly manner.)
The E. if. {noticing the smile with approval). Glad you are able
to see the merry side of it, Sir I

dering what his Client is saying of him now, and wishing he
had never been born.

BLACKWOOD'S TALE; OR, A MASTER OF BLACK ARTS.
CnAPTER II.
The next morning early found me stirting for Damascus. I had
reoeived a post-card in a diabolical hand bidding me go there at
once. Under the circumstances it seemed the only reasonable thine
to do. I asked leave of the Principal. The term was only half
finished, and he refused. I laughed in his face, and instantly
brought the immense force of my will-power into play. The
effect was electric. With a feeble stagger, and a sickly far-off
smile, he at once gave me permission to stay down as long as I
liked." I started by the twelve o'clock express; the same train
contained Gullttoff, who had received a missive similar to mine,
and was departing, without further hesitation, straightway for
Patagonia. We parted at Paddington. Thence onward my journey
was an easy one.
In three weeks after my departure I found myself lolling in lazy
luxury under the deep blue canopy of the Eastern Meridian. In
some respects the hotel I had selected at Damascus was a peculiar
one; it had a hack garden of roses that led imperceptibly into a fair
green oasis in an Arabian desert, interseoted hy cool bubbling
streamlets that plaved in the soft shadows of the lovely oleander and
myrtle bushes, which lent it its subtle and fantastio charm. Here
it was my wont to wander 'neath the myriad stars that glistened in
the stilly firmament above, while the pale crescent moon hung sus-
pended m the emerald amber of the dying West, lying like a slice of
glorified and silvered melon upon its back in some wondrous incan-
descent and translucent sea.
One night I happened to have strolled many miles further than
was my wont in this enchanting paradise, from the habitable pre-
cinots of my abode, when a strange sound Bmote my ear. I listened
intently. 1 was not disappointed. I distinctly heard the words
"Houp-ld!" pronounced in a sweet hut melanoholy voioe. To dash
through the intervening myrtle-bushes and find myself suddenly
inside a Cirous, in which a troupe were giving their entertainment
apparently to empty benches, was hut the work of a moment. I
noticed that the structure seemed shadowy, and I advanced into the
ring. Two Bounding Brothers were going through their exercise.
I poked one with my umbrella. It went through him. I approached
the leading lady, and tried playfully to embrace her. My arms
olasped nothing—she was mere vapour. The Ring-master stooped
down to pick up something; I tried to sit on him—I went to the
ground. There was no doubt about it; I had met with a Circus
troupe of performing spirits. They were clearly Gullttoff's rela-
tions. They crowded about me.
"And are you happy?" I asked, struck with the rather mournful
cast of their countenances.
"Almost," they replied. "The fact is, we should he quite, if it
were not for the circumstance of our playing to empty benches. It is
weary work never getting a hand," they sighed.
"And we have been running this programme now for eighteen
thousand nights in this oasis," added the Ring-master, with a
mournful smile. "It is a little slow—just a little slow 1"
But it shall be so no longer I" I rejoined brightly. For I had
already made my resolve. I would materialise these poor spectres,
and restore them living, breathing, animate beings to Gullttoff
onca more. And as I made up my mind, I felt my whole energy of
being rush irresistibly into one channel, and all my mighty strength
of will sweep on supremely to one steadfast and tremendous purpose.
The effort was colossal, but so was the result. Gradually a strange
change came over them. Their forms grew denser. The trousers of
the Ring-master seemed to fill out. The Bounding Brothers appeared
visibly to put on flesh. The rouge came in distinct patohes on the
leading lady's ohecks. My patienco was rewarded. My agonising
efforts were successful. Their materialisation was complete.
Within three hours I had paid my hotel bill, and booked our passage
by the mail route direct to Southampton.
But I must not further delay the climax of my story. I ^had
brought my charges safely to Oxford, and installed them in my
rooms. Their arrival created Bome excitement in the College. This
I discounted. I saw the Principal passing beneath, and I willed that
he should break out suddenly into a Highland Fling. This he
instantly did in the centre of the quadrangle, and by his wild antics
at once quite absorbed the universal attention. Meantime Gullt-
toff, who had, by a strange coincidence, just arrived that very
morning from Patagonia, had recognised his lost relatives, and my
scout was about to lay lunch, when we became conscious of the pre-
sence in our midst of a blazing big balloon of blue fire, containing
in its centre the evil-looking little money-lending Jew. Gullttoff
turned pale. Then he asked his malign relative what he wanted.
"What I want F" shrieked out the vindictive little Jew, in reply.
"Why, I have just looked in ,to have a little more fun. I '11 teach
you to meddle with the Black Arts. They shall all die in your
rooms! Ha! ha! ha! Ho! ho! ho!"
And with a withering curse on the whole party, he took an upward
bound and vanished in a bigger halo of blue fire through the ceiling.
His prediction was not long in taking effect. One hy one the
troupe were seized successively by violent apopleotic fits. Gullttoff
rushed first to one, then the other, foaming at the mouth, his black
hair streaming in all directions, and his eyeballs starting out of his
head. Just as the second Bounding Brother succumbed, he staggered
blindly towards him, and giving one last wild ory and wringing his
hands, fell a lifeless log across his prostrate body. I summoned my
scout, and desired him to send for the nearest undertaker.
There was a Coroner's Inquest. The reputation of the College
suffered somewhat. But the Jury brought in a verdict of Accidental
Death; though, as I had willed that the Principal and Yice-
Chancellor should be more or less implicated in the affair, they
added a damaging rider reflecting severely on the character of those
worthies.
Though this happened some years ago, I am still in residenoe.
From time to time I have had a Walpurgis Nackt, with its attend-
ant orgies, within the College walls, and on the morrow of these
occasions I have invariably been requested by the Prinoipal and
Fellows to take my name off the College books. Need I say I have
always declined? I am still studying the Black Art, but have not
yet taken my Master's degree. The Prinoipal, I fancy, instinct-
ively avoids me. Men seem to give me a wide berth in Hall. Are
these things strange f Sometimes I think they are; sometimes I
think they are not. Now and then I find myself asking myself
how it will all end! Ah! how will itf That's the question.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Howe of Commom, Monday Night, March 12.—To-night comes
Charlie Bkbksfobd's opportunity in the great combined attack
upon the Government, conducted by sea and land under General and
Admiral Lord Graitdolfh, V.C. The Navy now signalled into
action. Great opportunity for Charlie, hut marred in advance by
the astuteness of Graxdolph. Chablie used up last week in
supporting Gbandolph'b personal attack on Army Estimates. If
he 'd saved himself for to-night, would have had full House and high
old time. But sacrificed himself for Gbandolph's sake. _ House
didn't care to hear speech over again. If Charlie hadn't said what
he had to say last week, he should have done. House never cares
to make two bites at cherry or speech. Inattention and in-
difference re-acted upon Charlie. Not at all up to the mark.
Gun-room stories best part of speech, hut these not artistically
handled.
Admiral Mathe told off to keep ex-Junior Lord supplied with
water. Duty carried out in sailor-like fashion. Hove alongside with
bucket of water and sat down on Bench at orator's feet.
"Ahoy!" sang out Charlie, in loud aside, when his throat get
parohed with much speaking.
"Ay, ay, Sir I" answered the Admiral, and ran up the bucket,
hand over hand, till Charlie could dip his beaker in it. Then
lowered away and stowed it under seat.
House never tired of watching this manoeuvre. But nothing
could keep debate alive. Flickered out before dinner-hour. Seemed
as if House going into Committee. But suddenly wind freshened,
sails filled out, and debate went off on another tack.
Bear Admiral Field greatly distinguished himself; came down
with notes of prodigious speech full fifty fathoms long. Anxious to
speak from corner seat by Cross-Benohes. But that belongs to Tin da i.
Robertson, the blind Member for Brighton. Absent just now, but
expected down after dinner. So Field cruised about the Bar till
Robertson hove insight; ran up to him; took him in tow, and
adroitly anchored him on front Cross-Benoh, thus leaving corner
dear. Robkbtson seemed to think position unusual. But. accus-
tomed to be led to seat by friendly Member*, said nothing, and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Field had anchorage before Cross-Benoh all to himself. Covered
Front Bench for half its space with his notes, leaned against Cross-
Bench and enjoyed himself for spaoe of an honr. Can't be said, as far
as audience was concerned, that plea-,
sore was mutual. Bat Members might]
at least leave the House,—and they
did.
Business done.—None.
Tuesday.—No limits to energy or
versatility of Grandolph. Means to
bring down a Government that pre-
sumes to continue its existence when
he has withdrawn. Doesn't matter
whenoe or how he can attack them.
Last week assailed them by land.
Yesterday attacked them by sea. To-
day fires a mine in far-off Ind. Old
Morality, reviewing position at ques-
tion time, thought Government were
going to have a quiet day. Si, a no
had Motion down, challenging frontier
policy in India. He would make his
speech, Gorst would reply, and then,
in all probability. House would be
Counted Out. In the pleasing prospect
quite forgot Grandolph. But that
invincible and insatiable warrior not
to be ignored. Having assumed the
command of the combined land and
sea forces, would now add India as a
trifle in his wallet. Showed himself
a little shaky in some of his figures,
and not quite certain in his geography

Tiadal Bobertson'a Convoy.
Bat what was clear at end
of his speech was that a miserable" Government that had no Army
worth Bpeaking of, and no Navy that the Swiss could not swallow
at a mouthful, were making terrible mess of it in India. Old
Morality, who had left the House after questions, cautiously returned
and sat in abject misery on Treasury Bench, whilst Grandolph
further demolished Ministry.
After this hope of a Count Out and a peace-
ful sitting vanished. All the authorities on
India oame to the front, and hour after hour
passed. Ughtred KiY-8HCTTLitwoBTH, the
mildest mannered man that ever cut into de-
bate, gave Randolph a neat hit. "Heartily
welonmed as a recruit to the ranks of Eoonomy,
the Noble Lord, who was responsible for the
addition of 10,000 European soldiers to
the Indian Army." Close upon mid-
night Roper Lethbridgb rose to make
his treasured speech, whereupon Caine,
who had comfortably delivered his,
moved Closure, and House divided.
Joseph Gillis now asserted himself.
Took seat above Gangway, so as to be
nearer the Speaker, and with copy of
Orders in hand, closely followed the
right honourable gentleman's utter-
ances. Whenever a Bill in Catalogue
of Orders of the Day recited and pro-
posal made to advanoe it a stage, the
lithe, lissom figure of Joey. B. rose to
its full height, and, with fairy hand
olutching at the air, he uttered the
magic words, " I object I"
No appeal. Under New Rules any
Member taking objection to progress of
particular Bills after midnight, can
stop them ; land Joseph did, his face
,, meanwhile beaming with large bene-
"The MUdest-manneredjlInn." voienc0i and a ]itt\e chuckle, sounding,
now and again, like faint, far-off echo of the groans of Members who
found their opportunity strangled.
Batim.<a done.—Slagg's Resolution condemning Frontier Polioy in
India, rejected by 122 votes against 72.
Wednesday.—" When we rearrange the Parliamentary Calendar,
this will be known as S. Bradlaugh's Day."
It was the voice of the A hornet-General ; I knew he would
complain. Bradlaugh had moved Second Reading of Oaths Bill. A
few years ago Member for Northampton had been hustled out of the
House, and finally kicked down-stairs, first because would not take
the Oath, and then because he wanted to. Now, had brought in Bill
not only practically abolishing Oath in Parliament, but everywhere
else where honest oitizens are oalled upon to swear. Attorney-
General not even permitted to speak for Government in opposing

BilL Too many Conservatives,'inoluding Solicitor- General, going
other way. Brad laugh master of the situation. Terrible con
viotion that he might, an he pleased, 'have Old Morality kicked
down-stairs, or even the Attornby-General.
GRandolph invincible on the sea, irre-
sistible on land, and master of India, quite
broken down by Bradlaugh. The ques-
tion before House to-day was the very one
that gave birth to the Fourth Party.
Grandolph, sitting in corner seat above
the Gangway, recalled and contrasted the
old times, when, firmly but gracefully
standing in his chariot Obstruction, he
drove his irrepressible party, three abreast,
riding down everything, even Gladstone's
overwhelming majority. Now, Gorst was
on the Treasury Bench, Balfour in the
Cabinet, Wolffib on the road to Teheran,
Bradlaugh carrying everything before
him, and Grandolph stranded on a back
Bench. A dark and troubled outlook.
Business done. — Bradlaugh's Oaths
Bill carried by majority of 100.
Thursday.—Field! positively on again
with more acres of speech! On Monday,
this Anoient Mariner button-holed House
for upwards of an hour; interrupted by
stroke of midnight. Now. having, as he
genially admits, refreshed his memory, pro-
poses to go on for another hour. Moored
once again in his favourite anoborage before
Cross- Benches, having during question time _ , , ,
beguiled TindIl Robertson into the offing Grandolph Ukmg a Gioemy
by false signals, towed him into the Ubrary ^ PoUtlMl
and stranded him there.
"Don't often get a chanoe of making a speech," says Admiral.
"Now I've got it, mean to make most of opportunity."
Members cleared out with one accord, leaving Admiral in solitary
possession of the deck. This bad enough in its way, but worse to
follow. The reverberating Colohb, who last week desolated House,
encouraged by Fibld's success, positively came to front again.
Lugged in seven baskets filled with fragments from the feast he had
provided last week. These now scrupulously served out. Unhappy
House in ultimate stage of inanition. Almost at last gasp when,
somehow, there being literally no one present to object, tumbled into
Committee. Voted trifle over Three Millions sterling in trifle over
three minutes' time.
Business done.—In Committee of Supply.
Friday Night.—Osman Digna Morgan ran Marriott to earth
to-night in matter of brief accepted for Ismail Pasha. Osman has
had his eye upon Marriott for some time. Painful to well-regu-
lated mind to near of such enormous fee as Marriott got; a reflec-
tion on the stay-at-home Bar. Marriott made few jokes in reply ,
Febgusson was very serious; and Attornry- General professionally
indignant. But, on whole, affair rather dragged, and everyone glad
when Division oame. As Pi.i'nkkt says, "Judge-Advocate-General
on Judge-Advocate-General is false heraldry."
Business done.—Marriott whitewashed by 218 Votes against 126.

".JOSEPH'S SWEETHEART."
(.<< Fieldingesque Fragment of a Tale of Love and Loyalty. Adapted to the Situation.)
Showing how our Hero rejects with scorn the proferred Title at the hands of Lady Tory Diplomacy, amd clings to
the object of his flrst love, dear democracy.
Joseph was now in what is oalled'the "prime of life "; he was of
the highest degree of middle stature; his hair was smartly and
smoothly disposed; his forehead was fairly high, if somewhat narrow,
his eyes were bold and keen, as full of shrewdness as of self-asser-
tion; his nose a little inclined to what, in vulgar vernacular, is
called the Snub, but it is, perhaps, better described by the politer
term "Celestial": his lips were firmly ohiselled and elosely set;
his face was perfectly smooth on the ehin and upper lip; :his
countenance had a cold composure joined with a oooksureness
inexpressible, a Pirr-like combination of power and perkiness.
Add to this the most perfect neatness in his dress, an orchid in his
buttonhole, and an air, which, to those who have not seen many
noblemen, might Rive an idea of nobility. I make this qualification
the more emphatically forasmuch as that to Joseph himself—if,
indeed, his own earlier utterances might be trusted—comparison
with "the Nobility" would seem the reverse of complimentary.
Suoh was the person who now appeared before the Lady. "Come,
Joey," says she, " tell me truly, who is the happy girl whose oharms
have made a con quest of you f
"Her name," answered Joseph, "is Democracy. I have wooed
her long, and to her I will be faithful."

French actors and playwrights in general, and by himself, King
Coquelln, in particular. Clever as he undoubtedly is as an all-
round Aotor,—he has been getting a trifle more all-round lately,—
original and amusing as he is in all his assumptions, yet there is
one in which he is unapproachable, and that is the assumption that
nobody knows anything about Dramatio Art out of France. King

Master Henry Irving and a few more youthful amateurs, "Take

would observe. " Keep your eye on your audience, and your audi-

continues, "It is there" {i.e., in the eye) "that the public looks for
you." What do the public look for in President Coqueltn's eye?

NEW VOLUNTEER MANOEUVRE.
"Lire Wheel!"
THE DOOM OP "SHE."
Fragments of a Romance of Political Adventure.
( With apologies to Mr. Rider Haggard.)
(The old Toryism—the high-and-dry Toryism of Privilege, and Prejudice, of Territorial
Autocracy, and anti-popular exclusiveness is dead, swept into the limbo of vanished things
and lost causes by that irresistible Democratic impulse, of whose dominant power this
Conservative Government's truly Radical " Local Government Biil" is the crowning proof.
—Set Daily papers, passim.']
• ••••••
There came a few momenta' pause during which "She-who-was-xcont-to-be-
obeyed" seemed to be gathering up her strength for the fiery trial.
At last, from far far away, came the first murmur of sound, the blurred and
confused sound as of a distant multitude triumphantly shouting, that grew and
grew till it began to crash and bellow as though close upon our very ears. A*
she heard it She" threw off her old True-Blue wrapping—that vesture of
whioh she had for so many generations been as conservatively oareful as a
fashionable lady of her beauty, as haughtily proud as a parvenu monarch of the
Imperial Purple—she threw it off, I say, with a boldneBS of abandon that was
absolutely startling, and stood before us even as the Revolutionary " Goddess of
Liberty" might have stood before Robespierre, and the rampant raving
devotees of the Red Terror, clad in nothing but her native loveliness, about
whioh, at this advanced stage of her amazing existence, opinions, to tell truth,
differed considerably. But to Leo, the British Leo, she flattered herself that
she still looked sweet—even divine. Nearer and nearer came the thunder-wheels
of fire, revolving, revolving in a way strongly suggestive—as, indeed, is not
unnatural with revolving wheels—of Revolution 1 As they came " She" flung
one ivory arm (I use this original comparison because the arm in question was,
indeed, of the exact tint of an anoient knife-handle or antique Chinese chessman)
around Leo's neck.
"Oh, my Leo, my British Leo," she murmured, "keep your beloved pecker
up. You 're all right."
"Perhaps," muttered Leo, rather sullenly, as I thought. "But how about
yourself? I doubt me of that raging flame. How do I know that it wiU not
utterly destroy you, or, at least, so radioally change you that I shan't know you
again?"
"Radically t" murmured "She," with slowly curving lips of low derisive
music "Why, my foolish faithless Leo, know you not that Conservation is of
its ' very essence.' Look at me 1 Do I look eight hun—well, older than Venus,
or more stricken in years than Psyche?"
"Humph 1" muttered Leo. You see he had not beheld her without her
anoient azure wrapping before, and he seemed a bit doubtful somehow.
"She-toho-toas-toont-to-be-obeyed" thought for a moment, and then said—
"It is hardly wonderful that thou shouldst doubt. Tell me, Leo. if thou
seest me stand in the flame and come forth unharmed, wilt thou enter also f"
"Well—per—ahem!—that is—yes, I suppose so," he answered.
"And that wiR I also," I cried.
"What, my Solly!" she laughed aloud; "methought
that thou wouldst naught of length of days purchased by
Surging fires, and radical change and revolution. Why,
ow is this ? *'
"Nay, I know not," I answered, "but there is that
in my heart that calleth to me to taste of the flame and
live/'
"That's right, Solly my boy," murmured the faithful
Job in mine ear. "A little Radical rejuvenescence wiR
do you a world of good, and give you length of days and
a rare run for your money."
"It is weU,'' "She " said. "Thou art not altogether
lost in folly, Solly. See now, 1 will, not for the first
time, bathe me in this living bath. Fain would 1 add to
my beauty and my length of days, if it be possible.
Anyhow, it cannot hurt me, as cynics say of the Homoeo-
path's infinitesimals."
On oame the crashing, rolling noise, and the sound
thereof was as the sound of an ancient forest being swept
flat by a mighty wind, and then tossed up by it like so
much grass, ana thundered down a mountain-side. For
a moment it came into my mind that some might see
in the anoient forest, Privilege; in the mighty wind,
Popular Franchise; in the mountain-Bide, the easily-
descended Avernus of Old Toryism and the anoient
Squirearchy. But I put this aside as fanciful and un-
practical. Nearer and nearer it came, the revolving
pillar of flame, shaped scroll-wise it seemed, like unto
the political caricaturist's symbolical representation of a
Parliamentary Bill, and in the heart of it appeared to
burn shifting characters of a runic sort, which now
seemed to mean one thing, and now another, aeoording
to the observer's particular point of view. The letters
D. E. M. 0.1 seemed to decipher; what the others were
I oould not satisfactorily determine; I caught myself
hoping that they might not be Q. 0. R. G. 0. N. Per-
chance, however, 'twas aU fancy, so suddenly dazzling
was the flame, so' swift were its shiftings, so rapid its
circumgyrations.
"She" turned towards it, and stretohed out her arms
to greet it. On it came very slowly, and lapped her
round with flame. "She" looked oddly like one of
Tenneel's droll Bill-Babes tinted scarlet—a sketchy
human shape wrapped round with a parchment scroll,
tape-oinotured, like unto that inimitable artist's graphio
incarnation—say, of some Looal Government Bill, or other
colossal Conservative measure.
So did "She" stand in the heart of the flaming Revo-
lution. I saw the fire run up her form; I saw her lift
it with both hands as though it were water, and pour
it over her head. I even saw her open her mouth, and
draw it enjoyingly down through her throat, as though
it were fine old crusted, tawny Tory Port of Comet
Vintage. And a dread and wonderful sight it was.
It paralysed Leo: it enthralled me; it seemed even to
Btartle the stolid Joe.
* * * * TtliU
But suddenly—more suddenly than I can describe or
even suggest—save by comparing it to the tactical volte-
face of a Constitutional" party in face of a Democratic
Ugly-rush or a Parliamentary majority—a kind of change
oame over her visage. The smile vanished, and in its place
there oame a dry hard look; the rounded face seemed to
grow pinched, as though Borne great anxiety were leaving
its impress upon her. The glorious true-blue eyes, too,
lost their light, and, as I thought, the form its old shape
and anoient erectness.
The flaming pillar slowly twisted and thundered off,
leaving '' She-xcho-teas-toont-to-be-obeyed" standing
where it had been.
"Why, what is it—what is itP" she said, confusedly.
"I feel dazed. Surely the fire hath not played me a
triok. Tell me, Leo, my British Leo, is there aught
wrong with my eyes? I see not dear." And her faoe—
by Heaven!—her face was growing old before my eyes!
I suppose Leo saw it also; certainly he recoiled a step
or two.
"Oh, look! look! look !" cried Joe, in a shrill falsetto,
his eye-glass dropping out of his eye, the smug rigidity
leaving his Wemmick-like lips. Look! look! look!
she's shrivelling up I she's turning into a mummy I"
And then he fell upon the ground in a fit—whether of
remorseful horror or of mirth I oannot certainly say.
True enough — she was shrivelling up; smaller and
smaller she grew; she ohanged colour, changed to a"

VERY SWEET LAVENDER.
Dear Mb. Pcinch,
I am such a sincere admirer of the works of Mr. Pinero,
that I trust you will allow me to make a few suggestions for his
benefit a propos of his new piece at Terry's Theatre. I saw it the
other evening, and liked it very much, but I should have liked it
better had it been sub-
ject to the alterations I
am about to indicate.
In the first place I did
not much care about
the title, Sweet laven-
der—as the name repre-
sents the daughter of
a Temple "laundress,"
to the lav mind it rather
recalls linen home from
the wash. But this is
a matter of small im-
portance, a remark
which, however, is un-
happily not applicable
to the place in _ which
Sweet Lavender is per-
formed. Mr. Tkkry is
so excellent in bur-
lesque that it is a thou-
sand pities his theatre
Bhould be hypothecated
to any other class of
entertainment. Mr.
Pinero's play, I fancy
would have been more
at home (in blank verse)
at the Lyceum, or, were
the incidents put back
But assuming for the moment

After a Celebrated Picture.
i century or so, at the Vaudeville, um uouuuug *ur uxo muiueuu
that Terby's Theatre is the best possible house for its introduction,
I cannot help thinking that it would have been better had the action
of the piece been laid in any spot other than the Temple. So many
people nowadays are Barristers themselves, or have friends or rela-
tives at the Bar, that the ways of lawyers are pretty well known.
Now the "Chambers of Mr. Phenyl and Mr. Hale, No. 3, Brain
Court," are really impossible. What would the Benchers say were
a tenant of the Inner Temple to house his Aunt, his Uncle, to say
nothing of his pretty Cousin, in his rooms? I am afraid there would
be a terrible scandal, and this is only one of the many incongruities
that are met with on every turn of Mr. PhenyFs staircase.
But assuming that, after all, there is not much harm in the scene of
Sweet Lavender'» adventures being laid in the Temple, I cannot con-
scientiously say that I was altogether satisfied with Sweet Lavender
herself. In The Schoolmistress Miss Nobbbys was simply delight-
ful, but she is a little out of her element in a pathetic part. She has
not the physique for the sentimental heroine of domestic drama, and
would be wiser to follow in the footsteps of Mrs. Bancroft, and
keep to comedy. But, admitting that Miss Nobbbys was welcome,
I can scarcely praise Mr. Terry quite as warmly. The Lessee of
Terry's Theatre is most amusing, as I have already hinted, in bur-
lesque, but he is not quite so pleasing in the part of a drunken, broken
down, and obtrusive Barrister, running through three Acts. Not
that he was much like a Barrister. For instance, he put on his bands
over his scarf, and kept his wig and gown in his Chambers, instead
of at the Robing-room at the Law Courts, and was guilty of like
eccentricities. I admit that these points had their value, as they
lessened the feeling of repugnance that one felt for him when one
realised that he was evidently only burlesquing a Barrister, and not
pretending to represent one. For all that, much as I admire both
Miss Norrbis and Mr. Terry, I cannot help thinking that, had the
characters they represented been omitted from Sweet Lavender, the
pieoe would have been improved by the alteration.
Admitting that Sweet Lavender should have been out out, Mr.
Clement Hale, her lover, should also go. This would be a distinot
advantage, as admirable as Mr. Bernabd Gould undoubtedly is, he
rather bored one. Next, I do not think that even Mr. Pinero would
seriously object, if anyone suggested to him that the pieoe would
play closer were the rather painful incident connected with Mr.
Wedderburn's relations with Ruth Rolt entirely omitted. I should
be the last to deny that the situation at the end of the Second Act,
whioh turns upon these relations, is effective; but is the effective-
ness of this one situation sufficient compensation for the introduction
of a story that is not altogether in the best taste P I question it.
Cut out the Rolt- Wedderburn imbroglio, and naturally the cha-
racters of Mr. Wedderburn, his sister, her daughter, her lover,
Dr. Delaney, a fashionable physician, and Ruth Rolt herself must
go; and excellently as those characters are played, I cannot help
believing that the Domestic Drama would be more concentrated in
interest without them. Having dispensed with these members of the
Dramatis Persona, I find that Mr. Maw, a solicitor, and Mr. Bulger,
a hairdresser, are the only characters left inl the oast. They are
both well played, but as they have very little to do, and are not
essential to the reconstructed plot, they might be omitted without
serious damage to the interests of the pieoe.
I have no doubt that my suggestions would cause a radical change
in the character of Sweet Lavender, but this is a time of radical

played as he has written it, and possibly he may be right. After all.
it is only a matter of opinion. As for myself, I can only say that if
my proposals are carried out in their entirety. I feel that I could see
the new piece every night for a year, without experiencing a sense
of weariness.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
11 am glad to see that Messrs. Routledqb have taken my hint,
and have brought out a pocket volume of Tales from Pickwick. It
is a capital traveller's-oompanion, and there
are some good illustrations by £. J.
Wheeler, who, strange to say, has not
found material for a pioture in The Baron
of Orogzwig. the most rollicking of
ckens's Pickwickian Tales.
The Prima Donna, by Sutherland
Edwards, is amusing."and interesting, but
it must be read carefully, or many of the
excellent short anecdotes may be missed.
What reverses these Queens of Song ex-
perienced I Cuzzom died a poor button-
maker: Faustina, her rival, married a
H AS8BI They were exposed to great temp-
tations; and, as a rule, the earlier Queens
of Song seem to have yielded to them with a good grace. They
either suffered from the jealousy of their rich and powerful admirers
(delicate word "admirers"), or from the brutality of their own
husbands.
Continental Society at the beginning of this century—not muoh
better or worse then than now, I suppose—drew the_ line at "pro-
fessional persons," and if they were ever admitted within the silken
cordon, it was only on sufferance. Madame Sontag was the brilliant
exception among foreign artists, and she—Oh I happy termination to
a virtuous career!—she married an Italian nobleman. Count Rossi.
In England a noble marriage for a Prima Donna was not so very
remarkable, as on the list we find three who married " belted Earls,"
and one Duchess. But Sontao was in every way a rara avis. The
stories about Prime Donne, from Grisi up to the present day, are of
a less sprightly character than those of their predecessors. Here Mr.
Sutherland Edwards found himself on delicate ground. An
anecdotist's motto must be, "De viventibus nil nisi bonum." or enter
Mister Libel on the scene, and the author would be annihilated by
the publisher's curse.
Nobody knows better than Mr. Edwards what the public expect
to find in such a book, and, though he is invariably decorous, he is
never dull. What would Lord Charles Bebbsfobd, or Sir Henry
Thompson, say to this description of the German Prima Donna,
Mara—" She had a compass of three octaves " P
A defect in the arrangement of the material is the absence of
side-headings and dates in the margin. When the author brings
out his Lives of the Upper Tenors, let him take this suggestion in
good part, and supply the deficiency acutely felt by his esteemed
friend, The Baron db Book Worms.

by the Manchester stipendiary for brutally ill-

mitted to bis care to be trained, and he was stated
to have beaten it continually because it could not
force its limbs into certain forma."
It is to be wished that Mr. Felix Rosen-
heim; had been rendered as infelix as he
deserved to be for his inhumanity to his infant
charge. Unfortunately, the law did not sub-
ject him to be so punished as such a cruel
"contortionist" ought to have been; that is
to say, adjudged to practise involuntary con-

A SUGGESTION FOR THE FUTURE.
What our M.F.H. was preparing to try it the Snow had continued.

THE DRAPERS' SACRIFICE!
Me and Brown was a setting the other night in a oozy littel room,
which shall be nameless, a finishing of a harf bottel of Clicko's old
rich Shampane that two yung Swells had ordered, on my reokomen-
dashun, bat had found too sweet for their
xperienced tastes, poor fellers! when
Brown says to me, says he, "Haye yon
herd of the hawfnl noose?" "What
noose?" says I. "Well," says he, "be
prepared for a real staggerer." "I thinks
as I'm amost prepared for any think," says
I; "bnt I '11 take another glass of this
delishus wine to make sure. "So do,"
says he, "and I'11 foiler your good xample."
Witch he did. "Well,'' says he, '/I hardly
zpeots you to beleeve me, but it's quite
trew, as the Honerable and Washnpfool
Compny of Drapers is about to sell off
hundreds of dozens of their werry holdest and werry best wine by
hockshun!" I thort as I shood ha' dropt out of my heasy chair!
"Grayshus goodness 1" says I, "what on airth are you a forking
about?" And then he took out a noosepaper and red me the
wundrous tail.
I declare I was that shocked that I scarcely knew what I was
about, for I emptied the Bottel and rose to leave, when he said,
"Don't go for a few minnits, for here's just two or three glasses of '47
Port left in this bottel, which I removed for fear it should get into
them young chaps' heds." So I yeelded to my fate and sat down.
And then he told me as how he'd bin to the Hockshuneers, and had
a tork with their hed man about how nessessary it was to have 1 or
2 werry careful men as was acustomed to such wines as them, to
know how to handle 'em, and that he had engaged us both for that
ewentful day. I was that efected by Brown's xtrornary kindness
that I drunk his elth in a Bumper of '47, and then sort my sober
dwelling a wiser bnt a sadder man.
Nex day I gos and I calls at Drapers' All, witch it's in Thrug
Mortem Street, I thinks they calls it, close to the Stock Xchange,
where I'm told as all the most piousest and most onerablest men in
the hole City assembels ewery day, and makes wagers as to who
shall do the most good, and be the most ginerous, to the poor and
kneady, and then meets once a month and settles their accounts with
one another, and pays over their warious ballances, and sends a large
part on 'em across the way to the Lord Mare for him to distribbute,
knowing as they does as he's just the man for their money.
Well, fortnitly, my frend, the Under Beedel's Assistant, was
in, and jest about having a nice littel snack for lunch, so I jined him.
and over a glass of, never mind what, we forked over the serious
Dizziness of the Hockshun. And wot a rewelation it were! and how
the scoffing jester would mock at its sollem detales! It woud appear
then, that for wery many years past, it has been the speshal dooty
of the most knowingest of the four Wardens of the Compny, so far
as a practical knolledge of wines was conserned, to lay in a large stock
of the werry rarest and finest that money could procure, for the use
of the thirsty Drapers, and so thoroughly and oonseentiously has
this dooty bin performed, that not only has more than one Wine
Warden fallen a Marter in the sacred cause, but the Cellar of the
lordly Drapers was littorally a busting with their glorious contents!
and they may be said to have xclaimed allergollically, Stop it I we
oarn't hold no more! My frend told me that for the larst year or 2
their efforts to make a hole, so to speek, in their winous stock was
most credittable to all conserned, omshals and all, but in wane! So
a sollem counsel was called, and stock ordered to be taken of the
priceless contents of their capayoious cellars. It was a hendless
task, but it was dun, and in doo time the gigantic cattalog was laid
before the washnpfool Court I
Experts was then called in, and'a calkerlation was made as to how
long the stock of wine woud last, supposing the konsumption to
continue as it had been for years past, and the result, after several
jovial meetings to make sure as there was no mistake in so werry
himportant a matter, was found to be, that there was quite enuff to
last em another thirty year!
Then came the most sollemest question of all. Woud the finest of
all Clarets, and the noblest of all Ports, and the loveliest of all Sham-
panes, larst another 30 years? Again was the werry expertest of
all experienced experts called in to give their unbyassed opinyon,
and, after several more jovial banquets, as no fine wine can be
properly tasted except at a scrumptious banquet, and with its proper
courses, the final decision was given that it woud not I

the Hockshuneer's on that day I shall not soon forget. Sampels of such Wines
as most peeple is content ony to dream about, handed round permisoous to a
thirsty mob. No sipping, oh no, bat everybody emptied his glass like a man,
so there was no littel heel-taps for the poor porters. Of coarse Brown and
me, with our long xperience, took preshus good care not to (-pile the look of
the wine by pouring it out too close, suttenly not, not by no means.
I manidged to git on good terms with the werry obliging Clark who took down
the names of the buyers, so I knows pretty well where sum of the werry finest
of the wines is gone to, speshally sum of my hown speshal Brands, so I still
indulges in the fond hope that, " sum day, sum day, sum day I shall see them."
I suppose it was the werry xciting day as I spent on that Hockshun Day, and
not the remains of the werry hold battels of werry hold wine as afeoted me
so singulally, but I was suttenly a werry long time getting home, and when
at length I arrived there, my reoepshun by my best-beloved was of that
strange character that I never knew ekalled. Of course it was werry kind to
insist on taking off my Wellinton Boots, when I was quite prepared to sleep in
'em, but why she shood xpress the unkind wish that I snood never attend
such a Hockshun again, I reelly carn't emadgin. Robert.
Humanity and Machinery.
Mr. Leonard Courtney, M.P., speaking at the Annual Meeting of the
Charity Organisation Society, said, "You cannot cure the ills of Society by
philanthropy." The maxim would have been more epigrammatic, and equally
true, if he had added, "nor without it." It is in the combination of the philan-
thropic impulse, as motor, with sound organisation, as machinery, that the only
hope lies of shaping an engine for the real " elevation of society." Philan-
thropy without knowledge is as ineffective as steam without a oylinder. But
knowledge without philanthropy is as inert as the oylinder without steam. The
Watt and Stephenson of Social Machinery are sorely wanted and anxiously
awaited.
THE COUNTY SQUIRE.
(A Song in tun parti, as sung before and after the introdw
tion of the Local Government Bill.)
Air—« The Holy Friar."
I. —Before.
I am a Squire of the present day,
To Quarter Sessions I take my way.
County business 1 have in my grip,
With Peer and Parson I sit and sip,—
Get on without me the County can't,
When highways they'd make, or money they want.
And why I'm so popular, that I will tell,—
The rustics do like to be ruled by a Swell.
No Lord Lieutenant they more admire
Than a resolute ruddy-faced County Squire.
II. —After.
But what is this?' Is't a horrible dream?
Are our Tory leaders indeed what they seem?
Their stoutest supporters why mortify
With this blessed big Bill, which is all my eye.
County Councils to handle the tin?
The Squire and the Parson both sack'd—for what sin P
Staff I It's a dirty dashed Radical wrong.
If it passes, my knell will be ringing, ding-dong.
For the power will cease, and the reign will expire
Of. the resolute, ruddy-faced County Squire!
The Real "Mystery of a Hanson Cab."—Why
it is that, despite much talk of new patented improve-
ments, that vehicle is found, in nine cases out of ten,
to be still a "Little-case" of dirt, damp, and general
discomfort. Anyone who can solve this mystery will
doubtless " hear of something to his advantage."
CONVERSION ALL ROUND.
A Conversion the Nation's poor creditor rues
That condemns him great part of his income to lose.
He must own 'tis all fair, but in heart he repines.
And, himself unconverted, accounts it hard lines.
It is much to be feared that he takes it so ill
As to harbour a sense the reverse of good will
To the smiling financiers who bid him be gay,
Having known where to put their own pelf cafe away.
By Conversion the Government credit will get
From the millions aggrieved by the National Debt,
In proportion, of course, to the sum of relief
Which they gain by so great an assuagement of gritf.
But besides, there's another " Conversion" than that
Which will fatten the lean at the cost of the fat;
For Conversion the Cabinet merit may claim
In general—Conversion at large is their game.
They've oonverted Consols, Three-per-cent., not alone,
But the views heretofore till in office their own,
In political faith a conversion indeed;
For oonverted they stand to the Radical creed.
The Liberals, too, are oonverted and thrive
As Unionists, Liberal-ConservahVe,
With Ritchie Gladstonian-Irish are found.
And so, one may say, there's Conversion all round.
Conservatives—this is oonversion-in-ohief,—
Converted by Bradlaugh I 'tis past all belief I
Now, what have Cjnservatives left to conserve?
Their seats. To do this they wiU strain every nerve.
"KEATS AND HIS HAMPSTEA.D HOME."
Under this heading, the Sunday Times—sprightly
paper this, nowadays — published a communication,
signed " B. L. H.," bewailing the probable demolition
of Lawn Bank, onoe the home of Poet Keats. The
owner of the property, it appears, hasn't yet made up
his mind whether to pull it down, or let it. The devotees
of Keats cry, "Let it alone!" The owner of the pro-
perty will probably retort to the devotees, "Then you
buy it 1" Sentiment is muoh: but six-per-oentiment is
more. And, on the whole, we should not like to be the
owner of a Dead Lion's Den.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

House of Commont, Monday Night, March 19.—Foresight of
Government in matters of detail strikingly illustrated to-night.
Have got up most stupendous Bill of modern times; touches innu-
merable interests throughout the country; takes ten days to print,
and upwards of two hours to describe in outline. Wants a man of
corresponding inches to take charge of it. King-Hakman might do,
but otherwise engaged. So Ritchie placed in charge of scheme. A
monstrous medley of minute multiformity; but Ritchie managed
to make it plain. Avoided all effort at oratorical flourish. Got a
downright hard job on hand, and grappled with it in downright
honest fashion much appreciated by House. Gladstone, who is
nowadays always blessing the Government, came out with unusual
fervour, publicly patting Ritchie on the baek. Only frigidity of
the season found on Conservative Benches.
"Much worse than Dilke's Bill," Babttelot whispers to
Fowler, "and you know we would not have that on any account."
"Yah! yah I murmured the Alderman. "Only one bright spot
in Bill. Middlesex Magistrates shall sit as Magistrates for new
County of London."
"Not sure, Toby," said Gladstone, as I crossed the Lobby with
him when all was over, " that from our point of view we aren't doing
better than if I was in office with a majority of eighty. Never dared
have brought in such thoroughly Radical measure as Ritchie's. If
we had, would have wasted three Sessions in urging it on. Now we
go into Opposition, they come into office, and do our work more
thoroughly and more rapidly than we could."
"Then, Sir," I said, you won't go back when the great heart of
the people stirs and calls you with peremptory voice P

"Oh dear, oh dear!" oried Old Morality, pinning on his shawl
and tucking up his trousers, preparatory to going home through the
snow, "there s no pleasing those fellows. On Friday, Dillon
awfully angry because 1 moved Closure at twenty-five minutes to
twelve; said it was too early. Now I wait till twelve, and Tim
Bealy says it's too late. Strike high, strike low, nothing will

Business done.—Local Government Bill introduced.
Tuesday. Things going wrong in the House of Lords. Lonn
Chancellor moved Second Reading of Land Transfer Bill. As he con-
fessed, expected Noble Lords would
pass this stage without demur. Noble
Lords took other view of their duty.
Arundel of Wardour charged
amazed Government with advoca-
ting revolutionary principles. Stan-
let of Alderley denounced Bill;
Clifford of Chudleigh adversely
criticised it. Strathedxn and
Campbell magnanimously declined
to press tottering Government; but
Denhan oame to front, and dealt
staggering blow. Long time since
snob, galaxy of hereditary ability
shone upon pallid occupant of
Woolsack. Zetland, looking on,
began to think there were insti-
tutions more hopelessly undermined
even than the Jockey Club. The
Markiss, with burlesque of audacity,
hinted that the phenomenon was
due to "lack of adequate informa-
tion on the part of Noble Lords."
But Lord Chancellor, supporting
his columnar figure against Wool-
sack, falteringly admitted that " no
one had said good word for the Bill."
Accordingly, it was read a Second
Time.
Commons had Morning Sitting. C
mittee. As, however, only trifle of some hundreds of millions at
issue, attendance very thin. Dismission chiefly confined to ex-
Chancellors of the Exohequer, and the present occupant of the
office. Naturally, that great financial authority, Grandolph, came
to the front. Gladstone having differed from Goschen on impor-
tant olause of Bill, Grandolph interposed, and in finest judicial
manner differed from both. Elderly and respectable they might be;
even possessing some reputation in financial world. But, really,
approaohing subject from directly opposite points of view, they were
both ridiculously wrong. Grandolph mentioned this modestly.
Still th9re it was.
"It's a great pity," Chaplin murmured under his breath, "that this
eminent man is, after all,
only human. Possibly he
v, \ might manage to fulfil the
duties of Secretary of State
for War combined with
those of First Lord of the
Admiralty. But then he
knows more about India
than anyone else, and in
questions of finance com-
pared with his omniscience,
Gladstone is a folly and
Goschen an impertinence.
Yet I'm afraid that it is
even beyond Grandolph's
capacity, controlling the
Army, directing the Navy,
caring for India, also to be
our Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer!" And Chaplin
gobbed.
Business done.— Conver-
gion of Debt Bill passed
through Committee.
Thursday. — Touth and
Age came down to House
to-day arm-in-arm. Age
to hear Touth swear and Bee
him take his seat. Age sat
up in PeerB* Gallery—white-haired, ruddy-faced, pleasant-eyed—
our old friend John Manners, now seventh Duke of Rutland.

The New Duke.
Youth is Henry Manners, now Marquis of Granby, and Member
for Mid Leicestershire. ("'Susan Clarke, "Markis o' Granby,"
Dorking,'" said Plunket; "wasn't that the name and address
Sam Welter s father had inserted in the marriage licence ? ") But
late he was Private Secretary to quite another Markiss. Now a
Markiss himself—at least quite as much as Hartinoton. The new
Duke watches new Marquis oarefully through ceremony. Hears
him oheered by Conservatives, sees him welcomed by Ministers,
observes him bow low over Speaker's outstretohed hand, and then
goes his way, trying to remember his Coleridge—
"Life went a-Maying
With Nature, Hope, and Poesy,
When I was young!
When I was young f Ah, woful when!
Ah, for the change 'twixt now and then!''
Still Constitution attaoked by Irish, undermined by Socialists, ham-
pered by Grand Old Mannists, is safe. For there is yet a Rutland
in the Lords, and a Manners in the Commons.
Lord John well away from his old quarters on Treasury Bench
to-night. Never a bed of rosea To-night particularly prickly.
Criminal Evidence Bill down for Second Reading. Quite inoffensive
looking measure. Receives united blessing ot Attorney-General,
Charles Rdssell, and Henry James. After this seems nothing
more to say. Irish thought otherwise. Have long made it a
grievance that certain English Bills do not extend to Ireland. Now
weep and wail beoause Criminal Evidence Bill to run through Great
Britain and Ireland. Debate began at five o'clock. At half-past
ten Old Morality pounced; movement well meant, but par-
ticularly ill chosen. Parnell just risen, and thus promptly shut
up. Irish howled with rage. Harcourt shaken with indignation.
John Morley terribly indignant. All the fat in the fire; frizzled
famously. What with Divisions, crimination and recrimination next
hour and half quickly passed by; twelve o'clock struck, and next
Order barred.
Oddly enough next Order was stage of Bill providing salary for
King-Harman. Strange untoward accident that unexpected and
prolonged debate should have sprung up on inoffensive Bill pre-
ceding it.
"Tell you what, Goschen," said Old Morality, wearily packing
up his papers, "you must somehow provide £1000 a-year for King-
Harm an, and we '11 give it him to go away. He's playing the doose
with our prospects. Lost more time over him than on all other
debateable points put together."
Business done.—King-Harman's Salary Bill postponed
another sitting.
Friday.—Bradlaugh brought on Motion for appointment
Committee to inquire int > Pensions; and, what ia more, carried it.
Capital Debate, enlivened by interesting speech from Jenninob, who
talked rabid Radicalism from centre of Conservative Camp. Glad-
stone much excited at disclosures made. Finally turned upon
Childers, and, impressing remarks by persistently poking him in
ribs with outstretched finger, addressed to him animated speech of
ten minutes' duration. From resigned expression on Childers'
face, report got about that Gladstone, dwelling upon enormity of
Pension system, was explaining to Childers that he should begin
reform by docking his pension as ex-Miniater. Must begin
where, you know.
Business done.—Inquiry ordered into Pensions.

Italian, and roll from the
singer's mouth in pleasant
liquid cadence. Alas, our pro-
saic language is apt to vulga-
rise the sentiment of Italian
poetry.
The Venetian Gondolier is not
only merry, he is wise; not
only gay but learned. His
name is Beppo, and in the
gentle undulating navigation
of the canals ana lagoons he
prefers to have a comrade.
The rich English visitors pre-
fer it also, it costs more
money and is distingue, don't
you know—il prima gondolero and it tecondo. Merry and wise I
■aid advisedly. You shall never find Beppo without his ready
■mile, his polite grazie! la ringrazio! Similarly you shall find
him deeply learned in certain Shakspeare plays, not that he
knows anything of the bard, who he was, or what he was, but he is
sceptical as to the authorship of Othello, The Merchant of Venice.
He does not venture to imply that Bacon wrote them, as some other
equally learned commentators do, but when you suggest to him that
an Englishman wrote the stories of Othello and Shylock, he knows it
U one of your jokes, and he laughs and sings accordingly for your
divertimento which is the breath of your life. At the same time he
knows exactly what you want to see, you laughing Inglesi, who only
become serious for a moment over the woes of Desdemona or the
Palace and the Prison. He knows the tragio history of Desdemona, and
can dwell with enthusiasm upon the thwarted vengeance of Shy lock.
Pulling up before a battered-looking house in a back canal, he will
extend his right arm as if he were posing for a picture and exclaim,
"Otf.llo, Signore, Otello the great general, where he live, riguar-
date—his statue at the door."
"Did he place it there himself?" you ask, for being Inglese, you
are necessarily witty.
"No, after," the smiling Gondolier replies, and thereupon you
encourage him to tell the story, which he does very much on the
familiar Shakspearian lines.
Again you fire off a little joke as to the authorship, and he tells you
the tragedy is really Venetian and true, written in the histories.
"And there, Signore!" he exclaims, before you have time for your
next witticism,' Riguardate do! Ecco! The house where Signore
Caksio lived."
You are near the Rialto now, and you ask if the gentleman in the
Jewish gaberdine going over the bridge, is Mr. Ik vino. He does not
understand, but you find yourself suddenly a trifle sentimental as
you think of the Othellos, the Shylocks. the Portias, the Desdemottat
you have known in your time. The Vic, the Princess's, Saddler's
Weill and other happy hunting-grounds of Shakspbare, fill your
thoughts and for a little while you make no jokes, you risk no more
The Gay Gondolier knows your symptoms. _ His
stories of the unhappy Desdemona, the brave Othello committing
suicide always make his noble English patron a trifle triste. Beppo
is jubilant but with suppressed force; in some occult way he may have
heard of Mr. Coghlan as Shylock. Alert intellectually as well as
physically, Beppo fits himself to your humour. He begins to hum a
few ban of Garibaldi's Hymn. He has a good voice, you encourage
his vocal efforts. It is evening, in fact the moon has risen while you
have been smoking and dreaming.
"Ah. Signore," it reminds him of his gallant padrone who died on
the field. "But here, Signore, here is my comrade Cabtello. he
fought by Gahibaldi's side; he is covered with wounds more than
you can count."
At this Golondero secondo, nods and smiles and whispers "Ah
poterino!" Being an Englishman away from home, you are sympa-
thetic towards all nationalities, to the Italian in particular. You
speak of the Crimea, of La belle Alliance. Primo and Secondo
burst out into wild praises of the brave Inglesi, and are both
supremely happy; for have they any other idea than to please the
noble patron r Does he sigh, they are sad unto tears; does he laugh,
they overflow in song:—
"Ever gay and free, boys!"
Do not be surprised if in the midst of your reverie, Beppo and his
Secondo have what seems to be a violent quarrel with a rival orew
who come suddenly upon them round a corner without sufficient
warning; not that the incident has endangered the safety of their
navigation, but it has given all parties an opportunity for one of
those tremendous disturbances, which on a first experience you con-
clude will end in the use of that ready dagger which you feel sure is
in the belt of every Beppo and Garibaldini in Italy.
"What is the matter?" you ask excitedly, when the feud is at
its height, or that there shall be no mistake, you speak in Italian (for
being English you are naturally a linguist) Che cosa c'S t"
Beppo will turn to you gay and smiling to remark there is nothing
the matter, or out of politeness to your choice Italian, he will reply,
"Non c'e niente," at the same time returning to the fray of words
with renewed zest until the foe is out of hearing, the foe doing like-
wise until Beppo is out of sight. He is ready to laugh the next
moment at your lightest joke, he will even smile upon the new steam-
boat, for he knows the gondola will last his time, and that no Inglesi
will ever patronise a vessel that is common to all the city; yet he is
free to confess that they were glorious days when the palaces were
occupied with the grand old. families, each family with its company
of Gondoliers, and there were intrigues and assassinations and affairs
and great holidays, and captives from over the seas, and Venice was
queen of the world. "Ah, Signore, those days are past, but iDglese
tney come to Venezia, they love the Grand Canal, thePalazzio Pizarro,
Saint Marco, Otello, Desdemona, and they have large heart and much
la buonamano!"
"Addio, Beppo 1"
His hat is in his hand. There is a tear in his eye. Secondo watches
and imitates his ohief. They are a picture. Beppo tall, erect, in
blue cloth, vest open at the neck, embroidered sash, broad sailor-hat.
Secondo, short, broad of chest, wrinkled face, crimson sash, and out-
throat grin; but equally sincere in his regrets at your departure,
equally appreciative of your drink-money, both thinking of the
polento and fish, and chianti, and cigars they will enjoy while you
are pelting away homewards on the hot railway in the stuffy car-
riages. You take home some pleasant memories, you have bought
the right to be critical about studies of Venioe at the Academy and
the Grosvenor; and when you examine your banking acoount, you
find that you nave paid nobly for your privileges.

SEEING ROBERTS."
The other night I witnessed the 165th performance of The Old
Guard at the Avenue Theatre. Wh«re would The Old Guard be
without Mr. Art hue Roberts? Nowhere. Certainly not at the
Avenue Theatre.
Mr. Joseph Taplet is a pleasing tenor, and hat as much acting
in him, as, in
the ordinary
way of busi-
ness, can be
got out of a
tenor; and,
when he has
s ome thing
worthy of his
roice, I may
say to him,
"ion will un-
d o ubt edly
make your
Mark, Tap-
lbt!" At
present
there is not
m u o h for
Joseph. Mr.
Also Maesh
is a fine fellow,
>and a vigorous
js*- baritone, and
the Capitaine
suits his mar-
General Arthur Roberta coming to the support of the ghal hearing
Old Guard. Migg MABION
Edgcumbe has a pretty face and a pretty mezzo voice, whioh should
be her fortune. Miss Fanitt Wkhtwobth is a lively soprano.
Miss Henbiette Polak, alluded to by Shakspkabe as the "sledded
Polak"—makes an uncommonly sprightly Bugler — a sort of
Cherubino in French uniform. Miss Claba Grahame only fails
of completely identifying herself with the remarkably trying part
of Lieutenant Vigoreux, out of pure consideration for the public,
who, it evidently occurs to her, would be sorry to lose sight entirely
of Miss Claba Grahame.
It is a question whether Mr. J. T. Dallas would not be more at
home in serious Opera, than in these light French frivolities, which
offer but little soope to the magnificent quality of his voioe, seldom
heard, but always thoroughly appreciated, or to his remarkable
histrionic abilities, which would recall the days of Gabbick, Talma,
and the elder Kean—that is, if anyone wished to recall them.
Finally, the clever young lady, whom, for the nonoe, I will call
Incognita, as her name was not in the playbill (a rare instance of
self-effacement, seeing that she represented Miss Ph-ll-s Bb-oht-n
in the part of Follow-the-Drum), played and danced—she may
have sung, too, but, if so, her voice escaped me—capitally, and was
of considerable assistance to the General, Abthub Roberts, to whom,
after all said and sung, I must return, because, despite this brilliant
ensemble, the audience languished when their favourite—the "droll
creature," as the ladies call him—is not on the stage. He certainly is
wonderful. I confess I laugh direotly he is "heard without;" I
laugh when he winks; I laugh more when he "speaks, and, no matter
what is going on upon the stage—and I am bound to say I don't
think there is at any time any thrillingly interesting action in The
Old Guard—the audience, on the grin, follow the eccentric comedian
with their eyes everywhere, so as not to lose whatever he may take
it into his head to do next.
Like the Old Woman who "had so many children, she didn't
know what to do," Mr. Abthub Roberts, whose children are his
quaint ideas, "can never be quiet." He is never in repose:
always wide awake and up to the time of day. Yet, for all this, his
fun is distinctly quiet, so quiet (indeed, that I fanoy the Soprano or
Contralto, or whoever might have been singing her solo on the stage,
did not at first notioe her companion's unobtrusive business, of sewing
for example—[inimitable 1]—and, a hundred and sixtv nights ago,
must have been considerably gratified at the flattering reception
accorded to her song. On such oooasions Mr. Roberts pleasantly
reminds me of the Comic Countryman who pretended to catch a
fly while Mrs. Crummies was making her most telling effect.
To see Mr. Abthub Roberts pretend to brush the crushed Mr.
Dallas's hair by machinery , to see him pretend to sew with invisible
thread and needle, to see him struggling with a sneeze, to see him
imitating the customer at the jug department of a large bar, instruct-
ing the maid in drawing beer, and then giving his life-like present-
ment of a superior'Abbt on familiar terms with the bar-maid—to
see him reading a letter, taking part in a concerted piece and
pretending (he is always "pertending" like children at play) to
sing his part out of a folio of the Code Napoleon, whioh he gravely
offers to the tenor as if it contained the words and musio of an
Oratorio,—to see him doing all this, and ever so muoh more which I
have forgotten, is so irresistibly oomio, that the house cries with
laughter, and no one cares whether it be the Old Guard, or the
Young Guard, or Singing Guards, or Hoarse Guards, White Guards,
or The Other Guards, so long as Arthur Roberts is not absent
from the stage for more than five minutes. In a funny duet, where
there is just a chance for the otherwise partially but unavoidably
suppressed Dallas, Arthur Roberts shows how he can fence. And
of this art he certainly should be a master, as the Avenue Theatre
provides him not with a single stick, but with an entire set of
brilliant foils. Jack m the Box.
P.S.—I cannot offer any opinion on the merits of the music, as,
the theatre being orowded, I could only find a seat on the windy
side of the orchestra close to the big drum, triangles, and cymbals,
for whioh soothing instruments, as it seemed to me, M. Planquettb
has composed with so free hand, that I was compelled to beat a
retreat at the end of the Second Act, and of course I subsequently
heard that General Abthub is at his funniest in the Third.
VOCES POPULI.
Sours—Interior of Third Class Smoking Compartment. First
Passenger, apparently a small Suburban Tradesman, of a full
and comfortable habit, seated by window. To him enters a
seedy but burly Stranger, in a state of muzzy affability, with an
under-suggeshon of quarrelsomeness.
The Stranger (leaning forward mysteriously). Yer saw that
gentleman I was a' torkin' to as I got in Y Did yer know 'oo he was f

on First P.'s knee). Now, you b'leeve what I'm a'goin' to tell yer P
FirstP. (his dignity a little ruffled). I will—if it's anything in reason.
The S. It's this: My opinion of Ktlltvan and Sulton's this—

down Bermondsey way. 'E's got a' nice little butcher's business
there at this present moment; and 'e's a mug if 'e turns it up!

DIARY OF A PESSIMIST.
Down to breakfast. Tea and dry toast. Couldn't manage egg.
Afraid of indigestion.
Looked over the moming papers. Read through the " Deaths."
Skipped "Births" and "Marriages." Never care to read them.
Only want to know who's dead, and what's to pay, which I may be
the worse for. No hope of a legacy.
No news. That is good news. Glanced over the debates with fear
and trembling, in dread of the proposal of some new tax or privation

ROBERT AT THE BOAT-RACE.
The wether was not werry attempting for a water xourshnn, but
the hoffer of a outside seat on a Steam Boat with plenty of refresh-
ments and nothink to pay, was too
grate for me to resist, speshally on a
Satterday, whioh is allers a slaok day
with us. The one grate drawback was
the hurly hour. I hates with a dedly
hatred hurly rising I As late as you
likes at nite, and as late as you likes
in the morning, but
"Hurly to bed and hurly to rise,
If I aaid as I liked, I shood tell great lies!
as the Poet says, or if he didn't like
to say so, I've no dowt he thought so.
I was told to be aboard by 9 sharp,
and so I was, punkshal to the minnet,
and so wery sharp set that dreokly as
we started from the Loryers Peer at
the Temple, me and my pal we de-
scended quite natral like into the
Cabbin, whioh, being jest a leetle bit
sorowged, my frend, who is a Littery man, like myself, said as we
was not only Cabbin'd, but] Cribbed and Confined. I don't at all
know what he meant, but as he said it no less than three times, I
persumes as it's a wery good joke, tho I don't see it.
The Brekfus was that sorumpshus, that, if it hadn't bin for the
nesessity of seeing the Bote Race, I think as we shood have stopt
down there till Lunch-time, and so have kept a good place, but
common desency took us on deck, and uncommon kuriosity kep us
there. We wos jest in time to squeege through Putney Bridge afore
it was stopt up, by horder of the Terns Conserwatives, I was told,
witch I dessay was quite right, for if ewerybody had been left to do
as they liked, there wouldn't have been muoh room for the race. I
begs thus publiokly to thank 'em for so thortfully having the Bridge
washed and polished. It reelly made it look amost as good as new.
The River wasn't a bit ruff, so I didn't feel my ushal inoon wenienoe,
but my frend, who's a old sailor, made me take jest a nip of whisky,
as he called it, so as to make sure, and then took wnn hisself, jest to
kindly keep me cumpny.
We had a bootifool Bite of the grate Raoe, at least we shood have
had one if it hadn't bin for the Fog, which shut all the boats out of
site till they wos olose hup to us. but we seed ennff of 'em to see how
wunderfoolly British pluck oan beat meer Sience. I scarcely expecs
to be beleeved when I says that the two little Botes with only about
nine young gentlemen in wite olose a pulling of each on 'em, acshally
beat the four big Steam Boats as tried in wane to owertake 'em, and
wun in a canter, as my frend told me, with both hands down.
Dreokly as the Raoe was over, me and my frend found ourselves,
promiakus as it were, in the little Cabin agen, and there was lade
out, as if by inoharntment, sitoh a moddel Lunshun as I have seldum
seen xoelled, and, as common perliteness dicktated, we at wunce set
to work agen with inwigorated happytites, thanks to the xoitement
of the great Raoe and the fine North-Easter that rattled so merrily
among our bowlines, as my friend said.
I don't kno when I've tasted a finer peace of Sammon, nor a
lovelier Pidgen Pie, with reel Pidgens in it too, nor a tenderer oom-
binashun of ohiokins and Tung. The Stuard kept a looking at us
with mingled surprize and hadmirashun, and I've no dowt reported
of us most favorable to his imployers, as having dun full justice to
his wittels and his drink. Wen we assended on Deck agane, the
Howses of Parlyment was a standing up boldly in the brite sunlite,
in the near distance, looking as if ewerythink was always as oarm
and as peaoefool within as it suttenly looked without, and. as the
Poet sings, "We stood on the Bridge (Westminster) by midday, as
the Clock was striking the our," (of twelve), and the lust thort as
struck me after my frend had left me was, what a deal oan be dun
in a short time if you ony nose how to do it.
Here had I bin and had a most sorumpshus Brekfust with amost
ewery dellicassy of the season, had seen the werry finest Bote Race
as ever was run, in whioh British Pluck licked British Scienoe into a
Cooked At, and had then had a noble Lunshon, as included all the
other delioassys as had nessessaryly bin left out at Brekfust, and
thoroly injoyed all three, and all in the coarse of three short ours I
The moral as I draws from the grate raoe is, that as M*rlhcrhow
said as how the Battel of Warterloo was won at Heton, so I says as
the Battel of Trafalger was won at Barnes! Robkbt.

WHAT OUR ARTIST HAS TO PUT UP WITH.
"This is your Mother's Portrait, Mr little Man. Do you thikk it like!" "Yes—very—all bct the Face!"
SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY ON THE SITUATION.
Communicated by the Shade of the "Spectator."
[" When the establishment of County Boards has reduced the administra-
tive power of the Justices to zero, the ancient glory of Quarter Sessions will
be gone, and one of the main reasons of the applications now made to the
Lord Lieutenant of the County for the Commission of the Peace will be
found to hare disappeared When Magistrates cease to manage the
business of their County, they will cease also to care for its official honours."
Escott's England (Ed. 1881), Ch. iv. p. 47.]
"Hccc memini, et victum frustrd contendere Thyrsin."
Virgil, Buool. EcL vii. 69.
"The whole debate in memory I retain,
When Thyrsis argued warmly, but in vain."
To revisit—as our great Dramatist expresseth it—" the glimpses
of the moon," is a privilege which, though it hath its pleasures, yet
assuredly is attended at times by a certain drawback of spiritual
pain at once poignant and pathetic.
Of all the ancient haunts which I love, when permitted, to return
to, the dearest to me is that long walk of ancient elms, at a little
distance from what was once Sir Roger's house, among the still
standing ruins of an old abbey, and amidst whose lofty tops the
rooks and crows of another generation still, as of old, "seem to be
cawing in another region." It still lies—and now, perhaps, it must
be allowed with greater show of reason—under the ill report of being
haunted.
I was taking a walk—the natural language of embodied humanity
still comes spontaneously to shadowy lips—in this place, the other
night, between the hours of nine and ten, and could not but agree
with my old and fleshy self of the dear days of the—alas!—departed
Queen A n n k, that it was one of the most proper scenes in the world
for a ghost to appear in. The walk of elms, with the croaking of the
ravens which from time to time are heard from the tops ot them,
looks exceedingly solemn and venerable. One might almost fancy
that, like their human analogues and counterparts, they were croaking
mournfully at the prospect of the destruction and disappearance of
things more venerable even than themselves, and at least as solemn.
As I was walking in this solitude, I became aware of the fact that
it was a solitude no longer. The shade of ray friend, Sir Roger db
Coverlet, was at my side, making his proximity known by a low
sigh, soft as the rustling of spring leaves, sad as the scarcely audible
voice of the gentle night-wind which stirs them.
The good old Knight was musing upon the same subject that at
the moment absorbed my own meditations.
"You once proposed, Mr. Spectator," said he, "that the honest
men of all parties should enter into a kind of association for the
defence of one another, and the confusion of their common enemies.
Of late, sensible men and sober citizens of all parties have been
rejoicing that your scheme seemed nearer than ever before in pros-
pect of realisation. And with what result?
I understood the drift of the worthy Knight's thoughts, and the
point of his piteous question, "You have Been perusing," said I,
with respectful sympathy, "the ingenious Mr. Ritchie's new-
fangled, scheme of County Administration as set forth in his Local
Government Bill?"
"Indeed, yes," sighed Sir Rogeb. "And what is it—to adopt
your own comparison dotto wed from Diodobus Sicultjs—but apoli-
tical crocodile-egg, the egg of Revolution? Would," he added
bitterly, "that some parliamentary ichneumon could be found to
break it, ere it be hatched into the horrid and edacious monster
which it bids fair to bring forth!"
"If we look into the behaviour of ordinary partisans," I replied,
in the same tone, "we shall find them now, as in our time, far from
resembling this disinterested animal."
"Disinterested!" cried the Knight, indignantly, "Disinterested-
ness is as dead as her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Asne herself."
I observed of old that I found the Knight a muoh stronger Tory
in the country than in the town. I find him a muoh stronger Tory
in the Shades than even in the country.
"Sir Andkkw Fbrepoht," pursued Sir Roger, "would doubt-
less welcome this curious birth of an insincere Coalition. He was
ever more inclined to the moneyed than to the landed interest. I
know, Mr. Spectator, that you are a wary man, and do not care
to talk of public matters. But doth not this monstrous menace
to the established repute and time-honoured influence of the Country
Gentleman move even you to indignant revolt?"
I was ever more desirous to soothe than to excite, to compose party

and polemio differences, than to aggravate them. There are some
opinions in which a man should stand neuter, without engaging his
assent to one side or the other. Such a hovering faith as this, which
refuses to settle upon any determination, is absolutely necessary in a
mind that is careful to avoid errors and prepossessions. It is with
this temper of mind, that I consider the subjeot which so aroused my
friend Sir Roger's not unnatural wrath.
"I remember," said I, "listening to the proceedings of the County
Sessions with muoh attention, and being infinitely pleased with that
great appearance and solemnity which so properly accompanies such
a public administration of our laws."
And all that," cried the worthy Knight, hotly, "all that is to be
changed, subverted, revolutionised, without reason, and, as the
St. James's Gazette—an admirable journal, Sir, quite after my own
heart!—rightly asserts, without necessity, and in the absolute
absence of any call from the Country. Preposterous 1 Infamous!
Unpreoedentedly, wantonly gratuitous 1"
If I mistake not, Sii Rogeb," I pursued, in the same concilia-
tory tone, "you yourself were called upon to serve as Sheriff of the
County when in your twenty-third year."
"I was," replied Sir Roger; "and I indulged the pleasure of a
young man (who did not think ill of his own person), in taking that
public occasion of showing my figure and behaviour to advantage.
I should not do so now, Sir. I should not do so now."
"Nay, Sir," said I, "it may well be that this Revolution, like
some others, will be less in reality than in appearance, or will be
limited and ameliorated by conditions and influences none the less
potent and permanent because subtle, and, to the vulgar eye, per-
chance, invisible. The rascally red faoe of Revolution, like that of
a blustering Bardolph, is often more threatening than formidable."
"Sir," cried the Knight, "a Country Gentleman of good descent
and substantial estate, might of old, creditably and without loss of
dignity, become a Justice of the Quorum, fill the Chair at Quarter
Sessions, co-operate in County administration with his peers and the
paraon. But sit on these new-fangled County Councils cheek-by-
jowl with the Tom Touchies, the republican Scribblers, the revolu-
tionary Cobblers, and other the tagrag and bobtail of Mob-election P
Never, Sir I Sir Andrew Freeport, with his trade instincts and
republican doctrines, might find himself at home in such company,
not a true Tory Squire, or sound Anglican divine."
"But surely, Sir Roger," said I, "a patriot's duty is to serve his
misgnided country in the worst pinoh of her misfortunes, even at the
cost of discomfort to himself. Could such an one as yourself for
instance, be present at one of these projected County Councils, and
perchance make such an impressive and inspiring harangue as I once
heard you deliver at the County Assizes, how would he inform the
assembly, give himself a figure in the publio eye, keep up his oredit
in the County, abash parvenu insolence, crush crude conceit, and
consequently checkmate and countervail the very dangers and disasters
which your patriotic prevision marks from afar 1 Remember, Sir,
what we agreed upon of old, that a Member of the Society we pro-
jected 'who 'should carefully employ himself in making room for
merit by throwing down the worthless and depraved part of man-
kind from the conspicuous station of life to which they have some-
times been advanced, and all this without regard to his private
interest,' would be no small benefactor to his Country."
Sir Roger fetched a deep sigh, and fell into a fit of musing.
"You know. Sir," I pursued, "that feuds between the wealthy
and well-placed, though too frequent in this country, are very fatal
to the ordinary people, who are so used to be dazzled with riches,
that they pay as muoh deference to the understanding of a man of
an estate, as of a man of learning; and are so hardly brought to
regard any truth, however important soever it may be, that is
preached to them, when they know there are several men of five
hundred a year who do not believe in it."
My friend's speaking countenance softened until it was scarcely
more recognisable as the indignant visage I had lately looked upon
than was the frowning and staring paint-transformed sign of the
"Saracen's Head," as his own benign physiognomy. He was about
to break forth into a discourse consonant, I am sure, with his
changed expression, when the clarion of chanticleer welcoming the
first glimmer of dawn that broke through the thick branches of the
aged elms rendered necessary what, in parliamentary diction, would
be designated an adjournment of the debate.

"Veabt Viator" writes:—" Sir,—The other day, walking in
the neighbourhood of Waltham Cross, I came suddenly upon the
historic stones of Temple Bar, erected at the entrance of Theobald's
Park. I have ascertained that this situation for our lumbering old
obstructionist friend pleases some folks, but, for my part, I can only
look upon its present position as ' Faute de Meux'."

Exchequer,—" Are Towel-horses and Clothes-horses to be taxed P"

(Chez Lui.)
"I am very glad to see you," says the Comic Chancellor, as yon
enter his sanctum. "When you were ushered in you soaroely
expected me to be a peer—I mean to
appear P"
You bow gravely, while the Right
Hon. Gentleman rings for one of .
subordinates.
"My Laughing Seoretary," he ex-
plains, when the young gentleman
enters. "This kindly individual ap-
preciates my jokes. I said to my visitor
he scarcely expected me to be a peer—
cz, ..~\^^* ~^^yt'l -® injcn^a^e *or *° aPPear' You see the
Call this a "Pleasure Horse!" , Thus challenged, the new-comer
bursts into a shout of merriment, ana
says the jest is of first-rate quality. On his retirement the
Chancellor informs you that it is his employe s duty to listen to and
applaud his jokes. For this he receives a princely salary.
No sinecure post, I can assure you, although there's no writing
about it, in spite of its being called tigny cure! Perhaps you would
not mind smiling yourself at my jokes in the absence of my Laughing
Secretary. Thank you."
Then the Cabinet Minister beoomes graver as he removes a cover'
ing from what appears to be a framed sampler.
Here is my celebrated joke about Gabbice being on the Spree
when Mr. Wtndham, of the Criterion Theatre, was in Berlin.
"But have you not made another joke about Mr. Wtndham P"
"I have," returns the Comic Chancellor, modestly; "I said that
although Mr. Wtndham was greatly liked at the Court Theatre in
the Prussian capital, that might be said to be no Criterion."
"The Criterion is the name of Mr. Windham's London theatre,
is it not P"
"Yes'; and that was the pith of my pleasantry. Had Mr.
Wtndham been the lessee, for instance, of the Haymarket, I should
have been unable to have given so muoh point to my jest."
"How ever do you think of such clever things, with so many other
matters to attend to—for instance the Budget and the Conversion
Bill?"
"I really cannot tell yon. They come to me spontaneously. I
believe I have a gift for waggery."
"Have you any works of reference P"
"A great many—but my favourite assistant is Joseph"
"ChambeblainP"
"No, Miller, dear old Joe !" and here the Comic Chancellor took
down a well-worn volume labelled " Joe Miller."
"Have you made any recent puns?"
"Oh, yes. Only the other day when something was said about
my taking a penny off the Inoome Tax, I observed I thought^ it
ought to be called the Outgo Impost, as everyone had to pay it!
I only took three days in contriving that impromptu."
"Really!"
At this point a servant gives the Comio Chancellor a card. _
"Dear me, I am afraid I can afford you no more of my time. I
have a pupil waiting for me—a well-known divine. I am sure yon
will exouse me." Then turning to the messenger, he adds, "Show
his Grace into the study, and ask my Laughing Secretary to accom-
pany me."
And as you leave this Home of Wit, you hear the grave tones of
the Chancellor and his pupil, followed at intervals by the rather
foroed merriment of the Laughing Secretary.

In this month's Men and Women of the Day, Messrs. Babbat/d
give, as the three "Contemporary Portraits," Miss Ellen Terry
(first-rate—as always, either in or out of a pioture), between the
Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain and the eminent metaphysician
Mr. Herbert Spencer. Oar Joseph looks quite the Right Hon-
ourable, but unfortunately he is somewhat in the shade, which is
most unusual for him; perhaps Messrs. Babbaud wanted to give his
otherwise life-like portrait a touch of novelty. The Metaphysical
Third Party looks exactly what he is, a hard-headed, determined
speculator—in the domain of psychology. A propos of speculation,
Mr. Spenceb himself records now, having dropped £4000 in bringing
out his work on Sciology, he was compelled to stop it at Part VIII.
He works for love, not gain, and from this portrait it may be gathered
that there is not muoh Cupidity about this lover of Psyche.

ADAPTED TO CIRCUMSTANCES.
Sir,—I am watching the case of "Little Lord Fauntleroy" with
some anxiety, as, if it goes against the defendant, I shall find
myself in an awkward predicament. I happen to have adapted for
stage purposes, without asking the permission of the author, a
popular Three-volume Novel. 1 must honestly say I think, in my
own opinion, I have vastly improved it; but if, in spite of this, the
decision now pending is given in favour of the originator of the
work, what, I ask, is to become of me P For it seems that, though
my right to dramatise the Novel will not be questioned, any attempt
made by me to distribute their respective parts to the actors will be
held illegal, and the sending a copy to the Lord Chamberlain will
be absolutely forbidden. This, Sir, will place me under the necessity
not only of teaching the actors orally, but oblige me to get hold of
the Lord Chamberlain, and, whether he will or no, read the entire
piece aloud to him. Now, how am I to execute the first portion of
this task? Am I to button-hole first this actor and then that, and
continue dinning their parts into their ears, until I think I have
succeeded in leaving at least some of their words in their heads P
What of the actor who is accustomed to study in bed in the morn-
ing P Am I to pounce on him before he gets up, and refuse to let
him stir till he has heard me go through his part several times P
The entire matter is beset with difficulties. Could I take the entire
company on a pic-nio in an omnibus, and read the play to them the
whole way there and back, or could I ask them all to dinner every
day for a month, and get through as muoh as they would stand of
it at a time at dessert r
Then as to the Licenser—how should I manage him P He, I fear,
would be sure to resent a three-hours' reading. Would it be better
to rush in, take him by storm, lock his door, and saying boldly,
"No, it's no use calling for help; you are going to near it," fire
away, and get through it at one sitting as fast as I could, or should
I drop in on him at odd moments like a sort of Paul Pry, and remark-
ing pleasantly, "Now you'11 hear a little bit more to-day, won'tyouP''
get through the matter in instalments by sheer force of pushing, and
taking him at a disadvantage when he's not expecting it P
But to tell you the truth, I am not at all sanguine about my
success with the Licenser, even if I am able, which I don't exactly
see how I shall be, to carry matters through successfully with the
company. Perhaps though, the pending decision may not involve a
recourse to some of the above suggestions. If, however, it does,
I assure you, Sir, I shall think twice before I again meddle with the
work of the mere Novelist, and invest it unsolicited with the dignity
and originality that can alone be imparted to it by

Goscitkn explained little provisions of his plan in speech three hours
and three-quarters long. To be precise, speech took three hours and
a quarter. Additional half-hour occupied by succession of apologies
for length of speech. Brought down notes of his address in series of
yolumes of manuscript. _ At end of first three hours Members anx-
iously regarded diminishing pile on left hand of orator. Much cheered
by discovery that there did not appear to be more than four volumes
left. Some revulsion of feeling created by Ashmkad-Baetlf.it at
this moment bringing in fresh glass of water, making the sixth.
But this happily proved to be exoess of zeal. Ashhead remembers
how, in far-off days, when he was about to make a speech, he used
to smuggle in glasses of water in his hat. Never makes a speech
now: draws quarterly salary instead. Has, therefore, no occasion
for drawing water. But when let loose in service of Right Hon.
friend, assiduity amazing. Jackson brought in supplies from other
side; but Ashhead gave him a tumbler to start with, and then beat
him. Qoschxn mopped it all up with avidity, first one side, then the
other. Looked as if he were going to put tax on table water, and
was laying in considerable stores at old rates.
A prodigious speech 1 half as long again as Ritchie's, and twice
as intricate. Gladstone enjoyed himself accordingly. Only, as
after disclosure of principles of Local Government Bill, half afraid
he's played out.
"They won't want me any more, Tobt," he said, when I saw him
home as usual after an important speech; "and fact is, I should
be afraid to go back. They are spoiling my hand by playing more
boldly than I dare do. One week we have a Radical Local Govern-

Yesterday Old
Morality an-
nounced that
principal busi-
ness at to-day's
sitting would
be adjourn-
ment. But they
don't know
everything
down on the
Treasury
Benoh. Much
more business
than that kept
House at it up
to very limits of
possible exten-
sion of Morning Sitting. Quite a heavy debate on work of Land
Commission in Ireland. Randolph said a few last words before
Recess to comfort Ministry. 8o did Gladstone. This opened fresh
opportunity for Arthur Balfour to show his profound scorn for
Ireland and the Irish.
At last Orders run through, and, Motion for Adjournment over
Holidays made. Then Irish Question broke out in fresh place. That
pink of Irish chivalry, Tat Pat, oame to the front, and bludgeoned
Balfoub.
J. F. X. O'Brten fixed Chief Secretary with his flashing eye.
(Dick Power — Where is Dick
Power, by the way ?—once told me
that X. in these initials stands
for Executioner, O'Brien having
twenty years ago, been sentenced
to death for high treason.) Talk
went on to half-past six, ten
minutes to seven, if debate still in
progress. House must needs meet
again at nine. Easter Holidays in
danger. House in such emergenoy
looks trustfully to Old Morality.
Evidently on the pounce this hour
past. Came down at half-past
six. William Redmond j ust risen
to supplement Tay Pay's exhibi-
tion of what Ireland oan produce
in these degenerate days. Old
Morality's extinguisher promptly
popped on, and expectant holiday-
makers breathed again.
From beneath extinguisher,
truculent voice of Redmond ex-
olaiming, "Why don't you let me
answer the Chief Seoretary?"
Pretty to see Old Morality wink.
Not used to indulge in such exhi-
bitions of levity. But W. Redmond
under extinguisher had so exactly
hit the point. "Let him answer
the Chief Secretary 1" Why, if
opportunity had been supplied, Chief Secretary would have been
shattered, Government would have toppled down, and chaos would
have come.
"Not if we know it," said Old Morality's wink, as plainly as if it
spoke.
Closure carried. Motion for Adjournment agreed to. House went
off for Easter Holidays.

THE BUDGET.
Mb. Punch, Sir,—Having devoted one whole day to endeavouring' to
fathom the numerous mysteries of the last new Budget, which required
more than four hours' elaborate descrip-
tion by its talented and knowing author
to explain to an entranced House of Com-
mons, I oan now, Sir. in accordance with
your suggestion, explain the whole mat-
ter so clearly and so explicitly, that the
conventional Schoolboy oan thoroughly
comprehend it. The whole secret of its i
brilliant success is its simplicity. It was jf
preceded, as we all know, especially un-
fortunate Bondholders, by the attempt to
make the simplicity of the 3 per cents,
more simple by reduoing them to the still sweeter simplicity of 2{,
and the success of this brilliant idea being once assured, the rest
followed as a matter of course.
First oame the startling announcement that the great Magician
from the land of Goshen had to deal with an enormous surplus of
no less than £2,165,000 l^and the delighted House prepared to listen
with rapture to the announcement of the many nuisances in the
shape of taxes that were about to be remitted. But the great
Magician waved his wand, and behold the whole of this enormous
surplus, and something more, was to be devoted to the relief of
something or somebody that his colleague, Mr. Ritchie, had tried
to explain a few nights previously, though with only very partial
success.
Having thus satisfactorily cleared the ground, first by creating an
enormous surplus, and then by bidding it vanish into thin air, the
political Prospero again set to work to conjure up an imaginary
surplus to replace that so curiously disposed of, and here his genius
for simplicity had full play. He first began by introducing the
novel idea that all carts should be oharged by weight, and proposed
2s. per owt. as an experiment; but the Agricultural party groaning
at this kindly suggestion, he at once consented to except agricul-
tural carts, this distinction to be ascertained by the inscription on
such carts in blaok letters on a white ground. "This here Cart is a
agricultural one principally confined to Taters and Turmuts."
This I was told in oonfidenoe by an Irish Member.
Another new idea had dawned upon the financial Wizard, so having
taxed carts, he next proceeded to tax wheels, and that too at the
rate of 2s. 6d. a wheel, if over 2 owt. I am not a very experienced
judge in these matters, but I should have thought that few cart-
wheels would weigh over 2 owt., but of course he knows what he was
talking about. Brewers are to be treated rather severely, as they
will be taxed both for weight and wheels, and will have to pay about
£300,000! Poor Brewers! The next brilliant idea was to tax all
pleasure horses 20s. eaoh, and all racehorses £5 each; so racing
Butcher boys will have to be careful. I am glad to see that the tax
upon Hawking is to be altogether abolished, but I do pity the poor
Duke of St. Albans, as I really do not see how they can continue his
salary after that. Why poor Wine Merchants should have to pay
5s. per dozen on wine, if sold in bottles, and nothing at all if Bold in
flagons or hogsheads, I cannot understand, but rich financiers are
always hard upon poor retailers.
The one point in the whole mysterious matter that I do understand
thoroughly is that the Income Tax is to be reduced to the sweet
simplicity of Cel. in the pound, which I am very much pleased with,
as it makes the calculation of how much one has to pay so much more
simple. I do not sufficiently understand about companies' registra-
tion fees, or stamps on foreign securities, to know how they will
operate and on whom, but having devoted two hours to calculating
how the new Budget will affect me, I arrive at the following result.
I possess £20,000 in the simple 3 per cents., which have produoed
me during the last twenty years £600 per annum, I will therefore say,
Income £600 0 0
Loss on Conversion
Tax on 1 Horse ....
,, „ 1 Carriage ....
,, „ 4 Wheels, at 2s. 0</. .
,, ,, Wine, at 5s. per dozen, say
50 0
1 0
1 0
0 10
1 10
Saving Id. in the Pound, Income Tax
54
2
0 0
5 10
Nett Loss . . . £51 14 2
With this startling result staring me in the faoe, I feel considerable
difficulty in joining heartily in the chorus of praise of the Budget,
that it took its author nearly four hours to explain, and the evil
effects of which he could, of course; easily avoid by selling out his
Consols a month ago, and laying in a heavy stock of bottled wino.

THE ODD-EYED ONE.
A Story of a District Surveyor.

Of one Ezekiel Smith
I have a tale to tell;
A man of parts and pith;
I knew him well.
No man was more alert,
Or talkier, or gayer.
Of Deepdene-in-the-Dirt
District Surveyor.
Ezekxel had two eyes.
One blue, the other brown,
One seemed to scan the skies,
And one looked down.
A curious kind of squint!
And of these optics twain,
One read the smallest print
Without a strain!
The other had the range
Of a race-glass, but closo
Saw nothing (which was strange)
Beneath his nose.
Odd-eyed Ezekiel
Inspected and surveyed,
And did it passing well;
Or so men said.
Local Authorities
Are men of nerve and phlegm;
The man of the odd eyes
Satisfied them.
The builders also thrived,
Exceedingly content.
So with the men who lived
Upon Ground Bent.
The tenants only—such
Are tenants!—did not smile.
They murmured very much,
And all the while.
They said the drains would smell,
They said the floors'would creak,
They said the doors would swell,
The roofs would leak.
They are a cross-grained lot,
Aretenants. Smith,much bored,
Pooh-pooh'd their plaints as " rot,"
Their woes ignored.
At last a tenant came
To Deepdene-in-the-Dirt,
A humorist, his i
Was Peter Burt.
He very soon made friends
With everybody round.
A smiling wit—who spends—
Is seldom found.
He had a genial face.
Inclining men to chat,
He soon had aU the place
Beneath his hat.
One day he gave a feed.
Churchwarden Michael Pott
Said, "This 'ere ohap indeed
Well knows wot's wot."
"An excellent repast!"
Said Mr. Roach, the Rector.
"A 1," said Lemuel Last,
Nuisance Inspector.
As for the Odd-Eyed One,
He, with a swelling shirt,
Proposed—'twas neatly done—
The health of Burt.
He, toyingwith a peach,
Said, "Thanks! It is my glory
Never to make a speech.
I '11 tell a story.
"Naturo has wondrous ways;
In her aU wit's embodied,"
He said, and fixed his gaze
Upon the Odd-Eyed.
"A man is not a fly,
Or so says Mr. PorE,
(Whose poems, by the bye,
You read, I hope,)
"But Nature can adjust
Man's vision to his need,
(You, all of you, I trust,
Your Darwin read,)
"You possibly might think
That man an optio ninny
Who could not see—that shrink,
And could—this guinea."
(Hepointed to the door
Whereon a yawning crack
Gaped half an inch, or more,
In zig-zag track.)
"But if he had two eyes
Of quite unequal range,
Twould lessen one's surprise,
'Twould seem less strange.
"An eagle orb applied

To plaster gaping wide

A wall not underpinned,
Foundations of foul slime,

Muck-mortar, crumbling brick,
Bad drainage, fetid nook,

"Whilst it, perchance, perceives
The fee which—unawares—
The Jerry-builder leaves
Upon the stairs.
"Nature, my worthy friends,
Will join the bat and lynx
To gain her wondrous ends.
Ah! she's a sphinx.
"I know a man but stay!
My dear Kzekiel.
What is the matter, pray?
You don't look well."
The Odd-Eyed One, indeed,
Had fallen in a fit.
This broke up Burt's Big Feed,
His guests did flit.

But what struck some as strange,
His health, he straightway found,
Required a change.
He was not long a stayer
At Deepdene-in-the Dirt,

Victoria is starting its own Fleet, with a line-of-battle ship,
several gunboats, a cruiser or two, and torpedo craft. Very crafty

dual control of the Southern Seas. Perhaps in our European wars,
if we have any, we shall be aided by an Australian naval contingent,

be styled a " contingent remainder " P Naturally the biggest island
in the world has the biggest coast-line, and so needs the largest

Tout de Sweet.—Mr. PnrKBO, the olever author of Sweet Laven-
der, complains, in a letter to Mr. Mo v Thomas, who commands the
Daily News Theatrical Column, that our genial contributor, "A
Nastv One," has found a fault with his play because Mr. Terry, as a
Barrister, robes in his Chambers in the Inner Temple, and wears his
bands, or "band" (as Mr. Pinero prefers to call them) over his
scarf. Mr. Pinero suggests that now the Law Courts are moved
from Westminster to the Strand all the Chancery men robe in
Chambers, and only a few Common Law men use the robing-room.
Mr. Pixero is wrong. Long before Westminster (qud Law Courts)
was abolished, the Equity men, having to practise in Lincoln's
Inn, robed in their Chambers, but the vast majority of the Common
Law men on the active list then, as now, assumed their wigs and
gowns in the Courts of Justice. But this is a very small matter.
"Surely," adds our genial contributor, himself a barrister with a
rare practice. "Mr. Pineho should be satisfied with my unqualified
approval of his capital Comedy—a piece which, it will be seen (by
reference to "A Hasty One's" notice of the play), only requires a
little re-arrangement to become practically perfect."
Petting at Petty Sessions.—According to the_ Essex County
Chronicle, the Brentwood Magistrates must be amusing persons. A
few days since a labourer was brought up before three of them,
Messrs. Petre (in the chair), Ind, and Lescheb, charged with
stealing six pounds of beef, and dismissed. To quote our contem-
porary, the Bench "gave him the bent lit of the doubt, the Chairman
warning him to be more careful in the future." No doubt, in
"reported cases " this decision will rank with the celebrated verdict,
"Not guilty, bat don't do it again." From his proneness to_ blow
people up it might be thought that the fall name of the Chairman
should be Salt Petke, were it not evident that Simple Petbe or
Petre Simple would be squally appropriate.

With a smile—and a frown—for all.
On her petulant face there's a boding shade,
As her Phrygian cap in the air she flings.
She is hardly at home with herself, I'm afraid:
In the firelight sparkle her rings.
As she lolls,—peevish fire in her Pompadour eyes
The long, sleepy, soft silken lashes beneath;
Through her Rahab-thread lips, stirred to pettish replies,
Breaks the gleam of white tigerish teeth.
As she lolls,—where your eye, by her beauty subdued,
Droops—from under the drapery scanty and slight
The neatest of feet, sa6o<-slipper'd, protrude,

But what, had she really the power to choose,
She would fix upon, vainly you '11 seek.

The Grammar of Dissent.—The Scotch Professor—there is only

are lots of men worth thousands who have risen—risen from the
ranks—far above Lindley Murray. The Professor doesn't believe
in grammar—he "believes in soul." This is really spirited. Evi-
dently Dr. Blackie is the grandly contradictory sort of personage
who would prefer the " three are nuts" to the " three R's."

When I passed into the salon, I found the

towards me as I entered. He did not change
his position while I remained. He simply

I bowed my thanks for this important
confidence. Hay I ask you to define a

"He who can rightly divide and define,

I backed nearer to the door. I proceeded.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH'S VERY QUEER STORIES.
PBOFESSOB GUINEAFATS FIRST LECTOEE.
It was a pleasant and select party that was assembled at the
Shambles. The oooasion was a remarkable one. Professor Sambo
Gutneafat, the newly-appointed
Oxford Leoturer, was to deliver on
the morrow his first popular address
in the neighbouring market town of
Bulkbnry.
Now the Professor was altogether a
distinguished and notable personage.
Born in Africa, he had fallen early
into the clutches of a troupe of wan-
dering Negro Minstrels, who brought
him to this country as a speculation,
and all the impressions of his earlier
years were acquired in the company of these musical children of his
race, in whose performances he had taken a part, and whose lot,
oast as it was in the rambling life of the caravan, he had shared.
From this, though, it must be added, at the time somewhat against
his will, he was rescued by an enterprising agent of a local School
Board, who, attracted by his peculiarly rich laugh and singular
power of repartee, as evinced in his introduced conversations with
the Banjo Man in the entertainment, foresaw how, if these gifts
were properly utilised, they might he made to subserve the noblest
purposes of educational advancement. Nor was the agent disap-
pointed. Sambo Guineai at rapidly distinguished himself, and,
securing a Triple First at Durham, in a very short time attracted
the notice of the older University. The Chair of Phlebotomy fell
vacant. The authorities offered it to him. He accepted it with
alacrity, and was installed forthwith.
So Sambo Gdtxeafat, M.A., filled the Oxford Chair, and as Sir
Chivet and Lady Shivers introduced him to the select oircle
assembled to meet him in the great drawing-room at the Shambles,
and they surveyed his dignified hearing, his faultless black suit,
gold eye-glasses, carefully-brushed hair, and general professorial
completeness, they could not but admit that, bat for his rich black
colour, he was as good and real a Don as any who at that moment
happened to be parading the High Street of the great University
town itself.
"You will take Miss Fltte in to dinner, Professor," remarked
Lady Shivers, with an arch smile.
The Professor, who was discussing some abstruse theories of
evolution with a scientific celebrity, gave a courtly bow, and
offered the middle-aged lady referred to his arm. She had been
standing coyly by, listening in rapt attention to his learned dis-
course, and blushed as she accepted the prof erred gallantry. This
fair though washed-out creature was the Governess of the house-
hold, and, during the Professor's short stay, had assisted him in his
search for books in the library. He had spoken to her enthusiasti-
cally of his early African experiences. So the charm had been
wrought. The swarthy University Othello had captivated the
worshipping, scantily auburn-haired Detdemona. She felt! that,
were he to ask her, she could share with him his Professorial chair.
Only that very morning, when handing him a volume of Blair*!
Sermone, he had said, "Why, Missie, why do you call 'im 'Pro-
fessor'? Why do you not oall 'im 'Sambo'!"' She had only
replied, "Oh, Mister Sam no, how can you go on so!" and he had
laughed a low rich guttural " Yeogh, yeogh, yeogh I" in response.
She knew from, that hour, if she so willed it, she could win him.
So, when Lady Sinvers, whose quick feminine instinct had divined
in whioh quarter the wind was blowing, had consigned her to his
oharif e at dinner with a significant nod, she blushed.
"You are not nervous about to-morrow's leotureP" she asked,
looking up at him with what was intended to be a little moue.
"No. Missie, 'im berry fit! 'Im never was more fit, Missie.
Yeogh 1 yeogh! yeogh!" And he laughed again richly and deeply.
Then they went in to dinner.
The entertainment went off as such entertainments generally do.
There were awkward pauses at first. Still, as the'' tinned oysters and
salmon and " canned rabbit," began to be washed down by the sweet,
cheap, but rather heady, champagne, upon whioh Sir Chivet had
not scrupled to regale his guests, the conversation gradually became
general, and the Politics of the country, the state of the crops, the
sporting prospects, the forthcoming Lecture, were all tossed helter-
skelter together in the general onflow of the talk. Suddenly there
came a pause, whioh left Lady Pstcee Raffbail in complete pos-
session of the field. She happened to be describing to her neigh-
bour, Captain Washoveb, the performance of some Christy Minstrels
she had seen at the Fair at Bulkbnry that very afternoon.
"You really must see them, Captain," she was saying. "They
are far and away the best Niggers I have ever seen. You know I
go in for the banjo a little bit, but their right-hand man was so
splendid on it that, really, he has quite taken the conceit out
of me. I don't think I shall ever try to touch it again."
"By Jove I" responded the Captain gallantly. And then the
interrupted flow of conversation again burst out on all sides, and was
about to rattle on as merrily as ever, when it was suddenly arrested
by the general attention being called in the direction of the Professor,
who, with a dazed far-off stare, gazed, as if in some absorbed trance,
at the Lady Psyche, and then, as if overmastering some powerful
inward emotion, he addressed her in a husky voice—
"You saw dem Niggers playing at de fair, MaarmP" he asked,
in a voice trembling with smothered emotion.
"Oh! yes, Professor, and very good they were, and they are going
on with their performances now, no doubt; though 1 hear the Fair
closes to-night," she added, with an inconsequent little laugh.
Then the conversation once more became general. The Professor,
however, took no part in it. He sat in his seat as one thunderstruck,
overwhelmed as if with some resistless inward reflection that com-
pelled him to silence. Amidst the general hilarity of the table his
condition passed unnoticed, but Miss Fltte had quickly detected it.
She endeavoured to rouse him by directing his attention to the
aspic of turkey's eggs that the servant was handing him. He
made no reply, but, with his eyes steadily fixed before him, kept
mumbling to himself.
Miss Fltte listened. She thought she oaught the words, "Oh 1
Golly! Golly! Oh! Jehoshaphat I 'Im a berry good corner-man."
Then she grew alarmed. She connected the weird change that had
oome over him with the mention of the Nigger Minstrels, and an
unaccountable siokening sense of fear possessed her. At that
moment the ladies rose. He was still mumbling "Oh! Golly!
Golly!" absently to himself, and did not even notice her departure.
Cigars were produced. The smoke seemed at length to rouse the
Professor from his reverie. He rose, and addressed his host.
"I think, Saar, I will just take a turn on the terrace. 'Im
berry fine evening," he continued, approaching the window.
"Do, by all means," responded the genial Sir Chtvst. hospitably
shutting out his University guest in the bleak and sleet-driving
October night.
In another minute the Professor was darting over the flower-beds
in the direction of the Great Park Gates. At length these were
passed. The lights of the market town shone in the near distance.
"Oh, Golly! Golly! oh, Jehoshaphat!" he cried, throwing up his
arms wildly. "How 'im ab longed to meet dem Niggers; but 'im
will to-night. Yeogh! Yeogh! Yeogh! But 'im will to-night."
Then, in leaps and bounds, dashing over ditches, past copses, and
through hedgerows, the newly-elected Oxford Professor flew on
the wings of the night, and, with eager gaze, [in breathless haste,
made straightway for the Market Fair at fiulkbury.
• • • • • •
It was late in the evening now. There were shouts of uproarious
merriment issuing from the principal booth, the crowded approaches
to which showed thit some unusual attraction within had evidently
succeeded in suiting the publio taste. A pale lady, with scanty
auburn hair, whose dinner-dress was concealed by an old ulster, had
just paid her two-pence at the doors, and entered the back of the
reserved seats. This was Miss Fltte. When the gentlemen had
joined the ladies the Professor had been missed, and the incident of the
Terrace having been mentioned, she had, with a terrible instinct, con-
jeotured where she should find him. She had crept out of the house,
and, to verify her worst suspicions, made for the Christy Minstrel
Show. With a terrible sense of shame and fear she oast her eyes
towards the platform. She knew the worst. There, partly disguised
with a huge burlesque white tie and collar, a long swallow-tailed
white and red striped coat trimmed with buttons as large as muffins,
going through frantic gesticulations and antics with the hones, so
inspired with frenzy that they seemed to work up his audience to
uncontrollable heights of enthusiasm, in the corner seat sat the Pro-
fessor of Phlebotomy. And the whole forces of his nature, pent up
for years in artificial restraints, appeared to have broken loose at last
in one gigantio rush. The training of his early youth triumphantly
vindicated itself. His hursts of wild and exuberant humour knew
no bounds.
As Miss Fltte leant pale and staggering for support against the
damp oanvas back of the tent, he again broke into a rich chuckle
and interrogated one of his brother minstrels with a banjo.
"When, Massa," he asked, "am a pigeon, not a pigeonP You
give'im up? Den I tell you. Yeogh! yeogh! yeogh It is when
*im am, Saar, a pigeon-pie!"
Thunders of applause followed this sally. Then he seemed fairly
possessed. But matters culminated at last. At a oall from the
audience he threw himself into the fantastic extravagances of an
impromptu clog-dance with suoh unrestrained gusto and aplomb,
that he regularly brought down the house. After this Miss Fltte
oould witness the terrible sight no longer. She crept back to her
room at the Shambles by a back way, but she knew that she had lost
her Professor for ever.
When inquiries were made for him next morning at breakfast,
she kept her secret. Meantime, the troupe of Christy Minstrels
had moved on to another and a distant market-town with their

new recruit. At eleven o'clock the Town Hall was packed with an
expectant throng, bat the Professor did not pat in an appearance.
There was search and inquiry for him, but the Committee were
reluctantly compelled to admit that they "did not know what had
become of him?' "It's very awkward," they said; and the
audience had sulkily to disperse.
And so ended what should have been Professor Guineafat's First
Lecture.

"A faithful picture of the manners of a period in French History" as presented on the stage of the Haymarket.
THE HAYMARKET POMP-ADORERS.
It is not an easy matter to exactly classify The Pompadour
amongst the entertainments of the present time. I think I should
not be very wide of the mark in describing it as " an almost extinct
Opera Boufft"
—that is, an
Opera Bouffe
from which
some violent
convulsion,
caused by the
strongly anta-
gonistic dra-
matic forces
known as
"Wills and
Gbundy, had
expelled near-
ly all the
sprightly
dialogue, the
flowing
rhythm, the
comic coup-
1 e t s, the
choruses and
dances, and
left only some
broken poetry
and anoient
witticisms, the
remains of a
pretty ballet
(in perfect pre-
servation), one OpSra Bouffe monarch, Louit-Ashley-the-Fifteenth
struggling for existence, the damaged materials of a comic trio called
BrookfieId-Voltaire, Diderot-Voltaire, and Orimm-aldi-Allan, one
lonely, plaintive air trying to bloom alone in the Third Act, and a
few shreds of Mr. Hamilton Clarke's melodramatic orohestration.
However, if this description be deemed inadequate, then I should
call this piece of powder and patchwork not an effect of collaboration,
but the result of a compromise between Messrs. Wills and Grundy.
Mr. Bkbbbohm Tkkr cannot be too heartily congratulated on his
treatment of this Compromise
when it was once in his hands.
Poet and Humorist had done
their work,—all the difference
between "work" and "play,"
—there was some tall writing,
rather poetic than otherwise,
and there were some rare old
jokes,—one of them at all
events older even than Vol-
taire himself, into whose
mouth it is put, and which,
during his visit to England, he prob-
ably heard told as a good story of
what Lord Rochester once said to
King Charles, when the latter spoke
of himself as "the Father of his
people," and which, perhaps, Messrs.
Wills and Grundy may have re-
membered as always weloome when-
., ever the play of Charles the Second
Ulley-Cibber-Voltairc-Brookneld. (whioh nge<i to be a great favourite
with amateurs, Captain Copp being a highly popular character),
was performed. The work also offered a fair chance of arriving
somehow or other at a striking tableau at the end of each Aot.
While Mr. Tree was thinking it over, there came a knock at the
door. "Come ins, Carr 1" exclaimed the humorous Lessee of the
Haymarket, and Com-yns Carr did. In a second this astute ex-
governor of the Grosvenor saw what to do with The Compromise, and
those who were to be the real collaborators were summoned . To work
they went, and, at the descent of the curtain on the premiere, all the
collaborators, Messrs. Telbin and Johnstone, scene-painters, the

designing Earl, the executors (of the Wills), L. and H. Nathan
costumiers, Collinson and Lock the Pompadour upholsterers, Eatti
Lanner the dancing-mistress, Clarkson the great Wig Minister, and
the Machinist,.Mr. Oliver Wales,—"gallant little Wales,"—should
have been summoned before the curtain to receive the congratulations
of the first-night audience on their individual and combined success.
Rarely has such a series of Pompadour pictures been seen on the
stage. I question whether the courtier on the left side of the stage
is wearing quite the right sort of buckle in his left shoe, and I
should be disposed to doubt the strict accuracy of an inch of the
trimming worn by the lady who stands at the back of the stage,
almost hidden by Miss Rose Leclebcq, who is the most winning
and charmingly graceful figure, and the one experienced actress in
all that crowd. I venture to draw the attention of Messrs. H. and
L. Nathan to the third button of Collet/ Cibber'i, no, I mean! Vol-
taire's— Vol-
taire, mind,

does: I am still inclined to my first expressed opinions, that these
materials are the remains of , , ,
an extinct Opera Bouffe,
and should there be any
doubt in Mr. Tree's mind as
to the lasting attraction of
The Compromise—there can
be none as to the durability

and it is this: let him call in

MY PLAY.
Sir,—Having for some time past been devoting the whole of my
time to the writing of a work intended for production on the stage,
it is, I confess with some chagrin and no little astonishment, that I
find I am unable to meet with a single Manager who is willing to
accept it. And what mikes this reluctance the more remarkable is
the testimony borne almost universally to the excellence of my play
by the leading Actors and Managers to whom I have submitted it.
You oan see from the following specimens which I subjoin, with what
a general chorus of welcome and approval they have hailed my work.
If, after reading these you are able to furnish me with any explana-
tion to account for the fact that I have not only not been set upon
on all sides with a view to the production of my piece, but have not
even had one single application calculated to lead to any negotiation
about the affair whatever, I need scarcely add I shall be glad to
receive it. 1 herewith also enclose the plot in full as I think it may
interest you.* Begging your attentive perusal of the highly flattering
opinions of my work which I append hereto, I desire to subscribe
myself, Your muoh-surprised and disappointed correspondent,
Ben-Brinsley Shakspbabb.
"I have read your piece, and have been quite carried away by it.
The writing is magnificent. What a part, too, is that Policeman's 1"
—Wilson Barrett.
"A fine play. You ought to meet with no difficulty in finding
some one ready to build you a theatre to produce it."—Henry
Neville.
"Subtle, majestic, and immensely humorous. If it were not for
that procession of elephants in the Seventh Act, I might have looked
at the part of that Arabian thimble-rigging fellow myself."—J. L.

the Public will probably feel on seeing the play when it is produced.—Ed.

"A fine play. You certainly can write. Ycur dialogue alone
ought to bring any house down."—Arthur Cecil.
"I'm mre it'b quite splendid."—Lottie Venn.
"Very oatching. Ought to go with a roar."—Nellie Fabbew.

"Powerful and sportive. That cataract scene alone ought to carry

"Strong in situation, terse in diction, and eminently dramatic, it
ought to make the fortunes of half-a-dozen Managers. I regret,
however, I oan not produce it at the Lyceum."—Henry Ibvtno.
"An excellent play. Altogether a very high-class piece of work.
There are heaps of money in it. I am afraid, though, it is not suited
to our requirements."—W.H.Kendal.
"A tip-top Drama, the takings of which, I should say, would be
tremendous. I am sorry, though, I can't see my way to putting it
up at Drury Lane."—Augustus Harris.
"Re-written, reconsidered, and reconstructed, it ought to out up
into at least five Comic Operas. I enjoyed it much."—Carl Rosa.
"Offers a great and unique chance. Why not take a theatre, and
produce it yourself? Shall I see you on the subject. There's a
part in it which, worked up a bit, might suit me."—Gilbebt Fab-

drunkard. The last time I saw my friend was a little
late one night, or rather morning, at the Good Consti-
tution Club, when he was asleep, and where I explained to
him the story of a Three Act Drama I contemplated
writing. He was then certainly intoxicated—very in-
toxicated—for he declared that what I had been telling
him was " bosh." I hope he is better now. I shall
take this Note-book, and, if possible, jot down my
observations under the table.

SHOOTING NIAGARA.
It appears that on a recent occasion the crowds thronging to see
M. P ii i li r pot ea cx's famous picture of'' Niagara " were so excessive,
and on being appealed to by the authorities to " circulate," so abso-
lutely disinclined to budge a single inch, that order had to be restored
by the intervention of the Police, who finally established it by clear-
ing the entire building. With a view, however, to dealing with
further possible invasions, likely to result from the growing attrac-
tiveness of the show, Mr. John Hollingshead, its ever business-like
and spirited Manager, intends, it is said, to issue the following
notice, which certainly seems calculated to minimise the nuisance of
which it professes to dispose.
Caution to the Public.
Every responsible person presenting himself for admission will be
called upon to sign a contract at the door undertaking for himself,
and if necessary for his family or the party accompanying him, not
to pause for a single moment to gaze at any portion of the Cyclo-
rama, but to keep moving continually at a steady trot through the
building, which must be preserved uniformly from the moment of
passing the turnstile to that of reaching the door of exit.
As this will probably necessitate some physical exertion, invalids

Qoschen's Conversion Scheme. — "When shall we
Threes meet again P"
and the infirm and aged, unless accompanied by their family soli-
citor, or by some other respectable person who will be responsible for
their keeping up the pace, are warned off.
To ensure the unceasing and lively continuance of this movement,
it will be supervised by an able body of Police provided with trun-
cheons, assisted by picked and experienced Guardsmen, armed with
fixed bayonets.
There will be a short comprehensive lecture every minute and a
half, giving the history of America from the earliest times to the
arrival of Columbus, the details of the War of Independence, the
strife between North and South, the history of Canada, and the
Statistics of the Fisheries and general population. As this will be
shouted almost continuously, from a speaking-trumpet, every visitor,
though hurrying along on his round, will probably catch some of it.
No flying questions may be put to the man in the rostrum. Any-
one putting the lecturer out by his interruption, will himself be
immediately put out by the Police.
It is believed that, by a strict adherence to the above regulations,
the whole of the sight-seeing public of the Metropolis may in due
time have an opportunity of visiting the show, if with some rapidity
of movement, at least without the inconvenience attendant upon a
struggle and a crush.
Finally, Mb. Hollingshead requests all those
who do not feel themselves up to a bit of brisk exercise, have not a
highly-trained ear, or a reserve of nervous energy, but who, most of
all, lack a practised eye, capable of taking in instantly the widest
ranges of distant country at one sweeping and comprehensive oyelo-
ramio glance, not to come and help to block up all access to his
"Niagara," but quietly, reasonably, and wisely,
To Stay Outside.

THE CHURCH AND THE STAGE.
It is expected that Convocation will be specially summoned, and as soon as possible, the
case being urgent, to consider the sudden appearance of open heresy in the theatrical world.
The statute de hatretico comburendo having been long ago repealed, application will be made
to Parliament for leave to invent a teoond aot—a very strong dramatic one—to meet the
present situation. It appears that the contagion is spreading in the Strand, where it first
attraoted considerable attention at the Opera Comique Theatre, when Mrs. Bkbnard Beere
introduced Ariane to the public Subsequently it cropped up in a fresh place on the opposite
side of the road at the 8trand Theatre, where it called itself Airey Annie. The Bishops,
therefore, will probably consult together with a view to putting down this alarming growth
of Arianr-ism'oa the stage. The Two Houses of Convocation will visit officially the two
houses of entertainment above-mentioned, — Opera Comique first and Strand the next
evening,—in order to pronounce upon the merits of the question as a whole.
Holiday Motto for Sir John Lubbock.—"Shut up I"
The candles stand straight in the sconces,
The boards like a looking-glass shine,
And lovingly rubicund John sees
To details of supper and wine.
An early arrival is taken
By radiant hostess in tow,
And, with confidence shamefully shaken,
He stands face to face with a row
Of flotsam and jetsam forsaken,
Whose heyday is gone long ago,
Who now lie in wait, like the Kraken,
To drag buoyant hopes down below.
There's a youth who would gladly annul it,
Though he sticks, now he's here, to his tryst,
With a collar that presses his gullet,
And a glove that is strained by his fist,
While the other, however he pull it,
All efforts is fain to resist.
And he knows he is certain to mull it,
As he gives a last desperate twist,
And the button flies off like a bullet,
And the glove curls away from his wrist.
There's a moody man out on the landing
Who bites his moustaches and swears,
For he is in solitude standing,
And the's sitting up on the stairs,
And without any glass he can well see
The story so prettily told,
That somebody else's is Elsie,
As dainty in manner and mould
As a shepherdess fashion'd at Chelsea
In charming- choice china of old.
And the well-polished floor waxes shinier,
And feet that were tiny look tinier,
Like the white rose's wind-driven petals,
Or the lawn by the blown apple-tree;
And the band to its business settles,
And the dance is all glory and glee,
And rubicund John's getting winier,
And smiles with a courtesy free.
Like a heavenly dredger the 'cello
Scoops all the soul out of a fellow,
Till wildly he worships the snowy-neok'd fay
In her virginal white, like the blossoming May,
With her curls than the woodbine woodbinier,
More precious than spell-guarded metals,
More bright than the eye of the day.
Then supper, with cracker and motto—
Oh, the power of those sibylline leaves—
When you say what it's much safer not to,
In an ear that too gladly receives.
And two surreptitious young creatures,
With the backs of their heads for their fea-
Like a Janus admiring himself, [tores,
Turn years to a moment of blisses,
Of heart-breaking, heavenly kisses,
Regardless of prudence's preachers,
Papas, and position, and pelf.
And I turn on my time very slowly,
To give the young couple a chance,
For there's something in sorrow that's holy,
To a soft-hearted Clock at a dance.
Then the chaperont yawn, and regard me
With wistful and sleep-reddened eyes,
And the youngsters would gladlv retard me,
As if it's my fault that time flies.
And dreaming of dances and marriages,
Of rivals, tobacco, or bed,
They seek in instalments their carriages,
And the vision of pleasure has fled.
And, quiet as the chamber of illness,
The ball-room grows dim and forlorn.
And I tick once again in the stillness,
As the wind brings the rain with the

No. I.-FREDERICK, RICHARD, AND ROBERT.
It was an Easter Tuesday, and little Bob and Dick
Fared forth to take a holiday with Brother Frederick;
Now Richabd, in the rash resolve more gilded youths to ape,
Came out inoongruoufly garbed in a loose and ample cape.
(Fall strangely clad was the simple lad in his aristooiatio cape')
"The Tower we will visit," they vowed, in eager tones;
"And read the lesson of the Past from its grim historic stones!
We'll press around the fatal block, and feel the dinted axe.
And study the construction of the thumbscrews and the racks!"
(For these, in sooth, thrill gentle youth—especially the racks!)
Sj on their way they wended, from Southwark to the Tower,
And heed- d not the changing moods of sleet, and shioe, and shower;
Until, in Queen Victoria Street, they halted at the doors
Of that august establishment—the Civil Service Stores.
(" What if," they cried, "we went inside these celebrated Stores.")
Into the Stores they sauntered—and Robert's eyes are round,
While Richard's month is open wide in wonderment profound;
Their artless prattle wins a smile from hardened men who li.-t:
Where'er they pass they leave behind a sense of something—:
(As if the joys of happy boys those Civil Servants missed I)
They cannot bear to lose them, and so detain the three:
Whioh, for some reason, seems to cast a gloom upon their glee.
Toys rattle out of Robert fast—while up the sleeve of Dick
Is ineffectually concealed—a silver-mounted stick!
(Now, the deepest sleeve can ne'er deceive by harbouring a stick.)
A model locomotive bad Bob disgorges next;
By whioh good Brother Frederick is sore surprised—and vext.
Rut Frederick's fraternal heart sustains a final shock
When from the folds of Richard's cape they extricate—a dock!
(Eight pounds and more was its price at Store,—he was quite a
judge of a dock 1)
See, from his shameless pocket bulges a pint bot-tel—
"Tis lavender—though he protests he can't endure the smell!
And the lad's ill-gotten gains include-why, nobody can think—
An unassuming china-pot, labelled "Pomade of Zinc!"
(What boyish eyes see aught to prize in ointments made of zinc t)
Next Frederick, all contrition, sobs how he, too, has sinned,
In se-creting a box of sweets, and oysters—only tinned!
And here they fancy they have probed the limits of his shame;
Bat, diving deeper, disinter a photographic frame 1
(And he pulls a faos—for a pencil-case has followed the photo-
frame.)
The Mansion House they've entered, these young reluctant rips,
To hear their awful doom pronounced by Aldermanio lips: —
Their bad behaviour is described in terms extremely oandid,

[Apbil 14, 1888.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

House of Commotu, Thursday, April 5.—Commons met again to-day after
Easter holidays—at least, some did.
"Meeting of the Commons doesn't seem so common as commonly," said
Goschen, whose jokes daily assume increased vigour and freshness.
Only three Questions on paper. Bat half-a-dozen Amendments on going
into Committee of Supply. Most probable the whole of sitting would he appro-
priated to Amendments. Perhaps if Old Morality pounced at a few minutes to
twelve, might get Committee stage pro forma. But that the utmost hope.
W. Redmond's Amendment about King Ja Ja enough to oooupy sitting. Was
reported that, since he had put Motion down, Redmond had ascertained who
King Ja Ja is, where he lives, and what's the matter with him. Might conse-
quently be able to say something on subject; though, as Gokst says, that not
condition with Redmond of delivering a long speech.
However, things dispose
themselves differently. Court-
NBv looks in at Question Time.
Shan't be wanted in Chair, at
any rate before dinner-time, so
turns up in morning dress.
Seated on Front Opposition
Bench thinking of long nights
to come in company with Local
Government Bill, when (as dis-
tinguished novelist occasionally
writes) lo! a strange thing hap-
pened. Three questions on the
paper disposed of in twice as
many minutes. Orders of the
Day reaohed. "Supply, Com-
mittee." Macdonald Came-
ron headed list of Amend-
ments. Speaker called on
him. Wasn't quite ready. Let
opportunity slip. No one else
in his place. Redmond proved
faithless to Foreign Potentate.
Before House could say W. H.
Smith, it waB in Committee,
and Courtney in Chair in morn-
ing drets!
Speaker hastily fled from
desecrated scene. Mace under
the table distinctly seen to turn
in its groove. Sergeant-at-Aims' amazed sword rattled in its scabbard all

Courtney's " Quick Change."
aghast Cry of "The Constitution in danger!" quivered
on pallid bps. Never before was Chairman of Com-
mittees seen in Chair without a white neck-tie and
swallow-tailed coat. Great opportunity for Courtney.
Would he be equal to it P He was.
Had heard or read somewhere of what is called at
Theatres and Music Halls "the quick change" trick.
Nothing yet done equalled feat now performed before
excited House of Commons. Beckoning to G0R8T to
take Committee Chair, Courtney slipped out behind
Speaker's Chair in morning dress. Whilst House still
wondering what this agility might portend, he emerged
from other side of Chair in evening dress. How it was
done, whether single-handed, or with assistance, not
known, and doesn't matter. That it was done was dear
enough, for there was Courtney, white neck-tied and
shirt-fronted, in seat of; Chairman of Committees, and
the Constitution was saved.
"Most remarkable illustration of the working of
Proportional Representation scheme I ever saw," said
Pltjnket. "Much better than the elaborate experiment
the other night. Through one proportion of sitting
Courtney represents Gentleman of the period in morn-
ing dress; throughout another proportion he represent*
ditto ditto in evening dress. Begin at last to see what
Proportional Representation means."
Business done.—Civil Service Estimates voted.
Friday.—Another night of real work. Not particu-
larly lively, but exceedingly useful. House tumbled
into Committee after Questions,
just as happened last night.
Crowd of Members came in to
see Courtney do the quick
change trick again. Another
suooess, bat repetition had na-
tural consequence of palling
appetite. The audience quickly
dispersed, and the few present
began to vote money. Money
being someone else's, most gene-
rous spirit prevailed. Gran-
dolph has quietly but sternly
rebuked absentees by being
present since business was re-
sumed. All very well for young
fellows like Gladstone to be
taking Frenoh leave in exten-
sion of ordinary holiday. The
star of Gbandolph's life is
Duty. Led him straight to
House of Commons as soon aa
doors were open. To-night pro-
posed new Committee to inquire
into expenditure of Houses of
Parliament. Old. Morality
s ijJJ eagerly assented.
"Committee, more or less,"
„ ... -~ ,, „ ., he says, "is nothing. HGran-
Hesd of the Dodd Family, dolph will be quiet on condi-
tion we fe( d him with Committees, provender shan't
be lacking."
Douds been roaming'about all'night, anxious" for
opportunity of repeating 'his like success of yesterday.
Suddenly, in middle of Bitting, d propos of nothing,
moved to Report Progress. Didn't mean anything. At
once withdrew Amendment, but felt he'd created a
sensation, and done something to spread fame of
Dodd Family Abroad. Deferred action too long. At
Eleven o'clock, Committee, astonished at extent of its
labours, reported Progress. House immediately thereafter
Counted Oat.

"This is a Montagu"
Williams Shakspkars.
Mb. Montagu Williams, though suffering at one time
from extinction of voice, and even now not speaking in
the full tone of yore, has contrived, since taking his seat
on the Magisterial Bench, to "speak out" in such a
manner as to make his voice heard throughout the length
and breadth of the Metropolis, and, indeed, of the United
Kingdom. The great orator, Bossuet. was known as the
Eagle of Meaux. Mr. Montagu Williams will be
remembered—especially by the Police of his district—a*
the Eagle Beak of Wandsworth.

deficiencies. In the meantime the Elderly Neophyte
has established himself, some trepidation, on a
bench, with his head resting on a little wooden block,
which he tries hard to think comfortable. He has
a dry roof to his mouth, a tickling nose, and a
general sensation of singeing. As the Bore's voice
ceases, a silence falls, which the E. N. finds depres-
sing. _ A Stout Gentleman observes "Phew!"
occasionally. A clock ticks, and water drips in the
distance. A head close to the E. N.'s sighs in a
heart-broken manner, and a Restless Bather rises,

wolf.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Long-expected come at last, and just now all the rage,
"Mister and Mrs. Bancroft both On and Off the Stage."
Two Volumes, on their pages will all eyes be fixed intently.
The binding is eccentric, and the Publisher is Bbntlxy.

from the easy flow of the verse and facile rhythm; but'' Woa,

"Turn and Turn about."
Pegasus!" or, if he doesn't "Woa," he may come to grief.
Fascinating book Let Bancroft have produced. The arrange-
ment is excellent. It reminds me of one of those duologue
entertainments where the lady comes on the stage first, and
does her speech, and solo; then exit " She," and enter on the
other side "He, who immediately gives his speech, his solo,
and then exit "He." Re-enter She; to Her enter He:
dialogue, duet, dance, and exit one of them, and so on, until
the final duet, and curtain. Most of it is mirth-moving;
here and there is a touch of genuine pathos; all is interesting,
and the narrative is directed throughout by the best possible
taste. To quote one of our national modern ballads,—
"They wouldn't hurt a baby,
They 're a pair as you can trust."
Bat the publication of this book is a death-blow to a great
many theatrical raconteurs. It gives to the world nearly all
the stories which were the property of a seleot few, and an
annuity to their privileged possessors in the way of dinner-
parties for many years past. Directly that storehouse of
professional anecdote, Muggins McMymmick, shall at any
time hereafter commence one of his many excellent stories
about the amusing Comedian Bob Romeb, he will be imme-
diately interrupted by his fellow-guests with cries of, "Oh,
yes, we've read that in the Bancrofts' Book." There is only
one chance left for him, and that is to introduce his stock-in-
trade by first mentioning the Busy B.'s Book, and then giving
his own version of their stories, affecting to set them right on
various points. The Bab crofts' reminiscences have already
ran to three editions. Who started the Reminiscensing
Craze ?" Kettle began it"—that is Edmundus Mundi, and
his volumes went off like steam. There were many others:
and then came Frith's. Now I hear that Mr. Tools is going
to publish his reminiscences, which Mr. Joseph Hatton is
Boswelling for him. The publishing season of 1887 and 1888
will be known as " Sacred to the Memories." Mr. R. Cornet
Grain has just concluded a short series of entertaining auto-
biographical anecdotes in Murray's Magazine. "Murray
come up, forsooth! go to I" Why did he bring them to so
abrupt a termination? But perhaps he did it on Mr. Welter11
epistolary principle of "pulling np with a jerk," and then the
reader "wishes as there were more of it."
I mentioned Joseph Bobwell-Hatton just now; I'll do
so again; for the sake of telling anyone who may be going a
railway journey, that he will get quite sixty per cent, of
interest out of his outlay of one shilling in purchasing The
Abbey Murder, at W. H. Surra's bookstall. It is not so
sensational as the title would lead you to suppose. But it is a good story
well, picturesquely, and dramatically told.
An interesting and amusingly written little book—still little, though
revised and enlarged by the author—is Mr. Blades' The Enemies of
Books. Poor Books! What a variety of foes they have had, from their
own authors downwards, and still have. There is one chapter devoted to
the Bookworm, which is naturally historically interesting to the present
writer; and I, moi qui parle, protest against our family title being
included among the names of those who are the enemies of books."
Good Books are, indeed, the Diet of .Worms, for the Book Worms family
are great devourers and digesters of books. And why f—because we love
them. On my father's side I belong to the joumal-devourers, or paper-
eating species. My sire was Sir Pertojai Anobium. His father was the
Erudite Anobiuh, and his grandfather justly celebrated everywhere as
the Paniceum. My mother was the charming, severely critical, witty, and
accomplished GScophora Pseudospretella, with Greek and Hebrew blood
in her veins. She could attack books—always justly. But none of the
real worms were ever associated! with the extinct grubs of Grub Street.
This is the parentage of which I am justly proud, tracing it back, as I
can, to the Ark, in the Arkives of which House-boat" there were several
most valuable workVon navigation andInatural]history. If the Weritable

Worms had been the enemies of books, where would have been the
Papyri now? I enclose my photo, taken of me some time since by
Dr. Linn-eub Sambornius, and am, Yours, most Wormly,

NEWS OF THE HOUSE OF SAVOY.
It was recently rumoured that Mr. George Grossmith, bo long one of
the "props " and ornaments of the Savoy Theatre, was about to withdraw
from D'Otlet Carte's Company, and take a Theatre for himself—and for
an audience; as his modesty compelled him to admit (what would be "not
admitted, after seven" and " bonnets not allowed")—that he, by himself,
could not fill the entire theatre. At first no reason was assigned for this
rash aot, but he has lately stated that he had for some time suspected his
Manager of being in treaty with Mr. George John G-sce-n, the Comic
Chancellor, who, it must be owned, would be a dangerous rival of Mr. G. G.
in the eccentric Opera and Short Entertainment line. Mr. D. Carte has
explained that he was only corresponding with the Comio Chancellor on the
question of taxes, and wanted to know if a "Gee Gee" retained on his
establishment would be considered as a " Pleasure Horse." George John
immediately replied that he was sure a Carte could not get on without a
Gee-Gee, and so the tax would not apply. Handshaking all round, and
everyone satisfied.

MY PRINCE!
[As rung quite recently at Charlottenburg.)
Where and how shall I manage to meet him?
What are the words they will make me say P
Shall I hare with a shake of the head to greet him,—
Tell him to call another day?
Will the Chancellor, true love scorning,
Stand in the path, and never wince r
Mast all my joy be turned to mourning,
Must I lose for ever My Prinoe I My Prince!
I will not dream of him crowned and ruling,
Mounting his late Bulgarian throne.
In Russian guile he has had some schooling:
He only asks to be let alone!
They talk to me of their " strained relations,"
01 tiie Czar who has hated him some time since.
Bat my heart is my own, and not the nation's;—
And I '11 give it to him, My Prince 1 My Prinoe I
So it' s only a matter of patient waiting.
And whatever scheme the Chancellor hatch
For him, since her strength he's under-rating,
He '11 find that Mamma is fully a match.
And, though he may growl, she '11 manage to tame him,
And tell him out straightway, plain words not to mince,
Alexander is mine, and as mine I shall claim him,
And hold him for ever, My Prince 1 My Prince!

Sir,—My income has been reduced by your friend and contributor,
George Jokin', from £3 per annum to

he had had the chance some years ago f
No. Certainly not. But recently he has
taken to making puns. He commenced
it publicly at Mr. Wyndham's supper.
After that —the Budget Now Dr.
Johnson has told us of what crime a
punster must be guilty. "Who makes
a pun would pick a pocket." Sir, my

When I next reoord my vote, I shall ask if the Candidate ever made
a pun. Defend us from George Joxxn, who is "punny wise and

WITH ALL THEIfi AET.
Sir,—Mr. Walter Besant's proposition, in regard to the Art of
Novel Writing, that "no moving situation was ever yet depicted, the
writing of which did not coat tne Author anguish and tears,'' has
somewhat perplexed me. Still, I own as a Three-Volume Novelist of
some standing, my experience as far as concerns my own work,
entirely coincides with Mr. Besant's. I have found myself fre-
quently, not only sobbing like a little child over the pathetic portions
of my works, but laughing myself into hysterics over the more
humorous chapters. I am bound, however, to admit that they do not
seem to have the same effect on my publisher and intimate friends,
whom I have often caught laughing themselves into fits over my
most serious and dramatio situations, while a perusal of my lighter
and comic pages appears to consign them to the depths of a profound
and impenetrable gloom. This, however, by the way; and I only
direct attention to it, in passing, as a curious fact. Notwithstanding
the opinion of some American authors to the contrary, Mr. Bxsant
is, therefore, probably right, and we may take it pretty well for
granted that the writer who moves others, must be first moved him-
self. I am going to interview all our distinguished writers myself,
d will let you nave the result next week. Tours inquiringly,
Fitz-Thacirrat Bulwer-Scott.
APATHETIC OFFICIALISM.
Though it may take, according to the accepted computation, nine
tailors to make one man, to judge from certain answers famished in
the House of Commons the other evening, it evidently requires some-
thing more than nine official men to re-make or rather to re-instate
one Tayler. In his issue of last week, Mr. Punch, commenting
briefly on the case of the sorely ill-used Patna Commissioner, and
applauding the vigorous protest uttered by the Timet on the subject,
expressed a hope that the Government would speedily take the matter
in hand, and, though at the eleventh hour, see the wrong righted,
and something like justioe done. This, however, they appear dis-
inclined to do. To talk of an objection to "re-opening " the matter,
as if it were an incident that had been put away and closed, is absurd,
for, as a matter of fact, thanks to the historians who have carefully
sifted all its circumstances, its details are thoroughly open to the
light of day and patent to all.
Colonel Malleson, in his history of the Indian Mutiny, has folly
investigated the charges made against Mr. Commissioner Tayler,
and exposed their utter groundlessness and futility. Sir John Hate,
a writer likely to be on his P.'s and Q.'s, and Mr. Holmes, who is
anything but "all abroad" in his facts, in their respective works
dealing with the same period, have not only done likewise, but borne
unmistakable testimony to the valuable nature of the servioes
rendered by Mr. Tatler to his country in the very crisis in which
his conduct had been officially attaoked. To decline, therefore, in the
presence of such experts, to entertain the " re-opening" of the ques-
tion, is simply to refuse to look the facts of history steadily in the face.
To shirk this ordeal may commend itself to the official mind, but
it is a proceeding that in no way finds favour with the publio
opinion of the country. That, the Government may depend upon it,
holds that it is better that the routine traditions of thirty years
should be utterly exposed and overthrown, rather than that a
deserving publio servant should undergo unmerited punishment and
disgrace. That the official mind should be capable of taking any
other view is preposterous; bat that it shows significant signs of so
doing, Mr. Punch much fears must be regarded as a melancholy fact.
THE SECRET OUT.

To zero will fall, and to nothingness dwindle.
It must, for the great Star of Science cries shame;
That true Boanerges, tempestuous Tyndall. ,
He says you're ''not wise," and, dear William, you'll see
This alone is sufficient the matter to settle.

And you—if he says so—of course are a kettle.
Balfour you may brave, or stand up against Joe,
Front even John Bright, that polite letter-writer,
Bnt you are not in it with Ttndall, you know,
Why vainly contend with so smashing a smiter?
This Slogger of Science, this Sullivan, swears
He was—well, olothed in light when you wore "Tory shoddy."
Tea, malice might whisper that what he now wears
Must be fustian, could he but see it, poor body.
He girds at the Liberal Party as dogs
For following you when he cannot. Great Ctcsar I
If Science could only see straight when it slogs,
This Ttndall, my William, might well be a teaser.
He chaffs you as pseudo-infallible. Oh I
One can see why he's wrath at your strong self-reliance.

For nothing's infallible now—except Science!

"I see by the paper," said De Mogtns, "that 'The Prinoe of

At Mr. Christy Minstrel Moore's benefit, Mr. Arthur
Roberts sang "Queen of the Tarts" with his usual success. In
the last century the ideal subject of this song would have been
celebrated in verse as "The Reigning Toatt." The "Toast" of
the eighteenth becomes the "Tart" of the nineteenth century.

scarf-pin, whioh blazed out like

vagueness, quite consistently with the latest theories of Art and Advertisement.
Salient and surcharged triviality, glaring forth like a Cyolops' eye from a misty

is, indeed, the open secret of success in the two chief branches of contemporary
charlatanism. Notwithstanding this accentuated nebulosity, however, Nobody
had an indescribable air of being emphatically All There I —what there was of him.
"No doubt," said I, "during your long and sensational oareer you have done

''And people!" interjected Nobody, with a delightful mixture of Whistlerian
airiness and Slugger-SuUivanesque swagirer. "Rather I I am found everywhere
—in Parliament and the Prize Ring, at Burlington House, and in

House of Common*, Monday Night, April 9.—Looked more like
old timet to-night. Benches well filled. A thin black line in Gallery
facing Opposition Bench. In seat of Leader of Opposition, Glad-
stone, with flower in button-hole, and suspicion of pomatum-pot in
coat-tail pocket. Sure signs of a big speech. Goschen moved
House into Committee of Ways and Means to pats Budget Resolu-
tions. Courtney, not to be caught napping again, came down to
yen in evening dress. Gladstone expected on his feet imme-
ttly after Questions. But Old Morality, looking moraller than
ever, and with quite fresh stock of copy-book heads learned off in
case of emergency, had told Opposition. Instead of Budget Bill
standing first on Orders, had put what Joseph Gillis (who still
retains command of French language that carried him through the
famous visit to Paris), calls "U sale Salary Bill." Poor Kinq-
H a euan gone away for brief period of rest. Pleasant surprise for
him to find his salary voted when he returns. Gladstone prepared

"Suppose he must fret rid of subdued energy somehow," says

oircumstances to pan out on Ministers, he prods us. Capital idea of
Childers to wear copy of Votes inside his waistcoat over left ribs.
Bat Hartington ana the other fellows best off. Sometimes feel

Business done.—Budget Resolutions.
Tuesday.—Old Morality had great triumph to-night. Everyone
shares in it, for everyone likes Old Morality, and feels" soothed by
his moral reflections. Triumph came at midnight. Bat there was
preliminary viotory shortly after House met. Edward Watkin
appeared on soene. Wanted to know when and how Ireland was to
have Home Rule. Everybody been putting this question for two
years. County Clare out en masie on Sunday shouting oat the ques-
tion. Comes up at every pnblie meeting; severs some Families; has
united One; political air thunderous with reverberating question;
here is Edward Watkln, of all men, wanting to know. Up rises
Old Morality, solemnly approaches table, gravely meets Edward
Watkin's strained regard, and, slowly beating time on table as
momentous syllables fall and rise, says:—" There will be no indis-
position to extend to Ireland an improved system of Local Govern-
ment when it is made clear that the people are prepared to reoeive
and work it in a spirit of loyalty to the Crown and Constitution."
Copy heading a little longer than usual. Won't go into single
line. Bat how fresh the sentiment 1 how terse the language! and
with what indescribable air of morality it is suffused! Ribald Irish-
men burst into shout of laughter. Bat on Treasury Bench not single
dry eye. Grandolph, sitting in corner seat behind, nervously tugs
at moustache. Chaplin, in corner seat below, thinks he hears a sob.
After this, House proceeded with chastened spirit to its allotted
task. Crowd of Notices of Motion; afterwards full list of Orders.'
Bradlaugh's Oaths Bill looms low down in latter
list. Wants to get into Committee with it. If
business steadily worked through, this Bill would
be reached in time. So at Nine o'Clock, Opposition,
led by Tomlinson vice Grandolph gone
over to the enemy, tried Count, wnioh

reached. Vagrants Act Amendment
Bill disposed of after moderate
discussion. Now Bradlaugh's

chise Bill; takes Division and gets
it rejected. Next brings on

cussion. Half-past Eleven struck.
Oaths Bill in peril. At twenty
minutes to Twelve Buchanan
pounced. Just in time to be
too late. Division on Closure
followed by Division on Second
Reading of Bill. Agreeably
occupied time till Midnight
struck, and then Oaths Bill
shunted. Seraphic smile man-
tled over oountenanoe of Old
Morality as he watched Bu-
chanan's blundering tactics. "They'd better leave it to me, eh P
Don't you think so, Toby P" he said, quite gleefully, as he packed
up his stray copybook headings and looked them in his box.
Business done.—Miscellaneous.
Thursday.—Things beginning to look up. House of late grown so
respectable that, regarded as a plaoe of entertainment, quite out of
running compared with vestries. Public deserting the place, and
Members habitually play to empty gallery. To-night Bill entirely
changed. A piece of the old kind put on. Soene, Ireland: dramatis
persona;, those old favourites Parnbll, O'Brien, Dillon, and Tim
Healy. Joseph Gillis in the wings with old familiar smile on his
face, and prompter's book in hand. Aspect of House suddenly
changed. Benches filled up; Strangers crowded in; oheers and
ooanter-cheers rang through theatre. For two hours and a half
piece ran without a flaw.
T. W. Russell took opportunity of coming baok again. Last time
he spoke threw in his lot with Parnellites; denounced Government,
and voted against tbem. Opportunity now at hand to pose as persistent
Unionist and support Government. This the only dull part in the
piece. As Balfour says, "There's no element of surprise about

The Break-Down in the Queen's Bench.—A queer place for a
"break-down," bat the Judge, Counsel, and all engaged in the case
"stepped it" with alacrity when the defective timber gave timely
warning last Wednesday morning. At first the noise was thought
to be occasioned by the Last of the Barons cracking a joke, or that
some prisoner on his trial had just been "let off" by Mr. Justice
Haw kins. But it was nothing of the sort. It was simply caused
by " someone" concerned in building the New Law Courts. On
inquiry, of course, it was found impossible to blame the Architect,
or tile Clerk of the Works, or the Foreman, or the Contractors.
It was finally settled that as the green wood used in building had
shrunk, the fault was attributable entirely to the "Contracting
Party, which, in this instance, 'tis as clear as sunlight, was the
beam. If they 're all like the Queen's Benoh, we can't correctly term,

nights (alas!) of Miss N:

heard of "Ellen" Farren. "Nellie" is our favourite. But

QUITE TAKEN" BY LES SURPRISES.
M. Bisson's "comidie," entitled Let Surprises du Divorce, which
is now one of the great successes of Paris, was played to such big
houses last week at the Royalty as would have been sufficient to
warrant M. Mayer in taking on the theatre for another
month at least. Let Surpritet
itraoted and most amusing
so genuinely comic, and the
is an ingeniously - con-
feree.! The situations are
dialogue so crisp and
humorous, that the piece
would "draw" in London

"Coquelinant" at the Royalty.
with even a less popular comedian than Coqueltn, supported by the
youthful J RAN Coquelin and the competent company—including a
M. Boclanqer, by the way—whom M. Mayer has got together at the
Royalty Theatre.
It is said that Mr. Hare is going to produce an English version of
Let Surpritet at his, at present unbuilt, theatre. If so, the adapter,
if he lays the scene in England, will have a difEoult task, as what is
essential to the plot is impossible here, and much detail that is
necessary to the humour of the faroe an English audience would not
tolerate in an English piece; though in a Frenoh play, acted by
French oomedians, "suggest!veness" is expected and condoned in
advance by an English audience, who, as a rule, laugh the louder
the more they see and the less they understand.
The old "husinets" of the low comedian, when overcome with emo-
tion, falling on to the keyboard of the piano, of a qniet man bringing in
a loaded tray only to be kioked over by the principal low comedian in
order to end an Act with something brisk, and to bring down "a
quick curtain," would be received by our capricious first-nighters
with derision. But what in a French faroe is considered by an
English audience as "immensely funny," would be voted "old"
ana "stupid" in an English piece of the same kind. I doubt
whether the ringing slap on the face given by the actor to the actress
would be acceptable to an English audience, if the characters repre-
sented were English. However, these matters are for the adapter's
consideration. Taken for what it is, a brisk Frenoh farce, played
by a good light Frenoh company, with plenty of Frenoh tauce
piquant?, Let Surpritet du Divorce is among the funniest pieces to
which M. Naquet s Divorce Aot has given birth.
Jack in the Box.
"Tatty was a Welshman, Taffy was" —ahem! —That
Reverend Arcadian "Welsh Shepherd who was brought up—(he
must have been very badly brought up 1)—before the Magistrate,
at the instance of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, for chip-
ping pieces off some old stone table in the Abbey, in order to carry
them away as relics, ought to be presented with a living near Chip
ping Norton. Perhaps Mr. 0." could find him convenient employ-
ment at Hawarden. He was fined a couple of sovereigns for the
damage done. No doubt he considers he got off very ohiply.
A New Heresy.—The week before last we mentioned the spread
of Ariane-ism in the Strand. But what is "Plagiarism in the Pul-
pit," for which, in the York Convocation, Dr. Hatman wished to
condemn Canon Fleming? Is it a misprint for " Pelagianiem "?
If not who was the Heresiaroh? When did Plagiary flourish? Of
course we do not mean Sir Fretful. Poor Canon Fleming to be
gibbeted on " Hitman's gallows" 1 This would be "suspending"
him with a vengeance. Let us hope the worthy Fleming will be
acquitted of Plagiarism.
Appropriate for April.—Quite the Month for the Aquarellistes
in Pall Mall East and Piccadilly to open their Shows. Plenty of
Showers at both places.
MR. PUNCH'S INDIAN POSSESSIONS.
The Indian Daily Newt of Monday, March 26, has been received at
our office, containing the following intelligence:—
"Mori Singh, the Rajah of Punch, has come into sudden notoriety by
the imprisonment of his Prime Minister and family, and confiscation of their
property, &c. The State of Punch lies about midway between Rawal Pindi
and Srinugger, &c."
To interview Rajah Moti Singh, Mr. Punch has, of course,
immediately despatched two of his best Kajahs-in-Waiting from
his Home Office, Kuan Singh and Mustapha Singh with A
Note. Mr. Punch thinks it due to the Prime] Minister to say
that this is the first time he has ever heard even the whisper
of any oharge against him, and he is loth to believe that the
present difficulty is due to Russian intrigue. The Two Rajahs will
he accompanied (on the Tom-Tom) by the celebrated Indian Guide,
Rita-Wazcr; and Mr. Punch trusts that the meeting of the three
Rajahs—Khan Singh, Mustapha Singh, and Moti Sinsh—who
will enjoy the far-famed hospitality of the Nizam Anprezah-
Dinar—will be thoroughly harmonious.
THE RECOGNITION OF INHUMANITY.
What would be the reasonable chastisement to award for a mis-
demeanor no worse than an unprovoked assault by which a sufferer
is hut grievously injured and irreparably maimed for life? Well,
as much, perhaps, as seclusion for a term of some not too long dura-
tion. Such was the sentence stated to have been passed by the
Recorder of Sheffield on two betting men, one named Oxley, and
the other Lamrert, convicted of rather too rough horseplay on the
person of a respectable tradesman. They had merely knocked him
down, and four of his teeth out, broken his jaw, and inflicted injuries
styled " serious" upon his head. For these acts of only unlawful
wounding, Ox let was awarded no less than two months and Lam-
bert as much as one month's imprisonment. In this instance, jus-
tice, as usual in such cases, was tempered with meroy; and according
to precedent not ridiculously too much of the latter. But certainly,
the reverse of that view of it was taken by the people of Sheffield.
At a crowded meeting of townsfolk convened by the Mayor, resolu-
tions were passed actually protesting against the inadequacy of those
lenient sentences! What Draconian judgment did the Mayor and his
concourse wish to have been'pronounced on a somewhat too foroible
outbreak of animal spirits P Five years of penal servitude perhaps,
and a whipping or two into the bargain? Why, the defendants
couldn't have got so much as that unless they had aggravated mere
violenoe with the graver offence of robbery. They seem to have been
sent to prison without the option of a fine. Was not that sufficient
t > satisiy the rigorous requirements of the Men of Sheffield? An
imprisonment of two months' duration for an assault upon a man is
as heavy a penalty as that usually imposed on the assailant of a
woman or a child. Isn't it?
Another "Mystery." — The Shilling Dreadfuls are having a
fine time of it. All Murders and Mysteries. The Book-stalls of
W. H. Smith—or "The Smithies," as they shall be henceforth
termed—are full of them. Among the latest is The Cliff Mystery,
by Mr. Hamilton Aide, who is also "among the profits." The
more improbable the story, the greater the probability of its being
read. Perhaps the Author wrote this shilling tale after a copious
draught of what he calls " Chateau Margot." Does he remember a
couplet of Charlis Dance's in Blue Beard t—
Margot. For drink, O'Shacxaback, you needn't far go.
O'Snack. I've searched for you through all the chateau, Makgot.
The quotation may not he strictly exact as far as the first line
goes, but the second is the one that may have lingered in the
Ai'dean memory. Let him get some " Marganx," and write another
Mystery. The greatest Mystery of all is, that there should be a
public for all these 'orrible tales!
"Sore as Fete."—Last Wednesday, April 18, was about as bad
a day as any of the Witches in Macbeth could wish for. There was
thunder, lightning, hail, and rain, fog, sunshine, oold, heat. Quite a
Variety Entertainment. Any Forecaster might have predicted it,
or something like, without any great meteorological science, if he
had only consulted the list of amusements for the forthcoming week
in a Saturday or Sunday paper. For was not the First Show of Spring
Flowers announced for this particular day at the Botanical Gardens?
0 cruel fete! Poor Flora in a mackintosh and under an umbrella I
Aids to New Dictionary.—Mr. Girling writes sensibly about
corporal punishment, but "Girling" is hardly the appropriate
name for a gentleman who has kept a Boy's School. "Girling''
would be a very good telegraphio-oodey word, meaning "Ednoating
Girls." If this were adopted, then "Boying)' would mean "Bring-
ing up Boys." "I boyed him up" would signify, "I had oharge
of his education from his earliest boyhood?"

Tried by the Furniss.—As might have
been expected, the Fiery Furniss has been
"making it hot" for some of them in his
lecture as reported in last Friday's Times. No
one could more appropriately do this than the
Fiery Furniss. His instructive and amusing
Lecture, evidently deals with burning ques-
tions. His next discourse will probably be
headed, "Cremation by Furniss," in which
he will discuss the utility of burning bodies,
and the advisability of selecting one consider-
able body—that of the Royal Academy—for
an initial experiment. If he cannot obtain
the entire body, he will be content with
roasting one member at a time. This Furniss
barns brightly for nearly two hours, and no
sort of interruption ever puts him out.

Mephistopheles, "The Spirit who denies,"
is the embodiment of Universal Scepticism.
Mrs. Prig, who "didn't believe there wasn't
no such person" as Mrs. Harris, is the illus-
tration of the particular Sceptic. The first
includes the second, and a term whioh shall
be a combination of the two may well ex-
press modern scepticism; and this term is
"Mephistophelian-Priggishness."

Something like a Conversion.—At the
first conference of the Pastors' College Evan-
gelical Association last Wednesday, when
Mr. Spuboeon made one of his most telling
and characteristic speeches, a Converted Devil
addressed the Assembly. True he was only a
Printer's Devil; but this is a step in the
right direction, whioh would have delighted
the Original Origin and generous Robbie
Burns of Ayr.—of that Ayr. by the way,
whence came the puir Printer's Deil in ques-
tion. He was one of the " inko guid."

THE "jPRODIGY" SONS.
The infant Otto Hegner—a name very suggestive of a chicken
scarcely out of its shell—has, it appears, been performing at the
Philharmonic, a circumstance which the Musical Critic of the Times,
who very reasonably urges that, as the Society is supposed to repre-
sent the interests of high-class music, it might be above yielding to
the craze of the hour, confesses he views both with surprise and
regret. That there is a regular flood of these musical prodigies
threatening to sweep over every concert-hall platform, there is not a
doubt; and while the public rush in applauding crowds to welcome
them, it is not easy to see where it is to stop. As long as the fever
lasts, their parents, whatever their weight, may be counted upon to
keep hurrying them to the " scales," and set them down to the key-
board practising till they are often literally laid on their BacVs.
Meantime, while the infants straggle, it is becoming a serious ques-
tion for the regular adult performers, who will find their occupation
gone, and certainly not know what to do with themselves, if the former
are to have it all their own way. For them, whatever the public
may think of it, the matter will undoubtedly be no mere "child's-
play," and they will surely hail any signs indicating that this
recent determined invasion of the concert-room by the nursery is at
all on the wane, with every expression of unfeigned delight.
VOCES POPULI.
AT A BOND STREET GALLERY.
Scene—Exhibition Rooms of a well-known Art Dealer's, where the
main attraction is a very charming collection of Japanese impres-
sions by a Rising Painter. In the first room are displayed
miscellaneous landscapes and figure-subjects by other painters,
which two Prosaio Persons are inspecting in puzzled silence.

"Mr. William Stott, of Oldham"). I daresay it's all right—but

the further room, though,—better go in and see if there s anything
to be seen there, eh f
[ They enter the inner Gallery, which is draped in dull carnation
and pale yellow, and hung with sketches framed in old gold
and dead copper, arranged in somewhat irregular order.
Visitors are moving slowly from one picture to the other,
making enthusiastic comments in a reverent whisper.

ecoentric, though, sticking the piotures about in patches like this!

L'AUDACE!!
De Vaudace, encore de Vaudace, toujour! de Vaudace!"
On the old quest, and after the old quarry P
Audacity 'b the arm for such a task.
The sight is stale, from use, and something sorry,
Of climbing C.f.sak with the patriot mask.
Great Uncle, little Nephew, in such fashion
Clambered and. clutched; may not another scale
The steep whose fair first step is patriot passion,
A splendid pretext seldom known to fail P
Ho for the eyrie! There the golden eagle
Perches, a little shabby-plumed of late
'Tis true, not quite so obviously regal
As when of old he sat in solemn state, _
Pinnacled high, and spreading mighty pinion,
Ready for arrowy flight or thunderous swoop;
Lord of the upper ether's large dominion,
King of the mountain-haunting harpy troop.
Rome's mimic eagles "glared in gold;" this creature
Glared at the sun with orbs almost as bright.
Age-dimmedP Perchance! But each Stymphalian
feature,
The brazen claw, the beak of iron might
Remain to mark the breed, sublime, predacious,
And moulted plumes may be repreened in sooth;
Sweeping again athwart its air-realm spacious,
The Imperial Eagle may renew its youth.
Cling, dutch, bold climber 1 Foothold most precarious
Those crags afford: but there the golden prize
Perches alone—such birds are not gregarious-
Peering down on you with half-curious eyes,
Those eyes that scanned the Corsioan, and goggled
Upon the lesser hero Hugo scourged.
So tough a task must not be botched or boggled,
But with audacious caution should be urged.
"JBe bold—be bold—be not too bold 1" To measure
Strength, skill, and daring artfully aright
Is not for bunglers. But that tempting treasure!
The chance of lofty place and splendid flight!
A'thought to fire—and dazzle. From below you
Rings on your ear the fickle mob's acclaim;
They watch, they worship. Some day they will know
you:
Will the late knowledge safety bring, or shame?
Sedan and St. Helena tell their stories,
But those seem old wives' fables when the chance
Revenge of snatching, of renewing glories
Swims on the ken of splendour-loving France.
The Dove is a tame fowl; perpetual cooing
Palls on the Gallic ear, what time so near
The strenuous Teuton the War God is wooing.
The Eagle I Ah I Glad memories, triumphs dear,
Link with the Olympian fowl, and who '11 remember
The Bird of Jove is also bird of prey P
Oh. Man of Destiny, Man of December,
Your Shades must surely watch your France to-day.
This scarcely looks the Eagle that onoe fluttered
Europe's scared Courts from London to Berlin,
When Vulture, Hawk, and Falcon shrieked and scut-
tered
Before its swoop with dire dismay and din.
More like the prisoned eagle, sick and sulky,
That cannot rove or rend, and will not pair.
And yet our latest cragsman, bold, and bulky,
With none too much of the heroic air,
The Boulevardier's Bourgeois-Bayard, struggles
By the old steps to the old eyrie. Yes!
And will the old end crown the old, old juggles P
Can France foresee, the World do more than guess P
Ominous Name.—When General Boulangkr appears
in public, he is generally accompanied by M. Li guerre.
That Boulangkr and La-gukrre should be inseparables,

'THE SERMON QUESTION."
Curate (Musical). "But why do you object to haying, a Hymn during the Collection I
Sector (Practical). "Well, you see, I preach a oood Sermon, which I calculate
should hove the People to an average of Half-a-Crown each; but I find, durino a
lono Hymn, they seem to cool down, and it barely brings a Shilling a head I"
NOVELS AS THEY ARE WROTE.
Anxious to discover whether there were any grounds for the statement recently put forth by-
Mr. Walter Besant in regard to the work of the novelist, to the effeot that "no moving
situation was ever yet depioted that did not oause the author anguish and tears," and also
with a view to ascertaining how far the writers of modern notion, before they are able to
impress their readers with the foroe of any particular situation they attempt to describe, are
under the necessity of first praotically realising it fully themselves, our Commissioner, in
conformity with his announcement made last week, has been hurrying about, and interviewing
several well-known authors, in the hopes of throwing some light on the subject. The following
is a summary of the result of suoh inquiries as he has been enabled to make in the interval.
Mr. William Black thoroughly agrees with Mr. Walter Besant. He not only cries and
laughs, but sings, and even dances and roars over his work, so completely is he carried away by
it. This is especially the'oase in his descriptionof natural phenomena. Sometimes, in depicting
a storm, he has sat in his study with an open umbrella over him, and even rushed into an
adjacent room to have a shower-bath, from whioh he has emerged dripping, to finish his
ohapter. This has frequently given him violent influenza. But he is sure it has enabled him
to reach his public
Mr. Eider Haggasd is of the same
opinion, and he cannot conceive a strong
situation affecting the reader which has not
powerfully affected the author. He wrote
the famous apotheosis of "She" in a
darkened room, with a flaming bowl of snap-
dragon before him, and as he realised the full
horror of the scene ne was describing, he fairly
yelled, and jumped round the room, leaping
over the sofa, chairs, and tables in his wild
excitement. Ultimately collapsing in a
smothered heap on the hearth-rug and up-
setting the contents of the snap-dragon bowl
over him, he was discovered enveloped in
blue flame by his Secretary, who finally
put him out. He then crept to his chair and
put the closing lines to the scene. All his
best work has been done in this fashion.
He believes it to be the only way.
Mr. Louis Stevenson always identifies
himself with his own characters. When
building up the peculiarities of his famous
villains in his romance of Treasure Island,
he used frequently to spend his spare time
in creeping about the house stealthily and
chuckling over their evil deeds, and he would
often, when dining out, find himself, in
the intervals of conversation, involuntarily
singing "Fifteen men on a dead man's
chest J Ye ho.' ho! ho ! for a bottle of
Sum!" Even the episode of throwing the
orutoh was rehearsed. He flung a pair of
drawing-room tongs through a conserva-
tory at a parrot in a brass cage, and
brought it down. That is how he got
his inspiration. He felt intensely the neces-
sity of realising every line he wrote, and
his life had in consequence become almost a
succession of gymnastics.
Mr. Marion Crawford never puts pen
to paper without "tears and anguish."
When in his recent novel, Paul Patoff,
he began describing the eccentricities of the
hero's mother, he had to be removed to Bed-
lam to finish it. He weeps copiously over
every line he writes, and never sits down to
a fresh ohapter without being first provided
with a large supply of pocket handkerchiet a.
Marie Corelli is powerfully affected by
her own conceptions. When engaged in the
production of her novel Vendetta, she was so
engrossed in her subject that she felt herself
several times impelled by an almost uncon-
trollable impulse to waylay the tax-collector
and stab him with a paper-knife. Thus she
nourished a real thirst for vengeance. Even
her publishers were at last afraid to meet her.
Mr. F. Anstey, the moment he sits down
to his study-table, is so conscious that he
ought to put something funny on to paper,
that he not unf requently goes into suoh fits
of laughter that he is utterly unable to
hold his pen. When at work on his Fallen
Idol, he was so often in hysterics from this
cause, that he produced the greater portion
of it in company with his Medical Adviser,
who had to be perpetually lowering his
spirits by the administration of powerful
(edatives until the last ohapter was finished.
He wrote the whole of his first novel. Vic*
Vertd, at a scream.
Mr. Hawlby Smart feels that, to reach
his readers, an Author must put himeelf
in the pot-it ion he endeavours to describe;
he has therefore written every line of his
latest work, The Outsider, on the knife-
board of an omnibus.
Mr. Lewis Carrol expressed surprise that
it was not generally known that he wrote the
greater portion of Alice in Wonderland
while standing on his head. This was how he
got hold of the " Jabberwook." He had re-
cently been engaged on a new work, daring
the production of whioh he had turned fre-
quent back-somersaults. Hefullyoonourred
with Mr. Walter Bezant's proposition.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 16.—More debate on Second
Heading of Local Government Bill. Courtney led off, dragging into
his Memorial the reference to Proportional Representation which
serves him as head of King Charles the First served another
eminent man. After him oame Chamberlain. Aspeot of House
suddenly changed. Benches filled up. Members became really in-
terested. Seems to be, after all, something intelligible in Bill. A
striking speech, fluent, concise, admirably phrased, and mercifully
brief. Touched up, moreover, with some of those little thrusts at
former friends, which so delights House. Courtney playfully
chaffed; Gladstone who, fortunately, did not happen to be present,
put hopelessly in the wrong. M undella at one point ventured to
say, "Oh!" ; thought he would have been
chawed up on the spot. Concluded to listen
to remaining portions of speech in silence
Hartington so far interested, that he didn't
getjmore than forty winks' sleep throughout AT \& , ^
the speech. Quite exception this. Has pro- f \ S -1
fited immensely out of debate as far as it has ?)V/;> ■ ('*k^' /
gone. Looks forward to many peaceful even- f
ings in Committee; doesn't mind an occa- r„,
sional late night or exceptionally hard work
through the day. Whenever Local Govern-
ment Bill is on goes down to House, settles
himself in corner seat on Front Bench,
I crosses his legs, closes his eyes, falls asleep
| like a shot. Chamberlain's vivacity little
disturbing. But Hartikgton made it up
later, when Chaplin rose.
"Washington Mission nothing to this," said
Grandolph, moodily regarding the scene.
"Anyone could arrange a Fishery Treaty.
I Chamberlain the only man who has been
'able to make debate on Local Government
Bill interesting since Ritchie brought Bill
in."
Wilfrid Lawson poked fun at Chamber-
lain's championship of Selected Councillors.
Objected only to name. Call them Aldermen,
and all would be well, Lawson agreed.
Drew moving pioture of Alderman Chaplin £xit Stephen Mason,
and Alderman Barttelot going to Church.
Writ moved to-day for election for 'Mid-Lanarkshire. So exit
Stephen Mason. Pity he wasn't here just' another night to take
part in revolt against Lord Advocate. This burst forth after mid-
night. The Mackintosh moved Opposition to particular Scotch En-
ent scheme. Lord Advocate rose, said not a word for or against
e, but gave Scotch Members terrible wigging for ooming to
House and presuming to call in question a scheme approved by Scotch
Education Department. Something in appear-
ance of Lord Advocate that would nave carried
terror to Southron mind; the towering form, the
majesty of wrath, the flashing eye, the quivering
lip, all terrible. But Soots-wha-hae not to be
cowed. Turned upon Lord Advocate; angrily
protested against his scolding.
A pretty scene. Joseph Glllis looking on
from below Gangway, smiled approvingly. No
knowing but what, in time, something might be
made of these Scotch Members. House didn't
adjourn till quarter to one.
Business dine.—Local Government BilL
Tuesday Night.—What a night we
have had to be sure! Makes up for the
ponderous performance through morn-
ing sitting. All began in little mistake
Everybody thought House would be
counted when Speaker took Chair again
it Nine, o'clock. Consequence was, every-
one, including Lord Advocate, settled
down comfortably to dinner. But Tee-
totallers interested in Second Order,
introducing Local Option in Scotland.
Teetotallers don't want as muoh time for
dinner as other people; so down in full
force at Nine o'clock.» Count tried; de-
feated. Brtce moved Second Reading
of Access to Scotch Mountains Bill.
Lord Advocate instructed to oppose measure. But where was
Lord Advocate P Scouts sent out in search. Access to Lord
Advocate even more difficult than access to Scotch Mountains. Bill


passed Second Reading. McLaoan moved Scotch Local Option Bill
without saying a word. A good deal to say: but Lord Advocate
might be in any moment; so the judicious McLaoan pocketed his
speech, and got his Bill passed. At this moment Lord Advocate
arrived with shining face and dinner dress. Cordially cheered by
Scotch Radical Members who had just passed most important stage
of two Bills designed to undermine Constitution.
Thirty Bills on the Orders; all private Members' ventures; most
of them horribly Radical: scouts still out; Ministers dropping in
breathless and alarmed; Benohes filling up on both sides; every
man in dinner-dress looking as if he had just been torn away from
dinner-table when cigars and coffee ooming on. In excitement of
moment, Richard Temple got looked in "Aye" Lobby; Rescued
through "No" Lobby. Old Morality arrived just in time to
see him emerge, offering observations understood to be Hindustanee.
By Eleven o'clock House quite full; threw itself with ardour into
discussion of Steam Engines and Boilers Bill; here Jackson dis-
tinguished himself in quite unexpected fashion. Seems that, before
he became Financial Secretary, spent his youth in a boiler; his early
manhood among the flues. Old Morality gazed at him with un-
feigned admiration. Edward Clarke began to think it was worth
while being rushed from dinner-table to hear this.
"If," said Jackson, with air of conviction, "an employer of
labour does not know that his boiler is subject to corrosion, where
has he lived? Some one says 'No,'" Jackson continued, fiercely
turning in the direction of Mundella. "As an employer of labour,
I can say that I always looked after my own boiler. 1 have been in
a boiler several times, and through all its flues."
House cheered enthusiastically. Jackson not quite the figure for
a comfortable exploration of recesses of a flue. But as Clarke,
jealous for veracity of his colleague, Bays, "He entered the flue
before he entered the House." No resisting flood of Jackson's
eloquence. "Speaks so fluently," said George Jokln. Using phrase
in Parliamentary sense, Jackson burst the boiler. Bill rejected by
overwhelming majority.
"There's a Government for yon," said Addison, Q.C. "Hit them
where you like, they ring out sound. Only Ministry of modern times
that includes a Member at home in a boiler, and fluent about flues."
Business done.—Immense I Unprecedented!! Something like
half a score of Private Bills debated and disposed of 111 Jackson
emerged triumphant out of Boiler Flue 111!
Wednesday. Full attendance to-day. Second Reading of Deceased
Wife's Sister Bill on again.
Lockwood says she's the
only Sister Bill he ever
heard of. Supposes her
full name is Wilhelminj
Seems a little familiar to
allude to her as "BilL"
But that familiarity of long
standing. Been with House
for many years. Members
know all about arguments.
Have come to vote. Will
not remain to listen: so
missed mincing speech of
Home Secret art, in which
he sedulously trotted out
Cardinal Manning to
sanction his illiberal views.
Huqhks-Hallstt, sitting
just behind, much im-
pressed. Home Sec retar j
opposed Bill on ground
that it would lead to in-
vasion of sanotity of do-
mestic circle, and under-
mine social purity. "Ah!"
said Hughes - Hallett,
sniffing at scent of violets
... . ,, „ in his button-hole, "that
Alderman Chaplin, M.P. will „ever do >»
So when time oame, he went ont with Home Secretary, Chaplin,
and other good men, to vote against Wilhslmina.
Simple John Simon met the Pieman, represented by Home Secre-
tary. Utterly routed him on question of Jewish practice. Henry
Fowler brought up reserves, pitting Cardinal Newman against Car-
dinal Manning, and throwing in Cardinal Wiseman. Fowler suc-
ceeded in adding rare touch of interest to well-worn theme by
relating forgotten story of how the present law was established. All
about a Duke who loved his Wilhslmina and married her. Lynd
hurst brought in Bill in Lords, which said "Duke not guilty, but
no one else must do it again." That's the law in a nutshell. House
decided to crack it. 239 voted for Heneage's Bill, 182 against.
Business done.—Deceased Wife's Sister Bill read Second Time by
majority of 57.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Thursday.—Arthub Balfour really oonfused to-night. Generally
thought that lowest depths of harharous oruelty been reached when
O'Brien's breeches were annexed.
Now Sweeney's braces are missing.
Balfour more than suspected. Clancy brings charge in form of
question. Balfour, white to the lips, tries to assume easy air.' Bnt
E. Harrington sternly pins him to the fact that when John
Sweeney entered Galway goal he wore braces—(" Suspenders" they
were called in the printed question, braces not being a Parliamentary
word); when John Sweeney woke up one morning he found his
suspenders had disappeared, like the snow on the mountains, like
the foam on the river, gone and for ever.
Where are those suspenders now? E. Habeington asked.
Guilty blood mounted to forehead of Arthur Balfour. No one
even suggested that he had personally appropriated Sweeney's
suspenders. But where were they t No satisfactory answer. Whole
thing looked very bad, and Government gladly changed subject by
resuming debate on Local Government Bill.
Business done.—Sweeney's suspenders solemnly sought.
Friday.—Fireworks at last. Sixth night of debate on Second
Beading of Local Government Bill. A long, depressing experience.
To-night, just when nickering out. Hascottbt lighted'up place with
oorrusoation of impromptus. "Went for" his dear friend and late
colleague Chamberlain with great gusto. Only pity Chamber-
lain not there to hear it. House enjoyed it immensely. Quite took
shine out of Goschen, who didn't make single joke.

the Black Page in the corner.
Flourish of trumpets. Enter the Duchess of Marlborough.
King. So, my Lords and Gentlemen, you are in Hampton Court,
and you are pleased with it? [Only the Black Page smiles.
Dryden (with a low bow). Certainly, Sire, we find no hamper in
Hampton. [All laugh.
King. Quite so; but it is not every bird that knows his own nest
on a market day in September. [Half the Court laugh.
Colley Cibber (half aside). That depends, your Majesty, on the
company! [Nearly all laugh.
Defoe. Bnt yon forget that two's company, and three none.

Swift (satirically). Except on Ash Wednesday.
[All laugh except Bos well, and the Herald with the trumpet,

that a miller in a white hat has as much right to look at a oat as a
king. [Dbyden nudges Cibbeb, who nudges Johnson. All three

Sheridan. I am reminded by your Ladyship's observation that
those ducks are putting their heads under the water for divers
reasons. [Everybody laughs,

Colley Cibber. And so, Your Majesty, I take my leave
Sheridan. Whioh is all you can take without the help of a French
Dictionary!

repartee quite ready. Dryden and Johnson nudge each

King. You press him too hard; remember that when a grub is

terest to the
Speaker

important point of order.

VOCES POPULI.
AT THE FRENCH PLAY.
SCUTE—A British Theatre, on ttage of which that irresistibly funny
farcical comedy, "Les Vivacites d'un Vrai Lapin," with the
celebrated M. Patatras in the principal role, is in cowrie of
representation. "Lei VivacitSs," though comparatively unob-
jectionable in its main idea, contains incidents and allusions by
which British propriety would be painfully scandalised in a
literally translated version, but which, in their native form, do
not seem somehow to outrage the susceptibilities of the highly
respectable Anglo-Saxons of both sexes and various ages who
occupy all the best seats.
On the Stage. M. Patatras is piteously detailing the story of his
domestic unhappinesi [to a cynical friend, interrupted by frequent
merriment from the audience.
In the Stalls. British Matron (whose mirth is far less restrained
than it would be in any other Stalls). Oh, it is really too funny! I'm
■ore I don't know what it is that makes one laugh so!
[Ami, to do her justice, the doei not in the least, the only phrase
she caught being— Et e'ett toujours comme <;a!" But it is
so silly not to laugh when everybody else is in fits.
British Parent (to his Daughter, whom he has brought here with
a view to discovering how far she has profited by that year at the
Boulogne Boarding School—he himself is "o little rusty in his
French.") "Well, I haven't heard you faugh much yet I Thought
you understood the language?
The Daughter (hurt). I do, Papa, I understand every word they
•ay—only, I don't always quite know what the jokes mean.
B. P. (indignantly). And this is what they call education nowa
days! Ah, well, I might have spared my money, it seems.
On the Stage. Mile. Maqutllee, as "Mme. Gandinois," says to
Visitor, "Asseycz-vousdono, je vous prie, vous nous ferez l'amitie de
diner avco nous ce soir, n'est-ee pas?" The Visitor. "Comment
done—ma;s o'est moi an oontraire qui," Src, Src.
In the Dresi Circle. First Briton (with a imile of subtle appre-
ciation). Yery smartly written, this dialogue, eh P—that latt hit I
[/A' chuckles wickedly.
Second Briton (who hat been secretly wishing they wouldn't speak
so confoundedly fast.) Full of esprit—full of esprit! We 're no match
for them there!
[An aside it spoken on stage, which convulses the initiated: both
Britons a little late in laughing, and resolve to watch one
another's face in future—result being that before end of
Second Act each darkly suspects the other of being a humbug.
On the Stage. "L'Ami de la Maison" to "M. Gandinois:"
"Froide? (Aside.) Ah, non, par ezemple!" [Roars of laughter.
British Fiancee (who is determined John shall not think her dull,
behind her handkerchief). Isn't it killing?
John [who has been beginning to think her rather too lively, with a
slight stiffness). Well, some people might find it a trifle broad—but
so long as you 're amused
B. F. (in extreme confusion). Oh, I thought this pieoe was all
right—or I wouldn't. . . that's the worst of Frenoh, you never
know! [ Wishes they had gone to " Dorothy" instead.
Between tht? Acts.
Lady m Box (to her friend). Enjoying it, dear?
The Friend (rapturously). Oh, so much I it's perfectly delightful!
(With a sudden impulse to candour.) You know, I didn't quite
follow evtrything they said.
VOL XCIT. i
First Lady. Oh, but one doesn't—you get into it by degrees, you
know. You '11 find yourself beginning to get more accustomed to it
by the'time they come to the end of the last Act—At least that's my
experience.
_ In the Pit. Plain Man (to Quiet Neighbour). Comical kind o'
pieoe, eh P Find you manage to catch the drift of it at all P
The Q. 2V. (who has spent much of his time abroad). Oh—yes, I—
a—think so.

GUNS AND CHARGES.
From the admissions made the other day by the First Lord, in
answer to the questionings of Sir William Crossman, it seems that,
notwithstanding all the tall talk about energy and activity in high
quarters, the Naval Administration of the country is still playing
the same wretched old game. Everything is, as usual, at sixes and
sevens. It was elicited that the Camperdown and the Anson.
though they would bs completed very shortly, will have to wait till
March, that is till next year, for their gunB, while none are as yet forth-
coming for the Australia and Narcissus, now ready to go to sea, hut
detained in consequence of being thus unprovided with any arma-
ment. Moreover, it transpired that the Collingwood, on board of
which one of her 43-ton guns burst nearly two years ago, was still
armed with the same type of ordnanoe, and this spite the fact that
the Admiralty officials at the time had the effrontery to declare that
the defective guns could be replaced in a very few weeks. Such
revelations of mismanagement of " our first line of defence" render-
ing our famons protecting " silver streak" as nugatory, as if it were
little more than a poetical expression, taken in conjunction with the
recent utterances of the Duke of Cambridge and Lord Wolselet on
the military situation, are not reassuring. Certainly something ought
to be done, and it is to be hoped that the Commission now sitting
will in some sense or other show the way. Meantime it may be
hinted that if the required ordnance is not provided at our Dock-
yards, some of our "big guns" at head-quarters could be readily
dispensed with. Better that an official reputation or two should
burst than that the whole Navy should be suffered to go deliberately
to the dogs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FIELDING" AND RUNNING.
Vaxjdsvtllz Theatre.—Mr. Buchanan has had his innings with
Tom Jones, and now once more he shows us how good he is at
Fielding. What probably first put
him on the scent of Joseph Andrews
as the subject for a play, was hitting
upon the character of Parson Adams
for Mr. Thomas Thorne, and, in his
mind's eye., Miss K ate Rorke for the
ohanning simple
English rnstio
maiden. Fanny
Goodwill. JNotthat
Miss Rorke closely
■esembles Field-
ing's Fanny, who,
by the way, was a
trifle too tall and
too buxom a lass
for even Field-
lug's own redoubt-
able Joseph to
have carried about
in his arms. And
if such an author
as Fielding may
ie inconsistent
with himself,
surely Mr. Bu-
'hanan may be
pardoned for eier-
oising his own
judgment when he

Mr. Buchanan Scoring off bis own Bat after Fielding,
has so captivating a heroine at hand as Miss Kate Robke.
It will not now affect the success of Joseph's Sweetheart to remark
that there is very little of Fielding in it, beyond the name.
Perhaps Mr. Buchanan's reverence for the great Novelist pre-
vented him from doing much more than this. "When he who
adores thee has left but the name." Joseph Andrews turns out to
be the heir to a title: Fielding's simple Mr. Wilson developes into
Buchanan's Sir George Wilson, Bart., a considerable expansion of
the original idea as represented by Mr. William Rignold. Lord
Fellamar, the exquisite abduotor of Fanny, is a charaoter concocted
by Mr. Buchanan out of Bellarmine (the hero of an episodical story
in Fielding's novel),the sensual Squire and Beau Didapper. Lord
Fellamar has nothing more characteristic of the fanciful oaths of
the period than an occasional variation on "demnition," which
reminded me forcibly of a Mr. Mantalini in a costume of the time
of Geokge the First.
Mr. Buchanan's Gipsy Jim, a kind of \Tyke, pioturesquely
played by Mr. Blythe, is not in Joseph Andrews at all; nor is
Llewellyn ap Griffith, which character, as played by Mr. Frederick
Thorns, is, after Mr. Thomas Thorne's assumption of Parson
Adams, far and away the best performance in the piece. Here and
there, in his simulation of drunken-
ness, in his artfulness, in his sudden
bursts of passion, Fred Thorne's
quaint little figure reminded me of
Kobson. Two Bases bloomed here,
and now Two Thornes are flourishing
at the Vaudeville.
The scene at Ranelagh, with which
the play ought to end, is not, in Field-
ing's story, and is one of the most
amusing in the piece. I suppose it
was suggested by an episode in Tom
Jones. No better representative of
Mrs. Slipslop—though 'tis a great
compliment to Fielding's hideous
Slipslop to say so— could be found
than Hiss Eliza Johnstone. The
two Thorites, Miss Johnstone. Miss
Rorke, and Miss Vane as Lady Booby,
are all excellent. But for being
stamped "Fielding," and having a kind of old-world SchooUfor-
Scandal-and-Bivals flavour about it, on account of the costumes,
what critical audience could ever have accepted, without an outburst
of laughter, the story of the Gipsy and long-lost son, which is
managed somewhat in this manner:—
Sir George Wilton [greatly agitated, of course—to Grpsr Jim).
You stole my child twenty-three years ago.
Gipsy Jim [sullenly, of course). I did—and from that day to this
I've never set eyes on him.
ISir George Wilson (breathing hard). Here's a hundred pounds
to find him—payable on delivery.

since the dark night I stole him out of the cradle—{with increasing
earnestness)— but if he's alive I'11

then in a voice trembling with grate-
ful emotion)—I 'U find him 1
[ Great applause, and exit Jim.
Then follows Scene in which Joseph
Andrews is brought in by Par-
son Adams.
Sir George Wilson {more and
more agitated on hearing Joseph's
age). Twenty-three 11 (Gasping.)
My boy would have been twenty-
three nowl There are no other
young men born twenty-three years

Long-lost Father pining for his Son. ^ ^ away t^nty-three years
ago—I've never seen him from that day to this—and I swear that
he is your son I
[Tableau. Curtain as quickly as possible, and no questions asked.
Though Fielding has provided some foundation for the introduc-
tion of the ooat-and-gipsy incident, whioh comes in quite naturally,
I do not remember in Fielding anything about Joseph Andrews
fighting a duel, and, if he had done so, I am sure the author's sense
of honour would never have permitted his hero to pad his manly
breast with a volume of Parson Adams's
sermons, and so take a mean advantage
of his adversary. However, "Saved by
a Sermon" may appeal to the goody-
goodiness of a mixed British audience.
Parson Thomas Thorne Adams is a
scholar. His pronunciation, following
Fielding's accurate writing, of "A*.
reka!" was most correot. He must
then have some scholarly reason for
saying, " fade retro, Satanas," instead of
"Vade retro, Sat ana f ";■ What may be
Parson Adams's authority for this Y
What with "scoring a success,"
"getting another run," "making a
hit," "having a good innings," and all
the witticisms which the name of
"Fielding" suggests to the profes-
sional Mr. Wagstaff, no one will be surprised to hear that on this
occasion " Jack in the Box" stayed at home, and his place (by the
kind permission of Mr. Punch) was taken by
The Cricket on the Heaeth.

WAITING FOR THE MAY.
(Nsw Vbhsion.)
Rejected One Singt: —
Ah! my heart was weary waiting,
Waiting for the May—
Waiting for the crowded scrambles,
Where the critics, thorny brambles,
At the Private View come "slating"
In the usual way.
Ah! my heart was weary waiting,
Waiting for the May.
Ah I my heart was sick with longing,
Longing for the May—
Longing canvasses to study,
Portraits ruddy, pale or muddy,
And the many thousands thronging
On the opening day.
Ah 1 my heart was sick with longing,
Longing for the May.
Ah 1 my heart is sore with Bighing,
Sighing at the May—
Sighing at the sure returning
Of my pioture, hotly burning.
Hope's bright flowers are dead or dying,
Hopes of fame and pay.
Ah 1 my heart is sore with sighing,
Sighing at the May.
Ah! my heart is pained with throbbing,
Throbbing at the May—
Throbbing on my lonely pillow.
For my hope must wear the willow.
The R. A. '■ all fraud and jobbing,
1 'm inclined to say.
Ah I my heart, my heart, is throbbing,
Throbbing at the May.
Sitting sad, dejected, weary,
On this first of May.
What to me are "popular" pictures,
Ladies' gushes, critic b strictures?
My look-out is dark and dreary;
Buyers turn away.
Art it long, and live is weary—
Oh! confound the May 1
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
I have been reading Robert Elsmere, by
Mrs. Humphry Ward. So has Mr. Glad-
stone, who has reviewed it, superficially of
course, with his light and airy touch, in
this month's Nineteenth Century. So I will
go just a little deeper. It is in the conven-
tional form of three volumes, but it is an
unconventional novel. Three-fourths of the
first volume will interest the majority of
novel readers, especially those who admire
Oeoboe Eliot's scenes from Clerical Life and
Tbollope's Barchetter Towers.
The party at the Vicar's in the opening
chapter is very Trollopian. In a way, it re-
minds me of the musical evening at the
Deanery in Dandy Dick, which was, to my
mind, one of the most genuine little bits of
contemporaneous comedy ever placed on the
stage. The character of Rose, the only one of
the three sisters of whom I did not become
tired in the course of our three-volume
acquaintance, also seems to me to be a develop-
ment of the auburn-haired, posing, and im-
posing girl, the Dean's pet daughter, who, by
the way, was rather too emphatically repre-
sented by Miss Norreys at the Court Theatre.
There is one line which I must quote as
indicating the authoress's sly humour. Agnes
is expecting the return of her sister.
"Wheels!"exclaimedAohks. "Catherine,
I suppose," &c, and the sprightly and eccen-
trio Rose is not permitted by Mrs. Ward
to seize the opportunity of replying,—
"YesI Catherine Wheels! Oh, don't I
wish I were at the Crystal Palaoe, instead of
in this dry-as-dust, sleepy old village of
Westmoreland!"
This is an instance of the self-restraint
which Mrs. Humphry Ward can exeroise
when inclined so to do. During my perusal
of the work I occasionally wished that she
had been so inclined when dealing with the
unfortunate Parson Robert Elsmere, who,
like the man in Hard Times, finds every-
thing "all a muddle," and who wanders
about, a married Hamlet in clerical attire,
undecided as to his mission to set things
right, and dying a victim to the Mephiatophe-
lian-Betsy-Prig spirit—"the spirit who ever
denies "—of the present age, to which allu-
sion was recently made in Mr. Punch's pages.
"I don't believe there ain't no such person,"
said Betsy, and so says Robert—not Mr.
Punch's "Robert"—but Elsmere. I, not
being MephUtophelianly-Priggish, do not
reply to Mrs. Ward, that "I don't believe
there ain't no such parson." I dare say there
are, plenty of them. Mrs. Ward knows best.
Only if there are, their captivating and
brilliant society must be just the sort of
thing one would choose on a wet afternoon
in the smoking-room of a country Inn in
some out-of-the-way district. Delightful!

Dear Punch,
We hare borne it for years, and without the least sign of a'protest;

We Adjectives, dear Mr. Punch, are a modestly useful community;
Why should we be thus abused, robbed of our good name with impunity?

Superlatives only attract him; and oh I as an invalid yearneth
For Spring; or as poor Howard Vincent for Trade Eeciprooity burneth;
As Amandus for word from Amanda pines, railing at Time the despotic,
Nay, as a French Novelist strains for a theme that's uniquely erotic;
So—poet or mere party scribe—doth the penman with positive passion
Strain after the epithets strong, which I am sorry to say are the fashion.
The temperate measure and fitness of phrase which hysterical women hate,
Our scribes now abjure; they are equally furious, hot, indiscriminate.
As the waters come down at Lodore, as described by the voluble Southxt,
So the epithets shower from the lips of our Mentors immodestly mouthy;
Till Reason is whelmed in the flood, until Courtesy goes down to zero.
And Truth is as hopelessly drowned as Leandkr when swimming to Hero.
Mr. Punch, we're a numerous tribe are we Adjectives. I, for my fellows,
Appeal to the Scribe when he screams, make my plaint to the Bard when he

out of engagement wbioh no one attached importance to, if,
indeed, any but himself remembered

vinoed himself that when he said he
brief speech didn't think he should
a long one. Ground thus cleared,
in highest state of delight. Usual three
courses loomed into five points, with
one over to stick into H arttngton.
Habtington, on the whole, had a
rough night. Guilders followed up
G. 0. M., mildly butting at old col-
league. When all seemed over,
House about to go into Division, Har-
court turned up. Heavily belaboured
Harttnoton. Conservatives howled,
Liberals cheered. Stonewall Har-
ttngton sat with countenance abso-
lutely impassive. Couldn't have
looked more unconcerned had Har-
cotjrt been simply continuing his
attack of Friday night on Chamber-
"It'll be my turn next," said
Hxnxage, with gallant attempt to
smile. "He's cudgelled Chambbr-

But I warn him, there'll be a ter-

Warns Goschen of danger of touching this question. Everyone
much impressed.

"Carious," said Arthur Balfour, momentarily resuming old
mental attitude, which led to Philosophio Doubt,'' how heredity shows
itself. Generations ago, in dim ages ofpoetio fancy, the first ana simple
Simon met a pieman; and here, in House of Commons, we have the
learned Simon involuntarily throwing himself into listening attitude,
as if he heard in the distance the falling footsteps of the itinerant
purveyor."
Tuesday.—Don't often hear from Colonel Waking. Not likely to
hear from him again for some time. To-night, in access of
desperate valour, tried a fall with Joseph Gillis. Joseph has for
weeks retired to back Benoh, and, save for occasional interjection of
"Hear, hear I" has been quiet. Only at Midnight he rises. Then
Members in various parts of the House, having little Bills in hand,
get up with furtive glance towards quarter .where J. G. sits, and
propose to take a stage. Up jumps Joseph with shrill cry of "I
object I" and there an end of the business. After Twelve, no
opposed Bills can be dealt with; within the ten minutes that follow
stroke of Midnight are crowded joys which compensate for
Balfour's supremacy throughout earlier part of sitting. Up to
Midnight Balfour rules supreme. After Midnight, Josepr Gillis
is monarch of all he surveys. Content with this division of dominion,
he lets things slide from Four to Twelve.
Waring, unwary, taken in by this appearance. Thought he
might bully J. G. B. by suddenly springing on him question, " When
was he going to move writ for seat vacated by Dwtbb Gray?"
House held its breath to watch result. J oft B. rose lightly to his
feet at sound of challenge. Cheers and laughter welcomed his rare
appearance. Joseph commanded silence with long lean hand impe-
riously outstretched, and then oame the answer, ready, shrill, and
cutting.
"Mr. Spf.af.kk, Sir," said Joseph, who never omits this courteous
reference to his Right Hon. friend in the Chair. "I intend to
move a writ as soon as I get instructions from my chief."
Then he sat down, and one of the broadest smiles ever seen in
British House of Commons illumined his countenance in gracious
acknowledgment of the Senate's applause.
Quite a lively debate on amiable habit of Irish County Court
Judges, who, when appealed to to revise sentences passed under
Coercion Act, humorously surprise prisoner by increasing them.
Justin McCarthy moved Adjournment. Darling, Q.C., ripe with
knowledge of Quarter Sessions and hoar with frost of advanoing
years, threw himself into breach, and staked his legal reputation in
support of his learned brethren the Attorney-General and the
Home Secretary. Pretty to see Lord Advocate surveying out of
corner of his twinkling eye his learned brother from Deptford.
Gladstone couldn't stand it at all. Presently dashed in, threw
off mask of benevolence, rent the robe of friendliness, and spent an
exceedingly lively half-hour. Argument, reiterated from Opposition
Benches and addressed to Treasury Benoh, was, "Have you got a
parallel case you can cite in English practice f"
"Have yon?" Old Morality nervously asked Attornby-Geniral.
"Not a single case," Webster muttered, under breath.
"No easel" cried Old Morality, tugging at his stock of copybook
headings. "I remember something. Ah, yes—here it is. 'No
case. Abuse plaintiff's Attorney.' Get up and walk into Glad-
stone."
Attorney-General accepted brief and did his best. Nagged at
Gladstone very muoh in earlier manner of Stanley Lxighton.
But Stanley Lsighton used to do it better.
■ " Attohnf.y-General's invective lacks finish don't you think P"
I said to Tkkvelyan.
"Yes," said George Otto. "It lacks the finish of Wig and
Gown. Listening to him one always finds one's self wondering how
much the brief was marked."
Business done.—Still harping on Erin.
Wednesday.—This has been Geandolph's day, to be marked in
Ministerial Calendar with white stone or anything that is heavy and
comes handy. Grandolph, basing his manner on that of Joseph
Gillis, has for some weeks cultivated great gift of silence. Been
pretty regular in attendance on corner seat behind Treasury Benoh.
but content with conveying to Old Morality exceedingly unpleasant
sensation of knowing he was there. Listened for two hours to-day,
through Debate on Bill proposing to extend reform of Local Govern-
ment to Ireland. Five o dock close at hand. Everybody had spoken.
Gladstone made now inevitable speech. Balfour replied in airy-
Alfy manner. Nothing to do but to dismiss Bill with rattling
majority; when up jumps Grandolph. Opens terrible fire on
Ministry. Rakes Treasury Bench fore and ait, amid enthusiastic
cheers from Opposition. Nothing so sudden, so swift, so dramatio,
seen in House for many a day. Old Morality put on the " gashlv"
look he sometimes wears when at critical moment he cannot remember
appropriate copy-head. Balfour, but late so jubilant, bent his head
— Like some tall lily that droops its head and dies," said Wilfrid

THE THEATRE OF THE FUTURE!
Sib.—Don't let Professor Hkrkomer and Mr. W. 8. Gilbert think
that their.notions are new and original as Unbuilding theatres and
lighting stages.
Long ago, I drew
ont designs for a
theatre, which
every expert who
had the privilege
of inspecting pro-
nounced
Simply Prefect.
The auditorium
will be lighted by
infinitesimal jets
of the incandes-
cent electrio light
bo craftily con-
trived that no one
can possibly make
out where the
light comes from,
and, to speak
lightly, the audi-
ence will be en-
tirely in the dark
on the subjeot.
There is no heat;
the ventilation is
so managed that
onthecoidestday
in winter, or on
the warmest in
summer there can be no perceptible change in the temperature. All
the seats are so oontrived that every one can enter and leave the audito-
rium without causing the slightest inconvenience to his neighbours.
There are no Box-keepers,
no refreshment people; no hat and oloak nuisances;
All is Dons by Machinery
on the "Put-in-a-penny-and-take-out-a-ohooolate"prinoiple applied
to refreshments, hats, and coats, &o. During the day the box-office is
managed in the same meohanioal manner.
There can be No Danger op Fire,
as on the slightest alarm the entire theatre will oome to pieces—fas
to pieces ooming to the entire theatre, more anon] —by anyone touohing
a button in the centre of the seat in which he happens to be sitting.
The Theatre being built on the " Revolving Wing" prinoiple (my
tola invention), can be literally turned inside ont at a moment's
notice, and so be well aired and dusted. There is a sliding roof which
collapses like an umbrella when required so to do. Everybody is
brought up and down by a series of
Automatic Lifts,
and the top gallery is therefore as accessible, without orush, as the
lowest stall. This is a distinct advantage. Refreshments are brought
in the same manner by Dumb waiters; the visitor to the auditorium
has merely to touch a button labelled tea, coffee, ices, oranges,
lemonade, or what not, at the back of hisfauteuil, and there is before
him whatever he requires—the amount in payment having been
previously dropped into the slit labelled with the tariff of prioes.
Inrainyweatherthe "revolving walls" will be utilised, and a passage
opened into the Stalls to admit carriages. In fact I have so
arranged that all the year round the stalls shall be collapsible (this
is the simplest thing possible), and the space thus opened, to a depth
of from 4 it. to 16 ft. gradient, will be at once filled with the purest
filtered and boiled water, at a delightful temperature, the private
boxes serving as dressing-rooms, so that persons waiting to take
seats at the box-office, where there will always be a considerable
crowd, can amuse themselves with water gymnastics, swimming,
bathing, and so forth.
The entire theatre will be as capaoious as
St. Piter's at Rome,
a trifle wider if anything, to admit of certain novel stage-efieots,
and the production of historical pieces on a scale hitherto never
attempted, or, if attempted, doomed to failure for want of adequate
space and appliances, and, I may confidently add, of Genius capable
of carrying to a triumphal finish the designs which, after all, though
I am loth to dwell upon this theme, only True Genius—of which
Michelakgelo had more than a mere spark—only True and
Unlimited Genius can originate. Then as to
Orchestra and Lighting.
The band is under the guidance— under the thumb—of the oomposer
himself; it is out of sight, it is out of mind. It is meohanioal. It

and the tfftot is as of the hand of one master-mind playing all
the instruments. As I oompose my own musio I know what this will
be. "Plaudite!" Bnt on their own merits modest men are dumb,
and if I said more you would begin to shrewdly suspect that I had
some ulterior design in appraising my own wares.
Real Sun, Moon, Stabs.
Light diffused, dispersed. Seal Light. How this is managed is
my secret. I will only hint at it thus:—" Sound" can be bottled
up (that is how I manage my real thunder, and rain and hail,—I am
now sampling several bottles of good sound thunder)—well, so can
light. It is very easy for those who know how to do it, as I do, to get
a supply of Bottled Lightning
—forked and summer—to be sent to any part of the country. Now
while I use artificial light for the auditorium, I use real light,
bottled sunlight, moonlight, Btarlight—fog mixture, mist mixture,
and so forth, for the stage. Every effect will be regulated by the
"Touch-the-Button System."

"MEASURE FOB MEASUEE."
Dear Mb. Punch,
I have been so greatly pleased and struck with Mr.
Donnelly's exoellent disoovery of Bacon's " Cryptogram," that I
have taken the trouble to solve another for myself. Are you aware
that Mrs. Cowden Clarke's Complete Concordance to Shakipeare
contains oneP Probably not; and yet it does, and no doubt the
puzzle was inspired by the Bard of Avon himself. It is very
simple. All you have to do is to prepare two alphabets, and take
the proper number of words and lines. This is so easy that I will
not insult your intelligence by explaining to you " how it is done."
Working out this plain problem, I have already made the following
disoovery:—
Turn to page 191, and finding the third column, you must oount
67, when you will oome to " Don." Now go to page 527, and passing
your finger down the first oolumn, you soon arrive at " Nell." Add
"Don" to " Nell" and you get " Donnell"; and in the very tame
page you will find "Deputy." Take away the "y" from this last
word, and add it to what you have already acquired, and there you
are—" Donnelly "! Is this not extraordinary?
But this is not all I Turn to page 681, and towards the end of the
second oolumn you get " rounding Sioilia is a so forth." Take away
the first two words and the last two words, and "is a" remains.
Add what we have before, and nowwe obtain, "Donnelly is a."
But after all this is not oomplete—it is a broken sentenoe. We must
add something more before we have a perfectly satisfactory result.
Well, it is simple enough. All we have to do is to turn to page 271
(whioh is easily seleoted by a simple mathematical calculation), and
oounting 3 from the bottom of the third oolumn, we oome to a
quotation from Love't Labour't Lott, which runs as follows:—" The
hedge-priest, the fool, and the boy." Now add one word from this
line to Donnelly is a," and the mystery is solved. But what that
word should be I must leave to your readers' sense of the appropriate
to discover. Yours enthusiastically,
"Much Ado about Nothing."
THE HARBINGER OF SPRING.
Sib,—I write this to inform you that last night as I was sitting in
my library, I heard the clear note of the Cuckoo. I think I counted
it nine times. Soon afterwards I retired to rest with a thankful
heart. This is indeed a sign and a Harbinger of a really fine
Spring I Yours gladly,
Patbb Famixias Obnithologistus.
Private and confidential, by tame pott.
I know the Governor has been writing to the papers about hearing
the Cuokoo. Such a lark 1 I mean tuch a Cuckoo I It was our old
nursery dock, whioh had been out of order for ever so lonir. Yester-
day, we got the Winder-up. who comes here once a week, to mend it,
and out came the Cuokoo. The Governor had his door open, and we
had ours open up-stairs at nine o'clock. That's what he heard.
But he's right about its being " a sign of a really fine spring." So
it is, for tne Winder-up said it was a first-rate spring when he
mended it. Don't tell, only I don't want you to be gammoned.
Yours, Tommy.

From Cub Whispering Gallery Reporter.—It is said that
soon a New Gallery Club will be started as a rival to the Grosv. Gal.
Club. A New Gal., if a nice one, must always be an attraction.
Should the surmise that it will be opened with a Ladies' Night be
correct, then equally so is the rumour that Sir Comyks Carr—
Mr. Punch gives him the title d'avance because he is the personifi-
cation of The Ladies' Knight—will dance the minuet de la cour
in full Court costume, accompanied by Mr. Charles Halle. The
report that the New Gallery will be open on Sundays to the Halle -
lnjah Lasses of the Salvation Army, is simply untrue.

'ARRY AT A RADICAL RECEPTION.
Deab Charlie,—This Spring's a dashed frand;
beastly wind still blows 'ard from the North;
Bat Sooierty's fair on the shove, and the buds is, at
lartt, bnstin' forth.
The Two Thousand's bin run, and the Picture Shows
open all round like green peas;
So I s'pose we must sing "Spring's Delights,"—when
we ain't on the bark or the sneeze.
Went larst night to a Opening Show of another guess
sort, my dear boy;
Not my regular form by a lump, nor the speohies of sport
I enjoy.
G jt dragged into it, though, by a pal who's a Radical
kind of a cub,
And who got me a ticket—don't larf!—for the National
Liberal Club!
You know Tommy Trotter,—pale face, ginger hair,
and nose-pinchers, old chap,—
An awfully " earnest" young mug, mate, and not the
least mite up to trap.
He is mashed on old G la dstone no end, as his sort always
is to a man,
And his Club, Chaelik. 'ad a "Reception," which
means a big crowd and cold scran.
Poor Tom looked all corners and crumples, and so did a
jolly lot more,
For it ain't every sportsman, dear boy, as can chuck on
the war-paint and score.
Bat I saw by the looks of the ladies as ogled my sweetly -
iled air,
And my claw-hammer coat and cuff-shooters, that 'Asrt
was simply all there.
Swell building, old pal, and no kid, marble staircase all
colour and shine,
2 la Rettorong, Charlie; the 'Olborn ain't 'ardly more
spacious and fine.
Rather too many tiles for my taste; shiny walls may be
all very nice,
For a dairy or fishmonger's shop; bat a Club ain't a
place to store ice.
But 'twas 'ot, Charlie, thunderin' 'ot. I got jammed
in the Liberv crowd,
I 'ad shoved to the front like a shot, bat a crummy old
Liberal dowd
With bare shoulders by acres, dear boy, and a twenty-
stun white-'aired old Rad
Nearly made me a panoake between 'em; I tell you, old
man, I felt bad.
'Owsomever, I sweltered and listened. They stuck the
Old Man on a chair,
'Cos the parties behind couldn't see, and they didn't
mean missing their stare,
"'Igher up. Sir!" tbey shouts, "'igher up!" af^re
two or three words he had spoke.
And he hists 'imself up in their sight, like a jolly good-
natured old bloke.
Well, you know I 'm not nuts on 'im, Charlie; Sooierty
'•itea him like sin.
And I goes with Sooierty, slop, mate; but when the old
boy did begin.
Though his patter I wasn't aif fly to, his meanin' I
couldn't quite kech,
Still—well. mate, he may be a fraud, but I'm blowed if
he isn't a " fetch."
'Ad me fair upon toast, the old sinner; his figgerhead
isn't arf bail,
Sez I, "he's the sort of old toff as a cove would be proud
of for dad."
Tommy Trotter he stared. "Ah!" sez he, "my dear
'Assy, I know'd you'd come round.
That'« the wicked old traitor you Tories so 'iss at, and
'owl at, and 'ound!"
"You shut up, Tommy Tsottkb !" I uz. I could see he
was fair on the froth,
And jest wanted sitting on sharp, or the btrtf«r would be
in the broth. [dddlededee,
"He hat got the gift o' the gab, but it's all blooming
And the way you mugs foller 'im round jest like spaniels
is siok'ning to me."

THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH.
Todeson {who his grow A his Moustache, dropped his ffs, and got into Society
again). "Fact is Society's qettin' much too m'Xed, Dccbess. It's mot
amu8in*, after 8pendin' a flea8ant evenin*, to find you 've been hobnob-
bin' with a Shopkeeper, or sittin' next his Wife at dinneb, you know!"
Her Grace "Ob, dear mr! Why, my Husband's a Shopkeeper. Mb. Todb-
son. He kesps tuat or»at Bric-a-brac Warehouse in Conduit Street 1—
and the Toy-shop at the corner, that's mine !—and the Confectioner
OVER THE WAY, THAT '8 MY MOTHER, THE DCCHESS OF HaUTCASTEL!"
[ Todeson feels he has been puttin' his foot in it.
So it wos Charlie. "Very absurd! they quite make 'im a hidol, and why?"
Sez a lady in pink at my elber. "By Jove, right you are, Mum," s«z I.
"I was tellin' my mate. Tommy Trotteb" but here she slung off like a shot,
With her nose 'eavena-high in the hair, Sir. And that's your dashed Radical
lot!
Wy, a prime Primrose Dame, well wuth ten on her, tipped me her sweet little
paw,
At a Brix wood Bazaar, t'other day, and she chatted that chummy—oh law I
I felt, well, I 'ardly know 'ow, mate, all 'oney and oder oolong.
Yet they say Tories ain't demmycratic, Rads are.' That 'a a trifle too strong.
And bifious-hued frocks like green bedgowns, a-floppin' on couch and on chair,
Fair sprinkling of " Stars " Tommy told me, but rayther small sparklers /think.
They ain't in the hunt with Aim, Charlie; no, neither for style nor the chink.
Tommy Trotter he gushed most tremenjus; bowed here, nodded there, and all
that;
Bat I twigged that the toppers left early; yours truly ain't 'ooked for a flat!

No. 286. "Her Mother's Voice; or, The Distracted Husband."
Here Mr. Obchardson has forcibly depicted a very telling scene.
The elderly man in the chair has married a young wife, who is at
the piano flirting with a gentleman who is pretending to be assidu-
ously engaged in turning over the pages of music. The moral painter
here suggests the hope that this young man may soon turn over a
new leaf. _ The young wife has one eye—the left—on the lover, and
the right is slyly veering towards the long-suffering husband, whose
left eye is surreptitiously glancing at her, while his right is steadily
gazing at the footstool, as though he were meditating picking it up
and flinging it at the heads of the enamoured couple. He is distracted
by the simultaneous performance on the violin of the lady next door.
No. 281. But what especially irritates him is the sound of his wife's
voice, which so reminds him of the tone of his late mother-in-law,
and, therefore, of her mother. The room and the accessories are the
same old but always admirable properties, but the tale is new and the
title most subtly and sarcastically ohosen—" Her Mother's Voice."
No. 292. "Still L\fe! or. Missed Again!" An Academy J. K.M. I
Sir John, with characteristic modesty, has omitted himself in the
picture; but as there is no mistaking a brilliant J.E.M., and as
everyone "sees Millais in it," we have introduced him into the
scene. Birds uncommonly wild.
No. 298. "Sub Rosa ; or, The Blooming Blizzard." The artist is
probably having a sly hit at the Operatic Bouquet nuisance. (N.B.—

Johannisberg we find that dates

Ere we lost the United States,

Chaplin, A. de Mubxetta, and Henrt Oppenheim, that has been

spirited Italian Opera enterprise that he is about to inaugurate at
Covent Garden, met last week to discuss details. Augustus Druri-
olanub in the Chair.
Lord Charles Bkresford wanted to know why they couldn't
open with Slack Eye d Susan t Wasn't there an Opera called
Britannia t At all events Britannia sounded Italian, and would be
highly popular.
Lord De
e Grey wished to inquire if cigarettes and light refresh-
ments could be served in the stalls? Wasn't there a song in some-
thing about " .Z7 Cigarette per Esser t"
The Chairman here reminded the meeting that the subject was
distinctly Italian Opera.
Mr. Chaplin thought the Sporting Element ought to be brought
in. Country Cousins same up to town and liked to go to the Opera.
He could do a lot with his constituents in the way of fetalis, if " plea-
sure horses" were introduced. He had not seen the list of promised
Operas, but he would be glad to know if in any of them there was
any approach to a sporting situation.
Mr. Oliver Montagu said the only approach to a sporting
situation he could recall was in Ernani, where some fellow, near the
end of the Opera, blew a horn. (Laughter.)
Mr. Chaplin: Did that bring on a paok of hounds P ("Oh! Oh!")
Mr. Oliver Montagu said he didn't recollect very clearly, but he
didn't think it did. (Laughter.)
Mr. Chaplin wished to ask whether there was not an Opera
called The Flying Dutchman t Surely that was an old Derby sur-jeot?
("Oh! Oh!" and"Question.")
Mr. De Mcrietta thought that they had better let Wagner, alone.
Mr. Oppenheim wanted to know why they had better "let

Lord Charles Berks ford never heard that Wagner professed to
"draw." Thought he only composed. (" Oh! oh .' ")
Mr. Oliver Montagu thought if the Opera oould be played at a rea-
sonable time—he meant at such a time as wouldn't interfere with his
dinner-hour—it would be a sort of attraction, and help to fill the place.
The Chairman then rose. He said he had listened with profound
respect and attention to the suggestions that had fallen from the

The Italian Opera Organising Committee, under the direction of
Bignor Augustus Druriolanus.
members of the " Organising Committee" assembled around him,
and he thought, on the whole, he oould not do better than advise
them to leave the conduct of the matters they had been discussing
entirely to him. He flattered himself he knew a thing or two about
stage management, and the Operas he was going to take in hand he
would undertake to turn out in such a style that their own com-
posers would hardly recognise them. (" Hear, hear !'") His troupe
with AiBAiri, Nordica, Arnoldson, the De Rezskb Brothers, and. a
host of other eminent artittei, would rival the palmy days of Lumlet,
and the less remote, though not| less brilliant, epoch of Gte. He
hoped to show that Italian Opera was not only not dead, but was
more flourishing and vigorous than ever. (Cheers.)
THE EXHIBITION-LOVER'S VADE MECUM.
Question. Do you intend to visit all the Exhibitions
Answer. Certainly. I have on my list the Anglo-Danish, the
Italian, the Frenoh, and the Irish.
Q. Are you very fond of these collections of all that is excellent
in Nature and Art?
A. Very; especially the lamps, the bands, and the American bars.
Q. You are most discriminating. At the Anglo-Danish Exhibition
you would select something from Hamlet, Prinoe of Denmark P
A. Remembering the English Village, I should like to see a
Danish Hamlet. Also, I should like to examine the hobby-horse
to which he refers in the Third Act. I think, too, that some of
Ophelia's Columbines might appropriately appear in a ballet.
Q. I find you know your Shakspeare by heart. Is there anything
else you would desire to see at the Anglo-Danish Exhibition P
A. The " quadrant dinner" on a fine summer evening.
Q. What do you expeot to see at the Italian Exhibition P
A. The ground hypothecated last year to the Wild West Com-
pany in someone else's occupation.
Q. Do you expeot anything else?
A. On a fine evening the inoonstant moon mentioned to Romeo by
Juliet. And no doubt we shall have " ancient Rome," and " ancient
Venice," and "ancient Spiers and Pond," or "anoient Bertram
and Roberts," or some other well-known refreshment oaterers.
Q. And you will be able to fancy yourself in Italy P
A. Oh yes. My imagination will be assisted by the close proximity
of the District Railway and the beautiful climate of West Kensington.
Q. And what do you fancy you will see at the Frenoh Exhibition P
A. Chiefly the Royal Westminster Aquarium.
Q. And at the Dish P
A. Some new tenants for that unfortunate hall, with the evidently
Irish name, "O'Lympia."
Q. And what do you expeot to learn from all these exhibitions P
A. That " one touch of Nature makes the whole world kin."
Q. What do vou mean by " one touoh of Nature" P
A. The usual shilling admission to all.
mQ. But supposing that the Anglo-Danish, Italian, Frenoh, and
Irish exhibits were eliminated, land only the musio, lamps, and
refreshments remained, would you not be sorrowful P
A. I should be very, very, very sorrowful! As my reasonable
and always satisfactory "self-improvement" exouse for going there,
unaccompanied by my wife, would be removed.
Q. Would this loss affect the number of your appearances P
A. Yes, and the attendance of the highly respectable Public
Q. But if only Anglo-Danish, Italian, and Dish produots were
exhibited, without musio, refreshments, dining-rooms, and variegated
eleotric-lighting effects, would it not be a great suooess P
A. No doubt such an Exhibition would be a very great suooess—
but no one would go and see it.
STRANGERS FOR THE STRANGERS.

ROBERTS SILVER WEDDING.
What a werry strange suckumstance it is that so many sillybrated
peeple has all managed to have their Silwer Weddins this here yere.
All along of the Prince of Wiialks. Bat the most strangest thing of
all is, that my much better harf vent and fonnd out that this was onr
Silwer Weddin Year as well as so menny other peeple's, and that it
oame dew on Sunday, larst fnst of April! Now the fast thing as we
found rayther a little orkard, wen we had made up our minds to keep
it up with dew oonwiwialityt was the day. The 1st of April ain't at
all a bad day for to go and git married on, if so be as you must git
married at all. in f aot I have herd it sed by a grinning old Baoheldore
that, it being All Fools' Day, it ort to be speshally reserved for Bitch
ocashuns! So we both agreed to put it off to the nex day, witoh being
a Bank Olliday, all our reglar set wood be sure to be dishingaged.
I was so wrapt up a thinking all about my grate speech for the
Second of April that I quite forgot all about the Fust, so when I set
down to Brekfust on that morning with the Fammily, and my
yungest boy, little Tommy, cum up, and sed to me " Lor, Par. sum-
ooddy's bin and gorn and chorked a large D for Dunce on your bak!"
I natrally dragged my coat hoff with hindignashun, when he shouted
tout, "Ah, you April Donkey 1" and there was a good larf all round.
I ooudn't be angry with the little deer, wen he xplained that he didn't
like to call me the other name, coz it woodn't ha' bin true. I was
5lad that he had not forgot my rule, alius to treat his Parients with
ew respect, and speshally to onner his Father and his Mother.
The sun didn't shine werry britely on our kept Silwer Wedding
day, and there was jist a leetle too much Nor-East wind to suit either
me or my fond partner, that werry particklar embracing wind not
being particklar faworable to sumwhat used-up complections,
speshally when they wants to look at their werry best, but at any

re-wisit on this, our silwer anniwersary, that particklar seat in the
Park where, a quarter of a Sentry ago, I had boldly arsked her to
jine her fortunes with mine, and where she had blushingly consented
so to do. So, after a nice little lunch, we all started for the Park,
and after a rayther long and dampish search, we found it, but jest
as we had set ourselves oomforably down to injoy the nateral fond
rununynissenses of our romantick sitty washun, the rain began for to
cum down with that cruel wiolenoe as it seems speshally to reserve
for Bank Hollidays and Piok Nioks and Silwer Weddins, and drove
us to the Railway Stashun, which, of course, was a long ways off as
ushal. We got home werry damp and not werry partickler cheerful,
but as Silwer Weddin days don't come ewery day, we soon pulled our-
selves together and awaited the arrival of our warious gestes.
In they all came to an arty supper at 8 o'clock, and tho' we was
jest a leetle scrowged, it wasn't suffishently so as to purwent us from
hindulgin in plenty of arty larfter. Browit was in great force, and
his pressentashun to my fare spowse of a reel silwer Broch, subscribed
for by all the staff of a certain Otel, in a reglar gushing speech of
amost hinspired heloquence was one of the ewent s of the heavening.
The famerly had put their little mights together and bort their Ma
a reel silwer Thimbel, which William presented to her in a few
words of such reel natral feeling that I prowdly quotes 'em. "Ma,
this is for you, with your childeren's love, and ewery time as you
puts it on to work with, or takes it hoff to leave hoff with, remember
them as guv it you I" Of course poor Ma began for to cry, as was
ony nateral on sitoh an appy occashun, but a nice little drop of ot
Rum and water administered at jest the rite time, put her all to rites
again, and she wore the silwer hemblem of her hoil'spring's love all
the rest of the ewentful heavening.
As for myself, I had dewoted several ours to trying for to learn
sum of the best pints of the Prince of Whales' speeches on like oca-
shuns, but, strange to say, when the himportent moment cum, my
memery quite failed me, and I stumbled like a hold horse, or a werry
green Cheerman, rather than a well-machewrd Waiter, witoh I atributes
to gitting so wet in Grinnidge Park that all my best ideas was quite
washed out of my pore branes. However, I pulled myself together
at the hend, and boldly arsked 'em, wun and hall, to come again to
our nex Silver Wedding, whioh I wood take care to have a little later
in the Summer, so as to be freed from North East Winds and soking
showers, and all like wexations. And so, with "He's a jolly good

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Some of Commont, Monday, April 30.—No limit to resources of
Irish Members. All night long Abthttb Balfour stands with his
back to the wall, on guard. Sometimes on offensive. Manages to
deal oat smart raps, that resound on tough hides. Bat Airey-Alfy
not invincible. Irish Members had him to-night. Joseph Gillis
told me all about it. Joet B. is sly, dev'lish sly, bnt strictly truth-
ful. WASHtNOTOK, even in earliest boyhood, not in it with Joskph.
Seems that, before House met this afternoon'emissary of Irish Party
had interview with Black Rod. Black Bod an amiable, elderly
gentleman, who lives in constant terror of Sage of Queen Anne's
Gate getting his salary cat down. Black Bod gets £500 a-year for
sitting in uniform in box by Bar of House of Lords; another £500 for
walking np floor of House of Commons; a cool thousand a-year for
walking backward when he retires.
"Ana little enough too," Black Rod says. Sage retorts he knows
a man who would do it quite as well for 30s. a week. Means to
abolish Black Rod, salary and all.
Emissary worked on Black Rod's fears. Promised him Irish vote
when Motion comes on in Committee on Civil Service Estimates.
What Blaok Rod was to do was, to wait outside till he got tip that
Airey-Alfy was on his legs, then to walk in, and summon Commons
to Bar of House of Lords to hear Royal Commission read.
Black Rod managed it beautifully. Airey-Alfy up snubbing
Habtinoton. Door flung back. Messenger bellows "Black Rod 1"
Enter Blaok Rod and Airey-Alfy peremptorily shut np in middle of
sentence. Obliged to sit down. Irish Members cheered, and laughed
at success of little plot.
"Yon should have seen Blaok Rod wink at me as he retired back-
wards. It was quite O revore," said Joskph Gillis. "We must
really do something for him when the Salary question comes on."
Meantime, House engaged again on Eing-Harman Salary Bill.
A "two-penny-halfpenny measure," Hkneaqk called it, in burst of
surprising eloquence.
"Nay, said CAUPBELL-BAinrKRHAir, "it's at least a thousand a-
year. Sort of thing, one would imagine, that G Randolph would

Tuesday,—Quite a curious thing happened to-day. Br. Clakk
had on paper question respecting condition of Scotch Crofters. Lord
Advocate answered in usual crust y manner.
When questions were over, Clakk rose;
asked leave to move Adjournment. Ex-
pressed regret at interference with ordered
Debate, but explained that he would not
have taken the course but for unsatisfactory
answer of Lord Advocate. Here's where
the happy aooident intervened. Clakk, put-
ting hand into pooket in meditative mood,
thinking how he should begin oration thus
suddenly and unexpectedly called for,
found voluminous notes of speech
already prepared I Eagerly seized
bundle. With its assistance talked
for three-quarters of an hour. Of
course, wouldn't do for average Mem-
ber to expect similar luck on ordinary
occasions. A pure accident, upon
which Cunliffe Bhooks, stepping out
of his portrait-frame at the Royal
Academy, begged heartily to congra-
tulate him.
Rather a dreary Debate, save for
one of those flashes of pellucid speech
with which Cuambkulain occasion-
ally varies proceedings. Lord Advo-
cate very petulant. As Wilfrid
Lawson says, has of late made not
unsuccessful attempt to graft Bal-
four's airy manner on the crabbed
Wants Smith to let him bring down a
ferrule. Says he would feel more at home if he had it in his hand
whilst lecturing Scotch Members. Smith says there's no precedent
for it; Lord Advocate must imagine ferrule.
Scotch Crofters summarily disposed of, Brad laugh brought on
subject of Waste Lands. The reverberating Colomb green with
envy as he (at and heard Bradlaugh shout. Bradlaugh always
dominated by sense of fitness of things. Waste places being subject
of his screed, imagined himself in centre of Salisbury Plain, with
audience scattered about the marge. Always a pretty strident voice.
But in these circumstances Niawa nowhere, and the reverberating
Colomb a puny whisperer. Effect presently seen. Bkadlaugh
shouted place clear of Members, and at a quarter to nine House
Counted Out. Business done.—None.
Wednesday.—It was Maple Blundell's speeoh that killed John
Lubbock's Bill. No doubt about that. One single passage in oration
rung the knell. Lubbock, trying to
conciliate Opposition, had exempted
vendors of certain hot provisions
from operation of Bill. It was this
touched Maple most deeply.
Wrought him up to height of pas-
sionate oratory.
"Yon may," he said, holding Bill
between finger and thumb, as if it
had been the next article asked for,
and really, 'pon his credit, couldn't
recommend it; "you may have a
glass of 'ot lemonade, but if you
want a glass of cold lemonade. Sir
John steps in and says, 'No.' Ton
may have a 'ot tart, but not a cold
tart; and. Sir." here voioe sank to
lowest unutterable depths of pained
indignation, "if you want a 'ot
sausage, you may have it, but not
a cold peelony."
That settled the thing. Even the
Speaker, who, after all, is (to a cer-
tain extent) human, gravely shook
his head. As for George Higginson
Allsopp, he felt a crisis had been
reached in long struggle for freedom
of people.
If," as he said to his brother
Samuel Charles, whom he met in Lords' corridor, "a gentleman
dropping in after Eight o'clock for a pale ale can't choose between
a hot sausage and a oold polony, what are we coming to?"
Business done.—Sir John Lubbock's Early Closing Bill thrown out
by 278 votes against 95.

The State in Sanger.
Thursday.- Gaiety of House eclipsed to-night by news that
Speaker is ill in bed. It is said the rapid progress of business has
taken his breath away. Whatever be the cause, everyone un-
affectedly sorry. We are all proud of our Speaker.
In his absence Courtney took Chair, Gorst sitting later in Chair
of Committees. One startling effect of this novelty is to bring out
George Campbell as a humorist. Wants to know what is going
to be done with vacant space on arch by Hyde Park Corner formerly
oooupied by revered statue of Duke of Wellington? If they have
nothing else to put there, will they bring the statue back? Plunket
rather thinks not. Spent £3000 in getting it down to Aldershot. _ A
considerable sum, but the deliverance worth it. Strictest discipline
preserved at Aldershot. Corporal's guard always told off to arrest
privates speaking disrespectfully of the statue. Not at all likely to
disturb this happy arrangement by fetohing statue back in
triumph. All very well for Napoleon to be from time to time
chasst from Paris and then brought baok amid frantic shouts of
"Vive VEmpereur."' Duke quite another person. His statue to
be left to adorn Aldershot.
It was then Campbell made his joke. Said he would " call atten-
tion to the distressing results which have followed the rash removal
of a landmark dear to the inhabitants of London."
Wilfrid Lawson a little critical; says Campbell joking reminds
him of what Dr. Johnson faid about the dog walking on its hiDd
legs: "Not marvellous, though it was well done; strange it should
be done it all." Gobchen snapped angrily at this incursion on his
newpreserves. If this was result of Speaker's absenoe, sooner he was
baok the better. But House, led off by Addison, laughed oonsumedly,
and for hours after George Campbell, ecstatically nursing his right
knee, indulged in silent chuckle. Business done.—George Campbill
made a joke. Budget Bill passed through Committee.
Friday.—Ashbourne baok in the Lords to-night. Says he's
come over to see Pictures at Academy, and incidentally to introduce
a Bill on Irish Bankruptcy. O'Hanlon thinks that's all a blind.
Suspects Lord Chancellor of blaok designs.
"Doesn't oome to London for nothing," O'Hanlon says, gloomily.
"No. indeed," says Ashbourne, in his oheery way. "Costa
me £4 5s., not to mention cab fares."
Being here, sets Lords by the ears. Throws in innocent remark in
discussion on Boycotting, which brings up Granville, Spencer, and
the cumbrous Klmbeblet. Markiss marches in. For some minutes,
quite a pleasant rumpus. Business done.—Commons Counted Out.
Thorough.—" If you want a thing done well, do it yourself," is
the motto of action for the Earl of Onslow and Lord Clinton, who
have lately been inspecting for themselves the sweating dens of
Whitechapel—or rather Blaokchapel. When a Select Committee
wants to get on fast, let them get Onslow. He is like the celebrated
Griffiths, a safe man, and his title should be, Earl of Onslow-axd-
Sure. Success to both their Lordships in their praiseworthy
endeavours to get the whole truth out about the " sweating system."
They must have experienced some melting moments in Whitechapel.

"A WINTER'S TALE" SPOILT.
Booties' Baby, at the Globe as a play is not ur> to the Stann'ard of
the well-known novel by "John Strange Winter." This un-
dramatio dramatisation of Booties' Baby at the Globe
is an ill-constructed play furnished with stupid dia-
logue, and too long bv at least an Act. But for the
infant Booties, of Act II., and the charming acting of
little Miss Minnie Terry—the only unoockneyfied
child. I ever remember to have seen on the stage—the
first night's performance would have been a_ very
dreary one, even in spite of one of the most friendly
and patient audiences ever assembled at a premiere.
The stage mis-management is on a par with the con-
struction of the pieoe. By the time this notice appears, considerable
alterations will probably have been made, and the pieoe will be played
within reasonable limits.
Mr. SroDEN acted excellently as the villain. Miss Edith Wood-
worth looked interesting, and tried to compensate for poverty of
dialogue by wealth of appropriate action. Miss I, in d ley
looked and acted very well as Mrs. Smith. Mr. Edmund Maurice
played Booties in a straightforward manly style. Mr. Gilbert
Farquhar represented, it is not improbable, a type of regimental
doctor, with whioh, thank goodness, 1 am unacquainted. No better
officer's servant could be found than Mr. Charles Collette, only
one can have too much of even so good a performance as his, and
indeed, thinking over it, the impression left on my mind by the
piece is, that it was all Collette and Babies. I was bored by it, but
then I deserved to be punished for breaking through my ride and
going to a premiere, an exception for Yours Truly,
jACK-IN-THJt-B0X.
P.S.—There doesn't seem at first sight much connection between
this very modern inartistic work and the picturesque, romantic,
musical fragment, entitled The Sorceress, as performed at Professor
Her comer's Theatre, Bushey. Yet there is. In the latter, round
the stolen child the picturesquely ragged rascals ran, and danced,
and kissed his little hands, and hugged him unoouthly. Now this is
precisely what the idiotio, prosaic, Tony I.nmpkine;que officers do
with Mignon in Booties' Baby. Another ourious and undesigned
coincidence is the resemblance between Booties' Baby and The Luck
of Roaring Camp.

doubt that the decisive crisis was approaching. It was
known, from the second edition of the Time*, that the
joint Armada, carrying everything before it, was con-
tinuing its victorious progress up the Channel. Ply-
mouth had fallen without tiring a snot. Portsmouth had
speedily followed suit. The former had found itself, at
the eleventh hour, unprovided with a single gun. The
latter, at the crucial moment, discovered that it was
still waiting the arrival of its ammunition. When
these faots, mysteriously whispered at first with bated
breath, became, later in the day, authenticated by the
appearance of succeeding editions of the morning papers,
the public excitement knew no bounds. A hideous panic
seized the Stock Exohange. "Gosohens " went down to
sixty at a single leap. Five well-known Stockbrokers
went off their heads, and were removed in cabs by the
police in violent hysterics. The Lord Mayor appeared
on the steps of the Mansion House, and endeavoured to
quell the riot. He was at once recognised by the mob,
and pelted with Pass-Books.
But things assumed a most threatening aspect at the
Admiralty. A vast multitude had assembled at White-
hall, and rendered Parliament Street impassable. There
was an angry howl at the "Board." The Police took the

ment met it would be asked to appoint another Committee
to inquire into the naval administration of the country.
His speech was out short by execrations, and he hastily
withdrew. Ten minutes later it was understood that he
had escaped by the back way over the palings into the

Fark, and was hiding himself from the fury
of the mob in an unfrequented slum in
Pimlioo. fc'*' ■ -•■
But while these events were" transpiring
in the Metropolis of the Empire, still grayer
ifsues were being arrived at on that silver
streak," which, up to now, had popularly,
but erroneously, been regarded as its sure
defence. What had been left of the British
Channel Fleet after its first disastrous
encounter with the joint Armada off the
Lizard had rallied, and was now await-
ing the attack of the again on-pressing
and advancing enemy, in what promised
to be a decisive encounter for the pos-
session of the Mouth of the Thames, in
the immediate neighbourhood of Heme
Bay. The Admiral, in his hasty retreat,
had colli cted about the shattered remnant
of his forces some auxiliary adjuncts. He
had been joined by Her Majesty's ironclads,
Styx and Megatherium, and by the belted
cruiser, Daffodil; but owing to the fact
that these vessels, not possessing any guns,
had had to put to sea without their arma-
ments, the recent arrivals could scarcely be
counted on by him as an addition to his
fighting power in'any pending action. Nor
was he sure of his own ship. Her Majesty's
ironclad Blunderer, which carried his flag,
was armed with four of the famous 43-ton
Collingwood exploding guns, and though
hard pressed in the recent engagement, he
had not thought it wise to give the order
to "fire."
Such was the position of the British Ad-
miral at the commencement of that fatal
afternoon which saw the last blow struck
for the preservation of the Empire. The
fight commenced by a general attack of the
enemy. But it did not last long. In a very
few minutes seven of the British ironolads,
including that of the Admiral, were blown
up by the explosion of their own guns.
1 he rest found that they were supplied
with the wrong-sized ammunition, and were
rapidly put nort de combat. Within a
quarter of an hour of the firing of the first
shot the action was over, and the last rem-
nant of the British Fleet had practically
disappeared. That evening the advance
despatch boats of the joint Armada anchored
off Gravesend, and 120,000 men]were landed
on the Kentish coast between Margate and
White table.
When the news of the disaster appeared
in the evening papers, the panic, which had
been gathering strength as the day pro-
gressed, culminated in fever-heat. Every-
body was in the streets asking, with staring
eyeballs, for the latest news.
Gradually it btcame known that 73,000
of the enemy were advancing on the capital
by way of Aldershot, and that the General
in command at the camp, who had 1371 men
of all arms under him, all told, had re-
ceived orders to oppose them, and this
announcement seemed to restore in some
measure the public confidence.
Meantime a quite phenomenal activity
prevailed at the War Office, and the horses
of the General Omnibus Company were at
onoe requisitioned for the service of the
Royal Artillery. The Duke of Cambbidge.
on hearing of the catastrophe, had applied
to the Authorities instantly for the 11,000
men he had reoently insisted on. With that
force, he said, even at the eleventh hour,
he would guarantee the safety of the
country. Mr. Whitklkt forthwith under-
took to furnish them within twenty-four
hours. His offer was accepted with en-
thusiasm. It was known too that Lord
Wolsklxt had already started with a
miscellaneous force of Volunteers, Guards,
and Policemen, hurriedly collected, for

'OH, TAX 'EM, BY ALL MEANS!"
Hawker (outside, talcing advantage of the open window) "Buy A yica Mop, GoVwouk I'
Sydenham, with the intention of taking up a defensive position among the antediluvian
animals, and there waiting the course of events.
The Authorities were fairly on their mettle. They instantly supplied three Volunteer
regiments with rifles of an obsolete and antiquated pattern. Nor was this all. They
telegraphed to Woolwich to expedite the selection of a model for the new magazine rifle, and
marked their communication urgent." Matters, meanwhile, at head-quarters were not
less vigorously pushed forward. Inquiries were made for Mr. Stanhope's plan of "defend-
ing the Thames." Every pigeon-hole was examined, but it oould not be found. Still, the
Department did not despair. They despatched a third-class War Office clerk to Greenwioh
to report on the situation and say what he thought of it.
When, however, it transpired the next morning that, spite all the efforts to stay their
advance, 50,000 of the enemy had taken possession of the Bank of England, seized the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen as hostages, and were prepared to treat with the Government, with a
view to evacuation, on the oession of Margate, Canada, India, Gibraltar, Malta, Australia, and
Madame Tussaud's Wax-work Collection, together with a preliminary payment of fifteen
milliards, Englishmen began soberly to recognise that what they had so long regarded as an
impossible vision had really oome about, and that the " Next Armada" was an unhappily
accomplished fact. ••••••

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Mouse of Common*, Monday, May 7.—Abthub Montague Bbookfield
came down to House to-day, whistling "Marlbrook il ien va-t-en guerre."
Bbookfteld was in 13th Hussars, doncha. Now sits for Rye, and sometimes
writes books. Had a great notion to-day. On Friday Bradlaugii orating on
Waste Lands. Incidentally spoke disrespectfully ot one hundred thousand
acres of waste land in Sussex. All Brookfield'3 martial ardour boiled over.
Bye should see what he could do for the county. Went out to prepare his
speeoh. Bell rang. Didn't matter; too busy. Presently messengers come in
to put lights out. House counted, Bradlauoh got off scot-free, Sussex sat
upon, and Rye unavenged 1
Thus things looked blaek on Friday night. But to-day sky brightened.
Brookpield had happy thought. Why not go down to House, rise after
questions, crave indulgence to discourse on personal matter, and, as Maple
Blun»ell would say, give it Bbadlau«h 'ot? Some fellows when they can't
ret off speeoh write to long-suffering Timet, and work off stray thoughts.
Better still to rise on personal question. Members always listen to personal
question; all the papers report it at length. Wonder never thought of this
before.
So Bbookfield il e'en va-t-en auerre—all across the Park, where the Spring
leaves danoed out to Bee him go by. Arrived at House took seat immediately
on right of Speaker, so as to catch his eye when time oame. Questions over,
rose, produced manuseript, and " claimed indulgence of House whilst he made
personal statement." Members beginning to crowd out under impression
that business was commencing, halted, turned back, resumed seats. Bbook-
field began with reference to Count Out on Friday, to Bradlaugu's " serious
and absolutely unfounded allegation," and so on to the existence of hundred
thousand aores of waste land in the oounty of Sussex—"one of the divisions
of which I have the honour to represent."
Speaker on his feet, with warning cry of " Order I Order I" "One hundred
thousand acres of waste land," said he, cannot possibly be a subject of personal
explanation."
Brookfield nervously explained that he was ooming to the personal matter.
Speakeb sternly shook his head. To cross an ordinary spinney, or fifty aores of
ploughed land, might be permitted; but a hundred thousand aores of waste
land I—House evidently could not wait whilst he crossed it at whatever speed.
So Speakeb called on next business, and Brookfield mournfully picked his
way back through the hundred thousand acres.
Maple Blundell was quite right," he wearily said. "Dead set in
modern legislation against anything 'ot. Suppose I might have made a cool
remark, bat when I meant to give it Bradlauoh 'ot, Speaker shuts me up."
Business done.—Local Government Eleotora Bill through Committee. Glebe
Lands Bill read Third Time. Got into Committee on Criminal Evidence Bill.
At this rate soon have no work to do.
Tuesday.—Alderman Sir Robert Fowler, thrice Lord Mayor of London, in
the dock again to-night. Always finding himself there, not for personal dere-
lictions, but as chief representative in House of Corporation. Fibth led for
prosecution. With him Bradlauoh, Q C. Prisoner, who was respectably
dressed, accommodated with a seat. Biumass, fauie
de mieux, accepted brief for defence. Crowds of wit-
nesses in the lobby prepared to swear anything, either to
character or ^having been with the prisoner in any par-
ticular place at any particular time mentioned in in diot-
ment. Solicitor General, interposing as amicus curia,
urged Court to look over affair, as another formal ana
more serious charge preferred against prisoner and his
friends is to come on at next assizes. General disposition
of Court to deal leniently with prisoner. Well known
for his philanthropy, his hospitality, and his "Heart
■hear 1" In the end, Jury disagreed. It is stated that
133 were for a verdict of " Guilty," and 156 for acquittal.
Consequence was, prisoner was discharged, and left the
Court accompanied by his friends.
Turned np a little later in support of Sam smith's
motion deploring the rapid spread of demoralising litera-
ture in the country. Understood that Alderman traces
all the iniquities of the Corporation to inordinate indul-
gence in cheap literature of demoralising tendency.
"If it hadn't," he said, "been for penny dreadfals,
the Street Committee would never have gone on that
excursion to Paris, ostensibly to inspect the telephone
wires; and the City Barge (if there be a successor to the
defunct Maria Wood) would have been sold for a mis-
sionary ship long ago, if it hadn't been for the minds of
the Court of Aldermen becoming unhinged by reading
aooounts of piratical excursions np the River Lea, penny
plain, twopence coloured."
Business done.—Corporation on its trial. Jury dis-
agreed.
Wednesday.—Abthur Balfour had pleasant time
this afternoon. Usually has Irish Members banded
against him. Fights them on wholesale principles,
"One down, another oome on." To-day sat beaming
on Treasury Bench, whilst Irish Members demolished
each other. Fun broke out on Second Reading on Irish
Saturday Closing Bill. T. W. Russell brought it in;
circumstance didn't particularly recommend it to any
section. As Flynn, dropping into metaphor, and re-
membering work of Art he has seen somewhere, observed,
"Russell always treating Ireland as The Dirty Boy;
catching it by the scruff of the neck, and forcibly
proceeding to wash its face."
Irish Members sharply divided on Bill. Some sup-
ported it, others opposed it. Parnell, with charac-
teristic judioious reserve, declined either
to support or opposite. John O'Con-
nor moved rejeotion. Thereafter as-
sumed that Arthur Balfour's remarks
on BUI were personal to himself. House
screamed with laughter when Aibet-
Arthur having made a particular
statement, Long John slowlyunooiled
himself, and, rising to fullest height,
solemnly declared he had "never said
that." In vain Balfour protested he
had not mentioned Hon. Member, had
not had him in his mind, was not, in
whatever indirect way, referring to bim.
After a few more sentenoes, Long
John's legs observed to move, then
slowly uprose the columnar edifice, and
a voice was heard saying, more in
sorrow than in anger, "I assure Right
Hon. Gentleman I never said any-
thing of the kind."
Presently Aibet-Arthur grew ao-
oustomed to process. Regarded inter-
position as note of admiration, perhaps
rather too plentifully sprinkled about
his sentenoes. When the tall figure
at the corner Bench opposite showed
signs of movement he resumed his
seat, John O'Connor made his protest,
and Balfour continued his speeoh as
if nothing had happened.
Business done.—Irish Saturday Clo-
sing Bill read Second Time.
A Note of Admi-
ration!
Thursday.—House kept a wateh on
Qcrnnr this afternoon, whioh, as Jo achtm
says, was odd, since Quinn had no watch on him. Lost
it early yesterday morning, wending his way homeward
after legislative labours. Understood that Qutwn waa

"Struck all of a Hsap."
FROM BROMPTON TO DENMARK AND ITALY.
(By Owr Much Abroad Contributor.)
with the sealed instructions of my Editor (not to be opened
until 1 was well on my way). I left Brompton for the distant climes
of the home of our Sea Ring ancestors, and the land that, by
universal consent, is known as The Garden of Europe." It is un-
necessary to describe my journey (which I need scarcely say was by
the Roaderzee-Exhibitionersberg, and the Diss-Trickrailwayzein), as
it was uneventful. I will merely observe that I was soon, very soon,
in the centre of Denmark. It was a most remarkable spot, and on
every side I found evidences that I was indeed out of England. The
first object that attracted my attention was a sort of .boat, painted a
bright red, which was floating in a small lake, dotted here and there
with fountains. This vessel had a solitary mast, or rather pole, sur-
mounted with a kind of globe of intertwined hoops, also coloured
vermilion. On oloser inspection, I found that this globe at night-
time could be exchanged for a lamp.
"Ah," I observed to a bystander, "I think I reoognise this ship.
If I am not greatly mistaken, this is the Nore. It is to be found, as
a rule (is it not r), at the mouth of the Thames."
"Ton are not quite tight," was the reply. "This is indeed a
Nore—but not the English Nore. This is of Danish origin. It is
mentioned by Shakspeahe, and is called Elsie-Nore."
Much pleased with this discovery, I continued my explorations,
and was Boon standing in front of a collection of small cottages.
"A village f" I hinted.
"No," said the bystander, who had accompanied me, and seemed
most anxious to furnish me with information. "In England, no
doubt, this cluster of cottages would be called a village, but here in
Denmark it is known as a Hamlet. Your great poet had, when
living, a deal to do with Hamlet."
"That is questionable," I replied, glad to show my erudition.
"The chances are that he might have composed half of it—say the
last half—but the Sam, I fanoy, is attributable to Bacon."
My Guide (who seemed a little annoyed at this remark) now left
me, giving place to a young lady (quaintly dressed in white muslin
ana wild flowers) of very prepossessing appearanoe. I was muoh
(truck with her hair, whioh was tastefully decorated with straw.
"Are you a Dane, Madam f" I asked.
"1 have lived all my life in Denmark, Sir," was the soft response,
"hut I am really of Irish extraction. _ My name is O'Phelia.
She pronounced it " 0'Failure," whioh gave me an opportunity of
| declaring that I was quite sure that it was a misnomer—that the
could only be associated with a great suooess. "Ton are moighty
polite," she returned, with a smile, " will I do anything else for ye?"
Thus invited, I said I should very muoh like to see a real Dane.
"Nothing aisier," she cried, and pointing to a gentleman in black
with a hat tied up at the sides and wearing gaiters and an apron,
observed, "Sure he's a Dane, and so was Swift."
After this, I saw a hundred objects of the most interesting char-
acter—there were jam tarts, jewelled brooches, tiny tea-oups, small
watches, and wee handkerchiefs covered with the most elegant lace.
"Thoroughly foreign," I commented.
"Not only foreign," said Miss O'Phklia, "but Dane-ty."
It now occurred to me that only half my duty had been performed,
and that in spite of the enchanting company of my fair conductress,
I muBt tear myself away to visit Italy. So after a courteous adieu,
I left Denmark, and was soon in the Rodo die Lillie, whioh, as every-
one knows is close to the Cemetario die Bromptoni. I hurriedly
entered the domains of the House of Savoy, and threw myself on a
seat where one of the most charming views I have ever seen pre-
sented itself to my delighted vision.
There was a small forest of the most delightful green foliage sur-
mounted by a gorgeous layer of flesh-colour enshrined in a sort of
shell of the brightest red. Resting on the layer, and overflowing
the foliage, was a stream of yellow that seemed to me like oil mixed
with hard-boiled eggs. I revelled in this perfect picture, and abso-
lutelydevoured it.
"What is it called?" I asked, almost choking with emotion,
"This, Sir," replied a man at my elbow, is the celebrated taladi
di lobiterini. Would you like to see the toupo-contommoni t"
I replied in the affirmative, and immediately there appeared before
me a small lake composed in the most exquisite taste.
After this I was shown the lambo, situated close to the tauei di
minto, the gelatino di stuffo-vealo, and the meringoet di cremo. While
1 thoroughly enjoyed these magnificent products of a happy country,
1 quaffed a very pleasing beverage, whioh effervesced when it was
poured from a bottle, decorated at the neck with what appeared to
me to be gold-foil. I was obliged to take it, as I found this kind of
sight-seeing rather thirsty work. By degrees the pleasant views
became slightly indistinot, and then I witnessed a most extraordinary
speotacle. The ground seemed to be turning round. Here was a
lamp-post standing on its head; there a band-stand climbing up a
tree. It was a weird sight, which filled me with vague awe.
"Where are we now r I stammered. "What do you oall this?"
"We oall this," was the immediate reply, "the Cnampagna!"
Then I remembered the evil effects attributed to the country sur-
rounding Rome, and hurried away. Shortly afterwards I fell asleep,
and remained in a heavy slumber for many hours. When I awoke 1
opened my sealed instructions. They were as follows:—
"Go to the Anglo-Danish and Italian Exhibitions, and write a
preliminary notice of what you didn't see."
With a sigh of relief (and a slight head-aohe), I reflected that I
had carried out my Editor's instructions to the letter I
"DI8TRICT VISITORS."
Thai there is "no more useful class, whether it be first, seoond,
or third, than 'the District Visitor,'" is the opinion of every official
connected with the District Railway and the Exhibitions at South
and West Kensington. Suoh, also, is the sentiment of the aristo-
cratic Earl of Earl's Court, in whose heraldic bearings stands out
conspicuous "the Early Bird on a field argent, catching the worm
iluggant."
For these District Visitors to London has been compiled, by an
anonymous writer, an excellent District Railway Guide, so ohoke-
f ull of useful and interesting information that the intending Visitor
who purchases it, may consider the most economical way of spending
a happy day to be remaining indoors perusing this valuable Guide;
only as it does not include details of the Italian and Anglo-Danish
Shows, he will have to visit these, unless he prefer trusting to his
imagination. The maps, as works of Art, might be taken as models
by some of our most eminent oolourists in the Aoademy; and the
War Office will do well to consider "the thin Red Line" shown
on this map in their soheme for improving " Defenceless London."
So muoh for the present—if you oan get somebody to give it you at
a present, all the better, if not it is sixpence well spent,—and in the
future not dim and distant, we may have something more to say on
these same lines.
It is published by "Alfred Boot and Sons,"—a pair of Boots,
and perhaps some odd boots,—and as it ought to be appreciated by
the Publio, it, as Lucius Junius Bootus might say, will go "like
old Boots." Boots it to add that it is Bootifully got up? Whether
it wouldn't be still better if more pooketable, is for the Publisher
to consider. But, d propot de bottei, he may think that a re-issue
in a portable form is quite another pair of shoes. A good advertise-
ment for the Guide would be on every Smith stall to have written
up "Boors Sold here."

AN IDYL MOMENT.
the latest society sensation.
The President of the British Artists—if we may still be per-
mitted to call him go—will find a formidable rival in his handsome
countrywoman, who has just arrived from America, and who has
already oommenoed her season in London. We allude to the talented
'' Madame Le 8lfi-leub," or Lady Whistler. The'' Lady Whistler!"
and our impressionable Jakes is not yet knighted. Why should
London wait f" What a chance for a duet! Papageno and Papa-
gena in II F.auto Magico! What is the old English, and, in this
oase, decidedly nngallant proverb about a " Whistling Woman and a
Crowing Hen?" No matter. The Lady Whistler has a career before
her. She is so attractive, that a song should be written for her,
"Whistle and I'll oome to you, My Lad-y!" Of course Madame
Li 8ITFLKUB does not exhibit her accomplishment " pour let beaux
yeux" of her admirers, and therefore they will have "to pay for
their whistle,"—and a very pretty and melodious whistle it is.
"P'Shobe I ".— Morning Performances are nowadays of such
frequent occurrence that the poor overworked Dramatic Critics might
adopt, as their national song, " Oh, dear! what can the Matinee
be! This would be a foot too long, but then anything connected
with an afternoon representation would naturally be the reverse of
too short. However, there are exceptions to every rule; and had
the Actors engaged in The Silent Shore a week since at the Olympic
Theatre played in any piece other than Mr. Bloundklle- Burton's
drama, there is every reason to believe that their labour would not
have been in vain. The promoter of this particular Matinee was
Mr. Arthur Platfair, who is more than a fair player—in tact, this
gentleman promises to be a very good Actor indeed when an oppor-
tunity is offered to him. On the occasion in question he worked
wonders out of very miserable materials, and was certainly the
feature of the performance. Mr. Scott Buist was also good. The
"Producer and Director" of the play, however, who assumed the
character of a fat and vague villain, was not so satisfactory; and it
was a matter of some regret that he was not as "Silent" as the
"Shore" for the production and direction of which he seemed to
hold jfaswM proudly responsible.
ALL OF A PIECE.
Dei* Mb. Pouch,
I see by the law reports that although Mr. Seebohm is not
to use any of Mrs. Bubkett's lines from her novel of Little Lord
Fauntleroy, he is to be permitted to retain what Mr. Justice Stirling
has decided to be his own work. I quote his Lordship's words:—" I
have oome to the conclusion that it may not be impossible for the
defendant to sever the passages whioh he has extracted from the
novel from the rest of his work. If he desires it, I will give him the
opportunity of doing so. He must first, however .... extraot from
those copies whioh are in his possession or power, and deliver up for
cancellation to the plaintiffs, all passages copied, taken, or oolourably
imitated from the plaintiffs' book." Of course this will rather alter
his present dramatio version of the story. I frankly confess I have
not been to the Prince of Wales's Theatre to see the play, but, as a
brother dramatist, I cannot help feeling that it would be a pity to
lose the whole of his labour. Why should he not alter the piece in
suoh a way that it might be still suitable for representation. I have
not time to work out the whole drama, but present him with a sug-
gestion for the Last Aot.

A STITCH IN TIME.
With a view to calming the popular apprehension now showing
some signs of rising, owing to the recently sprung "National
Danger" soare, it is said that the Naval and Military Authorities
have resolved on putting the following schemes into execution at
their earliest convenience:—
1. Arming the Volunteer Artillery.—As neither Sir William
Abmstrono nor the Ordnance Department at Woolwich, owing to
the heavy arrears of work they have at present in hand for the pur-
pose of supplying guns for Her Majesty's ships, arsenals, and coaling
stations, can turn their attention to the manufacture of a weapon
suitable for the requirements of the force of Artillery Volunteers for
the next fifteen years, it has been determined to equip this impor-
tant factor in the defensive organisation of the country with a light
muzzle-loading field-gun, the barrel of which will be constructed
from an ordinary six-inoh iron gas-pipe. The contract has already
been placed with an enterprising firm of East-end sweaters, and it
is calculated that probably before the end of the year after next the
first consignment of the order will be in the hands of the force for
whioh it has been so happily designed.
2. Organising the First Line of Defence.—With a view to pro-
viding a suitable force to act on any sudden emergency as a first line
of coast defence, it has been determined to enrol all the bath chair-
men, marine store-dealers, and Nigger minstrels, in the habit of
frequenting the summer sea-side resorts, and forming them into a
skilled corps to disoharge this important duty. They will be drilled
by the local police constable, and efficiently armed with the famous
Brown Bess, a sufficient supply of whioh good old-fashioned weapon
will be forthcoming from the Tower.
5. Land Transport Service. — This important bran oh will be
supplied in any emergenoy by an arrangement with the Borough and
New Cut costermongers, who have undertaken to furnish their
barrows for the work. It is calculated that in the event of any
sudden call being made upon them, they could render valuable and
active servioe in this special department.

THE REAL LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY."
(A Very Imaginary Conversation. With Apologies to Mrs. F. Hodgson Burnett.)

And then the Duke looked up.
What Little (iKANDOi.ru saw was a portly old man, with scanty
white hair and bushy whiskers, and a nose like a florid bulb between
his prominent imperious eyes.
What the Duke saw was a smart, small figure in a jaunty suit,
with a large collar, and with trim, aoourately-partcd looks curved
curt fully about the curiously canine little face, whose equally protu-
berant eyes met his with a look of—well, perhaps the Duke would
haye found it difficult exactly to define the character of that look,
but it combined in an emphatic way the interrogative and the
ironical.
It was thought that Little Lord Fauktliboy was himself rather
like a small oopy of a grander and older original, and he himself was
supposed to be well aware of the fact But there was a sudden glow
of emotion in the irasoible old Duke's face as he saw what a sturdy,
self-confident little fellow Lord Fauntlxboy was, and how unhesi-
tatingly he stood to his guns in all circumstances. It moved the
grim old nobleman that the youngster should show no shyness or
fear, either of the situation or of himself.
"(Are you the Duke ?" he said. "I'm a Duke's son, you see, and
know something about such thing*. I'm. Lord GRandolph
Fauhtleboy."
He nodded affably, because he knew it to be the polite and proper
thing to do, even from young and clever Lords to old and (the adjeotive
he mentally used may be suppressed) Dukes. "I hope you—and the
Army—are all right, he continued, with the utmost airiness. "1 'm
very glad to see you here."
"Glad to see me, are you P " said the Duke.
"Yes," answered Lord Fauntlekoy, "very."
There was a chair at the head of the table, and he sat down on it;
it was a big chair, and, physically, he hardly filled it perhaps; but
he seemed quite at his ease as he sat there, and regarded a Monarch's
august relative intently and confidently.
"I've often wondered what a Commander-in-Chief would look
like when being cross-examined," he remarked. "I've wondered
whether he'd be anything like my great ancestor of the Queen
Anne epoch."
"Am I f" asked the Duke.
"Well," GRandolph replied, "I've only seen pictures of him, of
course, and I can't exactly say how he would have looked in a
similar case, but I don't think you are muoh like him."
"Tou are disappointed, I suppose?" suggested . his august
interlocutor.
"Oh no 1" replied Gbawdolph, politely. "Of oourse you would

like any great military contemporary to look like your own illustrious
ancestor; but of course you might admire the way your great
military contemporary looked, even if he wasn't like your illustrious
ancestor. _ You know how it is yourself, about admiring your con-
temporaries."
The Duke stared. He could hardly be said to know how it was
about admiring his contemporaries, many of whom he didn't admire
at all. and some of whom did not altogether admire him.
"Well, and how's our bit of an Army getting on?" asked Lord
Fauntlkroy, airily.
"Our—bit—of—an—Army?" repeated the Duke, in a scattered
sort of way.
"Yes," explained Grandolph, "the bit of an Army we pay suoh
a pile of money for?"
11 Ha!" ejaculated his Lordship. "That's it, is it? The money
isn't spent as you like. You'd like to have the spending of it. What
would you buy with it P I should like to hear something about that."
"Doubtless," replied Lord Fauntleboy, coolly. "Some day you
may. At present I'm asking questions, and your business is to
answer them."
"The D 1" began the Duke, hotly.
"Quite so—the D etails," interjected Little Lord Fauntleboy,
blandly. "As you were doubtless about to say, the details are the
things I All very well to say in a general sort of way that the Army
is going to—its usual destination, Duke; that Party Spirit and
Finanoial Cheese-paring are the cause of it, and that more men and
money are urgently required. That won't do for me. 1 want to
know—bo does the Country—much more than that. How? Why P
What? When? How many P How much? These, my dear
Duke, are"the pertinent questions'to which we—the Country and I—
demand precise answers. When we get them, instead of vague
denunciation and big D's, we shall know what to do."
The sensations of nis Royal Highness the Duke, could scarcely be
desoribed. He was not an old nobleman who was very easily taken
aback, because he had seen a great deal of the official world; but
here was something he found so novel that it almost took his lordly
breath away, and caused him some singular emotions. A civilian
had always seemed to him a most objectionable creature—imperti-
nent, parsimonious, and with inadequate conceptions of discipline.
But this composed, preoise, insolently interrogative little personage
was a portent. The Duke's martinet manner was quite shaken by
this startling surprise.
"Well," he began, "if we cannot get the Country to understand
what is wanted, why then it is not our fault."
"Isn't it?" said Lord Fauntlebot. "And who are 'we'?
"Whoever ' we' may be, be sure that when ' we' oan explain dearly
and convincingly, with something like agreement, and without fog and
fury, what really is wanted, the Country will be only too ready to
'understand,' and to pay, for that matter. But when the Country,
paying heavily for an Army, is told periodically, with muoh
emphasis, that it hasn't got one; and when, asking anxiously what
it is to do to get one, the only intelligible 'tip upon whioh all
'Authorities' agree is—pay more money, why, then, my dear Duke,
the Country oan't understand that singular state of things, and
small blame to it, I say. What do we want, and how muoh will it
oostP These are the questions. Who oan answer them P"
"Well," faltered the Duke, " something satisfactory might doubt-
less be done with an additional eleven thousand men."
"Now, do you mean to tell me that the difference between 'no
Army' and an adequate one, between frightful danger and com-
fortable security, resolves itself, after all, into a question of eleven
thousand extra men P" asked little Lord Fauntleboy.
"Why, n—o—o, not exaotly," replied the Duke.
.. "Not exaotly," repeated Lord Fauntleboy. Of course! Nothing
ever is 'exaot' in what the Authorities tell us; "and yet they
grumble at the Country for not' understanding.' Stanhope says he
never heard of any suoh want before. What we want, he says, is
'improved organisation.' Another nioe vague generality I I've no
doubt we do want it, and are likely to want it as things go at
present. If there is one point you do agree upon, it is the need of
more money.' While John Bull believes, as I do, that with less
money he might, with decent management, get all he wants, he '11
hardly be in a hot hurry to relax his purse-strings at the oonfused
olamour of conflicting Authorities. Only a little re-arrangement
required, say the offioial optimists. The patriotio pessimists
put it very differently. A pleasant piotnre, indeed, the latter
paint. Nothing like enough men; not sufficient barraok accom-
modation, even if we had the men; artillery batteries with
bad guns; no means of supplying good ones without long
delay; best magazine-rifle .invented theoretically, but not a single
regiment provided with it; Army stores "miserably deficient; not a
single land-fortress with a modern breeoh-loading gun; guns served
out to Volunteers obsolete, armaments of forts obsolete, shot and
shell obsolete! There is the pessimists' pioture of our Army—to say
nothing about the Navy, what there is of it If half of it is true,
somebody ought to be impeached; eh, my dear Duke P"
"All we can accomplish is to do the best we oan with the Authori-
ties we have to deal with—the Country and the House of Commons,"
muttered the Duke.
"But do you ' do your best?'" asked Little Lord Fauntleboy.
"A physician doesn't first grab a bouncing fee, and then turn the
patient loose in a drug-shop. He gives a prescription! Where is
yours P"
"What does Lord Wolsslky sayP" retorted the Duke. "At
present John Bull goes to considerable expense in paying those
whom he considers experts to advise him as to the Army and Navy;
but he never gets to know what the opinion of these experts really
is when it has been given."
"Then couldn't the experts get to let him know?" asked little
Lord Fauntlkhot. "If, in all honesty and frankness, they agreed
—supposing always that they can agree—to take a complete survey
of the needs and resources of the Empire, with a view to clearly
formulating a scheme, and fairly estimating its cost, don't you think
that' the Defence of the Country' would be better advanced than by
the endless charivari of conflicting counsels and all-round recrimi-
nations which John Bull finds it so hard to " understand " P
"Humph 1" said the Duke.
THE BRITISH OFFICER AT HOME.
[A Page from a Diary.)
8 a.m.—Called by my servant. Glad to find that the window had
not fallen in. Thought the fork would keep it together.
• A.M.—Tub sunk into the floor. My
donkey of a servant put in more water
than the boards oould bear.
10 a.m.—Slight delay getting on parade,
oaused by ohimney coming down and
smashing half my furniture.
12, noon.—Back again. During my
absence the ceiling has fallen in. Quarter-
master does not see his way to ordering
repairs. Thinks I shall have to pay bar-
raok damages myself, as I had a bird-cage
with a canary in it suspended from the
oeiling. Says that that was enough to
"bring the whole thing down with a
run."
1 p.m. Just been to see my horse.
Found the poor creature occupying a
stable, as General Nicholson would say,
"not large enough for a donkey I" I
don't know what he would do if he didn't
keep his head out of a window!
2 p.m.—Rather annoyed to find that
the paper of my quarters had peeled off,
thanks to the damp.
4. p.m.—Nearly broke my neck falling through the barrack stairs.
Planks gave way, and when I tried to Bave myself by holding on
to the banisters, they divided in half.
6 p.m.—Dressing for Mess, I was imprudent enough to lean against
the wall pulling on my boots, and suddenly found myself in the next
fellow's quarters. Really these barracks are sadly out of repair I
12 Midnight.—Home from Mess. Looked out of window, and
found it rather windy. Under these oiroumstanoes I retire to rest,
with an uneasy feeling that if it blows fairly hard, I may find
myself under a heap of ruins before the morning.

Somethdto Like a Cemeteby.—While General Sir Lothian
Nicholson was under examination last week by the House of Com-
mons Select Committee to Inquire into the Army Estimates, General
Hatelock-Allan put to him the following query:—" Are not the
Royal Barracks in Dublin in a very unsanitary condition?" To whioh
the Inspeotor-General of Fortifications replied, "That is an open
question." Upon this Lord Randolph Churchill observed,
smiling, "Not much of an open question to the offioers who reside
there." Quite so—not an open question, but an open grave question I
A Northern Line.—In the Chantrey oase Mr. Justice Nobth,
giving his decision, quoted, d propos of soulpture—
"The brau that seems to speak."
And it must have struck his Lordship how far more appropriate
would be the application of this line to some of the eminent prac-
titioners in the Law Courts.

DIARY OF A NOBODY *
My dear wife Cabbik and I have just been a week in our new
house, "The Laurels," Brickfield Terrace, Holloway—a nioe six-
roomed residence, not counting basement with a front breakfast-
parlour. We have a little front garden, and there is a flight of ten
steps up to the front door; which, by the bye, we keep locked with
the chain up. CuMMmoa, Gownro, and our other intimate friends
always come to the little side-entrance, whioh saves the servant the
trouble of going up to the front door, thereby taking her from her
work. We have a nice little baok garden whioh runs down to the
railway. We were rather afraid of the noise of the trains at first,
but the landlord said we should not notice them after a bit, and took
£2 off the rent. He was certainly right, and beyond the cracking of
the garden wall at the bottom, we have suffered no inconvenience.
Alter my work in the City, I like to be at home. What's the
1 of a borne, if you are never in it. "Home, Sweet Home"—
'■ my motto. I am always in of an evening. Our old friend
Gowrno may ask us to drop in sans cirimonie; so may Ctjm-
MTjros, who lives opposite. My dear wife Caroline and I are
pleased to see them it they like to drop in on us. But Cabbie and I
can manage to pass our evenings together without friends. There is
always something to be done. A tin-tack here, a Venetian blind to
put straight, a fan to nail up, or part of a carpet to nail down—all of
which I can do with my pipe in my mouth; while Carrie is not above
putting a button on a shirt, mending a pillow-case, or practising
the "Maiden's Prayer" on our new Cottage Piano (on the three
years' system), manufactured by W. Btxxson (in small letters), from
Collabd and Collabd (in very large letters). Now for my diary :—
April 3.—Tradesmen called for custom, and I promised Fabxeb-
809, the Ironmonger, to give him a turn if I wanted any nails, or
tools. By the bye. that reminds me there is no key to our bedroom
door. Dear friend Oownro dropped in, but wouldn't stay, saying
there was an infernal smell of paint.
April 4.—Tradesmen still calling, Cabbie being out, I arranged
to deal with Bisks, who seemed a oivil Butoher with a nice clean
shop. Ordered a shoulder of mutton for to-morrow to give him a

trial. Cabbie arranged with Dorset, the Butterman, and ordered
a pound of fresh butter, and a pound and a half of salt ditto, for
kitchen, and a shilling's worth of eggs. In the evening, Cummiucs
unexpectedly dropped in to show me a meerschaum pipe he had won
in a raffle in the City, and told me to handle it carefully, as it would
spoil the colouring if the hand was moist. He said he wouldn't stay,
as he didn't care muoh for the smell of the paint, and fell over the
scraper as he went out Must get the soraper removed, or else I
shall get into a scrape. I don't often make jokes.
April 5.—Two legs of mutton arrived, Cabbie having arranged
with another butoher without consulting me. Gowing oalltd, and
fell over soraper coming in. Must get that soraper removed.
April 6.—Eggs for breakfast simply shocking; sent them back to
Dorset with my compliments, and he needn't oall any more for
orders. Couldn't find umbrella, and though it was pouring with
rain, had to go without it. Sarah said Mr. Gowins must have took
it by mistake last night, as there was a stick in the 'All that didn't
belong to nobody. In the evening, hearing someone talking in a
loud voioe to the servant in the downstairs flail, went out to see who
it was, and was surprised to find it was Dobsxt, the butterman, who
was both drunk and offensive. Dobset, on seeing me, said, "He
would be hanged if he would ever serve City Clerks any more, the
game wasn't worth the candle." I restrained my feelings, and
quietly remarked " that I thought it was possible for a City Clerk to
be a Oentleman." He replied, "He was very glad to hear it, and
wanted to know whether I had ever come across one, for he hadn't."
He left the house, slamming the door after him, whioh extinguished
the fan-light, and I heard him fall over the scraper, which made me
feel glad I hadn't removed it. When he had gone, I thought of a
splendid answer I ought to have given him. However, I will keep
it for another oooasion.
April 7.—Being Saturday, I looked forward to getting home early,
and putting a few things straight; but two of our principals at the
office were absent through illness, and I did not get home till seven.
Found Dobset waiting. He had been three times during the day to
apologise for his conduct last night. He said he was unable to take
his Bank Holiday last Monday, and took it last night instead. He
begged me to accept his apology, and a pound of fresh butter. He
seems, after all, a decent sort of fellow, so I gave him an order for
fresh eggs.

April 8, Sunday.—After church, the Curate came back with us.
I sent Cabbie in to open front door, which we do not use except on
special occasions. She could not get it open, and, after all my
display, I had to take the Curate (whose name, by the bye, I did
not catch) round the side entrance. He caught his foot in the scraper,
and tore the bottom of his trousers. Most annoying, as Carrie could
not well offer to repair them on a Sunday. After dinner went to
sleep. Took a walk round the garden, and discovered a beautiful
spot for sowing mustard and cress, and radishes. Went to Church
again in the evening; walked back with the Curate. Cabbie noticed
he had got on the same pair of trousers—only repaired.
A BALLAD OF A LA.TE OCCURRENCE.
To the Tune of " The Spanish Armada."
Lord Wolseley spoke some trenchant words for one in his position,
For though a soldier straight and bold, he is no politician,
And what he said at dinner-time contained reflections sinister
Upon all sorts of Governments and every kind of Minister.
The things he said are often heard quite calmly by the nation,
For as a rule they don't enjoy the Largest Circulation;
But now the Daily Telegraph exploited him and Ranger,
And told the world, in largest type, the country was in danger.
Though Wolseley can't bear politics, each sentence had a stab in it,
And caused much indignation to eaoh member of the Cabinet;
And Salishuhy, who of appeals sensational no lover is.
Was hurt that he had not been first apprised of these discoveries.
But what most vexed the Premier was the shocking want of grace of him,
To say these things behind his back, and not before the face of him.
And so to set the matter right, and make things straight and pleasant,
He said the nastiest things he could, when Wolseley wasn't present.
The country now was all agog, its Tadpoles and its Tapers,
And those who had no private views annexed one from the papers;
But all allowed that now at last a crisis we were nearing,
And some for " extry-specials" went, and some for volunteering.
Some roundly blamed the Soldier bold, f or j ealous-minded men are all
As pleased as—not as Punch— to jibe at England's Only General;
Ana others didn't care a fig about their country's glory,
If they could hurt a Government that happened to be Tory.
But hip, hooray I when Greek met Greek they showed how scandal's
tools lie,
For Salisbury vows 'twould break his heart to lose his gallant
Wolseley.
And hatchets fouled with party strife we all at duty's calls bury,
And Wolseley never said a word disparaging to Salisbury.
A New Discovery by Mrs. R.—" Well," said the good lady to
a friend, "I dare say, my dear, you '11 laugh at me when I tell you
that till the other morning I never knew there were more equators
than one. And what's more, I hadn't an idea that when one of the
equators was out of use it could be lent or given to anyone by the
Government to whom it might belong. How did I find this out?
This way: my nephew reads the foreign news in the Times to me
every day, and on Saturday last he read out, and wrote it down at
the moment:—' The Greeks still talk of expelling a Turkish Consul
from Greece, should the ex-equator be refused to him.' * I didn't say
a word to my nephew; but I'm going to write to the Astrologer
Royal about it, as I think public attention ought to be drawn to the
faot. The idea of a Turkish Consul having an ex-equator all to
himself, and then being angry because they wouldn't give it to him 1

"You think unless you have some fresh excitement you will die?"
"I am sure of it. I have grown so aooustomed to a whirl of the
most delirious amusement, that, unless I have some new pleasure
every day, I must sink. Wild mirth is my second nature."
The Editor looked upon his Contributor regretfully. He felt
that to some extent it was his fault that his faithful follower had
become so wedded to these delioious but jading delights.
"You were present last week at the I estival Dinner of the Home
for Incurables in the Conservatory attached to the Albert Hall?" he
murmured sadly.
"Ah, was I not?" cried the contributor, in an ecstasy of joy.
"Never shall I forget the ubiquitons draughts, the several lights,
the soul-stirring eloquenoe of the Duke of Cambridge (who was
defying influenza under cover of Japanese screens), and the music of
the Guards' Band, whioh was loud enough to blow the roof off! And
the dinner—what a dinner 1 And the company—what a company I"
"And there was singing too P"
"I should rather think there was I One song, in any number of
verses, was called ' Helpless .'' and described the ' death in life' of
the patients. So interesting! so cheerful I so pleasant I Just the
sort of rollicking ditty to enjoy over a cup of coffee and a cigar."
"And did you go into the grounds afterwards P,"^
"Yes: and saw quite a number of coloured oil lamps—quite a
number I I was never more pleased in my life."
"And did you not like the tableaux vivants of Hans Christian
Andersen, arranged by Mr. 8a vile Clarke P"
"Sincerely I did. They were really and truly beautiful. But
even Mr. Clarke paid a passing tribute to the prevailing gloom of
the Incurables by including- in his admirable collection the Little
Match-Girl being frozen to death in the snow."
"You must have had a very delightful evening ?']
"Indied I had! But it was nothing to compare with the following
afternoon, when I had the advantage of being present at a Matinte
of The Seal Little Lord Fa—'
"Was it well dramatised?"
"Admirably, by the Authoress of the Novel. I cried the whole
time I It was so affecting! Miss Emery, as "Dearest," admirable,
and Mr. Alfred Bishop, as the Earl, beyond all praise. Then Mr.
Chevalier as the Butterman, and Mr. Brandon Thomas as the
lawyer could not have been surpassed. And Miss Vera Berangbr
was clever beyond her years. She had studied every attitude, and
paid suoh attention to the audience that it was impossible to overlook
the fact that she was acting, and acting very much indeed 1 And
when I was not distracted by her admirable impersonation, and could
fancy the other characters real flesh and blood, I wept like a child."
"You must have had a most enjoyable afternoon?"
"A most pleasant one, and the very next dav I went to the
Criterion, and absolutely revelled in a pieoe called The Deputy."
"Do you know what it was about P"
"No, I do not, but I am sure it must have been something vastly
amusing. I rather fanoy a gentleman called Brown was supposed to
have committed bigamy because he would not say he was married to
a widow of the same name—not until the last Aot, you know. So
very mirth-provoking I At least I know it must have been mirth-
provoking, because it was called a farcical comedy in three Aots!
Dear me T Alas! And all these pleasures are over I"
And the poor Contributor heaved a heavy sigh.
"Life is not worth living without such wild delights I" he mur-
mured. "Unless I have some more, I feel I shall die."
The Editor drew a paoket from his pocket and gently placed it in
the hands of his faithful follower. The latter with lack lustre eyes
glanced at its contents. Suddenly his face beamed with pleasure.
"Saved I " he shouted, "saved I I am myself once more I"
He had received a vouoher for a special morning performance for a
new and original play in four Aots. It was called The Love Story,
and he read this note on the programme:—" N.B.—Unless the whole
of the First Scene be witnessed, the subsequent action of the play
cannot be understood."
"Four Aots, and not a jot less 1" he cried. And then he fainted
away for sheer joy.

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday 14.—Augustus Druriolanus opened his Operatio Season
with a real novelty. There was a bust of the Queen on the stage,
and a bust of applause from the audience. Everyone sans; the
National Hymn in honour of the National Her, and then we sat
down to listen to Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia. For my part—a
very small one in the Opera—I may say I am never tired of Lucrezia.
I wagged my head to the old familiar strains, kept time with
my foot, and wondered to myself whether Grisi had dressed the
part as does Madame Fubsch-Madi,—who oertainly "embodies
the character" in the most ample manner,—and whether Signor
Mario made as boyish a Oennaro as does Signor Ravelu. 1
like Signor Nat abbot as the Duca. But how difficult for any
couple to play the great poison scene without drifting unconsciously
into the fine old and very mellow-dramatic style of the palmiest days
of the Victorian Theayter, which the burlesquers of half a century
ago—I mean Gixbebt a Beckett, Albebt Smith, and the Bbouqhs
for example—scotched, and whioh H. J. Bybon, and later burlesque
writers, killed. So there are uses even in burlesque.
Tuesday 15.—There could not be a stronger contrast in appear-
ance between Madame Nordjca, as Carmen, and Miss McIntybe as
A Mi chae la
For such a
debutante no
part could
have been
better cho-
se n. It

admirably,
and her
shortcom
ings, her
naivete, her
simplicity,
and her
graoe f u1
awkward-
ness, mate-
rially added
to the great
charm of
her perform-
ance. Ma-
dame Nob-
dica looked
the Carmen
of the story,
playing and singing the part like the genuine artiste she is. M.
Etixnne de Reims, as Don Jose the soldier, was excellent as far
as the acting went—about the most dramatic Jose I've seen—but
in singing he was what any silly lover of Carmen would naturally
be, " a little flat." With the Etcamillio of Signor Del Pttehtb I
was, like the Tortador himself, quite "contento," The encoret,
which weren't taken, the bouquets that leere, and the applause
on all hands quite reoalled the ''palmy" days of Covent Garden
Opera. In those palmy days the palms were white- gloved; perhaps
the applause was not so real as now, when there is "very little
kid" about it.
The Opera Season so far starts well, and Miss McIntybe has made
a decided hit.
Thursday, 17.— Vbbdi's Traviuta. Favourable verdict on Vebdi
emphasised and Anglo-Italicised. The opera has never been so per-
fectly plaot-d on the stage. To-night, under the personal superin-
tendence of Augustus Druriolanus principals and chorus looked
thoroughly Harriu'd, but not in the least distressed. Miss Ella
Kussell as Violetta, the suffering soprano, was charming, and
physiologically looked anything but consumptive; but she was, and
frequently I felt inclined to hand her up a box of cough lozenges
instead of a bouquet. Once in the course of the evening, her chair,
overoome by the weight of woe, gave way, and poor Violetta
was more upset than ever. Mr. Randeqgku conducted himself
and the orchestra most properly. M. D'Andrade was old daddy
Oermont, melodious but prosy; and Signor Kavelli was Oermont
junior, dear little Alfredo, the tender tenor. The opera went off with
great Mat—a fact due, among other causes, to the amount of powder
used in the piece. The supper scene was superb. The Realistic Drama
could no further go, for there was real supper, whioh the chorus and
supper-numeraries were really eating: and there was no sham about
the " cham" itself, whioh was real, and which they were really drink-
ing. No doubt it was Pommery '74 — notioed, as the bad Boulangerites
had it, for Augustus Dkukiolanus doesn't do the thing by halves
when he goes in for it, and there are one or two on the Operatio
Organising Committee who know good wine when they taste it.

THE HANGLODANNI8H XHIBISHUN.
With that usual good luck as alien atends the owdaoious, I has
got ingaged at the Hanglodannish Xhibishun in my hold oapassity,
and, as I fondly hopes, with the same sattisfactery results all round.
I was of coarse at both of the hopenings, for what I says is, "When
you gets a hopening, make the most of it," an I did bo, and allwiss
shall do so, and ave done so.
Who hever heard of Mr. Saximon till about a munth ago, and who
won't have heard of him in about another week Y It appears that a
Mr. Sammon, who is the habel Secretary of The Inkurabels (a nobel
oharrity), was a sailing along close to the City of Denmark when it
suddenly struck bim that as they was wery much in want of a lot of
money for the nobel hinstitution afoursaid, what a grand idear it
wood be to hinjaioe sum of the poor but most clean looking people ma
he was a passing by in his ship, to cum over to hold England and
bring their tidy cottages with 'em, jest to show us what a nice set
they was where our Prinoess of Whales came from.
He had plenty of time to think hout his nobel idea while he was a
tumbling about in the Danish Sea, and dreckly he oum home he
set to work and, with the abel asistanoe of Mr. Trundle, who
heverybody nose, we now sees the grand results. And a most
hinteresting site it is. Ah, if all our own pore English and Irish
Labourers had such nice neat and clean cottages to five in, what an
appy lot woud there's be I
But of course that ain't the only site for to see. Why there's a
spessimen of how they travels up and down their snowy mountains
in that partickler cold country as makes you amost warm ony to look
at. Up hill.and down dale they gos like a flash of lightning, and I
didn't see one single sole tumbel off. And then they have brought
over with 'em a sample of their sno mountings themselves as is jest
like life, and whioh was so jolly reel that on the nite of the fust
hopening that it quite akounnted not "for the milk in the Koko
nut," as the sayin is, but for the air outside witch was pennytrating,

With a sequel humanity dreads to divine.

And Justice this time is not utterly shamed.

THE CHURCHYARD OVERCOAT. — This stylish Noveltv,
owing, as it does, its attractive and appropriate title to the
faot that the grinding and miserable pittance paid for its production
entails starvation, premature disease, and death, on most of the
miserably struggling wretches who are engaged in the work, is now
being supplied by enterprising Middlemen, to well-known West-End
Tailoring Emporiums, in large quantities.
THE CHURCHYARD OVERCOAT is patronised largely bv the
dashing City Clerk, who,, solely anxious to obtain a Snowy
Artiole at a oheap figure, is callous alike as to its origin and
antecedents.
HE CSURCHYARD OVERCOAT is occasionally purohased by
the totally unsuspecting Member of Parliament.
THE CHURCHYARD OVERCOAT has even been supplied by
his highly respeotable West-End tailor to the quite unconsoious
Peer, who nas worn it conspicuously in the Upper House of the
Legislature.
THE CHURCHYARD OVERCOAT is being turned out daily
at the East-End, in the midst of misery ana death, and is pro-
viding the usual middlemen with a handsome profit, but, owing to
the starvation price that is paid for its production, it oan be offered
to the trade at a figure that will enable them, in dealing with it, to
do a highly luorative business.

Premier. Well, my friends, I really think we are getting on! Did yon

War Secretary. Splendid! His Royal Highness is becoming quite an
orator. By the way, how would it do to buy that land on Wimbledon Common
behind the butts, and utilise it for a fortress, say in defence of Manchester?
First Lord of Treasury. Expensive work, I am afraid, but still it would
be nice to keep the National Rifle Association in its old home. But you said
yon were getting on nicely, as how?
Premier. Well, I think we have all but made up'our minds that a
magazine-rifle is absolutely necessary for the troops, eh P
War Secretary (hesitating). Yes, I think so. I am afraid, however, we
are coming to a conclusion rather hurriedly. You must remember not one
of us began to consider the matter seriously until about six years ago.
Premier (with some show of decision). Ah, I really think we must take it
as settled. You see we have reaohed a oriels. And now, assuming that we
are to have the magazine-rifle, how long will it take to arm our Regular
Forces and Volunteers with it?
War Secretary. At our present rate of manufacture ?—I think I may
assume that we cannot increase on our present speed of production, eh P
Premier. Certainly; oh, certainly.
War Secretary. Well, then, at our present rate "of manufacture, we ought
to be able to let most of the Regular Army, a part of the Militia, and some
of our Volunteers, have the magazine-ritle by the end of three years.
Premier. Come, that is very satisfactory—very satisfactory, indeed. It is
rather a pity that so many of our big ships should be floating helplessly about
because we can give them no guns. And I suppose some day we ought really
to consider seriously how to get horses for our cavalry. But, taking every-
thing into consideration, it is most satisfactory, and all we have to do in the
meanwhile is to jog along quietly and cozily, and, if passible, keep out of
foreign complications. Very, satisfactory indeed!
Mr. Punch (suddenly appearing). What is satisfactory, my LordP
_ Premier. Dear Mr, Punch, how you startled me! I was saying that my
right honourable friend, the Secretary for War, is satisfied that we can get
quite a number of magazine-rifles manufactured by the end of three years;
or, at any rate, by the end of five years.
Mr. Punch [severely). Five years 1 Why, five months
would be more than sufficient to give every soldier wearing
Her Majesty's uniform the new weapon, if you went to work
with adequate energy.
Premier. Adequate energy 1 Why, we are very energetio I
War Secretary. 'Pon my word, we are almost too fast I
First Lord of Treasury. We have such a sense of duty,
you know, that we absolutely gallop through our work 1
Mr. Punch. Silence I I repeat that, in four or five

CHANNEL BRIDGE TALK.
From the Conversation Book of the distant Future.
It quite surprises me to hear that a second-class ticket
across the bridge costs £9 17s.
Dear me I And even at that rate is the Company able to
pay the original 12 per oent. Debenture-holders only one per
cent, per annum on the Forty-Nine Millions sterling they
have sunk in the undertaking P
I almost wish I had determined to cross from Dover to
Calais in the halfpenny boat.
Certainly the wind is very strong at this elevation above
the surface of the sea.
That four-wheeler that is ahead of us can scarcely cross
the bridge safely in this hurricane.
Ah 1 I thought so 1 There it goes, horse and all, plump
into the middle of the Channel!
Why, I do believe that ironclad has run into the piles of
the pier we have just passed, and has knocked it over.
_ Good gracious 1 is it really a fact that the tornado has car-
ried away the three arohes just in front of us, bodily P
It is very awkward to be fixed here in the middle of the
Channel, unable either to go forward or to retrace one's steps.
I am beginning, in the present situation, to realise the utility
of the Places of Refuge, watch-houses, and alarm-bells,
referred to in the original prospectus. I really do not think
I can climb down the 160 feet of iron network to reach the
boat that has come to take us off.
It is to be devoutly hoped that this rope will not break
before I get to the bottom.
Thank Goodness, I am safe on shore onoe again, and am
well of the Channel Bridge.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, May 14.—Lively night in
both Houses. In Lords, Oar Only General replied to Markiss's
attack of Friday last. Explained that when at the famous Pender
dinner he had spoken of English Statesmen as "deprived of the
manly honesty whioh was onoe their characteristic," and as being
"influenced by a low and vicious standard of morality," had not
meant anything personally offensive to present Government. Refer-
ence, in fact, rather meant to be complimentary. At to what he had
•aid on state of Army and Navy, that he stnok to. Markiss thought
apology very handsome. All ended happily.
In Com mons, Solicitor-General for Ireland delivered striking
speeoh in debate on Tim Hkaly'b Privilege Motion. Irish Members
say that before he came to House, Solicitor-General had honest Irish
brogue. Now, straggling against suspicion, has hit upon most
remarkable pronunciation heard since Dundreary Peerage extinot.
Leading peculiarity is to pronounce "er" as if spelled " aw A," the
syllable being delivered with sort of explosion like drawing a tight
oork. Took verbatim note of opening sentences of to-night's speech.
Naturally resolve themselves into poetio form:—
"Mr. Deputy SpeaknieA.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Solicitor-General, red as turkey-cock, gazed angrily round hilarious
House, wondering what was the meaning of this unseemly laughtatoA.
Debate incidentally furnished Hakcotjrt with opportunity for
paying off old scores. Question of privilege arose on letter from
resident Magistrate announcing John Dillon's conviotion "for
taking part in the Flan of Campaign." Tim Hf.aly demurred to
this way of putting it. "Taking part in Flan of Campaign," he
said, "not offence known to law. Gorst put up to endeavour to
get Government out of this fresh hole, dug by irrepressible resident
Magistrate. Said Magistrate had simply "adopted popular language
intelligible to the Speaker." Haecoukt quickly saw opportunity,
and made most of it. Has an accumulated debt against Courtney,
who, as Deputy Speaker, has more than onoe called him to order.
Paid him off now.
"Sir," he said, turning to Courtney, "this is a pretty defence.
The Under Secretary for India says that letter was couched in
popular language likely to be intelligible to you. This insult is
offered to the House of Commons in order to meet the feebleness of
the comprehension of the Deputy Speaker."
Courtney squirmed, but could say nothing. No mistaking triumph
of Harcoubt's tone, or intention of his gestures. But perfectly in
order. Courtn k y accordingly could only smile, and smile, and be a
Deputy SpeakatcA.
Business done. — King - Harman Belief Bill in Committee.
Heneage's Amendment, charging salary on revenues of Lord-Lieu-
tenant and Chief-Secretary rejected by majority of eight in Houee
of 374; dangerously narrow tqueak.
Tuesday Night.—Closure reached its climax. Climbed up pretty
well when Joseph Gillis at critical moment shut up Old Morality.
To-night Sage of Queen Anne's Gate closured Bbadlaugh. Junior
Member for Northampton rising to continue debate on Motion giving
precedence to Imperial Defenoe Bill; Senior Member for Northampton
moved question be now put. Put it was, and Bbadlaugh peremp-
torily shut up. Coolness since sprung up between these eminent
statesmen which may have important effects on history of England.
Sitting sharply divided into two epochs. First with crowded
benohes, animated speeches, resounding cheers and counter-cheers,
discussed order of business with special reference to King-Harman
Belief Bill. Epooh second: empty benohes; Old Morality on his
legs; dead silence, broken only by rustle of yawns. Subjeot under
discussion, Imperial Defences, and expenditure of Three Millions and
a Half sterling.
House doesn't do this sort of thing by halves. Makes no pretence
of preference for business. Soon as ever fireworks over and work
began, benohes cleared. House so
empty that, whilst Price was discus-
sing proposals for convoying merohant
fleets in time of war, House nearly
counted out.
Depressing effeot upon Bobby Spen-
cer. Bobby's gay young life been
ohanged by iron hand of fate. Went
to bed one night a frivolous
flutterer around the Parlia
mentary flower - garden;
awoke next morning a serious
politician. Duke of West-
«iNSTER did it. Asked Bobby
to dinner on a Wednesday.
Bobby occupied Tuesday in
dining at Eighty Club with
Pabnell. Hearing this, Dnka
formally withdraws invita-
tion. The babbling current
of Bobby's life changed.
Thinks of lowering his collar
and growing a beard. Has
already abandoned pretty
triok of turning up his trou- 'yf/j
sers over spotless patent •"•
leather boots, and has bought
an umbrella suited to ohanged
circumstances.
"All very well," he says,

A Serious Politician.
"in days of my youth, when I was what I may call an Irresponsible
Butterfly. Now, when it has become a question of State where I
dine, and ducal dovecotes are fluttered at sound of the name of a
fellow guest, must behave as such."
Pity the Duke took it that way. Was always such a pleasant
thing to have Bobby buzzing around, oonvoying his noble brother
about the House, standing him a bun and a glass of sherry at the
bar, keeping Gladstone well informed on the current of publio
opinion, and with all the cares of a division sitting lightly on his
young shoulders. As Harcoubi says, "One must needs be a Duke
to take Bobby seriously."
Business done.—In Committee on Imperial Defence Bill.

Wednesday.—Met Joseph Gillis leaving House early. Says
he's going to dine to-night at house dinner, National Liberal Club.
Going home to dress. Bought an orchid to wear in button-hole.
Doesn't see why Cha.mbkrt.atn should have
all the good things. Lord Spencer, K.G.,
to be in the Chair; Tay Pay in Vioe-Chair.
"What a happy oombination!" I said.
"Suppose it's arranged to do special honour
to Spencer?"
"No," said Joseph Gillis, gently but
firmly, opening orchid with his forefinger.
"Fact is, some talk of National Liberal
Club being hard up. So they invited Spen-
cer to preside, with Tay Pay in Vioe-Chair,
to show they can make both ends meet."
Business done.—Jesse Codlings—Cod-
lings the friend of the Agricultural Labourer
not Gladstone—moved Second Reading of
Small Holdings Bill. Conservatives much
interested in Bill; discussed it so earnestly
that Muntz talked it out.
Thursday. — Courtnei's early training
stands him in good stead. (Not generally
known, I think, Chairman of Committees
brought up for stage. Rather promising
Romeo.) His great feat of quick changing
already noted. Now, in absence of Speaker,
doubles his part every night. Takes the
Chair when the House meets; sits there
through questions; when House gets into
Committee, steps down to plaoe 'at table,
and officiates as Chairman of Committees.
Great hit of the evening is, when, as
Chairman of Committees, he reports pro-
gress to himself as Deputy Chairman. Usual thing, when pro-
gress reported, for Speaker to be brought in. Takes the Chair.
Chairman of Committees stands at his right hand, and reports
progress. In doubling part, Courtney has first to get himself into
Chair as Deputy Chairman, and then, standing at his own right hand
as Chairman of Committees, report progress. How it is done secret,
like his famous feat of changing his dress behind Speaker's chair,
But 'tis well done, and quickly. Since Dr. Blimber's eldest pupil
used to write letters addressed to "P. Toots, Esq., Brighton, Sussex,"
nothing been seen like Courtney reporting progress to himself.
Summers, who has grown quite desperate since John Bright
attaoked him for his appearance at Huddersfield side by side
with T. D. Sullivan, had Balfour up. Balfour, having a
holiday on Wednesday night, went out to make a speech, inci-
dentally alluded to Coroner's Jury at Mitohelstown as " oorrupt."
Summers challenges him with this. Balfour apologetic Not
certain he used the word, or if he
did, didn't mean it. Hopes House £&//~<r^
will accept his correction.
"When he said Jury was cor- *
rupt, he meant to say that it was
incompetent and worthless."
That makes it so much nicer for
Mitohelstown jurors.
"Very good," said
Trevelyan, "but not
quite original. Remem-
ber what Dr. Johnson

THE DIARY OP A NOBODY.
April ;>.—Commenced the morning badly. The butcher whom we decided
not to arrange with, called and blackguarded me in the most uncalled-for
manner. He began by abusing me, and saying he did not want my custom. I
simply said, "Then what are you making all this fuss about it for?" and he
shouted out at the top of his voice so that all the neighbours could hear, "Pah,
go along; ugh! I could buy up 'things' like you by the' dozen!" I shut the
door, and was giving Carrie to understand that this disgraceful scene was
entirely her fault, when there was a violent kicking at the door, enough to
break the panels. It was the blackguard butoher again, who said he had out
his foot over the scraper, and would immediately bring an action against me.
Called at Farmkrbqn'b, the ironmonger, on my way to town, and gave him the
job of moving the scraper, thinking it scarcely worth while to trouble the land-
lord with such a trifling matter. Arrived home tired and worried. Planted
some mustard and cress and radishes, and went to bed at nine.
April 10.—Farmerson came round to attend to the scraper himself. He
seems a very civil fellow. He says he does not usually conduct such small
jobs personally, but for me he would do so. I thanked him and went to town.
It is disgraceful how late some of the young clerks are at arriving. I told
three of them that if Mr. Perkupp, the principal, heard of it, they might be
discharged. Pin, a monkey of seventeen who has only been with us six weeks,
told me "to keep my hair on I" I informed him I had had the honour of
being in the firm twenty years, to whioh he insolently replied that I "looked
it." I gave him an indignant look and said, " I demand from you some
respect, _ Sir." He replied, "All right, go on demanding." I would not
argue with him any further; you cannot argue with people like that. In the
evening Go win a called and repeated his complaint about the smell of paint.
G owing is sometimes very tedious with his remarks, and not always cautious;
and Carrie onoe very properly reminded him that she was present.
April 11.—Mustard and cress and radishes not come up yet. To-day was
a day of annoyances. I missed the quarter-to-nine 'bus to the City, through
having words with the grocer's boy, who for the second time had the imper-
tinence to bring his basket to the hall-door, and leaving the marks of his dirty
boots on the fresh-oleaned door-steps. He said he had knocked at the side
door with his knuckles for a quarter of an hour. I knew Sarah, our servant,
could not hear this as she was upstairs doing the bedrooms, and asked the boy
why he did not ring the bell? He replied that he did pull the bell, hut the
handle came off in his hand. I was half an hour late at the office, a thing that
has never happened to me before. There has recently been much irregularity
in the attendance of the clerks, and Mr. Perkupp, our principal, unfortunately
chose this very morning to pounce down upon us early. Someone had given
the tip to the others; the result was that I was the only one late of the lot.
Buckling, one of the senior clerks, was a brick, and I was saved by his inter-
vention. As I passed by Pitt's desk, I heard him remark to his neighbour,
"How disgracefully late some of the head olerks arrive." This was of course
meant for me. I treated the observation with silence, simply giving him a look
whioh unfortunately had the effect of making both of the olerks laugh.
Thought afterwards it would have been more dignified if I had pretended not to
have heard him at all. Cummengs called in evening, and we played dominoes.
April 12.—Mustard and oress and radishes not come up yet. Left Farm erbon
repairing the scraper, but when I came home found three men working. I ask the
meaning of it, ana Farmerson said that in making a fresh hole he had penetrated
the gas-pipe. He said it was a most ridiculous place to put the gas-pipe, and the
man who did it evidently knew nothing about bis business. I felt his excuse
was no consolation for the expense I shall be put to. In the evening, after
tea, Cowing dropped in, and we had a smoke together in the breakfast parlour.
Carrie joined us later, but did not stay long, saying the smoke was too much
for her. It was also rather too much for me, for Go wing had given me what he
called a green cijrar, one that his friend Shoekach had just brought over from
Amerioa. The oigar didn't look green, but I fancy I must have done so, for when
I had smoked a little more than half, I was obliged to retire on the pretext of
telling Sarah to bring in the glasses. I took a walk round the garden three or
four times, feeling the need of fresh air. On returning Go win a notioed I was
not smoking: offered me another cigar, whioh I politely declined. Gow in g began
his usual sniffing, so, anticipating him. I said, Youre not going to complain of
the smell of paint again P" He said, 'No, not this time; but I '11 tell you what
—I distinctly smell dry rot." I don't often make jokes, out I replied, "You're
talking a lot of dry rot yourself." I could not help roaring at this, and Carrie
said her sides quite ached with laughter. I never was so immensely tickled by
anything I have ever said before. I actually woke up twioe during the night and
laughed till the bed shook.
Bad Style.—" If there is one thing more than another irrigates me," says
Mrs. Ham, "it's to see people mixing their tongues." She instances the
familiar quotation, " Chacun a ion gout." "Why not put it all in French, or
all in English P Or, if this medley of languages must be used, why not say,
1 Chacun a ton rheumatism,' or ' Chacun a ton neuralgia' P" These com-
plaints, Mrs. R. affirms, are quite as common as gout.
Propositions and Riders.—Why not make a few rides under the shady trees
through Kensington Gardens, and connect Kensington with Bayswater P Who
objeots? Whv not more Rotten Rows across Park, from Park Lane side to
Bayswater? Who oan out these Gordian Why-Nots P '' George Ranges " P

MR. PUNCH'S GREAT DERBY CRYPTOGRAM.
Donnei,lt be — dephlogisticated! His
"Mammoth Mare's Nest" (as the Spectator
o ills) it) is very small
potatoes indeed com-
pared with an idea
which strnok Mr.
Punch. Mr. Don-
nelly labours
through some thou-
sand pages to prove
that Bacon wrote
Shakspeare, and hid
an avowal of the fact
something more than
"fathom deep" in
the arithmetical fog
of folios. And hardly anybody will read
him. Mr. Punch, who has a free pass to the
Shades, hit upon the splendid notion of get-
ting Bacon and Shaksfeare to collaborate
in an article for his pages, whioh should
contain as a veritable "open secret" the
name of the Derby Winner for 1888 I I!
And everybody will read—and profit by—
Aim. Here's the result I
If all Mr. Punch's readers after its perusal
don't win piles off the coming race—but
there, they are Punch's readers, whioh of
course means that they are the wisest,
brightest, but not meanest of mankind. The
boxes of Cabanas and oases of '74 Champagne
whioh will orowd Mr. Punch's sanctum for
some days after the Derby, will sufficiently
demonstrate that! Bacon begins:—
ON RACING.
As Kaoing hath pertinently been entitled
"the Sport of Kings," so might it with rqual
fitness be called "the King of Sports." Youth
loveth it, manhood rejoiceth in it, and age
gossipeth thereof by the chimney-corner.
Rating, like Love, levelleth all. Shopboy and
Prince are at one in interest and in hope on
one day at least of the year. "How not r" as
the interlocutors of Sochates have a habit of
asking. It is the Day when the Derby is run!
Rbgiomontanus's prediction, "Octogesimus-
octavus mirabilis annus" (Eighty-eight a won-
derful year) will be fulfilled. Eighty-eight
hath produced this propheoy, and the equine
wonder—and winner—whose name it enig-
matically enshrineth. As to betting on horse-
races,—marry, there's the rub I
To bet or not to bet,—that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in a man to gobble
The Derby luncheon without tempting fortune,
Or take the odds upon a dark outsider,
And so spoil one's digestion. To punt—to plunge,
No more; and by one lucky bet to end
The heartache and the thousand bills and bothers
Poverty's heir to,—'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To punt—to plunge;—
To plunge ! perchance to lose :—ay, there's the rub.
For from that plunire what awful dreams may come
When we have shuffled off our Derby togs,
Must give us pause; there's the consideration
That makes us long for an infallible prophet I
For who would bear false " tips " of sporting touts,
The Welsher's wrong, the Advertiser's snares,
The pangs of backing wrong 'uns all the day,
The insolence of bookies, and the spurns
The patient juggins of the sharper takes,
When he might winners spot and make his pile
With a bare monkey } Who would ever bear
To fret and fume about a " morning wire,"
But that the off-chance of a stunning " coup,"
Some undiscovered " System," with whose use
No chap can ever lose, puzzles the will,
And makes us take the bogus tips we have,
Hoping for " morals" that we know not of.
Let the egregious Donnelly deoipher this
cryptogram, and decide, if he can, the respto-
tive shares of "Sweet Will" and facile
Francis therein. A world charmed or bitten
by the new game of Cryptogram-hunting may,

what a charming performance that was
last season with Miss Arnoldson in
the part, and M. Maurfx as the

expectancy. House full by 815 in
consequence of the Timet haying

been fortunate enough to find the one person in London who can and
will ring the part of Donna Elvira!" (We breathe again!
........ again
Wonderf ul person, Dbubiolanus! We imagine him driving at fire'
engine speed—perhaps on a fire-engine—all over London, routing up
Elviras—trying them, discarding them, and finding the right one at
last) "A lady," continues the Pale and Small One, brightening up
a bit, " who, as a matter of fact" (here he becomes quite confidential).
"has made a great success with this very part in St. Petersburgh"
—with which encouraging announcement he pulls himself well
together, bows in a familiar bnt withal respectful manner to the
audienoe, and retires amidst applause.
"Name I Name!" shout voices of inquisitive people, who insist on
knowing so muoh. Whereupon the Announcer returns at once, and
in a pleasant, casual sort of way, apologises for having quite forgot
to mention that the lady's name is Rolla—Madame Rolla. The
Apologist seems as pleased with his second appearance, as if he had
taken an encore.
The name of Rolla suggests Pizarro, Cora, and the child, in
Sheridan's old play. When Madame Rolla does appear, she is
most heartily received by a grateful audienoe who thank her for
having " kindly oonsentea to oblige." Pretty face, majestio presenoe,
plays and sings admirably; and how she fits into her place without a
rehearsal is a mystery. Piquante Miss Abnoldson, charming as
Zerlina, but Signor D'Andrade (why not Irishise it as Dan
Drady ?) too Hamletty for the gay Don. He picks himself up over
the immortal serenade, and the audienoe forgive and encore
him vociferously. Everybody delighted with Signor Ravelli's " II
mio tesoro," as also with the great trio of masks, before the Ball
Room scene, with Mmes. Fursch-Madi, Rolla, and Signor
Ra villi. Don Giovanni evidently had an eye for what Mr. Manta-
lini would have called "Demnition fine Duohesses," for certainly
the two oruelly-deoeived ladies of title, as personated by Mmes.
Fursch-Madi and Rolla, represent " Quality and Quantity." Miss
MoIirrTBB wouldn't have been half a Duchess compared with Madame
FivRScn-MADr. Signor Ciampi as funny as ever as Masetto; Signor
Navabstni's Leporello a trifle cumbrous. The Ball and supper
magnificent.
Altogether an eventful evening. I am particularly interested in
watching the new arrival, Madame Rolla, through my opera-
glasses. I am "all eyes," so. to speak—(at least, it's better nod
"so to speak," as it gives opportunity to Wagstaff to say, "Oh,
are you r Thought you were all ears 1" Must be always on
guard with Wagstaff present)—but unfortunately a man in the
stall just in front of me is all head and shoulders. If I sit up, I can't
see over him; I can never see through him; and he is of so restless a
-w wiw uuu , a uau never eee mrougn mm; ana lit
disposition, that he is either leaning to the left, to make remarks to
his neighbour, or swaying to the right, to obtain a particular view of
the stage. When he moves to right, I move to left, and net versa;
only as I cannot oaloukte on the exaot moment of his changing
his position, I pan never once get more than a momentary glimpse
of the stage. Finally give it up as a bad job. At last in the middle
of the Second Aot his head droops . . . thank Goodness, he sleeps,
and I obtain an uninterrupted view of stage. {Happy Thought
suggestion for Druriolantu and Organising Committee.—-Tall men
oughtn't to be admitted into front rows. Every opera-goer
patronising the stalls should be measured for a tioket. All the tall
men at the back and the shortest in front.)
After Seoond Aot great excitement. From the lobby I hear audi-
ence making a noise. What has happened? Another apologyf
I rush to stall entrance. What is it f Anyone ill P No. Only
first appearance this season of black oat. It crosses the stage, it
visits three private boxes, and is at last kindly taken care of by a
gentleman in the stalls. Waqstaff said he thought it was Katti
Lanner. Equanimity restored. As I have already remarked, "An
eventful evening," and Miss McIntyre not missed.
Tuesday.—Albani perfect as \OHda in Rigoletto. Sad Opera
Rigoletto. Melancholy finish always makes me unhappy. The
Quartette in last Aot of course encored, and so was Signor Kavelli's
"La Donne e Mobile." This is, up to now, the best thing Ravelu
has done. Madame Zkpptxli Villaht, the new contralto, is likely to
be popular. The choruses magnificent, and once more, as to the
mise-en-scene, Druriolantjs is outdoing himself. Another eventful
night,—no bouquets 11 New departure, this.
Thunday. — Madame Melba di-huted, and Signor Cotogm
rentrS'd. Opera, Lucia di Lammermoor. Scotch Opera,—Hiss
McInttrk ought to have been in it, but. as it is, Miss Melba from
Melbourne (real name Armstrong, and more power to her elbow! ")
was a great sucoeis. Bouquets to-night. Scotch Chorus first-
rate, and Scotch mist-en-scene admirably arranged by Augustus
Haggis. Signor Ravilli (getting better and better histrionically)
appeared as Edgar, and sang his dying song like a swan.
Saturday— See ''Oar Next"
DOGBERRY'S DIARY.
Monday.—Notice of crime about to be committed at No. 13, Lonely
Lane, handed in at office. Residents appeal for protection. Set
watch immediately. Special officers told off. Some in disguise. All
surround house. Some watching from neighbouring house-tops.
Nothing nor nobody can escape our vigilant eye.
Tuesday.—Odd! Burglary and murder been committed at No. 13.
Most extraordinary. Sent men in all directions. Somebody, by the
way, who,—corresponds to the description given by the residents of the
suspicious-looking party,—called with information at office. Sergeant
Verges took down his name and address, and promised to call as soon
as possible. Man not since been seen. Can't help repeating, odd!
Wednesday.—Scouring the country for miles round. Made four-
teen arrests. One man confessed his guilt.
Thursday.—Thirteen arrested people discharged and cautioned.
They thanked the police, and testified to the great care taken of them
in the cells. Fourteenth party, who confessed his guilt, is now sober,
and asks what it's all about, and where he is. His friends visit
him. He is discharged. Twenty arrests made before 9 r.sr.
Friday.—The twenty people arrested have been discharged without
a stain upon their character. The criminal is somewhere about
Saturday, Sunday, Monday.—Still scouring country. The criminal,
of whose description we have isssued exaot descriptions, was last seen
at a public-house within the radius of Charing Cross. The barmaid
suspeoting something wrong from the way in which he drank his
beer, communicated with the police, who, after carefully taking down
her statement, and giving her the usual oaution, went in company with
her to the public-house. The landlord, after some resistance, was
arrested; also, barmaid. They were not detained in custody beyond
a few hours, and both thanked the police for the kindness and con-
sideration with which they had been treated at the station-house.
Criminal still at large.
Six days afterwards.—Criminal more at large than ever. Several
burglaries have been committed by him, and in each case he has left
a note for the police with a parcel enclosing description of his latest
disguise, and a photograph. Not to be put on false scent by this.
Friday.—Made several more arrests.
Saturday. — Arrested persons discharged, and cautioned that
whatever they say will be used against them.
Tuesday.—It is just three months to-day since the crime at No. 13,
Lonely Lane, was committed. Criminal last seen talking to Detective
Sharp, who was in disguise at the time. It is believed that Detectivc
Sharp told him, incautiously, who he was. Neither of them has
been seen since. There is some mystery here.
Six Months later.— Criminal of No. 13, Lonely Lane, still more at
large than ever. Sure to turn up some time or other. Shall wait
Public interest in case died out. More important oases demand instant
attention.
Prettt Sight.—At Oxford and Cambridge. Meeting of "The|
Coaches." Date uncertain.

and, as I had seen photographs of him, directly I set eyes on him
I recognised his liniments."

lie addition to all I disoribed larst week, there's a rioter Gallery
as will cstonish a good menny of our own Painters. Sum on 'em I calls
reel staggerers, and quite diffrent from
any that I ever seed afore. For instance
there's 1 or 2 that made me that mel-
lanoolly to think of what sum peeple has
to go through, and the kind of life as
sum peeple has to live, as made meurry
out into the blessed sunshine jest for a

"O contrare," as the Germans says,
there's one lovely little boy a setting j
hunder a tree all as naked as Master
Kupid hisself, a trying for to piok a
most butiful Rose' off a great big tree.
He tries to look as if he rather liked it

was about it, to choose suoh a jolly ool<
nite for the hopening day as to make us think as we was really in
Denmark, where, as we all know, even Amlet said as the hair bited
so rudely as to make it werry cold; but I think, as fur as I was con-
serned, I shud ha liked it jest a leetle warmer.
There's a nice little Theater bin bilt up in the Garden, and if what
I was told by one of the Gentlemen of the Press,—and I allers beleeves
all as they says, just the same as 1 does all as they rites—was true,
that little Theater will be that sorowged ewery heavening that it
will posserbly bust. He aoshally told me as they means to play one
haot of the Tragedy of Amlet, the part of Amlet by the reel Prince
of Denmark! at the speshul request of his butiful Sister.
Grayshus Goodness I what a idear! and the charge for admission
is to be 1 Ginny for a reel Lady, and 2 Ginnys for a reel Gentleman,
and no one else ain't to be slowed to henter not at no price.
I have herd of one rich person, who is not considered to be quite a
reel Gennelman, as has hoffered to give a hundred ginnys to be
alio wd to haot as one of the Hoflicers in the Play. I am harf promised
that praps I may be allowd to carry a Banner, but my hopes
scarce haspires to so giddy a hight.
One of the Denmarkish Sailers as speaks a little Inglish, told me
as they thinks notbink of catching half a dozen whales of a morning
before breakfast. I didn't understand what he ment when he torked
of their sticking Sharp Poons into the poor things to make 'em blubber.
Considring what a remarkabel jolly cold country Denmark looks to
be, I 'm sumwhat disappinted at the werry few new Drinks as they
has brort over with 'em. Memory looks back with fond delite to the
grand old times last year, when Btjfferlow Bill and his Satterlites
introduced me to a new Drink for ewery day in the year, xoept, of
coarse, Sundays, when in coarse nobody don't want no drinks, or if
they is werry uncommon thirsty they can repeat Saturday's. Can I
ever forgit my sensashuns when I fust tasted " White Tiger's Milk!"
or the "Flash of Lightning," or the "Parson's Delight!" or, far
above all, the " Yard of Flannel!" Never! or my enwious estonish-
ment at seeing the Savages of the Wild West toss off three of them
"Nock-me-down" Drinks in suoksession without winking! All,
them was grand times, them was, which has gorn, I fears, never to
return! I shall try and get a peep at the Etaliens, close by, to see
what they can do in that line. Robert.
A SURREY SITE.
Mr. Alexander Macmillan. the well-known publisher, has given
his house and grounds, Knapdale, Upper Tooting, to the proposed
Suffragan Bishop of South London, which gift has been "gratefully
accepted." "Gratefully aooepted! "—rather! Why, who wouldn't
have gratefully accepted it, without being a Suffragan Bishop P
"Alexander the Grate-fully-aooepted" has done the thing well,
and has generously sacrificed the reposeful-sounding Knap-dale for
the rest of his days. To give a site like this is doubly valuable,
for "Bis dat qui site-o dat." But, in honour of the beneficent donor,
why not build on this site a splendid Cathedral for South London,
after the model of the grand duomo of Milan, and call it the
Cathedral of McMillan ?" Yell," as a Foreign Gentleman observed,
"the Bishop 'ave got der money,—dat is von ting; now he 'ave got
der house and ground of Knapdale,—dat is two ting." (Foreign
Gentleman subsequently caught, and sent back to his friends.)

'LE GRAND PRIX."
RARJE AVES.
{Poetry by Popjoy.)
Ween I was a youngster, the finest of fan
Was to roam fields and meadows and lanes with my gun,
Knocking over cock-robins and potting tomtits,
Blowing thrashes and blackbirds and linnets to bits.
Bat at birds somewhat bigger I now have a slap,
Pigeon-shooting at blue-rooks let loose from a trap;
Tis a pastime wherein a resource may be found,
Sport in season at any time, all the year round.
Birds of passage, rare strangers that visit our shore,
Wheresoever I find them I pop at and floor,
Hang the Wild Birds Protection Aot—that I defy I
At as many as oome in my way I've a shy.
Golden Oriole, Ring Ouzel, and Hoopoe to bag
Are exploits and achievements I boast of and brag.
If a Short-teed Lark ever should light on his way
Close enough, dead he drops, to my choke-bore a prey.
0 8t. James, at that Cormorant, come to thy Park,
Hid I only a ohance, 'twould have been a rare lark,
8o to speak without making a bit of a bull,
With sure aim, on the perch to have taken a pull!
And the grand Golden Eagle in Kent lately seen,
What a triumph to pepper—for sharpshooter keen,
Famous feat,. from the olouds, orack, with rifle to
bring
Down the soaring, scarce visitant, splendid Bird-King!
Obvious Erratum. — At a political meeting, Lord
George Hamilton delivered a statement of the amount
which the Government intended to expend annually in
strengthening the Navy:—
"This, he maintained, would keep us abroad of foreign
nations."
Has not a word been misreported in (he above quota-
tion? "Abreast?" 6urtlv what the noble Lord really
did say must have been " Ahead."

ARROWING ATTRACTION.
1HE SUICIDAL BALLOON ASCENT.
THE 8UICIDAL BALLOON ASCENT.— This unique and ghastly
feat already witnessed with oreeping awe by upwards of 200,000
shaddering people, will be repeated (the Authorities in the meantime
not intervening) again to-morrow afternoon, when the Champion
Aeronaut will make his daring ascent hanging on to a wire suspended
from the balloon by his eyelids.
THE SUICIDAL BALLOON ASCENT, appealing as it .does to
the most brutal, degraded, and savage instincts of a large
portion of the sight-seeing olasses of the British Public, is considered
a fitting and attractive item in the programme of a great popular
entertainment.
THE SUICIDAL BALLOON ASCENT presents the unquestion-
able advantage of placing the life of the performer in absolute
and terrible jeopardy.
THE SUICIDAL BALLOON ASCENT may furnish the on-
looking publio at any moment with the speotaole of an in-
describably appalling and horrible death.
THE SUICIDAL BALLOON ASCENT is made without the
slightest provision for any misadventure or accident
HE SUICIDAL^ALLOON ASCENT involves the performer,
who loses nerve for a single moment, in utter destruction
T
THE SUICIDAL BALLOON ASCENT is the result of the com-
petition of poor creatures anxious to create a sensation at any
risk, and enabled to do it through the absenoe of any paternal legisla-
tion protecting them from the consequences of their headlong temerity.
THE SUICIDAL BALLOON ASCENT will probably, if allowed
to continue with impunity, terminate in the dashing to pieces,
under circumstances too hideous to contemplate, of a living human
being.
THE SUICIDAL BALLOON ASCENT should, therefore, eDgage
the attention of the Home Secretary— and the sooner the better.
"GOOD OLD GRACE!"
[Playing for tho Gentlemen against the Australians last week, Mr. TV. Q.
Quack scored an innings of 165 runs. Later in the week the Flayers of
England beat the Australians by 10 wickets.]
Bravo, W. G. 1 'Tis a very prompt answer
To Punch's appeal of last week.
One hundred and sixty-five runs! That's the plan, Sir I
The moral is not far to seek.
You've scored off of Turner and Ferris like winking,
At Punch's especial desire;
And now there should be no more funking or shrinking,
Or failing in coolness or fire.
When that pair of smart Cornstalks let fly at our stumps,
As well they know how to let fly,
There is not the least need to be down in the dumps;
Think of Grace, boys, and never say die I
Before Orach had met them, and spanked them all round,
They really appeared bad to beat; [bound
But the Players—who whopped them—were oheered I'll be
By the thought of that Grace after meet I
A N«w Inspiration.—One of the Spectator1* poets, with no sig-
nature, in the number for May 26, wrote "The steadiest angel is a
woman's love." Now we know there are good angels and bad angels,
bat of the latter olass the poet is not speaking. Among the good
angels are there then some who are rather unsteady or shaky f This
poet probably knows; but the idea ef one angel being steadier than
another does open out a wide range of possibilities which might
account for a good many emtio movements. Of coarse all such
beings are invisible to ordinary mortals, and only seen by the Sjwc-
tator and his Inspired Poet.
A Long Farewell.
Madame Nhjsson has jast commenced bidding "farewell,"
But when she will finish < ne cannot quite telL
For " parting," as Shakspfare says, is "such sweet sorrow"
(And so says the lender to one who would borrow),
That Nilsbon may ssy it again and again,
And then may deoide (be it so) to remain.
Continue to sing while you can,—then, ma belle,
"One bumper at parting "— one brilliant farewell.

(The Story of a Shadow that should not end in Smoke.)
Mr. Punch was greatly pleased with all he had seen. He had
been to the head-quarters of the Fire Brigade on the south side of
the Thames, and had found everyone on the alert. The horses were
ready harnessed; the fireplaoes under the boilers filled with fuel,
and only waiting a match to set them alight; the men dressed and
wide awake, and prepared to start at a moment's notioe to go any-
where and to do everything. The organisation was perfect. London
was protected by a network of telegraph-wires. Communication was
established between the centre office and the outlying districts. Here
and there was a fire-escape with its attendant, able to proceed at
once to any point requiring immediate succour. Tke signal-posts,
too, were all in working order.
a Excellent I" exclaimed Mr. Punch. "The system seems to be
admirable 1" And as he spoke, six o'clock struck, and some of the
firemen got up, and prepared to go out.
"An alarm r" queried Mr. Punch.
"No, Sir," replied one of the Brigade; "we are off to help to take
the escapes back to their morning quarters."
"Morning quarters f
"To be sure. After six o'olock we presume that they will be no
further needed for immediate use, so we wheel them back to their
daily resting-plaoe. They are rather heavy, so some of our men are
sent to help."
"Rather risky," quoth Mr. Punch, gravely.
"Not much," was the reply, as a number of firemen departed.
_ Suddenly there was a glare of red light. The smoke rose in the
air, the flames made a crackling noise, and a huge pile of premises
were well a-light!
A loud cry was raised for the fire-escapes. It was useless—the
refuges had been removed.
Then the poor frightened inmates shouted for help. Once more a
vain appeal! The firemen were most of them away, assisting in the
removal of the escapes! Tide and time wait for no man—fire never
breaks an appointment; so the flames spread, and there was no
help! Some died at once, others lingered but to die!
,rHow is this, SirP" asked Mr. Punch, angrily. "Why were
you not prepared P"
"Please, Sir," explained the Chief, "it is not our fault—look at
the time," and he pointed to a clock. The hands stood at half-
past six.
"Not your fault 1" echoed Mr. Punch, once more severely.
"No, Sir. Ton see it is nearly seven; and it's against the regu-
lations for afire to break out after six o'clock!"
"This must be looked into 1" cried Mr. Punch.
And it must!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE,
In answer to numerous anxious in-
quiries as to why I have been so Ion?
silent, I can only reply that I have not had
a moment to spare for reading since I com-
menced my book on the Derby. The pro-
cess has oost me many sleepless nights
and a considerable amount ot ready cash.
Henceforth, I will read books, not make
them. I have now on my library table
The British Army, which, of course,
must be reviewed; The French Stage in
the Eighteenth Century, by Monsieur
Frederic Hawkins, uncommonly inte- I
resting, no doubt; History of the People
of Israel — in the 60 p*r century;
Twenty-five Years in a Waggon, which
sounds monotonous, and suggests a
series of "A Week in a Hansom,1'
"Fourteen Minutes in a Oroteler," "A
Fortnight in a Fly," and so forth. The
title of The Chronicles of Bow Street
Police Court, by Percy Fitzoebald, is
promising, though I do not remember
having often oome across his name in the
police reports. There are some oases, how-
ever, which are taken early, and do not
find their way into the daily journals
which dismiss them summarily with the usual line, "After the
ordinary night-charges had been disposed of, &c, &o." If there are
many startling tensations in it, Mr. Fitzoebald would do well to give
it a second title, "Fitt and Starts." Mr. Oliphant's Scientific
Beligim, must be Oliphantine. Mr. Fargkon's Miser Farebrother
is the only one I've been able to get through since reading that
light and airy work Robert Elsmere, but it does not represent Mr.
Fabgeon at his best, and he will, I hope, soon give us another which
will make novel readers sit up. Mrs. Hodgson Burnett's charming
story of Sarah Crew : or. What happened at Miss Minchin's, I've
read, and if I hadn't been entranced by Little Lord Fauntleroy first,
I should have been loud in praise of this book as I was of the latter.
For Kditha's Burglar I own I do not care; it is forced, but it makes
me thoroughly appreciate Mr. Vice-Versa-Quthrie's Burglar Bill,
whioh is one of the best among his subjeots for reciters. At present 1
can do no more than mention these names, and include among them
A Wanderer's Notes, by Beattt-Kingston, whose motto, as a Special

OPERATIC NOTES.
Saturday, May 26.— House crammed. Old times revived.
Lorgnettes in requisition. "Fops' Alley" restored. That is, if
Fops' Alley was up the middle and down again. Don't remember
Fops' Alley myself, only heard of it. Remember time when every
stall and box was identified with a somebody, and as a boy recollect
elderly gentlemen becoming quite nervous on a subscribers' night if
one of the stalls or a box was vacant.
t Madame Albani, as the Countest Almaviva in the Nozte diFigaro,
in] superb voioe. Countess not a great part; with one song (strenu-
ously encored but not taken) and a fair share of a sprightly duet with
Hiss Ella Russell as the coquettish Sutanna, in rather modern
Opira Bouffe style of costume, with dangerously high heels. Duet
arouses unwonted enthusiasm. Demand for encore. Albani raises
her eyebrows and implies, "Shall we?" Whereat Ella Russell
replies with graceful gesture, " If you will. It's for you to decide."
More applause. Albani gives in. Mr. Randkgger says, "Go on I"
and on we go. Delightful. Everyone pleased. Floral tributes. Pretty
to see Albani hand first bouquet to Ella Russell. Never lose by
politeness. Next bouquet is a better one, and Albani gets it.
Cotogni as Figaro—not quite a good rigger (01) fordanoing. Looks
as if good living and retirement on a pension in Count Almaviva't
servioe had told upon him. The Barber is not so active as he was.
Never mind. Charming music Miss Abnoldson looks the larky
young Cherubino to perfection. Will suggest to Toby that should
the House of Commons ever want to cast this Opera among them-
selves, Mr. Habbt Lawson or Mr. Bobbt Spencer would, either of
them, make a first-rate Cherubino. Neither of them so pretty as the
pitillante Abnoldson, but, as youths, each would look it and act it.
House thoroughly appreciates Abnoldson. Ravblli as the Count
counts much,
and scores
acohordingly.

intended to convey symbolically a moral before the Derby. Beware
of blacklt gs and gambolling. Austere critics raging wildly about the
unities. How dare Augustus introduce Webeb's musio into Mozart's

who appreciate the unqualified generosity of Augustus in giving them
Webeb when they'd only paid for Mozabt, applaud vehemently, and
the Curtain descends on a triumphant finale of Wozabt-ctth-Meber.
Monday.—Minnie Hauk as Carmen (Howk clever I), with Miss
McIntyke as the ingenuous simple maiden. Glad puir Scotch lassie
has recovered from the puir Scotch lassitude which prevented her
from singing in Don Giovanni. Signor Ravelli as Don Joti, a con-
siderable improvement on poor Db R ei ms. Ravelli grows on you; he
doesn't grow any taller, and both Minnie and Mack y—meaning Miss
Hauk and Miss McIntyre—have the advantage of him in height.
Saturday.—// Trovatore. This, by its name, II Trove a Tory,
ought to be a favourite Opera with Signor Chaplini, Count Carlo
B ekesformst, and other members of the Italian Organising Com-
mittee. II Trovatore himself was excellently Well Trovatore,
being sun; in first-rate style by Signor Ravelli, who received an
enthusiastic and thoroughly well-deserved ovation. As a working
tenor, Signor Ravelli is invaluable, for, up to to-night, and since
the early retirement of M. de Reims,—who must have been a native
of a very fiat country,—there has not been a single Opera, as far as
I am aware, in which Ravelli the Reliable has not appeared, and
won his way with an appreciative public. Then there is little Mile.
Battermkistte the Benevolent, whe seems to delight in doing good
work, and who, in the role of confidante to the soprano, is so deeply
sympathio and so strictly attentive to business, that, whether she
appears as a youthful gipsy in Carmen, pretty and sprightly, or as
the confidante already mentioned, or as a middle-aged lady in wait-
ing in some other Opera, doleful and demure, or as a genuinely
wicked old Dame Martha in Faust, it is always a pleasure to see
her, and recognise her dramatio talent. To insure success, no
Italian Opera Company should ever be without Bauebheisteb the
Benevolent and Ravelli the Reliable. Madame Scalchi, as usual,
first favourite as Axucena. Signor D'Andbade looked the "two-
pence coloured" part of the melodramatio Conte di Luna. Mile.
Mabguebtte Martini, at first hearing, struck me as rather like the
celebrated Betty Martini, who was famous for her rendering of the
great cavatina. "Al mi to." House crammed, Dbubiolanus de-
lighted, and everyone on their legs to assist in the National Anthem,
in honour of Her Majesty's birthday.

DIARY OF A NOBODY.
April 14.—Spent the whole of the afternoon in the garden, haying
this morning pioked up at a bookstall for flvepenoe a oapital little
book in good condition on Gardening. I procured and sowed
half-hardy Annuals in what I fancy
will be a warm sunny border. I thought

that all you wanted me for P" I said,
"Any other time you would have laughed

"Certainly—at any other time, but not
when I am busy in the house." The rest of the evening was'spent
in silence—both reading.
April 15, Sunday.—At three o'olook Cuiqungs and Gownro called
for a good long walk over Hampstoad and Finchley, and brought
with them a friend named Stlllbbook. We walked and chatted
together except Stillbrook, who was always a few yards behind us
staring at the ground and cutting at the grass with his stick. As it
was getting on for five, we four held a consultation, and Gownra
suggested that we should make for "The Cow and Hedge," and get
some tea. Stlllbbook said, "A brandy and soda was good enough
for him." I reminded them that all publio-houses were olosed till
six o'clock. Stlllbbook said, "That's all right—bond fide tra-
vellers." We arrived, and as I was trying to pass, the man in charge
of the gate said, "Where fromP" I replied, "HoUoway." He
immediately put up his arm, and declined to let me pass. 1 turned
back for a moment, when I saw Stillbrook, closely followed by
Cummings and Gowlng, make for theentranoe. I watohed them and
thought I would have a good laugh at their expense. I heard the
porter say, "Where from?" When to my surprise, in fact disgust,
Stillbrook' replied "Blaokheath," and the three were imme-
diately admitted. Gowlng oalled to me across the gate and said,
"We shan't be a minute." I waited for them the best part of an
hour. When they appeared they were all in most excellent spirits,
and the only one who made an effort to apologise was Mr. Still-
brook, who said to me, "It was very rough on you to be kept wait-
ing, but we had another spin for 8 and B's." I walked home in
silence. I couldn't speak to them. I felt very dull all the evening,
but deemed it advisable not to say anything to Carrie about the
matter.
April 16.—After business set to work in the garden. When it got
dark I wrote to Cummtngs and Gowlng (who neither called, for a
wonder; perhaps they were ashamed of themselves) about yester-
day's adventure at the "Cow and Hedge." Afterwards made up
my mind not to write yet.
April 17. —Thought I would write a kind little note to Gownro
and Cum Mings about last Sunday, and warning them against Mr.
Stillbrook. Afterwards, thinking the matter over, tore up the
letters, and determined not to write at all, but to speak quietly to
them. Dumfounded at receiving a sharp letter from Cumklngs,
saying that both he and Go wisg had been waiting for an explanation
of my (mind you, MY) extraordinary conduct coming home on
Sunday. At last I wrote, "I thought i" was the aggrieved party:
but as I freely forgive you, you, feeling yourself aggrieved, should
bestow forgiveness on me. I have copied this verbatim in the
diary, because I think it is one of the most perfect and thoughtful
sentences I have ever written. I posted the letter, but in my own
heart I felt I was actually apologising for having been insulted.
April 18.—Am in for a cold. Spent the whole day at the office
sneezing. In the evening, the cold being intolerable, sent Sabah
out for a bottle of Kinahan. Fell asleep in the arm-chair, and
woke with the shivers. Was startled by a loud knock at the front
door. Cabbie awfully flurried. Sarah still out, so went up, opened
the door, and found it was only Cummings. Remembered the grocer's
boy had again broken the side-bell. Coif m lngs squeezed my hand,
and said, "I've just seen Gowing. All right. Say no more about
it." There is no doubt they are both under the impression I have
apologised. While playing dominoes with CumiiNos in the parlour,
he said, "By the bye, do you want any wine or spirits P My oousin
Mebton has just set up in the trade, and has a splendid whiskey,
four years in bottle, at thirty-eight shillings. It is worth your
while laying down a few dozen of it." I told him my cellars, which
were very small, were full up. To my horror, at that very moment
Sabah entered the room, and putting a bottle of whiskey, wrapped
in a dirty piece of newspaper, on the table in front of us, said,'' Please.
Sir, the grocer says he ain't got no more Kinahan, but you '11 find
this very good at two-and-six with twopence returned on the bottle,
and please did you want any more sherry, as he has some at
and-three, as dry as a nut" II

MR. PUNCH'S GREAT DERBY CRYPTOGRAM.
Right again I From amongst the thousands of letters Mr. Punch
has received from those of his readers who have deciphered—and
profited by—his Great Derby Cryptogram, here is one:—
Dear Mr. Punch,
Tou Grand Old Oracle! I drink your jolly good health in '74
Champagne, and I ve taken care that you shall hare the fullest opportunity
of responding in the same splendid tipple. Tour Cryptogramio Derby
"Tip " was as clear as mud. I took it like a shot, and am a Twenty
Thousand-Pounder to-day in consequence. "First here will, of course, be
first at Epsom," says the Tip; therery first paragraph of Bacon's contribution
gives the name of "the absolute Winner," as the advertising humbugs hare
it. That paragraph hath eight sentences. Put the first letter of the first
words in those sentences together—those first words being, As—Youth—
Racing—Shopboy—How—It—Reoiomontanus's—Eighty — and you have
the name of the Derby Winner of 1%88—Ayrthire ! .'!!!! Wonderful!
D. pnnkli.v 'b not in it. Tours, opulently, I. S. Pottsm.
True, Mr. Pottem; but that's not all. The Cryptogram is full
of "tips" from begiuning to end. Look a little lower down. "Not
as the Crow flieth, but as the Swallow wheeleth," says the mystio
script. And " Be eyes right ready yet." Pat this and that together,
and you have the tecond in the Derby, "Crowberry" to wit 1 To make
assurance doubly sure, Mr. Punch says, still further on, "See me
1 In this way. 'Fonder real runner evidently sears win-
ning or "realising" colours!'" Read the initials here in reverse
order, and you get a second, " Crowberry." And "Crowberry " wot
second. And did not those who backed him for a place win or
realise P
Yet again. Take the latter sentences of the Cryptogram. "The
van oannot be in the rear. Don't I evidently mean another nnbi-
bustio secret /ucidly and not darkly to reveal P" And there you
have " Van Dieman's Land," the third in the Derby IQ.RF.lll
Was ever so complete a " Tip" as this of Mr. Punch'11
Bat even this is not all. The Cryptogram oontains—as Donnelly
says Bacon's does—an elaborate arithmetical cypher. Here is a
specimen:—
The (1-7) Derby (3'80) Winner (3'108) of (3 9) Eighty-eight
(3-89-90) is (1-13) A (6*1) Y (6 8) R (611) S (6-25) H (6 23) I (6 5)
R (6-37) E (6 9).
Like Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Punch means to "withhold the full
explanation" of this braoketed-dotted-hyphenated-mathematioo-
mystio cypher. His readers will, doubtless, prefer to work it out
themselves. He would simply, in conclusion, call their attention to
the significant warning already given in last week's Cryptogram:—
"And mind ye are not put off the scent of the veritable quarry by
obvious herring-trails, diverted from the true track by false dues I

METROPOLITAN MEMS.
Thajtks, I prefer not crossing the Park after dark
unless attended by a squadron of Horse Guards.
No, when I referred to the "horrible crime " in Oxford
Terraoe, I was not speaking of the affair of the day
before yesterday, when a harmless bank clerk was set
upon in broad daylight and "settled" by ten roughs
armed with daggers, whose excuse was that they "mis-
took him for somebody else." I mean yesterday's
murder—of the City Missionary, his wife, and three
children by the escaped convict in the East End.
As there are two suspioious-looking men now coming
up the front steps, armed with jemmies and carrying
skeleton keys, perhaps it would be as well for us to go
out on the roof and drag the ladder up after.us through
the sky-light till they nave completed their surrey of
the premises.
Dear me! This is the twenty-seventh fresh due that
the Polioe are said to have found to the murder in
North-East Highbury sinoe it was committed two days
ago.
It can hardly be said that the detectives have exhibited
no energy in connection with "the West Dulwioh Flaying
alive Case." Why, only yesterday they arrested my
maternal aunt and two of my cousins up from the country
on the oharge of being the persons wanted for the crime,
and only released them after twenty-four hours on
bread-and-water in a dark cell, upon the urgent assu-
rances of the Vicar of the parish, the local Medioal
Han, and a firm of Solicitors, that they were really quite
innocent.
Between tip-oat and unarrested assassins, a walk along
the streets of London is becoming as exciting an achieve-
ment as a trip across the Dark Continent.
I am sorry you do not like my new Botany Bay port,
of extra quality, for which I gave sevenpenoe the half
bottle, but I really cannot go down into my cellar to get
any other kind, because I heard a very strange noise just
now; and the only question remaining is. whether it is
the Manchester murderer, the two Canontrary ditto, or
the unarrested members of the Regent's Park gang, who
are down there.
The Chaswkl Bridge m this Air.—What sort of
structure would be the most suitable for bridging over

SHUT, SESAME!
(A Fairy Story of ths Regents Park.)
"So, Captain Rip," said the Enchantress, "you have had your
sleep for a hundred years, and now you are quite awake f"
"Thank you, fair lady," replied the Knight of the Road, raising
his feathered hat courteously, "that indeed I am. I do well remem-
ber a century ago here were the Mary le Bone Gardens—a lonely
spot all round, and excellent for gentlemen of my profession. In
those days there was no Wimpole Street—we only had Welbeok
Mews; and as for Cavendish Square, it waa hardly finished."
"Tour wish has been realised," smilingly replied the Enchantress.
"It is 1888 -the year after Her Majesty's Jubilee."
"How different from a hundred years ago 1" oried the highway-
man. "Then the roads were infested with robbers who courteously
offered the benighted oitizen either to take his purse or his life.
Things are changed now I"
'' You can see for yourself," replied the Enchantress, rather dryly.
"If you want me, cry ' Open, Sesame!' and the gates will yield me
up." Upon this the fairy disappeared.
"This is indeed pleasant, said the reformed thief. "How
delightful to ride in oomfort and peace in this beautiful park!
How happy must be the inhabitants living in the neighbourhood!
How"
He had got thus far in his soliloquy, when' suddenly a rabble of
shouting jibing roughs surrounded him.
"Do you oome from the Grove f" yelled one.
"Are you from the Deck?" shrieked another.
And then with one aooord they fell upon him and tried to kill him I
Captain Rip set spurs to his horse, and with great difficulty
esoaped. As he galloped away, ruffians of all kinds sprang up from
every corner, and tried to stop him. "Open, Sesame I" he oried
when he had distanced his pursuers, and immediately the Enchant-
ress reappeared before him.
"Well," she asked, "what do you want with me f"
"I never in my life saw anything more brutal—more barbarous!
Prithee, ' Shut, Sesame 11 Close the gates!"
"No; that charm won't work," sorrowfully explained the good
fairy. "The First Commissioner of Works has ordered the gates to
remain open, and he is more powerful than I. I cannot oloae them
tor you!"
"Then let me sleep again. Perhaps a hundred years hence the
state of the Regent's Park may be better."
"At any rate," responded the obliging Enchantress as she granted
him his request, "whatever that change may be, it cannot make
mattert tcorte.'
A REAL ".EMERGENCY MAN."
"One rescue waa effected in a most praiseworthy manner by a labourer
named David Buchanan, who asoended the ladder, but, finding it too short
to rtaah the upper story, climbed at great personal risk to tbe window-aiil,
and from there handed down one of the girls."—" Tunes" account of the
disastrous firs in ths Edgwart Road.
'Tis a real relief, 'midst official unreadiness,
To find an example of prompt pluck and steadiness.
One man did not know how to fear or to fail!
It lightens the gloom of that heart-chilling tale.
Bravo, my brave " labourer" I Punch doffs his cap
At the labour of love of this stout-hearted chap.

Who show oooler courage than David Buchanan I

A MILITARY MATINEE-
(By a Bank Civilian.)
June 2.—Show oalled Trooping the Colours advertised for 10
sharp. Parade Ground full. Performance doesn't commence till
10'30. Oar Only General riding to and
fro between Horse Guards and Marl-
borough House, looking anxious. What
has happened? Has a button come off
Commander-in-Chief's uniform at the
last moment, and no needle and thread
at hand? Has the civilian valet put
out a wrong costume for H.RH. the
Prince? Can't the bearskin be found
anywhere?
Several stout Warriors on horseback
ride in. Impossible to distinguish them
—that is, more than they are, as, by their medals and gold trimmings,
they are all sufficiently distinguished individuals already.
Officer in front riding in stateliest manner on highly-trained steed.
Suddenlv. highly-trained steed starts back on seeing the soldiers.
Stately Officer nearly turns a oatherine-wheel over charger's head.
Equanimity and equilibrium restored. Whioh is the Prince P Whioh
is the Duke.? From this distance whichever you like, my little dear.
Everybody remarking distinguished Officer in bright blue. Some-
one says. Oh, he's a Blue Hungarian." Explanation gives general
satisfaction fur the moment. What are they going to do now P
10 30 —Life Guards' Band in full fig. (why "fig"? fruitless
inquiry this), with usual gold coats and jockey caps (why "jockey-
caps " ?), plays a snatch of National Anthem. Snstoh is repeated at
intervals. Air never played right through. Why? Don't they
know it by this time? Lieutenant Dan Godfrey should see to this,
or,jif not Godfrey, at all events,one of the Military Musical Leaders.
A propos of Band, lady inquires, "Where is 'the Saluting Bass'?"
Never heard of instrument being employed in this manner. Point
out to her that the Band is only " wind" not "string ": therefore
neither Bass nor violoncello present: therefore no " saluting Bass." If
"Saluting Bass" were here, there would also be a Bowing and
Scraping Fiddle. She explains that she meant "B.a.s.e" not
"B.a.s.s." Polite of her to spell it in this manner. If sarcastically
inclined, might have omitted the "B " in second word. Military
gentleman, a spectator on my right, points out the "Saluting Base,"
whioh consists of H. R H.'s, Field Marshals, and such like.
Having come here to see the oolours trooped, I want to know where
are the oolours. Don't see them,—that if, not what / should call
"colours." Military person says, "There! they're going to fetch
the oolours now." Soldiers march languidly across while Band plays
Luther's Hymn, or something like it out of the Huguenots. I expect
to see several flagstatfs and flags that have braved a hundred years the
battle and the breeze. Oh, dear no. "There are the oolours," says
military friend, pointing. "What those 1" I exclaim, seeing only an
officer of some sort holding something like a small pocket-handker-
ohief on the top of a stick. "Yes," answers military friend with pride,
"those are the oolours." Officer with pocket-handkerchief on stick
and body of soldiers march languidly along, as if they had all been
out late the night before (" the night before the battle, Mother!")
and were very tired. Think they '11 all lie down presently and go to
sleep. Same idea probably strikes Conduotor of the Band, as he gives
signal for striking up lively air from Old Guard. Arthur Roberts
and Victory! All brisk again. Pipers in National Highland costume
might now do a reel. They don't, and all relapse again into solemnity,
relieved occasionally by the snatches above-mentioned of the National
Anthem. Then some gallant officer, mounted, rides into oentre, and
shouts something perfectly unintelligible. "That's all wrong," mut-
ters my military neighbour, discontentedly; "there's no such word
of command in the British Army." Military man probably right, as
whatever the command was, nobody moves, and no one takes any no-
tice of it. Crowd breaks up. Distinguished Warriors ride away slowly.
The oolours have been " troop'd." Sic transit gloria Saturday morn-
ing. Monotonous as a spectacle. Next time better entrust the manage-
ment to Generalissimo Aroustu.i Drckiohncs assisted by HuroLXK.

VOL. XCIV.
STRANGE CASE OF MERRIMANIA-COMPLETE CUBE
Dear Me. Punch ,
As Merrimania is nowadays not an uncommon ailment, 1
think you will be interested to learn how I completely escaped from
it. My Doctor, on my last visit to him, found that I was in the
highest possible spirits—I laughed, made jokes, I was full of amusing
stories. He shook his head, and recommended an immediate course
of Exhibitions.
"I do not advise you to visit the Picture Galleries," he said, as he
felt my pulse, "as that would be almost too strong a remedy. The
sudden transition from great gaiety to the depths of melancholy,
whioh would assuredly follow, would be injurious. I think you might
safely try a little of the waste land at Earl's Court, mixed with a
weak solution of Olympia, and the Conservatory attached to the
Albert Hall. But, before following this prescription, I would suggest
you should prepare yourtelf by attending an evening fete at the
Flower Market at Covent Garden. It will give you strength to bear
your subsequent treatment."
To hear was to obey; and that very night I found myself in the
midst of thousands and thousands of the loveliest flowers—lilies,
geraniums, roses, and pansies. On its merits, an extremely pretty
sight.
The next morning, in higher spirits than ever, I visited the Italian
Exhibition. I am happy to say that the depressingly long passage
from the railway platform to the entrance, the immense gallery to the
ex-happy hunting-grounds of Buffalo Bill, and the considerable
walk through the building before I could get to the Conoert Hall and
Theatre, did me a world of good. As I passed under seemingly
endless arches of artificial vines, I became duller and duller, and
telt my face growing longer with every step. Some of the exhibits,
too, had a decidedly sobering effect, especially those of British manu-
facture. I passed through a marquee wherein some Minstrels in the
costume of Neapolitan fishermen, were giving rather a humorous
entertainment, and entered the saloon devoted to a "wonderful per-
formance" of "Fratelli Prandi's celebrated Italian Burattim, or
Marionettes." There was a stage, with a proscenium suggestive of
'' the Theatre Royal Back Drawing Boom," and a full-sized orchestra.
The lever du rideau was " a gorgeous representation taken from the
Scriptures," called The Universal Deluge. It went with roars of
laughter from the "great procession of animals" down to the final
tableau depicting "the flight of the unfortunate victims, the raging
of the exterminating waters, and the roar and crash of the thunder,"
whioh again (to quote the programme) "proved a truly marvellous
scene." Some of the animals were rather feeble about the legs, and
many of the unfortunate victims preferred waltzing in the
exterminating w.itcrs with greater vigour than grace, to attempting
to escape. However, as a whole, the performance was fairly
amusing, although I have my doubts whether it would quite suit
the Polytechnic, even in these days, when that once popular insti-
tution is given over to the rulers of the Young Men s Christian
Association.
The'' Magnificent Hutorioo-Allegorical Fantastic Ballet, in fourteen
scenes, entitled Excelsior " was not so entertaining. It was long, and
(after the novelty of watching the puppets had passed off) wearisome.
However, it suggested to me that some of our pieces relying more
upon music, scenery, and mise en scene than on dialogue, might be
played with advantage by Marionettes. For instance, I should like
to see The Mikado dealt with in this way at Earl's Court. The
Pompadour too, so full of interest to the antiquarian, would lend
itself admirably to this treatment; and again Masks and Faces,
with its graceful gavotte (invented by Mr. D'Ac ban) could be
included in the repertoire. Possibly, in the cause of Art, Mr. and
Mrs. Beekbohm Tree and Mrs. Bernard Beere might be induced
to lend their valuable assistance in carrying out this really excellent
proposal.
It appears from Mr. Sim s's expression of hearty approbation whioh is
printed on the programme, that the eminent melodramatist thinks
that these Marionettes "will draw all London." Of course he will
give up Wilson Barrett, and one of his melodramas would be
just the very thing for the Puppets
Thoroughly depressed by the Burattini," I left the Italian Exhi-
bition and asked for a railway tioket to South Kensington. "If you
wish to go to the Anglo-Danish," said the clerk, "you won't get in.
I may tell you. Sir, that it is olosed because it is being reserved to-dav
for the female Freemasons who are taking tea with the Royal Family."
Warned in time, I asked for a ticket for The Irish O'Lympia, and
completed my cure. Whatever the Exhibition may be in its future, it
is at this present moment a most melancholy spot. The grounds are a
mass of brick and mortar, whioh are gradually assuming the appear-
ance of completed houses and artificial ruins; the exhibits, with the
exception of some bottles of whiskey, are spiritless. The musio of
the Connaught Regiment and th" Inniskilling Fusileers is not wildly
rollicksome. Ten minutes of Olympia reduoed me to tears, and I
felt that mv doctor's experiment had been successful.
Yours weepingly, A Wiser and a Sadder Ma*.

THE MAGISTRATE'S SONG.
The oases were oyer, the Magistrate rose,
Quite glad to be able to beat a retreat;
He held his handkerchief up to his nose,
For the Dalston Court-house was not very sweet.
And he sat him down in his private room;
But suddenly leaped again to his feet
With a scream that made the Reporters stare
And the Clerk jump up from his seat.
The Solicitor paused in extracting his fee;
His Client slipped out of the way;
The "Drunks ana Disorderlies" sniggered and grinned,
And thought 'twas a curious " lay."
Then the Magistrate said, "I have known many Courts,
But never until to-day
Have I seen a judicial sanctum filled
With—well, with creatures of prey 1"
ITALIANO IN KENSINGTONIO.
Suggestion for Improvements {by an Occasional Cor-
respondent).—There ought to be such a tramway as there
is on a long pier, to convey passengers at a halfpenny
apiece from the District Railway Station to the top of the
steps of the Italian Exhibition and baok. As it is—it
is a weary walk. An enterprising individual might
make a fortune here with a tramway or bath-chairs, ot
atmoepherio or electric rail. I went to see a rehearsal
of Pranm's Marionettes on Tuesday, by speoial {invita-
tion. But though my visit was post-prandi-al, we were
too scon for Signor Peak in, who was hard at work
erecting the Marionette Theatre. "Could I interview
the puppets P" I asked, not relishing having come there
for nothing. There was some hesitation; a consultation
between Signor Peak di and two assistants, and then a
courteous official informed me with a bashful air, as
though admitting me to a delicate confidence, that he
was "afraid I couldn't see any of the puppets to-day,
as they were all undressed." Not for worlds would I
intrude, I replied, and, having promised to come another
day, I retired.
The World, in an artiole entitled " The Rhapsody of
Rapping," asks some pertinent questions, to which an-
swers should be given by the individuals who are men-
tioned by name in Mrs. Home's book about her husband,

his spiritualistic reputation was founded. These answers

ROYAL FARES AND PLEASURE
GARDENS.
A propos of the first illustration of the
Pleasures of a Pleasure Horse in London,
which appeared in last week's number, seve-
ral Correspondents wish to know—
First. If gravel is very expensive, because
the Authorities in charge of the Park are
very sparing in the use of it in those most
dangerously slippery places, the Park Gate
entrances.
Secondly. Who are " the Authorities " who
have the management of the Parks and of
Kensington Gardens? Is it the First Com-
missioner, the Hon. David Robert Plunkbt
with "George Ranges" of St. James's,
Green and Hyde Parks, with the Police Com-
missioners?
Thirdly. Can't the Hon. D. R. Plunkbt
find, somewhere pigeon-holed away in his
office, plans for rides through Kensington
Gardens, under shady trees, as in the Bois
de Boulogne t And if he can't, cannot "the
Dook" find them in his office of Ranger?
If any difficulty, refer to former intelligent
offioials, Mr. Sh-w L-f-vre and B-btte
M-tf-rd.
Fourthly. What has beoome of the tan-ride
right round Regent's Park P Who " ranges"
Regent's Park? Apparently no one, at
present, exoept Roughs.
Fifthly. {For Sir Charles Warren.) Have
suoh Policemen as are stationed at the cor-
ners of thoroughfares close to Park Gates,
received strict orders that, on the appearance
of anyone on horseback,—attempting to cross
the road in order to enter the Park,—they
are at once to occupy themselves in cracking
jokes with a casual acquaintance, or in
cracking nuts, or to beoome apparently ab-
sorbed in the deepest contemplation of
nothing in particular until the perplexed
equestrian shall have arrived at the haven
where he would be, or somewhere else where
he wouldn't be P R. 8. V. P.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, June 4.—Habcoubt appeared
to-night in favourite character of Uncle Pumbleehook. Pip, for
this time only (first appearance on Westminster Stage), Evans, the
elect of Southampton. Habcoubt proposed to bring him up—
literally "by hand," as Pip was brought up in the Gargery house-
hold. What he had to do in the matter not quite clear. Herbert
Gardner, who escorted Evans on other side, right enough. Before
Evans was returned, he was the only Liberal Member in the Home
Counties. Habcoubt sits for Derby; rather remote from South-
ampton. Never saw Evans
till he met him on return
from America, and hailed
him Member for Southamp-
ton. No more to do with his
good fortune than Mr, Pum-
bleehook had with Pip's.
But, all the same, insists
upon effusively welcoming
him.
To-night stands at Bar,
half a foot in advance of new
Member, softly stroking chin,
and smiling to himself, await-
ing moment of triumph when
Spraxeb shall oall on new
Member to advanoe to Table.
AH described long ago, as far
baok as when Great Expecta-
tions was written. No need
of Cryptogram. Read straight
forward.
"' My dear friend,' said
Mr. Pumbleehook, taking Pip
by both hands, 'I give you
joy of your good fortune.
Well deserved. Well de-
served. To think that I
should have been the humble
instrument of leading up to
this is a proud reward. But, my dear young friend, you must be
hungry, you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a Chioken,
had round from the Boar. Here is a tongue had round from the
Boar. Here's one or two little things had round from the Boar,
that I hope you' may not despise. But do I see afore me him as
I have sported with in times of happy infancy, and may I ?—
may I?'"
And Habcoubt does; shakes hands with the blushing Evans, and
then strides up floor of House amid thunderous cheers of Liberals;
Evans always half a pace behind, Habcoubt, bowing gracefully,
face flushed, and pleased smile as resounding plaudits rise.
t "'Pon my soul, said Gorst, looking on with undisguised admira-
tion, "I do believe Habcoubt thinks it was he that won Southamp-
| ton. Shouldn't wonder to see him take the oath and go up to be
introduced to Speaker."

Undo Pumbleehook.

Stopped short of that. Just remembered Evans when brought up
by table. After half a moment's hesitation reluctantly wheeled to
the right and resumed seat on Front Bench. Then House had oppor-
tunity of seeing new Member, who speedily disappeared in obscurity
of back benches.
Business done.—Imperial Defence Bill in Committee.
Tuesday.—Tim Healy's tender heart touohed by abjeot depression
of House after six hours' debate on what some Members call the
Cantoumment Acts in India. Thought he would stir them up a bit.
He did.
Ebrington had Motion on paper ordering copies of certain state-
ments alluded to in course of proceedings before Select Committee
on admission of Strangers. An in-
nocent-looking proposal. Ebrtng-

rent impossibility of getting up a

'' Please, Sir, I did," piped Stuart
Wobtley in trembling voice; '' but

cried Tim, with scornful sweep of
extendedhand. "Ha! ha!" And
all the Irish Members cried,
"Ha! ha!" and Conybeare said,
- "Ho I ho!" Old Morality moved

ghastly attempts to smile. Tim's

coming libel action, "O'Donnell against Times." Putting this and
that together, Ebrington away, the Attorney-General in his
place, the Maoe on the table, yesterday being Monday and to-day
Tuesday, what could be clearer P A plot I a wicked plot to defame
the character of Irish Members. The Attorney-Genera l was artfully
using the House of Commons and hoodwinking that child of nature,
Viscount Ebbington. in order to obtain evidence on behalf of his
employers in the libel case.
"Could anything be dearerP" Tim asked, winking at Joseph
Gillis, who sat watching him with ecstatio admiration; and all
Members below Gangway shouted "No!" and Members above
Gangway ohuckled, and Members on Ministerial Benches stared, not
understanding the matter a bit, half fearing there was something
in it. Prettiest sight of all, face of Attorney-General; in rapid
changes indignant, scornful, angry, contemptuous, perturbed, and,
finally, unsuccessfully assuming feeble imitation of that far-away
look Dizzy used to put on when Big Ben olumsUy girded at him. A
most excellent piece of fooling, lifting Tot Healy at a bound to first
rank of comedians.
Business done.—C. D. Acts in India condemned. Tlm Heaxy
takes a rise out of Attobney-Genebal.
Thursday.—Lobd-Advocate beginning to think life not worth
living. As he says, "Life would be endurable only for its 8cotoh
Members." They have illogical and indefensible idea that Lord-
Advocate is representative of Scotch Government; that when they
want information on particular points, or have suggestions to offer,
they may address him. That, of course, all nonsense. On Monday
not less than five Scots-wha-hae combined to put down questions
addressed to Lord-Advocate. He just stopped away till questions
had been reaohed second time, then coolly turned up and answered
them all together.
To-night Hunter, following on trail, put a wordy question.
Seeing that so-and-so was so-and-so, and that if so-and-so did
not happen, something might ooour, would the Lord-Advocate see
his way to do so-and-so?
"No, Sir," growled the Lord-Advocate, half rising from the
bench. Ribald Conservatives laughed at this snub. Hunter sat
for a moment gasping for breath. Soots gallantly massed themselves
behind him, pushed him forward into front again. Hunter
repeated question at greater length, with added solemnity. Resumed
his seat. All eyes turned on Lobd-Advocate. Said never a word.' |

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday Night, June 4.—Grand performance of L'Africaine with
splendid cast. Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of
Wales and Princesses present punctually, and the house a brilliant
one. Madame Nordica as Selika, and M. Lassalle as Nelusko,
deoidedly "off colour," as they don't make these two characters any-
thing like as black as they were originally painted. Both Selika
and Nelutko ought to.be "kept dark." The contrast between
Selika and the fair Ines is impaired by this want of mahogany dye,
and much of the dramatic force of Selika's performance is lost.
The two De Reszkes play and sing like the thorough artists
they are. Yet opera heavy, and what ought always to be a startler
—the orchestral gymnastic performance with which the Last Act
opens—takes nobody's breath away, and is not encored. Disap-
pointment. The savages boarding the ship aren't half savage
enough. Merely colourable imitations of savages.
That "artless thing," Miss McIntybs, more artless than ever.
Called before the curtain, she comes on looking utterly surprised, as
Nordica, who hands her over to the care of Jean de *Reszke, who
in his turn convoys her to the o.r. side, and sees her safely off.
Entr'actes too long. I retire, humming the first bars of "The
Minstrel Soy," which had somehow got into Meyerbeer's head
when he composed the music of L'Afrieaine.
Tuesday.—La Traviata, with Albani, instead of Ella Russell,
as the heroine. Albani, heart-breaking; Ella, chair-breaking.
As the fair and frail Violetta, Albani looks frailer than Ella. In
excellent voice. Encores and bouquets: former declined, latter
accepted. Ravklli the Reliable as Alfredo the Little. IV Andka he,
as Papa Oermont, reminding me of that other heavy father in Mig-
nonne, with the telling ballad. First cousins, musically and
dramatically, I should say. If Traviata were played, as it ought to
be, in modern costume, what a chance there would be among the
principals and chorus for " making up " after Society's celebrities!
Mr. Alfredo" is a suggestion in itself likely to prove a great attrac-
tion. In the lobby I meet the popular proprietor of the largest
circulation in the world. "Just up from my little place, Hall Barn,"
he says; "always come up from Hall Barn to hear Hall-Barni."
A propos of Hall, I have only seen the Hall of the Opera once this
season. He is depressed by the absence of Mr. Gladstone, who
used to come so frequently to the Opera, and is not reassured by the
Conservative tone of the Organising Committee. He only consoles
himself by reflecting that the Opera is under the Liberal Manage-
ment of I) kuk tolas us. Still he is not happy, and wears bis Gardenia
Gladttonia with a deference.
Wednesday.—Crowded house. De Reszke Bros., as Faust and
Mephistopheles, summoned by enthusiastic audience at finish of
Aot 1. Nothing de risky about the De Reszke, the two Poles—
strong poles, too, capable of supporting the Opera. Poles together,
yet Poles asunder in their voioes. Madame Nordica received with
vociferous applause; is encored also vociferously in that gem, " The
Jewel Song," but declines with thanks. After that sweet thing in
duets, "Dammi aneor," everybody exclaims "ancor," but remem-
bering the presence of ladies, omits the first word, which does sound
strong, even in Italian. At end of Third Aot Nordica re-appears,
supported by the two Poles—North Pole and South Pole—Edouard
and Jean. All three greeted with well deserved ovation. After

Madame Nordica supported by two Poles—not sticks.
enthusiasm, reaction sets in, and Opera drags a bit towards the end.
Mdlle. Bauekmfister the Benevolent, good as ever as Dame Marta.
Altogether, excellent entertainment.
Thursday.—Don Giovanni again, with Lassalle as The Don.
Different, of course, from Toole as The Don, but in some respects
has the advantage over the latter. Toole is rarely now seen in
I toolian Opera, but if he were to appear, The Don would be, of course,
the very part for him.
The timid McIntyre now plays Elvira. This Elvira is a size or
so smaller than the Don's other victim, Madame Fuesch-Madi,
and thinner, though perhaps taller, than the coquettish Zerlina-
Amoldson. This is better than representing the Don's attachments
as being "all very fine and large." Ravelli the Reliable in it, of
course, and his song rapturously received.
Friday.—The Nozze . . . , which I did not see. I did Nozze before.
Saturday.—Les Huguenots. House full, no standing room.
Chairs at a premium. Exceptionally brilliant oast. Valentino would
be Madame Nordica's finest part, vocally and dramatically, were it
not for her Marguerite and Carmen. Must compliment Ella Russell
on her equestrian performance. Can scarcely believe that this Queen
of Song, on horseback, is the sprightly Susanna of the Nozze di
Figaro f No doubt of it, and in magnificent voice. A most impres-
sive Conte di San Bris is Edouard de Reszke. Edouard is "all
there," and there's a good lot of him. A gallant Raoul is the Polar
Star, Jean de Reszke, shining brightly in the darksome duel scene,
and afterwards going through the grand duet, and through the win-
dow, triumphantly. Scalchi first favourite as Urbano-" no-no-no-
no-no!" Encores not taken,—Opera long enough without; but
huge basket of flowers, for two, handed up, after Second Act, to be
shared by Nordica and Ella. The latter got it, and gave Noedica
a rose. Dare say they will share after—the Opera's over. Who
sent it? The E-ng of Sw-d-nF Mustn't mention his M-j-sty's
name, as he is Incognito in the Royal Box, disguised with either the
blue ribbon of the Garter or a Masonic soarf round him, enjoying
everything immensely, and no doubt going back to supper at the
palatial Grand Hotel, where he is naturally more at home than in
the cheery little snuggery known as Buckingham Palace. Alto-
gether, taking principals, special chorus, and our old friend Mite-en-
scene (perfect this time), this setting of Les Huguenots is well worth
repeating.

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
April 19.—Cummings oalled, bringing with him hia friend Mehton
who is in the Wine Trade. He made himself at home at once, and
Caebie and myself were both struck with him immediately, and
thoroughly approved of his sentiments. He leaned back in his chair
and said, Ton mast take me as I am," and I replied, "Yes—and
you must take us as we are. We 're homely people, we are not
Swells." He answered, ''No, I can see that." and Cummings roared
with laughter, but Meeton in a most gentlemanly manner said to
Cummings, " I don't think you quite understand me. I intended to
convey that our charming Host and Hostess were superior to the
follies of fashion, and preferred leading a simple and wholesome life
to gadding about to two-penny-halfpf nny Tea-drinking afternoons,
and living above their incomes." I was immensely pleased with
these sensible remarks of Mbeton's, and concluded that subject by
saying, "No, candidly, Mr. Meeton, we don't go into Society,
because, neither of us cares for it; and what with the expense of
cabs here and cabs there, and white gloves and white ties, &o., it
doesn't seem worth the money."
Meeton said in reference to friends, "My motto is 'Few and
True,'" and by the way I also apply that to Wine, "Little and
good"; and Cummings said, " Yes, and sometimes ' cheap and tasty,'
ehP old Man." Meeton still continuing, said, "He should treat
me as a friend, and put me down for a dozen of his ' Lockanbar'
whiskey, and as I was an old friend of Cummincs, I should have it
for 36a., which was considerably under what he paid for it" He
booked his own order, and further said that at any time I wanted
any passes for the Theatre, I was to let him know, as his name stood
good for any Theatre in London.
April 20.—Caeeib reminded me that as her old school friend
Annie Fullehs (now Mr. James) and her husband had come up
from Sutton for a few days, it would look kind to take them to the
Theatre, and would I drop a line to Mr. Meeton asking him for
passes for four, either for the Italian Opera, Haymarket, Savoy, or
Lyceum. I wrote Mehton to that effect.
April 21.—Got a reply from Meeton saying he was very busy, and
just at present couldn't manage passes for the Italian Opera, Hay-
market, Savoy, or Lyceum, but the best thing going on in London
was the "Brown Bushes," at the Tank Theatre, Islington, and
enclosed seats for four: also bill for whiskey.
r. and Mrs. James, Miss Fuller that was,
meat Tea, and we left direotly after for the Tank Theatre. We got
a 'bus that took us to King's Cross, and then ohanged into one that
took us to the " Angel." Mr. James each time insisting on paying
for all, say i n g that I had paid for the tickets and that was quite
enough. We arrived at Theatre, where, curiously enough, all our
'bus load except an old woman with a basket seemed to be going in.
I walked ahead and presented the tickets. The man looked at them,
and oalled out "Mr. Willowly! Do you know anything about
these':" holding up my tickets. The gentleman called to, came up
and examined my tiokets, and said, "Who gave you these?" I said
rather indignantly, "Mr. Meeton,of course." He said, "Mehton?
Who's he?" I answered rather sharply, "You ought to know, his
name's good at any theatre in London." He replied, "Oh I is it.
Well, it ain't no good here. These tiokets whioh are not dated, were
issued under Mr. Swinstead's Management, whioh has since ohanged
hands." While I was having some very unpleasant words with the
man, James, who had gone upstairs with the Ladies, called out,
"Come on! I went up after them, and a very civil attendant said,
"This way, please, box H." I said to Jamep, "Why, how on
earth did you manage itP" and to my horror he replied, "Why,
paid for it of course."

MOVEMENTS OF MR. WILLIAM SIKES.
From the Cracksmarii Circular.
Mr. William Sues arrived in London this morning by the 10 a.m.
train from Portland, having murdered a warder or two and left early.
There were a number of friends to meet him. After making them
a short speeoh, he adjourned with a select few to the Burglar's Arms
Hotel, where a recherche dejeuner was served. He left in a private
Hansom for the residence of a friend en route for Paris. During his
short stay Mr. William Sixes visited the houses of several wealthy
merchants in the suburbs, and removed a considerable amount of
superfluous silver, gold, and valuable jewellery. The lot will be sold
in a few days' time at Melter Moss's Lost Property Auction, of which
due notice will be given in this journal and in the Police Gazette.
At the request of his admirers, Mr. William sat for his photo-
graph. One specimen copy he subsequently sent by Special Messenger,
as a present, to Sir Charles Warren, and another he left personally
on the Chief of the Police Intelligence Department, Whitehall. Mr.
W. Sixes conversed pleasantly for several minutes with some of the
chief constables on duty, and bidding them farewell, drove back
to the house of the friend with whom he was staying.
In the evening of next day the first burglary of the season (in
this neighbourhood) took place at the house of Mr. Snobhinoton,
whose gold plate was left out on the side-board on the occasion of
the reception given by Mrs. Snohbixgton to the Half-Crown Prince
of Saxe-Hapense. Mr. William Sixes, who is a great collector of
old jewellery and gold and silver plate, was naturally attracted by
the display, and was not contented until he had become the happy
possessor of some of the most splendid pieoes in the set.
Friday.—A man said to be uncommonly like Mr. William Sixes
has been arrested, and is now in the custody of the police. The pro-
ceedings are necessarily secret.
Saturday.—Another man more like Mr. William 8ixes than'the
other has been arrested. The other one has been cautioned and
discharged. He promised not to look so like W. Sixes again, and
thanked the police for the oare they had taken of him.
Sunday.—The man arrested yesterday has been discharged. On
being confronted with the photograph it was ascertained that he wasn't
like Mr. Sixes at all. He was immediately dismissed with a caution.
A wire from Paris brings the intelligence that Mr. W. Sixes was
present at the Grand Prix, when several distinguished Frenoh gentle-
men, residing in the neighbourhood, lost considerable sums of money. ■
Unfortunately the news arrived too late for any member of the Intel- I
ligenoe Department to avail himself of it.
Due notice will be given of Mr. Sixes's return to town.
Mrs. Ram went to see one of her little nephews at Eton on the
4th of June. "A pretty sight," she said. "I hope Mr. Irving was
there, as the fireworks quite reminded me of that wonderful scene on
the Brooas,—in Faust, you know."

ROUND THE FIBST; OE, GETTING DOWN TO AVOID.
Fragment* of the Story of the Great Fight between the "Pugnacious Pump,'\and
"Bung's Novice."
• ••••••
Amid Fistiana's old chronicles many a "mill" is recorded,
Which to the Corinthian patrons of boxing much pleasure afforded;
Bat seldom
the swells
of St. Ste-
phens' s
King have

greater ex-

Than watoh-

He has shown unexpected good form, and the knowing ones readily backed him,
"We pity the other," they cried, "when our Novioe has met him and whacked
him!"
The "Pugnaoious Pump" was a big 'un, but just a bit soft, so men muttered,
And aged and stale; so 'twas thought the young Novioe might face him
uc fluttered.
'Twas true he'd a lump of a fist, and was long in the reach, and a smiter;
But then he was oookcrowy rather, a very bad sign in a fighter.
His temper was awfully nasty; the Novioe was cool and collected;
And so it seemed skill against size, and a rattling food mill was expected.
• • • • • • •
It calls for Pierce EoAif's old pen with a sort of a dash of Macacla y's,
To worthily follow the fight from the moment they put up their mawleys.
The "Pump" stripped a regular whopper, the " Novioe he peeled a bit forky,
But then he seemed quick as Jem Mace, and as light on his toes as old Corky.
The "Pomp" had a rare orowd of backers, and oh, how they holloaed and

be doubted. _ [oheery;
A slab-sided slommocking ohap was the "Pump," and his mug looked most
A trifle smook-faoed to be sure, but not the least puffy or beery.
The "Novioe" looked clean as a pin, and as hard and as game as a pebble;
But light—^very light; his opponent's b^g bulk seamed bis carcase to^treble.
They spar for an opening. Bang! If, my Novice, your nose that had smitten
As straight as the P. P. intended, I fear Mother Earth you'd have bitten!

says the Daily Newt. Of course; the fact is No-torjous.
LAT-LN FOR A SPEECH!
The following letter was picked up last week in Trinity
College, Cambridge, shortly after the conferment of
honorary degrees on Prinoe Albert Victor, Lord Salis-
bury, and other distinguished personages. If it doesn't
speak for itself, Mr. Punch declines to speak for it. It
at-ems to be addressed to the Professor of Latin in the
University:—
Dear Mayor,— Kindly look at the enclosed draft of my
forthcoming address in introducing the new L.L.D.'s to
the Chancellor. I want particularly to know if the Latin
is all correct—audi of course you, from your official posi-
tion, are the right person to tell me that. I flatter myself
the address will cause a sensation; but, if you don't
approve, would you just send me a few hints as to what
you would say under the same distressing circumstances P

the Volunteers have a nice place to themselves at Aldershot, for

visit them, and where festivities will be less the order of the day
than striot attention to business. Should the Crystal Palace Company
want to realise, wouldn't their grounds suit the Volunteers as a
permanent Camp? The Sydenhamites, who are accustomed to Odd

"CONSULE PLUNKET."
The First Commissioner of Works (Chief JSdilenot "Consul"—but
the quotation applies) has shown a tender care for the nest of the
Fly-catcher in Rotten Row. The tree is protected by an iron rail,
and the bird is as carefully watched by the police as if she were a
dynamiter hatching a plot. The Right Hon. David is evidently a
man of sentiment. As an old bird—not quite a Nestor, but, so far,
a Bird-Nestor—not to be caught with chaff, he has a sympathy with
the little hen who is "up a tree," and whose sittings are tempo-
rarily of longer duration than those of the House of Commons. If
the House of "Commons" were worthy of its name, it would give
further consideration to open spaces for ill-used Equestrians, and,
with the assistance of " George Ranger" (who chiefly patronises Bat-
tersea Park for his morning exercise) would open spaces across
Kensington Gardens, demolish the sunk fence, and give another ride
across Hyde Park.
If the placid Equestrians were 'Radical Rioters or Noisy Salva-
tionists, every attention possible would be paid to their modest
requirements; but as they do" not assemble in their thousands, and
neither rant and roar under the Reformers' Oak, nor threaten Revo-
lution, nor demolish railings, they are treated as a "feeble folk,"
like " the coneys," or trodden upon as bruised worms whioh have
only the poor space of Rotten Row to turn in. Certainly, except,
perhaps, for the Early Christian Martyrs-to-over-feeding, and for
riding-masters with pupils, Rotten Row is about the Rottenest Ride
to be found in any civilised Metropolis; and Livery Loudon, and
every "poor beggar on horsebaok," ought to protest against its
insufficiency. The life of a squirrel in a oage teems with pleasing
variety as compared with the very-un-merry-go-round-about course
to which the Rotten Rovers are condemned.
Ask for the plans for new rides whioh were in the departmental
pigeon-holes to which we alluded last week. Let First Commissioner
of Works, David, stronger in faith than in works, go out against the
Philistine Giant, Tie-Wig-and-Red-Tape, and hia victory is assured
beforehand.

W. B.'S LEGGINGS.
Mb. Wilson Babbitt's moral advertisement of Ben-my-chree is
worth noticing. If Ben-my-chree were a Ballet, then this display
of legs would be intelligible to the
meanest capacity; but it isn't a
Ballet. As there are only three
weeks more for these Legs to ran at
the Prinoess's, the picture might be
supposed to have some referenee to
the piece heing on its last legs; in
which case it must have had six or
eight legs to start with. We're
quite aware that these Legs, alive
and kicking, are the Manx Arms,
adopted for this occasion only by
Wilson Barrett, who may wish to
show that the present state of Ben-
my-chree makes him Manxious.
"His Last Legs." jn the advertisements which we
would suggest to W. B. for his last two-week legs, the "ohree"
would be omitted, and only "Ben-my" remain, or it maybe read
"My Ben," which will recommend itself to
the theatrical mind, and we hope the last one,
the "Ben,"—short for "Bentflt,"—will be a
real good one. The above advertisement is
not patented, and with great pleasure we
make it a present to Ben-
ray-BiEEKTT. But there is
one thing most remarkable
and most worthy of imita-
tion in this form of adver-
tisement, and that is the
self-effacement of the actor

the gentle Gboboib refer to book by its homely title. "The Soldier's
Pocket-Book.'" he repeats wherever name may be dragged in.
"Never realised till this morning," said Babttelot, "how much
venomous contempt oould be expressed by simple citation of the title
of a book."
A pretty scene, in which Thb Taj played his part with dignity and
discretion.
A steady night's work in Committee on the Local Government Bill.
Crowded benones, earnest, useful debate. Only one note of discord
when Curse or Camborne turns up, and moves futile Amendment.
Members bound to sit by whilst Contbeabe makes speech, and must
needs divide at his sweet will. But no one will take part in discus-
sion, and, after a while, the Curse goes home to roost.
Business done.—In Committee on Local Government Bill.
Tuesday Night.—" I remember," said Old Morality, trying to keep
pace with Ritchie, walking home aoross Palaoe Yard, "when I was
at school writing in my oopy-book, 'Punctuality is the Thief of
Time.' Wish now we hadn't been so punctual in announcing with-
drawal of Licensing Clauses,"
"Pooh, pooh I" said Ritchie. "Had to be done some time.
Might as well do it at once."
"Not so sure," said Smith, wearily. "There's another reminis-
cence of my youth, 'Never do To-day what you can put ofp till
To-morrow.' If we hadn't shaken things up at the Morning Sitting,
perhaps we should have been better off in the evening. Can't stand
many of these experiences. What does the copy-book say P Forget
exact phrase, but something to the effect
that unintermitted distillation of fluid
upon a stony substance will in process
of time diminish its superficial area."
Truly not a cheerful day for Govern-
ment. At Morning Sitting withdrew
Licensing Clauses of Local Government
Bill. Last night Old Morality, with his
hand on his heart, declared that there
was absolutely no foundation for report
that Government had decided to abandon
the Clauses.
Then do you mean to go on with
them P" asked Catnb.
"Certainly, Sir," said Old Morality.
"Come, come, now," said Sir John
Mowbray, when, this afternoon, Clauses
abandoned. "Don't you think that for
a moral man this is a little , eh P"
"Certainly not," said Old Morality,
flush of virtuous indignation mantling his
brow. "When I said we would certainly
go on with Clauses it was Monday. Answer
strictly limited to the day. This is Tues-
day, and you get fresh answer. I can
assure the House I am animated solely by
sense of publio duty. My only desire
is to meet the convenience of the House
and further the great interests of the
publio service.
At evening sitting Jennings moved Resolution condemning reor-
ganisations in publio departments. Geoboib Hamilton defended
system. Showed conclusively that best way to save publio money is
from time to time pension off all servants over thirty-two years of
age, getting fresh relays. Chablie Bbrbsfokd, hitching up his
trousers and saluting First Lord, told him that he might reorganise
till he was blue in the face. Nothing would come of it as long as
present system existed."
Old Morality appealed to nobler instincts of Jennings not to press
Motion to a Division. Position critical. Whips caught napping.
Evidently not a hundred men in hand. Midnight sounded from Big
Ben. If only debate oould be kept going for another half hour 1
Messengers, soouring the Clubs, might bring in reinforcements.
Abthtjr O'Connob evidently going to make speech. Anxious faces
on Treasury Benoh beamed gratefully upon him. Nothing known of
him justified belief that he would talk for less than half an hour.
O'Connob on his feet; sigh of relief from Treasury Bench.
"Sir." said O'Connob, *• I move that the question be now put."
The Closure, ah! the Closure! Old Morality remembered some-
thing he had read or written out about danger of playing with tools
sharpened on both sides. Often wielded the Closure; now cut at
him. No appeal. House divided, and Ministry defeated by 113
votes against 91.
"Often heard Arthur O'Connob speak," said Wilfrid Lawson,
coming in just in time for Division, "but I never heard a more
eloquent or effective oration than this last."

"So demn'd impertinent I said Mantat.tnt Matthews.

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday, June 11.—Fautt and Foremost. Nobdica, the two Polks,

would be Cally-flowers. Wagstaff oughtn't to be admitted.
Tuesday.—Ravelli the Reliable resting. Rigoletto given with-
out him. He deserves several bars' rest. Apology made for
Madame Mblba on account of hoarseness. Everyone is a little
hoarsey in Ascot week. Apologia pro voce sua quite unneces-
sary apparently, Madame Mblba being in magnificent voice. She
brings down the house—quite a Samsonian teat—and is recalled
after the First Aot tumultuously. She can act as well as sing.
Signor D'Andrade very good as Rigoletto. Once decidedly flat,
but that is when he is prostrated, quite knocked over by his grief,
so that his voice goes in sympathy with his emotion. Madame
Scalchi is Maddalena. Signor GunxE, as II Duca, reminds me of
the fat boy in Pickwick when amorously inclined towards Mary the
housemaid. There is no accounting for feminine taste, bat when
Qilda tells her father how
"Each Sunday whilst I went "A youth of heavenly beauty"

I confess that the peculiar fascination exeroised by this stout
Lothario over the youthful and devout victim is inexplicable, though it
might not perhaps be so had she known that he was a Duke in
disguise. I'm afraid that as it was she must have been considerably
distracted during the service, and she couldn't have told anybody
afterwards what the sermon was about. And all this for a little

doesn't get an encore for "La Donna £ mobile" but as a Fancy
Fascinator he is not, so to speak, "in it." Backrmeister the Bene-
volent not resting like Ravelli the Reliable. Couldn't both be
spared on the same night. Sad story—Rigoletto. Always feel
melancholy at the finish. Sorry H Duca escapes, but such is life.
The quartette encored, and deservedly so. The conductor with the
sherry-white-wine sort of name, Signor Mancinelli, has band and
choruses well in hand. Mise-en-scene worthy of Augustan Operatic
Era. Mr. Charles Hall, Q.C., M.P., who ought to be at Cam-
bridge receiving degrees honoris causa, weeps over the hard fate of
Oilda, and Lord Lathom wipes his lorgnettes. Not a dry eye in
the house. Dry throats though. Emotional grief makes anti-
Lawsonites of us all.
Wednesday.—Hail, Columbia 1 L'Africaine is the Opera, and
Mile. Columbia is the remplacanie of Mme. Nobdica. Nordica
resting like Ravblli. Quite right. Hope "the Balm of Columbia"
(whatever that may be—probably something for the hair—never say
dye) will restore her. Why won't Lassalle (fine voioe, fine actor,
too,—" Avast, there, Messmate I" says the noble Tar, C. B. "He
has a magnifioent compass." C. B. is a judge of compasses) make up
as a real nigger? I don't mean in collars, but in colour. At all
events, why isn't he a villain of the deepest mahogany dye? The
boarding of the ship by the members of the Savage Club more
spirited than last week, when, instead of being untutored Savage
boarders, they were as polite and mild as parlour boarders. The two
Poles first-rate. The " Artless Thing," Miss McIntyre, looking more
astonished than ever at her exceptional success as Inez. No encores.
Evidently not offered lest they should be taken and Opera be pro-
longed beyond midnight. "Aye, Aye, my hearties!" says Lord
Charles. "Belay encores! avast encoring! Why, my dear eyes,
the other Saturday night the last Aot of The Huguenots was heaved
overboard to lighten the ship, for all the world as if it had been a

doesn't pay the Opera a visit. Mr. Chaplin, of Italian Organising
Committee explains that "0. 0. M. might select a night when
Trove-a-tory was being played, and wouldn't like it,"
Saturday.—A "Nicnt wi' Wagner," Splendid performance of
Lohengrin. No applause permitted, except between Acts, as Wag-
ner's work mustn't be interrupted. Jean be Reszkk, as the Knight
from Swansea, superb, well worthy of Albani as Elsa, and "No one
Else Sir can do it as she can." (Wagstaff passim.) Madame
Hastreiter musically and dramatically powerful as the Orful
Ortrude, and Navarrini equally so as the Hateful Harold. M.
Edouard de Reszkk every inch a King, and acts as such. Signor
Manclnelli—pronounced Marnchinally, not like the wine Mansi-
nilhi—shows now perfect the orchestra oan be. Crowded and
enthusiastic house. "Floral Hall," decorated with Gardenia
Gladstonensis, breathes again, in oonsequenoe of liberal supply of
Ayr. Lohengrin must be repeated more than once with same cast.
Druriolanus Triumph ans takes additional title of " Coventus Hor-

"THE VIGIL."
"Yer»e-moi dam le caur, dtt foadi de «e tombeau
Quelque «ho«e de grand, de sublime et de beau!"
Rernani, Aet IV., Scene 2.
The prayer of Charles, that rose amidst the gloom
Of the dead Charlemagne's majestic tomb,
Might fitly find an echo on the bps
Of the young Prince, whose pathway death's eolipse
Hath twice enshadowed in so brief a space.
Orandsire and Sire I Stout slip of a strong race,
Valiant old age and vigorous manhood fail,
And leave youth, high with hope, with anguish pale,
In vigil at their tomb! "Watch on, and kneel,
Those olenohed hands crossed upon the sheathed steel.
Not lightly such inheritance should fall.
Hear you not through the gloom the glorious call
Of Valour, Duty, Freedom? Death but late
Smote, at the crown and top of patriot state,
The age-unshaken Sovereign, whose white crest
Bore up against the years. Now, ere the test
Of twelve short moons his strenuous soul had tried,
Through fierce affliction, borne with patient pride,
In brave mid-manhood promise-full, and pure
In honour opulent, in love secure,
Passes the gallant Prince Germania hoped,
With the great burden of her fate had coped
For many a peaceful, progress-laden year.
Fallen, like some old knight in full career,
Dead on the field of honour, gripping close
The weapon, Duty, which not mailed foes,
Nor pain s insidious stress, could force or steal
From the firm hand that served the spirit leal.
A Drama here, of Kings, not low or base,
But of heroic strain I
And youth must face
What snowy age and stalwart manhood found
A weight of sorrow, though with splendour crowned.
Young Hohxnzollxkh, soldierly of soul,
Heaven fix your heart on a yet nobler goal
Than sword may hew its way to. Those yon mourn
Heroes of the Great War when France was torn
With Teuton shot, knew that the sword alone
May rear, but shall not long support a throne.
William has passed, bowing his silver crest,
Like an old Sea King going to his rest;
Frederick, in fullest prime, with failing breath,
But as heroic heart, has stooped to death:
Here, at their tomb, another Emperor keeps
His vigil, whilst Germania bows and weeps.
Heaven hold that sword unsheathed in that young'hand,
And crown with power and peace the Fatherland!

His dismissing; me summarily with the remark that my conduct

Polite Attendant (to a Strong-minded Matron, who insists on
standing with her numerous family in the gangway between the five-
shilling seats). I really must ask you to go further back, Madam—
your tickets were for the shilling seats—you have no right to block
the passage here.
The S. M. There's no room in the shilling seats. I have brought
my family all the way from Haverstook Hill, on purpose to hear
little PousHZiN, and it's not likely I shall go away now.
[The Polite A. summons two other P. A.'s., who urge the pro-
priety of retiring.

I am only a woman, with these defenceless children, but I warn you
that I will yield to nothing but superior force—you will have to drag
us out I [ The P. A.'s smile at one another feebly, and remain irre-
solute, with the bearing of baffled tyrants at a minor theatre.

leaving the 8. M. and her family, flushed but triumphant, in
undisputed possession.

one—entered into the yearning discontent, the dreamy despair, the
hopeless passion, with such feeling and perfect comprehension as

relief, and is recalled again and again, amidst rapturous

TYPICAL MODERN DEVELOPMENTS.
GRANDMOTHER AND GRAND-DAUGHTER.
FOOD, FLOWERS, AND MYSTERY;
Or, The Nursery of the Strange and the Beautiful.
Mr Dear Editor,—Ton may remember that one day last week you sent for
me in great trouble. You explained to me that you were very sad.
"You see," you observed, "the Managing Direotor of the Pine Apple Nur-
series has addressed me officially, 'begging me to honour him with a visit to view
the Company's Show of Oloxinias and other flowers in their Grand Conservatory.'
This is a most reasonable request, and it cuts me to the heart to have to refuse
it 1 Alas that I should be bo busy!"
"But could you not be represented by a substitute P" I suggested, sympa-
thetically.
"Eureka!" you shouted, absolutely beside yourself with joy. "Look at
the letter of invitation I You notice either I am to come or ' any delegate I may
appoint.' I will appoint you. Read the last paragraph in the letter of invita-
tion—' Luncheon will be provided at one o'clock.' You hear, luncheon will be
provided at one o'clook!"
"This is indeed kind!" I cried, almost choking with emotion; and then
after a few whispered words I took my leave.
The next morning I hastened to the Pine Apple Nurseries. They seemed to
me to be situated miles away from anywhere. In the cause of economy I
patronised the Metropolitan Railway, two tram-cars, and an omnibus, and
after taking several bad shots which resulted in hurried visits to Brompton
and Hammersmith, landed myself in the neighbourhood of Kilburn. The Pine
Apple Nurseries had several rivals which seemingly were more than success
fully holding their own. To tell the truth I did not think much of the " Oloxinias
and other flowers" belonging to the P. A. N. in the Grand Conservatory, but
then I do not pretend to be muoh of a judge. This by the way.
Ontside the grounds was a one-horse refreshment cart. Inside the glass house
stood three melancholy-looking gentlemen seemingly on what soldiers call " the
alert." Over the door of the Conservatory appeared an invitation to "customers"
to enter and inspect the exhibits. I walked in, and the three gentlemen gave
a little start on seeing me, as if they were not sure whether I was to be
treated as a king, or a convict. However, I disappeared down a side-path, and
was left in peace. There were some specimens of ferns and that sort of,thing.
I did not think much of what I saw, but then, as I have already admitted, I do
not consider myself infallible on matters of horticulture. I returned to the
entrance,and then one of the three gentlemen observing that "I had been
reund," let me out. 8o f ar I had seen and heard nothing of the luncheon,
although its existence had been suggested by the one-
horse refreshment-oart to which I have already referred.
Once outside "the Grand Conservatory," I began a tour
of inspection of a market garden which appeared to me
of not very imposing proportions, and in the course of
my journey came upon a building which seemed to be
used for an office. Standing before it, I heard a pop, and
looking through a window I found a lunoheon, which
presumably was the one promised " to be provided." A
waiter in his shirt-sleeves had opened a bottle of wine.
There was a table laid apparently for about a score of
guests, and through the glass I could see an " arrange-
ment in yellow," which did not seem to me to be very
digestible. By-and-by, two of the gentlemen who I had
noticed standing in the Grand Conservatory, entered the
room accompanied by a lady, and took their seats. It
was then I fancy that "the face at the window" was
observed, and I thought it respectful to withdraw. I
made my way onoe more to the entrance to the market
garden, and was there accosted by the third gentleman
who asked me, "if I was looking for anybody t"
Had not the Manchester Murderer been just appre-
hended, I fear that I might have been tempted to have
declared that I was a detective searching for Jackson.
Failing this excuse (the only one that on the spur of the
moment occurred to me) I asked a question.
"Have many come to luncheon P"
""Well, no, Sir, not yet," replied my acooster in a tone
in which I fancied I could trace a tinge of melancholy.
"Not yet," he repeated, and then continued more hope-
fully, more cheerfully. "But then of course, they can
ohoose their own time—we said one, but any time will do."
I did not ask who the "they " were, nor did I attempt
to guess. I merely smiled a soft, genial, innocent smile.
There was an awkward pause.
"Perhaps you would like some luncheon, Sir?" sug-
gested my companion with high-bred courtesy, which
tilled me with admirationjnot unmixed with surprise.
I felt deep gratitude and considerable pride that I,
a perfeot stranger, should have been singled out for this
magnifioent display of hospitality.
"Thanks, no," said I, struggling wi
"not to-day. Perhaps at some future
in again."
And then I left him. He followed me with eyes in
which there appeared to me to lurk some latent doubt.
When I got to the gate, I asked the young man in charge
of the one-horse refreshment oart if he could furnish
me with the Menu of the apparently rather neglected
feast. He said he could not. Under these circum-
stances I regret to report I can give you no further
particulars. I can merely subscribe myself, My dear

Company; in default, he may be taken into the Station-
Master's room and compulsorily vaccinated with any
lymph that may be found on the premises, and in as

will not be liable to any fine whatever.
The servants of the Company have peremptory orders
to admit nobody to a platform unless furnished with a
ticket. Persons found without tickets on platforms will,
unless the Station-Inspector and one or two Guards have
been previously tipped, be caught by the scruff of the
neck and ducked in the nearest horse-pond.

The Military Musical Tournament (why "Tournament" ?), under
general superintendence of Major Tully, commenced at the Agricul-

this, wouldn't the enemy, if half sharp,
steal a maroh on them, and bolt with their

occur to a mere civilian. The Aldershot
Military Gymnasts go through a lot of
athletio exercises, which would have a
most startling effect on an enemy. The

DIARY OF A NOBODY.
April 24.—Could soaroely sleep a wink through thinking of having
brought up Mr. and Mrs. James from the country to go to the Theatre
last night, and his having paid for a private box because our order
was not honoured; and such a poor play too. I wrote a very satirical
letter to Mebton the Wine Merohant, who gave us the pass, and said,
"considering we had to pay for our seats, we did our best to appre-
ciate the performance." I thought this line rather cutting, and I
asked Cabbie how many P's there were in appreciate, and she said.
"One." After I sent off the letter I looked at the dictionary and
found there were two. Awfully vexed at this.
Decided not to worry myself any more about the James's; for, as
Cabbie wisely said, " We'll make it all right with them by asking
them up from Sutton one evening next week, to play at Bezique.
April 25.—In consequence of Bbickwell telling me his wife was
working wonders with the new Pineeoed's Enamel Paint, I deter-
mined to try it. I bought two tins of red on my way home. I hastened
through tea, went into the garden and painted some flower-pots. I
called out Cabbie, who said, "You've always got some new-fangled
craze "; but she was obliged to admit that the flower-pots looked
remarkably well. Went upstairs into the servant's bed-room and
painted her wash-stand, towel-horse, and ohest of drawers. To my
mind it was an extraordinary improvement, but as an example of the
ignorance of the lower olasses in the matter of taste, our servant
Saeah, on seeing them, evinced no sign of pleasure, but merely
said, " she thought they looked very well as they was before."
April 26.—Got some more red Enamel Paint (red to my mind being
the best colour), and painted the coal-scuttle, and the backs of our
Shakspeare, the binding of which had almost worn out.
April 27.—Painted the Bath red, and was delighted with the
result. Sorry to say Cabbie was not, in faot we had a few words
about it. She said I ought to have consulted her, and she had never
heard of suoh a thing as a Bath being painted red. I replied,
"It's merely a matter of taste." Fortunately, further argument on
the subject was stopped by a voice saying, "May I come in?" It
was only Cumminus, who said, "Your maid opened the door, and
asked me to excuse her showing me in, as she was wringing out some
socks." I was delighted to see him, and suggested we should have
a game of whist with a dummy, and by way of merriment said,
"You oan be the dummy." Cumminos (I thought rather ill-
naturedly) replied, "Funny as usual." He said he couldn't stop, he
only called to leave me the Bicycle Neics" as he had done with it.
Another ring at the bell; it was Gowing, who said "he must
apologise for oalling so often, and that one of these days we must
oome round to him." I said, "A very extraordinary thing has
struck me." "Something funny, as usual," said Ccmminhs.
"Yes," I replied, "I think even you will say so this time.
It'8 d propos of you both; for doesn't it seem odd that Gowws's
always coming, and Cumming's always going?" Cakrik. who
had evidently quite forgotten about the bath, went into fits of
laughter, and as for myself, I fairly doubled up in my chair, till
it cracked beneath me. I think this was one of the best jokes I
have ever made. Then imagine my astonishment on perceiving
both Cum minos and Go wish perfeotly silent, and without a
smile on their faces. After rather an unpleasant pause, Ccmminos,
who had opened a cigar-case, closed it up again, and said, " Yes -I
think, after that, I shall be going, and I am sorry I fail to see the
fun of your jokes." Gowinq said he didn't mind a joke when it
wasn't rude, but a pun on a name, to his thinking, was certainly a
little wanting in good taste. Cumminos followed it up by saying, if
it had been said by any one else but myself, he shouldn't have
entered the house again. This rather unpleasantly terminated what
might have been a cheery evening. However, it was as well they went,
for the charwoman had finished up the remains of the cold pork.
"Wounded by a shot from an Ayr gun!" exclaimed Gbobge
Joein. "From the report it sounds to me like the explosion of a
blunderbuss."

DALY" NEWS.
One visit to the Daly Co., now performing The Taming of the
Shrew at the Gaiety, will make it evident to the student of the English
Drama that Theatrioal America most have heen discovered by the
Kembles, with Mrs. Siddons, followed by Macrxady, Phblps, Comp-
tow, and Buck stone, whose good old traditions have not yet been
discarded as is evidenced by the occasionally deep tones and courtly

Yankee Shakspeares came to town
On Petruchio's pony;
Such a feather in their cap I
Hope they 11 make their money
of the leading members of this company, and in the
peculiar mannerisms of the low comedians. What first struck me,
after the remarkable performance of Miss Ada. Reran a& Katherine,
was Mr. John Drew's clever embodiment of Petruchio; and pass-
ing over the out-and-dried oomio business of Mr. James Lewis as
Cfrumio, Mr. F. Bond as Tranio, and Mr. Charles Leclebco, as
Oremio, I.was delighted with Mrs. Gilbert as Cur tit, whom the
Americans have ohanged into an old woman after Shaespbabe had
made a man of him. Miss Phcebe Russell looks quite Burn-Jonesian
as Bianca. About the others, with the exception of Mr. William
Gilbert, the exponent of Christopher Sly, there seemed to me to be
an amateurishness which was quite inexplicable. But the two, on
whom the suooess of this Elizabethan Farcical Extravaganza depends,
axe worthy of the greatest praise, of whioh to Miss 1Rehan must be
allotted the lion's share.
About the spelling of Petruchio's name there is admittedly some
■light difference of opinion, but about the pronunciation of it as
spelt in the Daly Company's bill, "Petrucio," there is a good deal of
difference among the Daly Company themselves, seeing that the same
person is called at one time " Petruzzio," at another " Petrooshio,"
and again "Petrutchio," aooording to the taste and faney of the
individual. If the correct spelling be Petruchio, the oorreot pro-
nunciation would be " Petrukio." The absence of uniformity in suoh
a matter is a note of indeoision in stage management, and through-
out the piece there is constant evidence of their still being bound hand
and foot by the old theatrioal red-tape of the Kemble-Macready tra-
dition, of whioh the English stage has well rid itself by a series of
Emancipation Aots, passed by the leaders of generations of oppressed
I players nobly struggling to be free."
Mr, Drew, as the mad-cap, strong-willed, gay and gallant Petruchio,
I has to thank nature for nothing, and art for everything. He doesn't
look the part at all, but plays it within a few inches of as well as it
is ever likely to be played. To impersonate a man acting a part, and
to avoid appearing theatrioal and self-consoious, is exceedingly diffi-
cult, though just within the resources of dramatio art.
IFor Miss Rehan as Katherine I have unqualified praise. She
looks the shrew, she aots the shrew, she exhibits suoh demoniac
possession as can only relieve itself by inarticulate cries of anger,
and by violence of aotion sudden and uncontrollable. When being
starved into submission, Miss Rehan so enlists our sympathies,
even in the most outrageously farcical situations, that the men
in the house begin to think what a cowardly brute is Petruchio, and
what a shame it is to use this splendid creature so cruelly, when she
might have been conquered by kindness. But Petruchio is right;
"Katherine had once got outside a good square meal, he ana his
wboy whip, his Buffalo Bill swagger and his burlesque bluster would
tve had as much effeot on Shakbpeabe's Katherine as it has on the
ludience who are in the teoret. And then to note how Miss Rehan
s the audience who remain spell-bound by her wise and gentle
delivery of that excellent lecture on the duties of wives towards their
husbands, with whioh the play practically finishes,—the sentiments
of which lecture I noticed were greeted with rapturous applause by
the elder male portion of the audience, while better halves appeared
to be suddenly particularly engaged in getting at their opera-cloaks
and wrappers. I wonder how Mrs. William Shaxspeare liked this
finishing speeoh; that is, if dear Anne was alive at the time, and
ever went to the Theatre to 'see her husband's pieces. The sort of
pantomime " hurry" music played at the entrance of Katharine is a
mistake, though quite in keeping with the old-fashioned notion of
the character which Miss Rehan utterly dispels.
When the Daly Company has left us, the truth concerning this per-
formance of The Taming of the Shrew, will be summed up in two lines,
"Rbhan the Shrew
And Petruchio ' Drew'."
I advise anyone who doesn't believe in the possibility of this piece
being acted nowadays, to go and see Miss Rehan as Katherine,
and I fancy they will remain of the same opinion still, as, without
her. where would this muddle-plotted whimsical farce be? But
with her it is something to be seen says Jack in the Box.

irritable rush at him, and dragging him to the front, with
threatening gesticulations, sing the following Chorus.—

At the Avenue Theatre Mr. Arthur Roberts in the
course of The Old Guard, and d propot of nothing in
particular, suddenly appears as the celebrated walking
tin toy figure with the tax-on-wheels cart which has
occupied the pavement in the presence of admiring obstruc-
tionists for so lorn?. He walks half across the stage and
then comes jerkily to a standstill. A man enters to
wind him up, and again he urges on his jerky career, and
makes his exit satisfactorily, unless the assistant has
placed him in not quite a straight line, when the mechanical
Arthur Roberts is unable to go straight. If the Reverend
Gentlemen who take an interest in theatrical perform-
ances will visit the Avenue—no necessity for Clergymen
to " take orders," as they are supposed to possess them
already,—they will see Mr. Arthur Roberts, after the
manner of the "poor player," literally " strutting " his
short two minutes on the stage, and, by going straight,"
when put in the right way, conveying an excellent lesson
to the youth of enfeebled will. And thus the Drama is
vindicated as a great moral teacher.

of your answer.
4. Give the pedigrees and list of performances of any two of the
following hones—Ayrshire, Success, Galore, Morebattle, Bonaparte,
Nunthorpe, Chitabob, Honey Drop, and Camaralzaman. .Write
opinion stating the chances of any one of them for Manchester Cup.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
SXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, June 18.—Peers determined to reform
themselves. Going to let out some bad blood, and let in some new.
Not any longer going to stand Members of sacred order smoking
short clay pipes, wearing pea-jackets with sanoer buttons, fighting
in baok parlours, running theatres, or running away with other
men's wives. On other hand, going to strengthen Institution by
specially recruiting from outside. Imperious Ministers in the
Commons, when they don't know what to do with an esteemed, but
useless colleague, make him a Peer.
"Peers," growls Bramwell, "are men who have failed at the
Home Office or the Colonial."
"Sometimes," said Ckanbrook, who didn't like tone of remark,
"they 're failures as Law Officers of the Crown." Glanced with
subdued admiration at stately figure of Halsbuby on "Woolsack.
However, will be all right now; the Markiss taken matter in hand.
Brought in Bill to-night. Awaited with intense interest; listened
to with freezing politeness. Turns out to be one of the Markiss's
little jokes. Rosebeby, with high scorn, dilates on modesty of
proposal, but will vote for it as admitting though not meeting
necessity of reform. Dunbaven says ditto. Final blow given to
measure regarded as practical reform by Selbobne heartily approv-
ing it. Notion of Selbobne doing anything heartily rather runny.
Argyll back again out of the snow-storm. Regards Rosebeby
with freezing displeasure. "What," he asked, "is the Noble Lord
driving at in his speeches in this House and out of it?" Then
changing metaphor, and seeing visions, he continued: "Men who
have been Ministers of the Crown should not throw the great Insti-
tutions of this country at the heads of the people." House visibly
shuddered at the terrible pioture conjured up. Grand Cross regards
Rosebeby through dimmed spectacles.
"A Minister of the Crown, he murmured, "who would lift his
hand to throw the great Institutions of the country at the heads
of the people, except in kyindness "Emotion so overcame him,
sentence unfinished. Bill read a First Time.
Rosebeby said nothing. Bnt, speaking at "Willis's Rooms on
Thursday lightly alluded to Argyll as that portentous, political
pedagogue." Delicious 1
Business done.— Commons at work again on Local Government Bill.
Tuesday.—Sinclair came up to take his seat for Ayr. Result of
election not exhilarating for Government; absolutely demoralising
for House. Number of bad jokes made on subject unprecedented.
Professor Joachim, who loves his art, descants dismally on situation.
"Just one of those opportunities," he says, "that proves irresistible.
Jokes to be made about Ayr are obviously numerous, and not above
oommonest comprehension. The real high-class joke should have
subtlety in it. Always regard it as a failure if when I make a joke
more than three out of nine people see it." Sinclair's reception
hearty, but not quite so dramatio as when Evans oame. Lacked
Habcourt's assistance. Harcocrt just as much to do with winning
Ayr as he had with victory at Southampton. But engagement in
the country keeps him away, and Sinclair gets the cheers whioh he
deserved.
More Committee on the Local Government Bill; also another
defeat for Government. Bill proposes that Chief Constable shall be
myrmidon of Quarter Sessions; John Morley moves Amendment to
make him oreature of County
Councils. On Division, taken
in crowded House, Govern-
ment defeat d by 30.

sion from Scotch Members;
too bad to be brought away
prematurely from his haggis

Rates. Growls and glares. Nearly frightens life out of Sinclair.
Not used to these ebullitions. "Wallace, strategically getting near
the door, shouts out, "Lord-Advocate bears down, with the aid
of Eaglish Members, the opinion of the country he nominally
represents." Then "Wallace flees for his life, and great hush falls
on assembly. Lord-Advocate's hand instinctively goes in search of
claymore. If he'd found it, and could have come up with Wallace,
there would have been vacancy in representation of East Edinburgh.
But weapon not handy; Wallace fled; has time to subside.
"All very well, Toby," he said, when I suggested he might "take
it out" of Lyon Platfaib; "but this state of things evidently
can't go on long. Either these Scotch Members must be got rid of,
or the Markiss will have to carry on his Government without Me.
It is evident we can't breathe the same air."
Business done.—Getting on with Local Government Bill.

to keep " Darling Mine " out of the collection. He has ohosen three
distinguished Englishmen to lead off with, and has monographed

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday— is "Black Monday ".'
Tuesday.—The Barbiire. Miss Arnoldsew a most' piquante
Hosina, and Ravelli the Reliable a musically correct, but not a
dashing Almaviva. Navabbjni amelodramatio Figaro, and Edouard
de Reszke too majestio for Basilio,—not his line at all,—but in
both cases the musio has rarely been better sung. Ciampi revels
in Don Bartolo; Signor Randegger and the Orohestra revel in
Ciahpi. Jokes, presumably "gag," in Italian. Onlyone person in front
row of stalls, who evidently wishes everyone to know that he under-
stands Italian, laughs heartily. Signor Ciampi reminds me occa-
sionally of that eminent basso, Lionello Brougho. Mile. Bauer-
heister the Benevolent refuses encore for her duenna's song: very
considerate of her, as it is getting unoonsoionably late. Nobody
in the audience thinks what the time is, but only what the Tune is
while the Barbiire is being played.
Delightful to listen to the conversation, evidently intended to be
overheard, of a well-informed lady and gentleman behind me, who
are seldom right. "Here's Figaro coming," says the gentleman,
and immediately enters Almaviva. "This is Don Basilio," explains
the lady when Ciahpi walks on as Don Bartolo. In the Singing-
lesson scene Miss Arnoldsen gives us the "Shadow Song" from
Dinorah. "Ah. charming 1 " exclaims the gentleman in rapture, "so
like Rossini! Best thing he ever wrote." Arnoldsen encored, sings
"Home, Sweet Home!" "Well," exclaims the lady, rather startled,
"I never knew that was in this Opera I" "Didn't you, dear ?" says
the gentleman, delighted at the chance of setting her right and
at the same time imparting valuable information to his neighbours.
"Don't you remember it was introduced here, like the " Last Rose
of Summer " was in some other Opera, and Rossini stuck to it that
it was his own composition P I think there was a lawsuit about it."
"Why does she sing it in EnglishP" asks the lady. "Because
Arnolds»N's an Englishwoman," returns the gentleman conclusively,
as if the oircumstanoe were a matter of general knowledge to all
habitue's of the Opera.
Everybody delighted with Barbiire. Charles Hall, Q..C.t< in
ecstasies at the shaving scene; thinks of throwing up his practice,
dashing his wig, and taking to the Lyrio Italian Stage. Might suc-
ceed to Ciampi, if Dbttriolantjs has no objeotion. Mrs. Shaw, La
Siffleuse, is present, and thinks it all "sweet." She would very
muoh like to whistle Bosina's part in the Lesson scene.
"Reminds me of the time I was on the stage," observes the gallant
Swaine, A.D.C., leaning on his gold-headed stiok, "at Cambridge.
Used to sing then. Every air oharming, eh P" he says, turning to
a fine old English Gentleman in the lobby. "Except the Ayr of
Scotland," replies Signor Chaplini, as he turns on his heel and
hurries out into the wintry night.
Wednesday.—Faust'&gain. Enthusiastic Composer, who publishes
under the name of Walter Austin (and why not P), protests loudly
in the Hall " after the Opera's over that " never, never, in all his
life, since the palmy days of The Fire Kinp'&t Leeds, has he ever
heard such an ensemble, or seen acting like Lassalle's as Valentin*.
If," he continues, addressing Dr. Wtlde, and interrupting him just
as he is telling a cirole of interested listeners that everyone who made
a suooess on the lyrio stage had been his pupil at the School of
Musio, "If," says W. A., emphatically buttonhole-ing Dr. W., "it
hadn't been for the people coming in late and treading on my toes,
I should have passed the most enjoyable evening 1 ever remember
at the Italian Opera." "I see," returns the Doctor, somewhat
shortly—but brevity is the soul of wit,—" then you didn't enjoy it tn
toto;" and he escapes to his carriage, while the Composer strikes
the light luoifer from The Fire King's patent match-box, illumines
a oigar, and slowly walks out, pondering.
Thursday.—Fra Diavolo, for the first and only time this season.
Not seen it for years. Though every air in it is as familiar in my
ears as household words, yet as the Opera proceeds, I begin to doubt
if I have ever seen it before at all. Have mixed up the story with La
Sonnambula. Ravelli the Reliable more at home in the fun of this
part than he was as Almaviva,—which he also enjoyed, rather. In the
Bed-room scene he is decidedly more oomio than the second humorous
villain; in fact, Ravelli the Reliable revels in the Ridioulous, and
beoomes Reoklessly Rollicking.
Ella Russell, sprightly and coquettish as Zerlina, sings the
Diavolo Band-ditty well and dramatically. Muoh interest evinced
among the audience when she is at her toilet preparing to go to rest.
Ladies titter: gentlemen discreetly use lorgnettes. Being the Maid
of the Inn, she has to be up and dressed quite early in the morning,
in order to fetoh the hot water (" She looks fetohing," observes the
gallant Major A.D.C.), and to oall the visitors for the first coaoh;
otherwise the praotioe of going to bed in tiehtly-laoed stays, and
high-heeled shoes, cannot be benefioial to health, even in Italy. By
the way, what palatial apartments there are in the small Inn at
Pontresina. You would never imagine their existence from the
exterior as seen in the First Act.
Signor Ciampi, as Lord Rocburg (first oousin to Lord Allcash), is
made up after the oarioatures of the travelling English in a Frenoh
oomio paper. His very modem travelling costume is an anaohronism;
as his weeping whiskers, ourl-papers, and dressing-gown, are of the
Mantalini period. He reminds me of '' The Swell" in the pantomime,
who, when there were comic scenes, used to receive most cruel treat-
ment from Clown and Pantaloon. As a whole, Ciampi and Mile.
Lablache are a thorough burlesque couple; the lady being, of
course, the better half. I wait until the treaoherous villain gives
the signal for the bel capitan to oome into the trap, and then I rush
out to get into my own trap, for I cannot sit there quietly and see
Ravelli Riddled. Delighted with the musio. Signor Mancinelli
conduots his Bandits well and wisely. But I am told that this Opera
never was popular. Can't believe it: but oan't deny it.
Saturday.—Lohengrin again. Same splendid cast as before.
Evidently public prefer big Operas at Covent Garden to small ones.
Exhibitions have not in the least as yet injured Opera or Theatres.
Three or four Exhibitions can only injure one another.
Patented Title.—A Job-master starting in business asked a
poetio friend to seleot for him some appropriate title to put over the
entrance to his establishment. "You let out riding horses P " asked
the friend. "Exactly." "Well, then, advertise 'Excelsior I No
more buying and being sold; try the Exoelsior System!"' "Ah 1
but what is the Excelsior System P " asked the Job-master. "Why
the ' Hire System,' of oourse." And if the friend had been connected
with the Board of Works, he would have reoeived a couple of
hundred for the suggestion.
Sub (Punch-and-) Judice.—If, by the time this appears, Charles
Wood shall have gained his oase, tne verdiot may be appropriately
stated as "Good Wood."
ST. JAME3'8 THEATRE.—A Vacanoy. Great opportunity for
an experienced COIFFEUR in want of a first-rate Situation,
as, at the end of this Season, Mr. and Mrs. Kendal will lose their
Hare—all requests to Mr. and Mrs. K. that " they would keep their
Hare on," notwithstanding—and the Hare-dresser will, it is ex-
peoted, also quit the establishment.

TWO PROFESSIONS.
Wood, the Jockey, plaintiff in Wood v. Cox, cheerfully owned to
making £4000 a-year by Jookeysbip. No " Whine from the Wood"
about such an income. A Buooesslul Comedian makes from £40 to
£80 per week, and an average one about £15. What shall we try to
make of our boys—Jockeys or Comedians P 11'Tis better to have tried
and failed, Than never to have tried at all." Many a rising young
Barrister who heard Wood's evidence on this point must have wished
he had gone in for the pigskin instead of the woolsack, unless he felt
sure of being Lock-Wood, Q.C., instead of Chables Wood. As to
the Stage, there is the chance of becoming a Tree, which is not so
big, of course, as a Wood. But in this profession an amateur who
aims at being a Tree may finish by being only a stick. Mr. J. L.
Toole was present on one oooasion during this trial, when Lord Cole-
bidoe stated severely that he would not have his Court turned into
a theatre. "Quite right, your Ludship I" exclaimed the eminent
Comedian. "Too many theatres already." Mr. Tools at once

ROBERT AT A WENSON FEAST.

One of them nice liberral intelligent gennelmen who kindly takes
charge of the jewvenile Sheryffs, and turns 'em out at the hend of
their year of ofishal life quite fit and quite hegar for the more higher
office of Aldermen, asked about fifty of his worry hitst frends and
aq wain tenses to dinner at that nice little
f avrite house of mine, the Gildhall Tavern,
to do honner to a present of Wenson
sent to the Chairman by Her Most Gray shus
Majesty Queen Victoria herself, to show
how compleatly she was satisfied with his
oonduok as Hunder Sherryfl! What a
grand and nobel thing is Royalty! Sup-
posing as the appy and onered Chairman
had dun somethink to satisfy sumboddy
else, they would have most likely said,
thank you, Sir, and there an nend. But
with Royalty, back oums two splendid
Hornohes of Wenson, one a Buok-un and
one a Doe-un, and Royalty says in this
werry royal manor, "eat, drink, and be
appy!" And so they did, and so they
was. I never never seed a merrier party.
They was all quite fust-rate, with jest a
few grand old Deputtys sprinkled about here and there jest to give
a tone and a oharackter to the hole lot.
It was a werry elegant Menu, printed in red and gold, and the
contents, with one xseption, wurthy of the diatingwished cumpany,
and the appy Chairman. But what a xoeption 1 I appened quite
by chance to see Brown a looking at one, and then begin a grinning
and a showing of it to one of his brethren, and then they both
looked at me, and grinned again. _ So my kuriosity was natrally
xoited, and I took one up and red it. And oh, shades of Udy and
Frank Ertellt! what did my wandering eyes read? Between
the Sammon, the Turbot, and the Croquets, and the Roast Hornsh
of Royal Wenson, appeared the follering line, all in red cappital
letters, "Sucking Pig, Sauce Robert! !_ And, to add hinsult to
hinjury, the sauce thus named was what is known to the wulgar as
"Sage and inions!" I don't know when I have bin so shamefully
hinsulted, and Brown a ribbledry hadded another pang to my wounded
feelings. I don't mind confessing, now that it is too late, that one
of my werry fondest dreams was, when the inewitable time came
that I had not ennff patience for to Wait no longer, to leave my
honerd name assosihated with suoh a Sauce as shoud keep it in fond
memory for countless ginerations of Corporation diners.
The many hours I nave diddicated to this noble haspiration is
now all wuss than wasted! and O! the many boxes of no matter
whoose p- lis I have had to swaller when pursuing my many werry
trying xperiments 1 But all in wain; and one cruel blow from a
thoughtless Sheff has blited my fondest hopes, and lost me praps
quite a nice little propputy. But such is life I We builds up our
Carsels of Cards bier, and hier, and hier, and with tears upon tears;
and jist as we thinks we is a going for to put the finishing touch to
our great Pioter, our grand Statty, or an emortal Sauce, somethink
happens, and down oomes the labour of long ears, and we stands
elpless and agarst, amid the ruins of our wastid lives I
But a troose to these sad thorts, and let us, as the French says,
return to our Wensons. Well, our Buck wenson we roasted, and our
Doe wenson we braized, and amost everyone of the gestes tried both,
and werry few on 'em ooud tell one from t'other, xoept of course the
members of the Hepping Forrist Cummitty, who natrally knew both
by instinkt. Sum few of the werry sewerest of the wensonian
Criokits wentered to say as they didn't think as it had bin kept
hanging quite long ennff, but they all looked most remarkable small
when the Chairman informed 'em as he had kep it hanging rather
more than three munse. To be sure it was in a Cold Store, but still
hanging is hanging all the world over, including NewZeeland itself,
and it woud ha been rather unloyal to look a Royal gift Buok in the
mouth to see how long he'd been kept hanging.
The Chairman set the good xampel of short speeches, and all fol-
lerd suit. What a nobel thing it woud be if all Royal presents of
Wenson was consumed in the same natral and libra! way.

SECRET MEETING OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY.
(THURSDAY, JCNE 218T.)
Lord S-l-sb-ry and Chorus {fortissimo). "But soft I Wb must dissemble I"
ANOTHER LITTLE TALE OF "MR, Or."
Thx following little story of Mr. Gladstone, which is said by the
Manchester Guardian to be "highly characteristic of his versatile
intensity," was recently quoted from that paper by the Pall Mall
Gazette :—
"After an interesting interview with a prominent author whose acquain-
tance he bad newly made, in reply to a courteous hope that his lite and
strength might long be spared, Hr. Gladstone said: 'Yes, I confess I wish
to live, for two great objects. You can guess one of them. It is to settle the
Irish question. The other is to convince my countrymen of the substantial
identity between the theology of Eoan and that of the Old Testament.'"
Having been favoured with another little story of Mr. Gladstone
of the same kind, and one whioh seems to be, if possible, even more
characteristic of his versatile intensity, we subjoin it without
comment.
At the olose of a deeply religious controversy with a well-known
Archbishop whom he happened to meet at a Garden Party, in
response to a cautious inquiry whether he felt his life and strength
equal to anything, Mr. Gladstone muoh surprised his reverend
interlocutor by replying, "I should think so: rather. And I '11 tell
you what I 've got to do before I die. I want to sing the tenor's part
in the Huguenots, ride the winning horse for the Derby three years
running, go up in a balloon hanging on by my teeth, and give a eon-
i'uringandventroloquial entertainment at the Westminster Aquarium,
for is this all. I'm going to preach from the pulpit of St. Paul's,

double-tooth extractor from the Dental Hospital, drive the Dorking

him oough, and then rowing stroke in the Oxford boat next year
when they race Cambridge, and you may be pretty sure I've got
plenty of things ready to set my hand to. And what's more; I mean
to do em."
A New Character in Joummxisx.—The "Religious Editor "—
vide letter to Times, from the Editor of The Contemporary Pulpit,
about the Bishop of Peterborough's sermons—is a new oharaoter
professionally in journalism. "I speak not for myself," he writes;
the style of "The Religious Editor" being quite Apostolio—muoh
more so than that of the Bishop of Peterborough, whose letter of
oomplaint to the Times was characterised by flippancy, especially in
its joke about " Extra "—" I speak not for myself," writes the R. E.,
with all humility, "but for all Religious Editors, when I say," &o.
And what he does say is, that he is quite willing to pay for the
copyright of sermons by the Best Preachers, if each one will revise
his proofs, and put his name to his own discourse,—a proposition to
whioh, as it appears, very few of the Best Preachers are inclined to
accede. But, anyhow, "The Religious Editor " is delightful. What

tremble at the bare possibility of snoh a notion.
