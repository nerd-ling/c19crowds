Decemmr 29, 1888.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SCENE— Mr. Punch's Sanctum. Season—The Ece of the New Year. Preterit, Father Time, Mr. Punch, and Tobias. An Edisonian
Phonograph, of the latest construction, it arranged, oracle-like, behind a curtain, the Sage and the Scythebearer have been
experimenting therewith.
Father Time (with emphasis). Wonderful!!!
Mr. Punch. From you, who have witnessed so many wonders, that o le word is a tremendous tribute which my young
friend Edison would mightily appreciate.
Father Time (meditatively). Yes; I have seen many marvels—or what for awhile were esteemed such. But the mirific'
marvel of to-day has ever been the matter-of-course of to-morrow, or at most of the day after. A real niue-days'-wonder is
indeed an exception. Still this latest of Yankee "notions " is a startler. My favourite Egyptians never achieved anything
more surprising.
Mr. Punch. You don't mean to say that your pets the Pyramid-builders did not forestall us poor moderns in this, as!
in most other things? Very good of them, I'm sure, to leave us something to discover!
Father Time (drily). What to do with the Soudan, for example. You don't seem in a hurry to avail yourself of that
privilege, however.
Mr. Punch. Ah! I wonder now, were it possible] to turn on the voice of Ramese3 through this vocal cone, whether he
could give the Marquis the straight tip about Suakin?
Father Time. If Memuon himself could speak through the phonograph, in the very voice of oracular music with which
he used to greet the rising sun in old Thebes, do you suppose that your Party potterers would heed it?
Mr. Punch. Humph! Isn't it whispered that the Priests—the real politicians of the period—had something to do
with that little Coptic "fakement;" that in fact the lips of the Vocal Memnon formed merely a convenient sort of
phonograph for the official oracles—the Salisburys and Smiths and Stanhopes of that day?
Father Time. I perceive, Sir, that you know a thing or two.
Mr. Punch. Otherwise, my KnoNos, it would hardly be worth your while to halt for an hour's chat with me on the
very edge of the New Year. Pray givo your glass another turn, though; I cannot part with you yet. And the other glass,
dear Edax Rerum, turn that up likewise—no heel-taps, you know, here !—and let me fill it again.
Father Time (sententiously). It is passing good—and too good to pass. (Drinks.) Your health, my Perenuial One!
| You are not of an age, but for All Time, as Ben Joxson' said of the other Immortal. "She " indeed! What was Rider
Hagoard's two-thousand-ycar-old compared with the unquenchable " J/e-who-must-be-obeyed" of Fleet Street?
Mr. Punch. You do me proud, Sir. But, by Jove !—beg pardon for naming that usurping parvenu !—you will have,
1 my dear Kronos, to look to your laurels, or your prescriptive rights and privileges, if this sort of thing goes on.
Father Time. What do you mean, Mr. Punch?
Mr. Punch. You know what Edgar Allan Poe says :—
"ScienceI true daughter of Old Time thou art!
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes."
Well, it seems to me, Father Time, that your daughter is gradually depriving her sire of certain of his most cherished

| attributes and most exclusive prerogatives. Space she has practically annihilated; and now she is having a turn at You!
Time was when what was past teas past, when what Edax Remm had once devoured knew no resurrection. But now?
Well, when Science can thus make the vanished Voices of the Past actually audible Voices of the Present, then, in the words
of the Hibernian Magistrate in "Killaloe "—
"Ye never know what she '11 bo up to next."
Already she has beaten Munchausen* on his own ground. Frozen words made audible by thaw? Pooh! What is that
! compared with the awe-striking possibility of the ipsissima verba of eloquent Gladstone, or honcy-tongued Leigh-ton, or
j ventriloquial Irving, being ground out of this instrument, for the editication, or Edisouitication, of dwellers in the tail-end of
j the Twentieth Century!
Toby (fortissimo). Bow-wow-wo-o-o-o-w!!!
Father Time (anxiously). What's the matter with that dog? He —he—seems to be asleep, and yet
21/;-. Punch (laughing). Don't alarm yourself, Krosos. Tody is asleep, so soundly, that even his own bark—of the day
before yesterday—does not awaken him!
Father Time (with awe). What, do you mean to aay it was that inf that extraordinary instrument of Edison's
that was yelping like that?
Mr. Punch. Precisely! Toby barked into it for me a day or two since. His wax-recDrded yelp may be useful to
frighten burglars in the year 1989. Had Axubis done ditto several thousand years ago, we could now compare his yaps with
those of the modem Dog of Dogs.
Father Time. Here, I say, don't! It's really uncanny, and, as you suggest, knocks my traditional prerogatives into
a cocked hat!
Mr. Punch. Never mind! After all, 'tis Vox et pratterca nihil. American Scientists are as impotent as were Egyptian
mummy-makors or the Embalmers of Kor, really to bring back the Past or to perpetuate the Present. And the Future is
Ours—as Mr. Gladstone says of the Liberal Party.
Father Time. Quite so. You may find the phonograph useful, to record for the benefit of remotest posterity your
words of wisdom and scintillations of wit; eh, Mr. Punch?
Mr. Punch. My dear Kronos, do you not see that, practically, I am as independent of this remarkable and really
interesting instrument as you are of an improved egg-boiler or patent lawn-mower? I am perennial, and have a Phonograph
—or Funnigraph—of my own, invented long before the days of Edison.
Father Time. Indeed! I should so like to see it.
Mr. Punch. You shall, dear Edax. Indeed yon shall take it with you, if you like. It will amuse and instruct you on
your lonely round between now and next New Year's Day,—when I hope to see you here again. You will find therein echoes
of the most valuable Voices of the Past, the best and brightest utterance of the Voice of the Present, and not a few vocal and
vaticiuatory " dips into the Future!" Oh, don't be alarmed; it is not a cumbersome and complicated bit of mechanism, like
this of Edison's. It is compact and portable. Tuck it under your arm, Father Time; it won't interfere with the comfortable
carrying of your scythe and hour-glass, I assure you. For Mr. Punch's original, ingenious, unsurpassable Patent Funni-
graph is his
flkcfg-Jiflj; tMtnte!

OUR DEBATING CLUB.
The election of a new member to the Gargoyle Club is so seldom
attended by any incident of note, that I may be pardoned, perhaps,
for devoting this paper to the description of almost the single excep-
tion in our annals. It is our invariable custom to transact all business
of this sort before proceeding to debate: and on the evening in
question Plluley Duff, who had proposed the candidate for elec-
tion, rose to give the information necessary to enable them to
pronounce upon his claims to admission. Now Duff had very
good-naturedly undertaken the duty at the suggestion of Bosher,
who had represented that the recommendation would fall with far
greater weight from him, and that, in Duff's hands, the election was
safe.
"Well, Gentlemen," said Duff, in his most matter-of-fact style,
it is not usual to say much on these occasions. I can only remind
you of the value of a little new blood from time to time in our councils.
When. I have said that Mr. Scipio P. Goliboise is a member of one
of our most ancient Inns of Court, the Under Temple, and is
fitting himself to take an active part in the profession of the Law, I
think you will see that he has—ah—fair qualifications for election as
a Gargoyle."
Then Geyser primed by Bosher, rose with his usual impetuosity.
"I must say, Gentlemen," he began, "with all deference to our
friend, Mr. Duff, I don't think he has laid Mr. (eh P yes, thank
you, Bosher!) Goliboise's claims to our votes before us with all
the earnestness and thoroughness he usually devotes to whatever he
takes in hand. He has suppressed—no doubt, inadvertently—a very
important fact in connection with tho Candidate which, in my humble
opinion, will appeal strongly to your imaginations. Mr. Goliboise
is a representative of one of the most thriving of the dependencies of
our great Empire. He comes to us, Gentlemen, from the Island of—■
(which? ah, just so)—the fair and smiling island of Sangaree. I put it
to you whether it is not our duty to lay aside all minor considerations,
and, in this Jubilee time, give the world a striking instance of the
brotherly feeling which unites the Mother Country to her Colonies!
Let there be nothing of ungracious, of grudging, of perfunctory,
in the response we make to his application for admission; a hand,
Gentlemen, is stretehed out to us from across the seas—let us not in
the palm we hold forth in return, conceal the invidious form of one
solitary black-ball!" {There was a murmur of admiration at this
fine image.) "Let us for once be unanimous in throwing our portals
wide open to receive the stranger who stands knocking at the door of
the Gargoyle Club!" [Loud applause.
There was no necessity for any further speech-making, but Percy
Vere would get up; he always will whenever he sees the slightest
opportunity, for his great idea is that oratory comes with practice,
and that it doesn't so much matter what you say, so long as you gain
a little more confidence by saying it.
So Percy Vere began very fluently: "As to the remarks of the
Honourable Member who has just sat down, I only wish to remark
that the remarks he made were remarks "(Here he looked about
him in a distressed manner) "remarks which were very ably—er,
very ably remarked. I can't help rising to say that I have no—that
I rise without any—I—I mean . . . that I don't feel a—a .... (I
could tell you the word if I could only remember the name—it's
curious how you forget things standing up!) oh,—what I meant was
hesitation!"
Having arrived at this point, he sat down very contentedly.
"I won't add any words of my own," said Pinceney, "to the
eloquent pleas (here Percy Vere looked deeply gratified) we have
just listened to. The Secretary will now distribute the balls, and
the ballot-box will then be brought round in the usual manner to
each member."
"I am happy to tell you, Gentlemen," our President announced,
after a scrutiny of the box, amidst much enthusiasm, "that Mr.
Goliboise is elected without a single dissentient voice! And now
let us proceed to the motion before the House, which is"
"One moment, Sir," said Bosher. "I believe the new Gargoyle
is below at this instant, waiting permission to take his seat amongst
us. "With your leave, I will now invite him to do so."
But this quite innocent proposal brought up Porpentixe: "I
must really protest, Sir! It looks to me as if the Candidate,
by coming here this evening, must have regarded his election
as a foregone conclusion; as if—I am about to conclude with a
motion, Sir. . . I move—' That, having regard to circumstances
with which the Club was previously unacquainted, Mr. Goliboise
be now informed that his election is still under consideration.'"
Geyser (rising excitedly). Really, Sir! really! Are we to punish
Mr. Goliboise for his very laudable impatience to join our societyP
Is his ignorance, pardonable in a stranger, of our customs to be
thrown in his teeth like this? A thousand times no, Sit*! I call
upon Mr. Porpentdte to withdraw his motion; otherwise, I, for
one, will not continue a member of this Club a single day! No, Sir,
not one hour—not one minute—not one instant—(lowering his voice
impressively)—not one week! (Cries of " Withdraw!" and some
excitement^)
Torpentine, (rather sulkily). I beg to withdraw the motion.
Pinceney. Then, if Mr. Bosher will introduce the new Member
as he proposes, I shall now call upon Mr. Geyser to bring forward
the subject for debate, which is in the following terms:—" That this
House is of opinion that all Racial and other distinctions are invi-
dious and reactionary, and should be abolished."
Bosher had already disappeared, and, as the President spoke,
there were steps outside, and presently the door opened, and Mr.
Goliboise made his first entrance into the Gargoyle Club.
He walked up to the vacant chair next to Geyser's, which Bosher
had vacated (by the way, he did not reappear that evening), and sat
down grinning from ear to ear, evidently nighly pleased with himself
and us, after which he devoted himself to rolling nis eyes, and suck-
ing tho top of his walking-stick.
I trust that we did nothing unworthy of our character as Gargoyles
and as gentlemen; but I am bound to confess that our new Member's
appearance excited a certain sensation amongst us which could not be
wholly disguised.
For Mr. Goliboise happened to be a remarkably fine, specimen of
the pure African type. It made no difference, of course, but we
should like to have been a little better prepared.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
At bidding of misshapen things,
That drive them blindly to and fro,
Dealing from out their rascal rings
Inevitable woe!
That motley drama—oh, be sure
It shall not be forgot!
With its Phantom chased for evermore
By a crowd that seize it not,
Through a circle that ever returneth in
; To the self-same spot;
And much of madness, and more of sin,
And swindling the soul of the plot.
But see amid the mimic rout
A wizen thing intrude!
A shrivelled shape that rides about
With despot power imbued!
It spurs!—it whips!—the Swells, the Snobs,
The vampire treats as food,
And the nooles that it rides—and robs—
Are to its will subdued.
Down—down on all fours are they all,
The sordid, sold, fool-flock,
The fierce whip-lashings fall
Like storm-flouts on a rock;
And the dupes, from counter or Court,
That wizened thing doth mock:
The play is the farce called " Sport,"
And its hero the Conqueror Jock!

THE EX-PENSIVE PRESIDENT, R.B.A.
Thhee weeks ago we asked, "Who is Mr. Wyke Bayliss ?" beyond
being the President-Elect of the Society of British Artists in lieu of
the Licensed Whistler, James I., deposed. We are now answered.
The gentleman has been interviewed by a friendly Figaro who
furnishes us with the following facts:—
"Mr. Wyke Bayliss, when a student at the British Museum, did
not limit his attention to the Elgin Marbles," but on the other hand,
"as a Chess-player, he held, last year, the cup for the county of
Surrey."
He is, moreover, "Chairman of the Board School in his District,"
"Member of the Diocesan Council of Rochester," and besides being
"Public Orator of Noviomagus" (what on earth is this?), he is
"Honorary Fellow of the Society of Cyclists."
It is quite clear from all this that Mr. W. B. was born for Suffolk
Street, and Whistler, the Painter, was there decidedly out of place.
And now having discovered Wyke Bayliss, Pres. Elec, we have
four questions to put to anybody who can answer them; t. e., "Who,
What, or Where is 'Noviomagus'?" And "Why has he a Public
Orator all to himself?"
Shady Places foe Hot Weather.—During the past week, Lord
Dttnxaven, as Chairman of the Sweating Commission, Lord
Herschell with the Board of Works Inquiry before him, and the
Lord Chief Justice with the Great Turf Libel case, might have been
represented at Madame Tussaud's as iEacus, Minos, and Rhadaman-
thus, in a Modern " Chamber of Horrors." Their effigies might have
melted, but their Lordships themselves are made of sterner stuff.
THE WANDERING VETERAN.
{A Legend of Wimbledon.)
The Old Man sighed as he walked into Richmond. The children
laughed at him, and their elders tossed their heads in scorn. But
he did not mind. He leant on his weapon, which served him as a
staff, and strode sturdily onwards. Soon he was in the Park. He
sank on one knee. In a moment he was accosted by an official.
"Move on!" said the official.
The Old Man wiped away a tear, and obeyed the order. He
passed through fields and gardens, and now he was at Epsom. Once
more he had prepared to make a stay.
"Move on f" again shouted an official, and the Veteran was forced
to submit.
And so he wandered from place to place—everywhere unwelcome,
everywhere abused.
At last he lay down on the ground, and could go no further. In
spite of the rough requests of the officials "to get up and be off," he
staved where he was. Indeed, he could go no further.
Where have you been'( " they asked, nim.
"All over the country," he replied, in a faint, voice; and then he
told them how he had journeyed from place to place, and never was
allowed to settle.
"And who are you?"
"The surviving Member of the National Rifle Association; " and,
with a faint smile upon his thin lips, and forgiveness in his heart of
hearts, for H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge, the last of the Volun-
teers calmly died.
The Conservative Tent just now.—Discon-tent.

WHAT OUR

"Parblbu, uoy ami! you know ze French Proverb—'Qui dort, disk'I"
JOTTINGS FOR THE TIMES.
(From the Duke of Downshire's Journal.)
A very weary day. Don't think I can stand this Omnibus driving business
much longer. Having to go to the Bluemantles' crush as soon as I get home
to-night, dressed before I took the reins in the morning, and have been got up
in fuU fig, ribbon of the Garter and all, under my overcoat on the box all day,
so as not to keep the Duchess waiting. She says I look "crumpled." Don't
wonder at it. Six times from Hammersmith to Whitechapel and back is enough
to take the starch out of anybody. Think, however, the Duchess has been
put out, finding the new Dressmaking business she set up in Bond Street not half
so satisfactory as she thought it would be. She has tried to tone down the
"shoppy" side of it by offering her customers five o'clock tea, and by en-
deavouring to invest the whole business with a little social glamour, but she
says that our pork-butcher's wife, whom she supplied only last week with a
ruby velvet, came and complained quite nastily that the dress did not fit her
properly in the back, and on the Duchess smiling amiably and saying she saw
nothing amiss, retorted that " Business was business, Duchess or no Duchess,"
and that when she "paid good hard 'money for what she ordered, she expected
good honest work in return."
This sort of thing is, I am bound to say, only what I expected. I was not,
therefore, surprised to hear that my two dear daughters, the Lady Constantia,
and the Lady Feodora, had had some disagreeables with the Principal of the
Regent's Street Bonnet Establishment, in which I had just succeeded in placing
them with so much difficulty, and had determined to throw the whole thing up.
Then, again, tho Fried F ish and WheLk business in Marvlebone, which I had
made such sacrifices to secure for Plantaqenet, appears likely to turn out a
disappointing investment. He says that, after his life in the Guards, he cannot
somehow take kindly to the calling. Well, poor boy, he may be assured ,that
it is not one that I, his father, would have selected for him, as the heir upon
whose brows mv Ducal Coronet must eventually descend—still, what was I
to do? The only other thing in the market was a " Sausage" concern.
My second boy, Bertram, seems, I am glad to note, fairly satisfied with his
butcher's calling, and dons his blouse and shoulders his
tray with the best of them. Still, the outlook is not
cheering, and if Plantagenet backs out of the Fried
Fish, all I can say is," Heaven help him!" Sometimes
I think if we could give a drawing-room entertainment,
and appear at a Music-Hall as "the Duke of Down-
shire s talented troupe," we might perhaps make ends
meet. I should still look respectable in spangled tights;
but with Beaumanoir and the Dashworth estates both
mortgaged over the hilt, it's clear that something must
be done, and that quickly. Ha! here is the Duchess! She
looks well in what, trying to raise a miserable laugh
among ourselves, we call, in wretched satire, the "family
paste.' No matter. I will taUc the subject over
her. But the slavey

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday, June 25.—Lovely music to LI Flauto Magico. The
commencement of one son£ sung by Monostatos (Signor Rinaldini),
a kind of Mozartised Christy Minstrel, reminds me of "Ah, bravo,
Figaro." It has probably reminded a good many persons of the
same air long ago, but the Opera is to me a comparative novelty.
Exciting story,—a triiie mixed. What I gather from it is that
Ravelli the Reliable is an Egyptian called Tamino, (evidently some
familiar form of "Tommy")—and that Tommy the Tenor, falls in
with three Ladies, one of whom is Mile. Dotti, which is a painfully
suggestive name, but there is no lame attempt about her singing, no
"Dorri-and-go-oney," but, on the contrary, she is majestio and
impressive, more "DoTTi-on-the-eyey" kini of performance; and
the other two are Mile. Desvtgxes and Madame Scalchi, who is,
as it appears, also in another line of business as a Real Genius (no
one ever doubted it, of course) associated with two other Geniuses,
Miss Louise Lablache and Mile. Bauermeisteb; and without the
last mentioned no cast at Covent Garden Opera can now be considered
complete. Well,—Tommy the Tenor, meets one Papageno (Signor
DelPuente),—a person in the ridiculous costume of a kind of Parrot
in full feather,—and Tommy having been presented with a golden
flute and a temperance blue riband, and Papageno having received a
set of musical bells, they find themselves in, apparently, the Egyptian
Court of the Crystal Palace; and here Tommy gives a solo to some
Pantomime Monkeys and profile Lions, Tigers, Rhinoceri, and
Elephants—quite a '' monster concert." Papageno makes some comie
niggers dance by playing on his bells, but beyond this they make no
particular use of their magic gifts.
Then Tommy makes love to Miss Minnie Hauk, impersonating
the remarkably fine grown-up daughter of Miss Ella Russell as the
I Queen of Night, who, for the loss of the infantine Minnie, is draped
| in black, representing the curious spectacle of Night and Mourning
all in one. Then Miss Hauk is interviewed by her mother, Miss
Ella Russell, who sings such astonishing top-notes as quite take
away her breath, the mother's, that is, and bo she herself wisely
declines the vociferous encore; but, before she retires, makes a
handsome present of a dagger, perhaps to be used as a paper-knife,
to her daughter Minnie, who, having accepted it unwillingly,
promptly loses it.
Then the Mozartian Christy Minstrel annoys poor Minnie with his
too demonstrative attentions, and she is rescued—she is always being
rescued—by Tommy the Tenor, who, having lost his magic flute as
Papageno has his bells, has had it restored to him by the three gifted
Geniuses (who have also restored to Papageno his lost bells), and
then Miss Minnie, assisted by the three distinguished Geniuses in
I costumes such as Geniuses wore many, many years ago, before Gaiety
I Fairies were invented, is taken away by Tommy the Tenor, and is
forthwith seen taking, as it appears, a sort of Turkish bath with him
in.the pleasantest manner possible, he playing the flute the while,
and both decently attired, of course; and afterwards they stand
under a mountain torrent by way of douche—and what the douche
it all means I don't know, but the foregoing story is something
like it, without mentioning Miss Abnoldson as Papagena, the bride
of Papageno—she ought to have been Mammagena, of course—and
without mentioning the High Priest, who being a Basso, is a very
low priest, and ought to have been Edouabd de Reszkb, but wasn't,
—having been metamorphosed by magic into Signor Nov aba,—and
without going into any of the wonderful details and describing the
grand Transformation Scene at the finish ("Thought there was
going to be Harlequin and Columbine," grumbles H.RTI.'s Attorney-
eneral, Q.C., M.P., to one of the Organising Committee, as he takes
up his hat and slowly emerges from the box. "Should like to have
seen Ravelli as Harlequin, and Abnoldson as Columbine,—charming
Columbine, begad! ") I should say that a better performance of the
most muddle-headed Extravaganza ever invented has rarely been seen
at Covent Garden. Could hear it all again with pleasure, hut not see
it. The only singer who reaUy seems to thoroughly enjoy it is
Scalchi. Abnoldson looks very pretty as Mammagena. She
ought to be brought on earlier. Why shouldn't she be the Princess
as well? She could "double the parts" as Scalchi does; but
Scalchi is " the First Genius," and can do anything. Any Manager
has a treasure in Scalchi. Can call upon her for a song at any
moment, and never make a mis-Scalchi-lation. Which is a crypto-
grammic joke: so hidden.
A TURN AT THE HANDEL. ♦
The Crystal Palace can now and then offer attractions by which
crowds may be drawn, as they have been in the week past by the
Handel Festival, without advertising the edifying spectacle of a
woman hanging on by her teeth to a rope attached to a balloon;
though at first sight one is afraid lest the names of Albani, Nob-
dica, Lloyd, and Santley, at the Palace, should not be sufficiently
attractive in themselves without adding some gymnastic feat to
their fine musical performances.
The Oratorios went Bplendidly, and the Selections on Wednesday
brought together a select audience. The Grand Old Manns of the
C. P. might have written something better himself than the speci-
men of The Triumph of Time and Truth," and have called it
"The Triumph of Time and Tune," which is a hint for next
Festival. Santley in first-rate voice, with " Honour and Arms ;"
so also Lloyd, with his "Love in ha 2?ye«," (no connection with
"Two Lovely Black Eyes"), which he sang deliciouslv.
The G. 0. M. of the C. P. accepted the encore of the Occasional
Overture for this occasion only, but Albani and Nobdica refused
flatly—the only note of any flatness in the entertainment—to accept
any encores, no matter how they might be pressed on all hands.
Madame Nordica charmingly sang, "Hush, ye pretty wobbling
Choir," addressed, of course, to the Handelian Choristers, who
evidently bridled up at the insinuation of unsteadiness, and refused
to "hush," rendering their fortissimo with such precision as to prove
the charge of their being "pretty wobbling," to be absolutely without
foundation. [A friend, who knows nothing about it, has suggested
to me that when I say " wobbling" I mean " warbling." Absurd!
If I meant " warbling" I should warble.] No one at the organ can
be better than Best. In fact the whole performance was so good
that as everybody wanted to have everything over again, this " Choral
Festival" may be memorable as the "Great Encore-all Festival."

Something Fubtheb about "Mr. G."—
Mr. Gladstone was reported last week as
having said that, among some of the few
tilings he had to live for was to show " the
substantial identity between the theology of
Homes and of the Old Testament." We
believe he since added to this the idea for
demonstrating that the Six Days of Creation
must be understood as six "Parliamentary
Days."
Pedestbianism at Lambeth.— In the
course of a series of amusing articles on the
Established Church, the St. James's Gazette
suggests that the legal-ecclesiastical diffi-
culties of its position at home and in the
Colonies is "a case in which, in a marked
degree, difficulties will be solved ambu-
lando." Yes, certainly—a good deal of
"Walker" about this remedy. It might
be tried this week at Lambeth.

COLERIDGE CORRECT.
Lord Coleridge in a recent case made an observation, to which
we have already drawn attention, to the effect that he could not un-
derstand how anyone with such an honoured name as "Moses" could
ever consent to change it for, e.g., "Mordaunt." The Handelian
Festival brought this remark of the Lord Chief Justice's vividly to
our mind. Where would be the force of substituting " Mordaunt"
for "Moses" in Israel in Egypt f Or to take a great work by
another Composer, Mote in Egitto, how would Mordaunt in Egitto
or Montmorency in Egitto sound r No; Lord Coleridge is right.
But is he not always right?

my humble opinion overdid it. Rimini doesn't; it is all fact! There's

the case to admit the esprit d'escalier,—when I read out about the
"'orreries" in the school prospectus, and remarked on the defective
sanitation, "On 'orrery's head 'orreries accumulate."
Yours ever, L-ckw-d.
"We are in quite another World," Lord Coleridge is reported to
have said in his summing-up in the Wood case. The well-known
line from The Stranger can now, on the Lord Chiefs authority, be
thus quoted, "There is another and a Betting World."

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
April 28.—At the office, the new and very young clerk Pitt, who
. was very impudent to me a week or so ago, was late again. I told
I him it would be my duty to inform Mr. Perkupp, the principal. To
my surprise Pitt apologised most numbly and in a most gentlemanly
fashion. I was unfeignedly pleased to notice this improvement in
his manner towards me, and told him I would look over his un-
punctuality. Passing down the room an hour later, I received a
smart smack in the face from a rolled-up ball of hard foolscap. I
turned round sharply, but all the clerks were apparently riveted to
their work. I am not a rich man, but I would give half-a-sovereign
to know whether that was thrown by accident or design. Went
home early and bought some moro enamel paint—black this time,
and spent the evening touching up the fender, picture-frames, and
an old pair of boots making them look as good as new. Also painted
Gowing's walking-stick, which he left behind and made it look like
ebony.
April 29, Sunday.—Woke up with a fearful headache and strong
symptoms of a cold. Caheie, with a perversity which is just like
her, said it was "painter's colic," and was the result of my having
spent the last few days with my nose over a paint-pot. I told her
firmly that I knew a great deal better what was the matter with mc
than she did. I had got a chill, and decided to have a batli as hot
as I could bear it. Bath ready—could scarcely bear it so hot. I
persevered, and got in; very hot, hut very acceptable. I lay still for
some time. On moving my hand above the surface of the water, I
experienced the greatest fright I ever received in the whole course
of my life, for imagine my horror on discovering my hand, as I
thought, full of blood. My first thought was that I had ruptured an
artery, and was bleeding to death, and should be discovered, later on,
looking like a second Mabat, as I remember seeing him in Madame
Tussafd's. My second thought was to ring the bell, but remembered
there was no bell to ring. My third was, that it was nothing but the
enamel paint, which had dissolved with the boiling water. I stepped
out of the bath, perfectly red all over, resembling the Red Indians I
have seen depicted at an East-End Theatre. I determined not to say
a word to Cabbie, but to tell Fabmebson to come on Monday and
paint the bath white.
April 30.—Perfectly astounded at receiving an invitation for
Cabbie and myself from the Lord and Lady Mayoress to the Mansion
House, to " meet the Representatives of Trades and Commerce." My
heart beat like that of a schoolboy's. Cabbie and I read the invita-
tion over two or three times. I could scarcely eat my breakfast. I
said—and I felt it from the bottom of my heart—" Cabbie, darling,
I was a proud man when I led you down the aisle of the church on
our weddinj
I lead my
Mansion House
I am pretty in your eyes, I am happy. You, dear, old Chablte, are
not handsome, but you are good, which is far more noble." I ^ave
her a kiss, and she said, '' I wonder if there will be any dancing i I
have not danced with you for years." I cannot tell what induced
me to do it, but I seized her round the waist, and we were silly
enough to be executing a wild kind of polka when Sarah entered,
grinning, and said, "There is a man, Mum, at the door who wants
to know if you want any good coals." Most annoyed at this. Spent
the evening in' answering, and tearing up again, the reply to the
Mansion House, having left word with Sabah if Cowing, or Cru-
mings called we were not at home. Must consult Mr. Perkupp how
to answer the Lobd Mayob's invitation.
May 1.—Cabbie said, "I should like to send mother the invita-
tion to look at." I consented as soon as I had answered it. I told
Mr. Pebkupp at the office with a feeling of pride, that wo had
received an invitation to the Mansion House, and he said, to my
astonishment, that he himself gave in my name to the Lobd Mayor's
Secretary. I felt this rather discounted the value of the invitation,
but I thanked him, and in reply to me he described how I was to
answer it. I felt the reply was too simple, but of course Mr.
Perkupp knows best.
May 2.—Send my dress-coat and trousers to the little tailor's
round the corner to have the creases taken out. Told Cowing not to
call next Monday, as we were going to the Mansion House. Sent
similar note to Cumminos. _
May 3.—Cabbie went to Mrs. James, at Sutton, to consult about
her dress for next Monday. While speaking incidentally to Spotch,
one of our head clerks, about the Mansion House, he said, "Oh, I'm
asked, but don't think I shall go." When a vulgar man like Spotch
is asked, I feel my invitation is considerably discounted. In the
evening, while I was out, the little tailor brought round my coat and
trousers, and because Sarah had not a shilling to pay for the pressing,
he took them away again.

WIGS AND BONNETS.
My dear Mr. Pcncii,
You are always so very kind to Ladies that I am quite sure
you will do your best to assist us to obtain the redress of a littl
grievance that has caused us a lot of worry recently. You know
how fond we are of trials—especially a criminal one, where a nice
interesting murderer is put in the dock, and has to fight for his life.
It is such fun! But, alas! my dear Mr. Punch, the resources of the
Central Criminal Court are of the most limited character imaginable!
I can assure you there is scarcely ant/ room on the Bench, and some-
times it is absolutely necessary for Ladies—accustomed to every home
comfort,— to
put up with
wretched seats
in the body of
the Court! We
want you to
get all this
altered for us.
Cannot the Old
Bailey be re
built, or some-
thing?
AVhat makes
the matter the
more irritating
to us is that at
the new Boyal
Palace of Jus
tiee everything
is so very nice.
My sister and I
the other day,
were on the
Bench with
that dear Lord
Chief Justice,
and you cannot
think how ex-
cessively nice it
was! We had
such delight-
fully comfort-
able chairs, and
the "L. C. J."
(as our barrister
young friends
call him), was
so amiable!
The dear good
creature scarce-
ly gave himself
any room at all
so that we
should not be
crowded! And
then the Lun-
cheon! Well,
I will not say
anything about
that, as (like
the Duke of
Portland's let-
ter), it was a
private matter!
But really and
truly it was
such fun!
We laughed
and talked to

Lockwood, who, everyone says, is so clever with his pencil. If
he sketched her, I am sure it must have made a pretty picture, because
he seemed to be so pleased at attracting such attention!
If the Lord Chief Justice would let us bring a camera into Court,
we could have great fun! Now, dear Mr. Punch, pray don't forget
about the C. C. C, and, believe me to be, always yours sincerely,)

THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FHOH
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 25.—Great field-night. Go-
vernment arraigned. Indictment set forth by John Mobley in
speech full of gems of literary style. Old Mobality formally led
into dock. Makes a lovely criminal. Air of unimpeachable respecta-
bility worth anything to counsel for defence.
"Sort of man sure to be bailed out," said Chables Russell, look-
ing at him with professional eye.
House crowded at outset, but specially in Galleries. "Three
Lord-Lieutenants looking down upon us," said Joseph Gillis,
rlancing up at Peers' Gallery. "It's like Napoleon—or was it
Wfalington ?—marching his men past the Pyramids, so that he
might say thirty centuries were looking down on 'em."
Joey B. nodded with friendly recognition to SrENCEE and Abee-
deen. Rather cut Londondebey, who had snatched an hour from
arduous duties at Dublin Castle to sit in Senate. Deeby there,
as usual without Joan. But Stbatheden had brought Campbell to
recreate his great mind by taking a turn at Irish affairs. Stbath-
eden and Campbell—"Siamese twins of la haute politique" as
Rosebeey calls them—nn audience of themselves. Sit by the hour
with grave face looking into space. "If they hadn't been bora to
share British Peerage," said Geoege Cuezon, who is an authority on
the subject of Peers, "would have made a reputation as Chief of the
Apaches, or any Indian tribe where a look of unutterable wisdom is
qualification for leading position."
On the whole, rather a dull evening. Everybody intensely inte-
rested, of course; fate of Ministry in balance, and all that sort of
thing. Still, after first couple of hours, Members began, as it were,
to fold their tent like the Arab, and as silently steal away. Just before
Nine, House so empty, occurred to anonymous humorist (probably
Joachim) to try Count Out. That would have been funny to have
Members summoned from ends of earth to attack or defend Ministry,

A.M. — Over at

O'Brien began it with speech an hour long. Better have been forty
minutes. But mercifully moderate compared with what followed.
Chaplin, not to be outdone by Irish Member, spoke for over an
hour; then Gladstone for an hour and forty minutes. Next thin
end of the Gedoe modestly inserted during blank dinner-hour. Then
Balfoub for two hours and ten minutes; and, finally, Sexton, for
as long as House would listen to him.
Harttnoton spent miserable time for last forty-eight hours with
speech laboriously prepared. Haecoubt sat on Front Bench all night
big with impromptus, packed to his boots with repartees. Wind Bag
Sexton appeared on scene
with his perpetual smile of
ineffable scorn, his illimitable
waste of words. Habtinoton

speeches. Sexton sure to go

Pleased beyond measure with
h imself. So wrapped up in charms
of own eloquence didn't notice that
Balfoub after first three-quarters
of an hour had slunk away. Went
on with same irritating everlasting
smile, pointing finger of scorn at
unoffending Old Morality, who
had incautiously dropped in Chief
Secretary's vacant seat.
Speech of the evening decidedly

vitriolic in its bitterness; irresis-
tible in its marshalling of facts
and arguments; bold and feli-
citous m its illustrations. Pity
the greater part of it was delivered
at top of his voice, creating _ circle
of stone deafness within imme-
diate area. Gestures terrific, and
dangerous to personal safety of
Members sitting underneath. But
speech finely conceived, inimitably phrased, good enough to com-
pensate for these remedial drawbacks.
"Erin-go-Bragh !" cried Plunket, momentarily falling into his
native tongue, in admiration of compatriot's native eloquence.
"Splendid! But reminds me of what Ccbban said of Grattan, that
he used to scrape the ground with his knuckles as he bowed in speak-
ing, and thanked God he had no peculiarities of gesture."
Business done.—Vote of Censure rejected by 366 votes against 273.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Doctor Gbandolph, D.C.L., turned up.
Not been here much since Degree conferred on him. Bather expected

"No gestures!'

he'd appear in cap and gown. But same now as when he was General
Gbandolph, V.C., or Lord High Admiral Gbandolph, K.C.B.
Modesty still his guiding star. Dropped in quietly, and, as far as
possible, unobserved. Channel Tunnel Debate on. Gladstone
supported Second Reading of Bill. A little awkward that Doctor
Gbandolph should be shareholder in concern. But trifles in the way
of logical difficulties never insuperable. When he became a share-
holder was in private capacity. In opposing scheme in Commons he
appears as a Statesman. Gladstone takes other side. Delightful to
see Dr. Gbandolph gently shaking ferrule at Old Boy- laments
his deficiency of knowledge respecting military and naval matters.
On tie whole not in bloodthirsty mood. Old Boy let off very gently.
Early evidence of the Doctor's new erudition displayed in lavish
quotation. Taken a leaf out of Old Mo-
rality's copybook. "Let well alone," ob-
served the Doctor just now, with look of
supernatural wisdom. "Better is the enemy
of Good," he added, by way of peroration.
"Yes," said Old Morality, unusually
moved by this audacious incursion on his
copyhold, "and Imitation is the sincerest
Flattery.5'

But Watktn not a bit disheartened.
"Wonderful man!" said the G. 0. M.
"Fancy I shall live to make him a Peer
yet. Dover Pierage of course. Shall sug-

Closing Clause of Local Government Bill.
Government propose to drop it. Harcoubt,
who might have slated Clause had Govern-

part of the Bill. Can't Dart with it on any
account. Incidentally birches Caine. Ring s/r,\
immediately cleared. Heavy weights, about \&
same height, and fairly matched. Conversa-
tion most edifying. Lord Tannel-Chunnel.
"Yah!" cries Haecoubt.—"Boo!" says Caine.
"Get 'long with yer Barrow!" says Haecoubt.
"Uncle Pumblechook," roars Caine, who is a student of Punch.
"Where did yon borrow your Latin grammar'i " jeers Haecoubt.
"Political lurcher!" cries Member for Barrow, and Haecoubt
retires with this brand of Caine red on his massive brow.
Wilfrid Lawson gave genial turn to debate by dropping into
familiar Latin quotation. Turned out, to amusement of House, that
in this respect Wilfrid's strong point is quality not quantity. Timeo
Dan&os et dona ferentes, was his way of putting it.
"The long and short of it is "said Wilfrid, summing up.
"That you put the long where the short ought to be," said Bryce.
But Wilfrid not to be daunted. Immediately after dragged in
another, even more familiar, tag.
"Care canem!" he said, looking at Caine.
"That's Dog Latin, eh, Toby?" said Henry James.
Business done.—Licensing Clauses omitted from Local Government
Bill. In this way we 're getting along quite nicely with the Bill.
House of Lords, Friday.—Our Only General at it again. Wemyss
made a back for him, with wordy Resolution raising question of
National Defences. Our Only took it flying, lumping on Geobgie
Hamilton, whom he accused of making "wild, extravagant, mis-
leading statements on subject of vital importance to nation." The
Dook to the front again, apologising for having created scare, and
explaining away his intentions.
Fact is, Toby," he said, when it was over, "it's my personal
Sipearance that's against me. Can't help looking warlike ana fierce,
y martial bearing strikes terror into casual observer. I must dis-
semble." Wemyss's Motion utterly ignored in course of debate.
Nobody said word for it, or against it. So Lords, always, polite,
made up for slight by accepting it.
Business done.—Local Government Bill in Commons.
History Repeats Itself, with variations,—as may be seen in the
Wood v. Cox case. What will remain in men's minds long after
other details of the trial have been forgotten will be the Duke
of Portland's confidentially free-and-easy communication, which,
like Lord John Russell's celebrated Epistle in the "Papal Aggres-
sion" time, will be known as "The Durham Letter."

VOCES POPULI.
AT A WATER-PICNIC.
Miss FritiUa Papillion (arriviitg at landing-stage with her brother).
Why, Teddy, isn't that Stella Cinnebshaw?
Mr. Papillion (dissem-
bling his rapture). Is it? I
daresay.
[Looks carelessly about, and
wishes he had had a new
ribbon put on his straw.
Mr. Petticure (elderly, but
of youthful exterior, who has
undertaken the control of the
expedition). Then we're all
here now r I've told them
to get the boats ready. I
thought we'd just pull
quietly uptoEelbuck Island,
land there, and have our
picnic and—and what not,
and drift comfortably down
in time for the last up-train,
eh?
[General Chorus of "De-
lightful!" "Charm-
ing." fyc.
Miss Manley (observing
Mr. Buncombe s elaborately
aquatic attire). I needn't ask
it you are going to row.
Mr.Bunc. (modestly). Oh,
if I'm wanted. But they
seem to have nothing but
fixed seats in these boats. I've got so used to a slider.
Mr. Papillion (who has been making some highly artful arrange-
ments on his own account, coming up to Miss Cinnebshaw). I—er—
think you 're in my boat, Miss Cinnebshaw?
Miss C. (with a sweet smile). Oh, am I? Then we'd better be
getting in, hadn't we?
Petticure (arriving at the exact moment when Mr. Papillion,
overjoyed at his success, is handing Miss C. into boat). Here—here,
stop a bit—let me see, Papillion, you 're going to stroke, eh? Very
well. Defaddeb bow. Miss Moule steering. Capital!—but Miss
Stella? No, no, that won't do—can't spare you; must have you in
with us!
Miss C. (with, if possible, a still sweeter smile). Must you? Oh,
very well.
Pelt. And, Papillion, I'll put somebody else in Miss Stella's
Slace. Ah, Miss Squeams . . (in an undertone) nice chatty girl—you
on't mind about looks, I know. That's all right, then, you 're
settled!
Going Up-Stbeam.
Miss Moule (to Mr. Papillion, who is rowing with the gloom of a
galley-slave). There's nothing more delightful, don't you think, than
an excursion on the water? It's the right string you pull when you
want to go to the left, isn't it? I never can remember! And there's
a barge or a steamer coming.
[Mr. P. just conquers temptation to leave her to exercise her own
discretion.
In the Second Boat.
Mrs. Ballast. Trim the boat, Mr. Rullocks! Now, what a pretty
poetical idea of yours! But you must wait till.we get to some water-
lilies.
In the Third Boat.
Miss Manley (stroke, to Mrs. Dedwayte). Could you manage to
• keep her head a little straighter. dear?
Mrs. Dedw. I am trying as hard as I can, Atalanta—but it will
keep going to one side!
Mr. Buncombe (in a gallant manner, to Miss M.) Afraid I'm
pulling you round.
Miss M. (who has been rowing with one hand for the last half-
minute). Are you indeed? I didn't notice. (Mr. B. executes an
elaborate backfall.) Don't apologise; I suppose you forgot you were
on a fixed seat.
[Mr. B.,from the bottom of the boat, is understood to attribute
the accident to some peculiarity in the button of his oar.
The boat which carries Miss Cinnebshaw sweeps gaily by Mr. Papil-
LIOn's; Miss C. is rowing under Mr. Rullock's supervision.
Mr. Butt, (with a tender patronage). Better, Miss Cinnebshaw,
much better! Don't cover more than the blade of your oar, and drop
your wrists at the finish—beautiful indeed!
Miss C. I shall soon get into the way of it, now I have someone
to coach me properly.
Mr. P. (grinding his teeth, to Mr. Defaddee, who is inserting an
oar in the water placidly at intervals). Shall we—er—quicken up a
bit, Sir?
Mr. Def. Eh? Rest a bit? By all means, by all means!
[He easies.
Miss Papillion (playfully, from Miss C.'s boat, as it rapidly
recedes). Goodbye, Teddy, dear, don't overtire yourself!
[He hears her voice from afar informing Miss C. that poor Teddy
is getting quite round-shouldered.
Miss Squeams. Don't let us hurry, Mr. Papillion, it's so much
nioer to glide gently along. And by-and-bv, when we get to a quiet
part, I want you to teach me how to row. I've so often wished to
learn, but I'm such a dreadful coward in a boat—with most people!
On the Island.
Mr. Papillion (after landing, and finding himself close to Miss
Cinnebshaw). I hope (huskily) you had a pleasant row?
Miss C. On, delightful! I rowed part of the way, and then Mr.
Rullocks and I towed.
Miss Fritilla (to her brother, archly). Teddy, how disgraoefully
you behaved with that Miss Squeams—we saw you!
[Mr. P. thinks people ought to knoio belter than invite a felloio
with his sister to this sort of thing.
Mr. Pett. (to numerous private inquiries). It's no good—we can't
do anything till Buncombkr boat comes up; they've got the cham-
pagne, and the knives, and all the plates—and they 're not in sight yet!
Mr. P. (making a second approach to Miss C). I don't think this
party has been very well managed.
Miss C. Oh, don't you? I thought Mr. Petticube arranged
everything so beautifully!
[Mr. P. is about to explain what he considers tcere errors of judg-
ment, as Mr. Petticube comes up with an immense bunch
of grasses.
Mr. Pett. (with the air of an authority on costume). I've been
wondering all the morning what it was your hat wanted to make it
absolute perfection, Miss Stella! Allow me—one moment—there . . .
(he fastens bunch into her hat) charming—charming!
[Miss C. submits as sweetly as ever.
Mr. Pap. (indignantly, as Mr. Petticube ambles off). But you
don't approve of that, surely!
Miss C. Oh, no—it's hideous, but I can't take them out very well
now, can I?
[Mr. P. is about to express his sense of her angelic consideration—
when his sister intervenes as tisual.
Miss Fritilla. Now, Teddy, I want to talk to Stella very particu-
larly. Go and make yourself useful with the hampers, or there's poor
Miss Squeams all alone there!
Mr. Buncombe's boat arrives an hour late, with Miss Manley and
Mrs. Dedwayte in shocking bad tempers, as he has volunteered
to steer, and broken two sculls getting into a lock; B. is as
serenely pleased with himself as ever, and says the Conservators
ought to make the lock entrances wider.
Miss Squeams (to Mr. Papillion). I thought Mr. Buncombe was
such a " crack oar," as you call it?
Mr. Papillion (who is feeling misanthropic). I don't know what
you expected—but he's smashed two already.
After the Picnic.
Mr. Petticube is secretly depressed because a young man in a
burst of effusion has wished that he had a father like him.
Several Ladies " think they felt a spot of rain." Packing begins
in confusion.
make some
get back as
Pett. (coming ttp to Papillion). Look here, we must
alterations going back. Miss Manley's very anxious to
soon as possible—so's Miss Cinnebshaw,
Pap. (trying to repress his delight). Yes? and you want me to,—eh?
Pett. Exactly, old fellow, to take Miss Atalanta Manley's
place in Buncombe's boat.
Pap. And—er—how's Miss Cinnebshaw going?
Pett. Oh, in my boat—it's the fastest; witia Miss Stella and
Miss Manley, and Rullocks, rowing randan, we can drop down in
no time, and take some of the old people on with us—you and Bun-
combe can manage without a cox, I daresay.
Outside the Station.
Bunc. There's plenty of time, I tell you. What's the matter
with you? You've been as grumpy as a pig all the way down. I
told you I didn't feel up to doing much work coming back. Of
course I shouldn't have run into the bank if I'd seen where I was
going; but, after all, the damage to the boat won't come to much,
etwecn us, and it didn't delay us half an hour! What, just missed
the last train? Well, I thought it was rather a forlorn hope—but
your sister will be all right, you know. And you and I, old chap,
must keep up one another's spirits at the Hotel, eh?
[Papillion, who has been reckoning on the railway journey as
his last chance, is incapable of replying.

A B B R so equivocally, is his old friend and leader,
Lord C L; opposite to tnem stands, by the side of

patrician stamp of man; vet the whole figure and atti-
tude of him wanting in determination, self-possession,
energy; and when he speaks a multitude of words with
scant meaning of a satisfactory sort, all eyes look doubt-
fully upon him—for his name is Lord G e H jr.
But he plays the game as one that loveth it, hugging
the bowl caressingly, as a miser his money-bag, and
eyeing the "jack" as keenly as an angler eyeth his
bobbing float when a big fish is nibbling thereat, and
the creel is empty, and supper-time draweth nigh, and
the inner man speaketh sharply forth in favour of grill
and goblet. Verily, 'tis a little game, this British Bowls,

patriotism as to—well, other considerations that need
scarce be set down in detail here. Skill thereat, like

diplomacies of parchment and protocol, argueth little for
a man's merit as citizen, state-servant, or patriot.

aquiline beak, and back adorned with a sort of decorative

were, ducks and drakes in the day of danger. A petty
game, and an unpatriotic. Blurt for them, sneak-ups!

As the outspoken Admiral hath it, 'These same beggarly
croakers be only fit to be turned into yellow-hammers up
toDartymoor, and sit on a tor all day, and cry, "Very
little bit of bread, and no chee-e-se'."' Many alarmist
scribes and factious ex-officials there be whom I should
rejoice to see served incontinently in such sort. The
yowling yellow-hammers onlv so cry what time they are
out in the cold. Snug-nested, and safely perched, they
pipe rose-water optimism of a shallow soft every whit as
pernicious, in its own foolish way, as the frog-like
cacophony of the croakers. I'figs, were I Admiral of
the Fleet, with such marsh-murmurers and parrot-
prattlers on board, I'd hang the whole herd of them as
high as Haman, if they didn't clap tompions in their
muzzles pretty fast. Marry, sneak-up, say I again.

bowls, and British honour for stake, I hold that no true

near out of his head.*
The man was a rough, rollicking, beardless young sea-
dog, who had just burst in from the tavern through the
low hatch, upsetting a drawer with all his glasses, and
now came panting and blowing up to the First Lord of
the Admiralty.
"My Lord, my Lord! They 're coming! I saw them

"The' Armada, your Lordship,—the enemy! But as

the eagle-beaked bystander aforementioned.

said Lord Charles, turning to H n.
"And it's this, my good Lord," said H N, looking
up as he aimed his bowl, "How slow soever they come,

NAVAL INTELLIGENCE;
Or, What may be Expected up to Date.
Heb Majesty's ironclad, Staggerer, having yesterday taken her crew on
board with a view to joining in the forthcoming Naval Demonstration, but
being still unprovided with ner guns, it was determined, before she started,
to test her capabilities of offence as a war-ship by a little preliminary
"ramming" practice. The harbour being crowded at the time, afforded a
favourable opportunity for essaying the test in question. The operation, which
appeared to create some surprise among the local shipping, was in every way
successful, a passenger steamer, several yachts, three or four colliers, and a
steam-dredger being in turn all sent to the bottom in a remarkably short space
of time by the Staggerer accomplishing its task with perfect facility, as it
made several vigorous and unexpected runs up and down the wreck-strewn
water. _ It is rumoured that the incident will probably form the basis of an
official inquiry.
A rather serious accident is reported as having occurred yesterday afternoon
on board Her Majesty's belted cruiser Perambulator. It appears that the
Purser's Mate having dropped a three-penny bit in the magazine, incautiously
entered it with a lighted oandle, and letting a spark fall on the fifteen tons of
powder stored there, ignited the whole, with the result of blowing out the ship's
bottom, and otherwise seriously disabling her. It is said that the occurrence
will, in all probability, form the subject-matter of an official inquiry.
Last evening, the turret-ship Boot-jack, while slipping her cables for the
night, suddenly headed on towards the ironclad Magog, and as she was bearing
down on her, the order to " go ahead at full speed" having by some unaccount-
able mischance been given instead of that to go astern," an inevitable collision
was the result. The Magog had an entire watertight compartment stove in.
while the whole of the bows of the Boot-jack were carried clean away, and
both of the vessels were towed inshore in a sinking condition by the rest of the
Fleet. It is reported that the untoward contretemps will very likely afford
material for an official inquiry.
Last night there was again the usual collision in the dark among [the torpedo
boats, and three more went to the bottom. _ It is rumoured that the affair will
shortly become the subject-matter of an official inquiry.

"QUITE A LITTLE (ROMAN) HOLIDAY."
(A Page from History, more or less remote.)
The day for the Triumph of Titus had arrived. It had been
delayed for a season, as it had been desired (to quote a print of the
period) "that the Italian Exhibition, per se, should first 'win its
spurs' on its own merits." Again to refer to the same authority, "it
had done so, and the Colosseum was opened with a view to give
Englishmen some idea of Ancient Roman Sports and Pastimes in a
more realistic form than had ever been previously attempted." And.
to more fully carry out this intention, the Directors of the " spurred
(and possibly " booted") Exhibition, made a charge, varying from six-
pence to 36s., to those Members of the British Publio who desired to
avail themselves of the boon thus generously offered to them.
The Colosseum itself had a strange appearance. One-half of it was
filled with a motionless audience of persons in the costume of Ancient
Rome, while the other moiety contained a few languid spectators,
garbed in the costume appertaining to the close (or rather clothes) of
the Nineteenth Century. There was a flourish of trumpets, followed
by music, in an orchestra of exceptionally early Romans, whose
instruments, however, were of far more recent date, and then the
Triumph of Titos commenced.
First came a line of Roman Guards, whose helmets were brave
with coloured worsted. They were succeeded by rows (fully ten
men to every one of them) of Etruscans, Gauls, Legionaries, and Pre-
torians. They, in their turn, were followed by Gladiators, "Young
Gladiators" (who seemed well qualified to accept engagements of a
Terpsichorean character), Lictors. and many others. Then came the
Emperor and Empress standing (somewhat unsteadily) in a chariot,
remarkable chiefly for an entire absence of springs. Thev were suc-
ceeded by more Young Gladiators," Consuls, Vestals (judiciously
veiled), Matrons (seemingly not many years older than their imme-
diate predecessors), and Slaves. It was a motley throng, and one
that certainly gave to Englishmen " some idea of Ancient Roman
Sports and Pastimes in a more realistic form than had ever been pre-
viously attempted." And as the beholders came to this conclusion
they murmured to themselves, "So it is written in the programme—
good old programme!"
Trrus and his illustrious Consort having taken their places in a
sort of roomy and draughty private box, the Sports and Pastimes com-
menced. First there were wrestling bouts" that gave not only an
excellent idea of Ancient Rome, but also an admirable recollection of
modern everywhere else. Then followed foot-races that were as full
of local colouring as the "wrestling bouts." These over, and the
"gladiatorial combats" commenced. They were certainly peculiar,
especially a contest set down in the official programme as " the Roman
Quintet. Not surprisingly, the quintet consisted of five men—a
gentleman with a sword and four warriors in helmets, shields and
weapons all complete. The gentleman with the sword (who wore the
unpretending costume of an acrobat) for a while indulged in a fight
of two to music which fight of two gave some idea of the combats
once popular in the minor theatres of the mighty Metropolis.
Wearying of this, he produced a second sword, and, still to music,
engaged in a contest with all four of the warriors, frequently waltzing
about in their midst. This eccentric behaviour apparently caused the
warriors to die of fright, and consequently left the acrobat master of
the field, and ready to receive a wreath from the Emperor as a token
of his victory.
The "gladiatorial combats" were followed by some chariot-races
that rather suggested the idea that the animals engaged therein
might possibly belong to that useful breed of steeds known to the
moderns as " wild omnibus horses." Then came a contest between
"the net and trident," which caused less awe than merriment.
Ultimately one of the gladiators was wounded, and appealing in vain
to three vestals of substantial proportions, who indulged in "police
verso," for mercy, was done to death. Then it was that his conqueror
tried to drag him out of the arena. For some time the dead man was
motionless, but the journey being a long one, his legs ultimately
became revivified, and obligingly assisted in the rest of his lifeless
form's removal.
After this came—to quote the programme—benevolent and ancient
document!—' 'jthe teaching of the Young Gladiators." This instruction
proved to be a dancing lesson, and "the Young Gladiators," to judg_e
Irom their physique, might have taken part in the days of their
vouth in a Burlesque at the Gaiety or a Ballet at the Alhambra.
More " Ancient Roman Sports and Pastimes" followed, and then, with
a grand processional march, the Triumph of Titus ended, never to be
seen again, save at the hours of " 4 and 8'30, wet or dry, daily."
And as the small crowd of languid spectators dispersed, one of the
more languid (thinking of the Wild West and the Paris Hippodrome
of a bygone day) murmured to himself, "'Wet or dry —well-
beloved and antiquated announcement!—again and again, ' good old
programme!'"
GRAND PROSPECTS FOR "STUFFING BOYS."
Me. Blundxll Maple's an amusing witness before the Sweating
Commissioners, who have all had a good deal taken out of them
during the past muggy weather. He is reported to have said, on
Thursday last—
"A boy who was engaged in stuffing could rise to any position in the com-
mercial world."
Whereupon somebody among the audience shouted out, "No!"
which interruption evoked a rebuke from the Chairman. Then
Mr. Blusdell Maple explained how he had meant that
"The boy could rise to any position as a stuffer."
And this correction of Mr. Blundeb Maple's—(name altered for
the occasion)—was received with " laughter." But wasn't he per-
fectly right at first? What better training could there be for the
honourable position of an Alderman,—which counts for something in
the commercial world,—than a course of "stuffing"? And as a
"stuffer," if he only stuffed enough, he might at last rise to be a
good old-fashioned English Mayor of the traditional type. For these
are degenerate days. We haven't had a stout Lord Mayor for some
years; there's scarcely a portly Alderman to be found in the whole
Court, and not a nose of any importance worthy of the Ward of
fine old crusted Portsoken. No Blunder, Maple, but you 're abso-
lutely right; and if an improvement can be introduced into the City
breed of Mayors, the Sweating Commissioners will not have sat, and
Mr. Maple's evidence on " stuffing boys " will not have been given,
in vain. The problem, "What to do with our Boys," is solved. Make
them "stuffing Boys"; and, like other boys, they have only to
"cram" sufficiently, to be able to rise—(sounds difficult for any bov
"stuffed " or " crammed ")—to any position in the commercial world,
and become worthy members of the Big Corporation and full-sized
Lord Mayors.

Harrogate, or Buxton, instead of Aix and Homburgh? You will find
the merits set forth in Black—and white. Give the "Continong" a
rest for a bit. "Better," says the village Hamlet, "to bear the
aches you have, than fly to others [Aix in Savoy, Aix in Germany)
that you know quite enough of." I have been there, and still
wouldn't go,—not except upon compulsion. As for the seaside, well,
the best air anywhere is to begot in the Isle of Thanet (which doesn't
want Home Rule at present, and is perfectly satisfied with a decreased
majority against it) whether you go to Blushing Birchington-on-8ea,
to the "Wild Westgate, to Merry Margate, Baby Broadstairs, -or
Refreshing Ramsgate.
The German Reeds have a lively entertainment just now, entitled
Wanted an Heit—to which I reply, "The Air of Thanet is all you
can possibly want." But there are more seasides than one to this
question, and Black's move on the board is Whitby, Bridlington,
and Scarborough, the first being far and away—well, it is "far,
and a considerable "way "from London—the best. The Tourist
must not forget to take Tracked Out with him. The title is
suggestive of a fruide-book. but it isn't anything in that line. It is
a sensational shilling novel, written by Aethtjb a Beckett, who is
the author of Fallen among Thieves, The Ohost of Greystone
Orange, The Mystery of Mostyn Manor, and who will, no doubt,
in due time produce Picked up among Pickpockets, The Filtered
Phantom of Felkirk's Folly, and The Crime of Crickleicood Creek.

A MUSIC SCORE.
Tuesday.— Vn Ballo in Maschera. Fairly good all round, as a
Bath ought to be. Jean de Reszke plays splendidly. Good point
that of his, making a pause just before " JS Scherzo." "I think
Mario used to do it," says Alfr-d W-ts-n, who wanted to follow
the score closely, but, having so many sporting and dramatic things
to think of. has brought a volume of the Badminton Library by
mistake. Verv annoying," he says, "but between Acts can
read the Duke of Beaufort's preface; always amuses me,—nearly as
good as first chapter of Pickwick." "De Reszke's first-rate in
£ Scherzo,' eh? says H-r-ce F-rq-h-r, appealing to H.R.H.'s
Attorney-General. "First-rate!" returns the Attorney; "reminds
me of a chap in some burlesque who used to sing, 'Let Dogs
delight to Bark and Bite' to the same tune. Went wonderfully,
begad." "I remember," observes Lord R-v-lst-ke, "it was in a
classical burlesque—Gods and Goddesses—all the Olympians." At
this moment Lord L-th-m looks into the Omnibus Box, but catching
the word " Olympians " withdraws.
M. Lassalle rather cold, but warms up for " Eri tu," which, it
strikes me, he sings to perfection. "That's a prettv compliment to
the audience," observes a gallant Major A.D.C. to Mr. Alfr-d, who
smiles sweetly, but remembers something similar having been said
by Sydney Smith, and glides away from vicinity of the Major.
Arnoldson's face and voice both pretty. Madame Roixa not so
effective here as she was when representing one of the Don Giovanni's
easy victims, not qtiite such a Rollaking part. Scalchi, as Ulrica,
of course,—where would Un Ballo be without ScALcm? "Where,
indeed! sighs the composer who writes under the name of Walter
Austin (and for a very good reason); "but," he adds, kindly, "if
Scalchi only had a few lessons from me, you'd see what an Ulrica
she'd be!" Mise-en-scene unexceptionable. Total,—good; but not
the best thing this Season.
Wednesday.—Day out for Operatic Birds. Druriolanus gives
grand "Three o'clock" at St. James's Hall. ,Goes "like One
o'clock." Albani, Nordica, Ravelli, & Co.
Thursday—" Guglielmo," or our old friend "William" Tell. Big
House. Bless my dear eyes! what, William .'" exclaims Lord
Charles, and splits a pair of brand-new white kids when applauding
'the grand trio and magnificent chorus at the end of Second Act.
'He knew it would be a success. "Sure, didn't I 'Tell' you so?"
says the Deputy Judge Advocate General to Druriolanus, who
is beaming again at the appearance of an entirely new set of ballet
costumes worn by Merry Swiss Girls, Merry Swiss Boys, and a novel
array of Bounding Swiss Beefeaters. ., " Can't be Swiss Beefeaters,"
objects C-mpb-ll Cl-rke, who lives on the Continent, and knows
more of Switzerland than most people would imagine; "must be

of conspirators, Edouard de Reszkk as Walter (not of The Times,
but of this Opera), and Lassalle as William .' Both "very tine ana

them, but he's only "a mealy-mouthed constitutional Leader,"
only a foolish O'Donnell or a mildly genial Justin M'C'arthy
against the gigantic Swiss Parn ell and. Davitt, "nobly struggling
to be free." This is an Opera that Floral Hall enjoys. He looks
upon Guglielmo Tell as a Home Rule work, and wishes the 0.0.M.
were here, instead of gardening-partying at Dollis Hill. "Dollis,"
says the Floral One, very much in earnest, "sounds too like Mario-
nettes, but here'8 the real thing." "Ah," sighs S-th-rl-nd
Edw-rds, who remembers the palmy, and the Grisi, days, "com-
Sared with Mario, all modern tenors are but Marionettes"—and
own this goes in his note-book, in which, like Count Smorltork,
he is collecting material for his next new book to be entitled,
Changing Tenors, a companion to his latest Prima Donna in two vols.
Act First ends with the excited exit of Edouard de Reszke and
De Vaschetti going outtoboganning, and disappearing down a steep
incline. Act Second ends magnificently. Act Thira ends noisily.
The pippin has been shot off little Jemmy Bauermeister-singer's
head, and when presented to Grim Gessler (Signor Miranda), the
Tyrant of the Tyrol, proves to be an apple of discord. Act IV. An
apple—no, an appeal to the Cantons—Suivez mot J" by Arnold,
who, with a sword, goes through Arnold's exercises, rescues The
Grand Old William, saves the boy, is married to Matilda McIntyre,
a Scotch Italian—(same sort of family combination as The Scotch
Italian, McIavelli)—who has done what was expected of her in first-
rate style. So in Guglielmo Tell, or the Story of the Apple, all ends
Apple-ly, as it ought to do. Don't think Tell a heavy Opera, not as
done here to-night: full of life,—" Tell" est la vie. Too long; not
life, but Opera.
Saturday.—Considerable excitement to hear new" Carmen. Every -

Gallant and-far-from-Rustic Swatne, Major A.D.C, says, with best
French aocent, "Can't have trop de ZSlie here." Applause. After
First Act bosquets, not bouquets, carried up on to stage. Out of one
of these Pretty Prima Donna wrenches flowering shrub, as a Reward
for Ravelli. the Reliable. After Second Act, same business with
Signor Manclnelli, who receives small tree for his good conducting

The projected visit of the Emperor of Germany
to the Czar is (says the Ttmes Paris Correspondent)
"considered to be a guarantee of peace, in view of

Must be accepted! Well, I'm sure I'm

Although the flaunting war-hosts Europe

The Emperor, old or young, must be a zany
Who yearns for wanton wars.
A zany, ves! But then my ardent lovers,—

I wonder now whether your love for me
Is a soul-fervour or a mere speech-fashion.
Well, we shall shortly see.

They say you love me with a burning love;
You would not see it wandering perchless,

Mr. Parnell. Mr. P., if I thought you looked upon me as the
mean-spirited, sanguinary creature the Times would make me out,
I'd—I d—well, there now, I'd be sorry for you.
Mr. Punch. No necessity for sorrow or anger. I laugh at all
that's laughable, even when it's contemptible. I assume every
man's innocence until he is proved guilty beyond all possibility of
doubt. Therefore I assume that you and your party are innocent of
the complicity in these crimes with which you nave been charged.
Mr. Parnell. And you don't believe a word of it at all, do you now?
Who in his senses can believe that I, or Pat Egan, ever wrote such
trash as was put forward by the Times?
Mr. Punch. I am in my senses, and I say, as every judicially
minded man must say, that if these letters are forgeries, if your
treasurer, Pat Egajt's, letters are, as he wrote to our friend Labby,
M.P., " villanous concoctions," then why do not you, with the Parisian
Pat, and others of your party, unite, and bring an action against
the Times f
Mr. Parnell. Why should we?
Mr. Punch. Why? Because the cause which you have at heart
will gain the sympathy of all liberal-minded Englishmen, if you
purge yourself and your party from all taint of crime, and thus
confound your accusers.
Mr. Parnell. Those who would believe that I wrote "make it hot
for old Foestek," or that Pat Egan wrote as he is represented to
have done, would believe anything.
Mr. Punch. Just so; and the majority of Englishmen, "from
information received" at the trials of the American Irish Dyna-
miters and Phoenix Park murderers, will continue to regard you and
the "constitutional leaders," he they "mealy-mouthed" or not,
suspiciously, until you yourself take up the gauntlet the Times has
long ago thrown down, and bring a civil action for libel, or place
Proprietor, Editor, Printers, and Publishers in the Dock oi the

Mr. Parnell. See here now! When the Times first attacked me,
you may remember I offered to have the whole matter sifted by a
Select Committee of the House?
Mr. Punch. An offer the Government obstinately declined, sug-
gesting that you should bring your case before the ordinary tribunal.
Mr. Parnell. And would I have a fair trial?
Mr. Punch. Before an English Judge and Special Jury? Certainly.
Mr. Parnell. If it were only myself, you see ... . but—there, I
can't do it.
Mr. Punch. If a person in a responsible position charges a private
individual with complicity in murder, then I should say any man.
conscious of his innocence, would prosecute the utterer of so foul
and malicious a libel.
Mr. Parnell. But isn't an Irish gentleman's word as good as that
of the Times t Why certainly. And suppose, now, I'd publish a
pamphlet charging the proprietors, publishers, and the whole of the
Times crew with conspiracy and with aiding and abetting forgery,
where'd I be then?
Mr. Punch. Try it, and you'll see. Floreat Hibernia! Good

Well-informed Subordinate. Indeed, I do, my Lord.
Exalted Admiralty Official. Come, that is satisfactory. And how
about the men? Have you whipped in the Reserve, hunted up the
Coastguard, and supplemented the deficiency of stokers by the enlist-
ment of the local bathing-machine men?
Well-informed Subordinate. We have, my Lord.
Exalted Admiralty Official. And the stores? You are sure that
the several Departments have provided respectively supplies of
marling-spikes and tinned rabbits, hammocks, rum, sardines, gun-
powder, tarpaulins, coals, Patent Medicines, mixed biscuits, and other
necessaries m sufficient quantity to enable the Fleet to put to sea for
three days without replenishing?
Well-informed Subordinate. I am nearly sure, my Lord.
Exalted Admiralty Official. And you think that, after this secret
three months' preparation, if mobilisation were to be, so to speak,
"sprung upon" you officially at a supposed .twenty-four hours
notice, you would be prepared to mobilise r
Well-informed Subordinate. Well, my Lord, I think we should—
almost.
Exalted Admiralty Official. And you are of opinion that the country
would be immediately impressed with the idea that the whole thing
had not been a pre-arranged job, and regarding the charges brought
against the working and organisation of the Departments as un-
founded, consider that to be ready at a moment's notice was your
normal condition?
Well-informed Subordinate. Indeed I hope it would, my Lord.
Exalted Admiralty Official. Well, then, I think I will try the
experiment.

So freely gives to an English June?
When each enamelled meadow lies
Emblazoned in a thousand dyes,
And every dainty flower that's there
Pays fragrant tribute to the air,
While, high above, the leafy trees
Bend to the whispers of the breeze,
And every bird, with swelling throat,
Fills Heaven with his grateful note,
And all created things confess
The spell of so much loveliness;
Oh, where are all these joys so rare?

Flies for relief to his proper bane;
And his aching bones confess the might
Of panacean aconite.
Each bird sits dumb in his feathered

For too much liquid has made them

The effect of a sunny and warm July,
Give Phoebus a bit of a chance to blaze
And have done with these dripping,

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
May 4.—Carrie's mother returned the Lord Mayor's
invitation, which was sent her to look at, with apologies
for having upset a glass of port over it. I was too angry
to say anything.
May 5.—Bought a pair of lavender kid-gloves for
next Monday, and two white ties, in case one got spoiled
in the tying.
May 6 {Sunday).—A very dull sermon, during which,
I regret to say, 1 twice thought of the Mansion House
reception to-morrow.
May 7.—A big red letter day, viz., the Lord Mayor's
reception. The whole house upset. I had to get dressed
bv half-past six, as Carrie wanted the room to herself.
Mrs. James had come up from Sutton to help Carrie,
so I could not help thinking it unreasonable that she
could require the entire attention of Sarah, the servant,
as well. Sarah kept running out of the house to fetch
"something for Missis," and several times I had in my
full evening dress to answer the back-door. The last
time it was the greengrocer's boy, who, not seeing it was
me, for Sabah had not lighted the gas, pushed into my
hands two cabbages and half-a-dozen coal-blocks. I
indignantly threw them on the ground, and felt so
annoyed that I so far forgot myself as to box the boy's
ears. He went away crying, and said he should sum-
mons me, a thing I would, not have happen for the world.
In the dark I stepped on a piece of the cabbage, which
brought me down on the flags all of a heap. For a
moment I was stunned, but when I recovered I crawled
upstairs into the drawing-room, and on looking into the
chimney-glass discovered that my chin was bleeding, my
shirt smeared with the coal-blocks, and my left trowser
torn at the knee. However, Mrs. James brought me
down another shirt, which I changed in the drawing-
room. I put a piece of court-plaister on my chin, and
Sarah very neatly sewed up the tear at the knee. At
nine o'clock Carrie swept into the room, looking like a
Queen. Never have I seen her look so lovely and quite
distinguished. She was wearing a satin dress of sky
blue—my favourite colour—and a piece of lace, which
Mrs. James lent her, round the shoulders to give a finish.
I thought perhaps the dress was a little too long behind,
and decidedly too short in front, but Mrs. James said it
was a la mode. Mrs. James was most kind, and lent
Carrie a fan of ivory with red feathers, the value of
which, she said, was priceless, as the feathers belonged
to the Kachu Eagle—a bird now extinct. I preferred the
little white fan which Carrie bought for tnree-and-six
at Shoolbred's, but both ladies sat on me at once.
We arrived at the Mansion House too early, which
was rather fortunate, for I had an opportunity of speaking
to his Lordship, who graciously condescended to talk with
me some minutes; but I must sav I was disappointed to
And he did not even know Mr. Perkupf, our Principal.
I felt as if we had been invited to the Mansion House by
one who did not know the Lord Mayor himself. Crowds
arrived, and I shall never forget the grand sight. My
humble pen can never describe it. I was a little annoyed
with Carrie, who kept saying, "Isn't it a pity we don't
know anybody?" Once she quite lost her head. I saw
some one who looked like Franching, from Peckham,
and was moving towards him, when she seized me by the
coat-tails, and said, quite loudly, "Don't leave me,"
which caused an elderly gentleman, in a court suit, and a
chain round him, and two ladies, to burst out laughing.
There was an immense crowd in the supper-room, and,
my stars! it was a splendid supper—any amount of
champagne—Carrie made a most hearty supper, for
which I was pleased, for I sometimes think she is not
strong. There was scarcely a dish she did not taste. I
was so thirsty, I could not eat much. Receiving a sharp
slap on the shoulder, I turned, and, to mv amazement,
saw Farmerson, our ironmonger. He said? in the most
familiar way, "This is better than Brickfield Terrace,
eh?" I simply looked at him, and said, coolly, " I never
expected to see you here." He said, with a loud, coarse
laugh, "I like that—if you, why not me f" I replied,
"Certainly." I wish I could nave thought of some-
thing better to say. He said, "Can I get your good ladv
anything?" Carrie said, '1 No, I thank you," for which
I was pleased. I said, by way of reproof to him, "You
never sent to-day to paint the batn, as I requested."
Farmerson said, "Pardon me. Mr. Pootes, no shop
when we're in company, please.

Huute of Commons, Monday Night, July 2.—Jemmy Lowther
back to-night after too long absence. Everyone glad to see him.
No "pulling" or "kidding" or "in-and-out running" about
Jemmy. Always runs straight. Takes any hurdle that comes in
his way, "including the Temperance Vote," says Wilfrid Lawson.
Looks as young and ingenuous as ever. Still mere beardless boy, as
he was when Dizzy put him up to govern Ireland. Found on
returning to House that Home Rule not yet established. High
Court of Parliament discussing for hour and half Private Bdl
relating to Ulster Canal. Seems it's among the Ulster Customs to
have a Canal. That's all ninty-nine Members out of a hundred
know of question, though everybody ready to divide on it if
necessary.
"Dam the Canal!" said Stansfeld.
Everybody shocked to hear such expression, particularly from
such a source. Stansfeld hastily explains no "»" in the word.
Merely a harmless engineering feat suggested.
After talking for hour and half suddenly discovered that there's
no serious diversity of opinion. Accordingly passed Third Reading
nem. con., and Jemmy brought up in triumph to receive benediction
of Speaker.

something about change, but not quite prepared, after sitting
opposite to Joachim through two long Parliaments, to find him in
this position. Joachim held out hand, which Jemmy took in
bewildered manner, and passed between table and Treasury Bench
in apparently dazed condition. Didn't notice any of his former
colleagues. But allowance made for temporary loss of presence of
mind. No malice borne.

tenant. Shall get the Bill right through, and insert the jemmy."
Solicitor-General, interposing as amicus curice, volunteered informa-
tion that " that would be flat burglary."
"Softly, softly!" cried Old Morality. "What does the Copy-
book say—' Gently does It.' I intend to make Jemmy First Minister
of Agriculture."
"That's your affair," said Wilfrid Lawson. "But, on behalf
of Temperance Society, Jemmy is engaged for a series of Lectures on
the Advantages of Temperanoe, in supplement to his pledges at
Thanet." Evidently plenty of work for New Member.
Business done.—Arthur Balfour announces new Irish Policy.
Government resolve to drain the Liffey—or is it the Shannon? That
done, Ireland will be at peace.
House of Lords, Tuesday.—Lords nothing particular to do just
now. Happy thought occurred to Camperdown. Land League on
trial in Queen's Bench before Lord Chief Justice and Special Jury.
Everybody talking about it. Great'exciteinent of the hour. Why
not have sort of mock trial in Lords? In civil cases Lords ultimate
Court of Appeal. Why not forestall course of events and try case
before it had left Court? Camperdown opened case for prosecution
in rather dull speech. Well meant, but calculated to throw damper
over proceedings. Seemed for moment after Camperdown sat down
that he had extinguished debate. After pause Spencer said a few
words. This brought up the MacCullum More. Things now fairly
started. Delightful to watch the MacCullum More strutting into
the fray like a game cock. Figure erect, breast protruded, head
thrown back, crest uplifted.
"Always think when I see Argyll plunge into debate," said
Rosebery, "it's a pity Rules of House forbid musical accompani-
ment. Dook would speak twice as well if he were allowed, before
commencing, to strut twice round the House whilst the piper played.
The MacCullum More did pretty well without the bagpipes.
Mention of Gladstone's name is a fair 'equivalent, and sight of
Spencer or former colleagues quite enough to set him off. Banged
them all right and left. Left them smiling, provokingly unharmed.
Granville, taking matter seriously, protested against bringing on
debate at that particular time, increasing difficulties attendant on a
trial in Court of Justice. Markiss replied, and then it was discovered
that in order that nothing might be lacking to success of travesty,
Lord Chief Justice was in his place. -Not quite so imposing in appear-
ance as when he sits in wig and gown in Court of Queen's Bench,
whether fast asleep with one eye open on learned counsel delivering
speech, or exceedingly wide awake during ex-
amination of witnesses. Position less advantageous
than that occupied in Queen's Bench. Can't
look down on Camperdown with smile of in-
effable sweetness as he does when coming down
severely in Court on Attorney-General or Henry
James.
"But quite enough, thank you, for me," said
Camperdown, as he shivered under the stern
glance, and tho words'spoken more in sorrow than
in anger.
"I deeply regret that this debate has taken
place at the moment it has," said L. C J. Every-
one waited breathlessly for next sentence. No
one surprised if L. C. J., still fixing guilty
Camperdown with stony stare, had continued,—
"and you to be taken to the place whence
you came, and there be hanged by the neck till
you are dead."
Recollecting himself just in time, L. C. J.
omitted this little formula. Debate came to
hurried conclusion; everybody got off safely.
Business done.—Local Government Bill in
Committee in Commons. Every one asking
where is Campbell, Member for Fermanagh,
Parnell's private secretary. Name been
favourably mentioned in Queen's Bench.
The Campbell who is not Joseph Ghxis tells me ho's not very well,
coming. and can't come.
Wednesday.—A strange weird sight to-day. Bradlaugh, at head
of Tory hosts, leading thorn to death or victory. Oaths Bill in Com-
mittee. Bradlaugh, with approval of Solicitor-General, moved
certain Amendment. John Morley, Trevixyan, Illtngworth,

Jacob Bright, and Liberals generally, hotly opposed it. Division
called. Bradlaugh and Tories troop into one lobby, Liberals into
other. A close run; but the Tories, under new Leader, won by Six.
"What do you think of that f" I asked Wilfrid Lawson, being,
to tell the truth, a little excited by general tumbling up of things.
"It's all right," said Wilfrid, with nice air of, imperturbability.
"Bradlaugh knows what he's about. Old Morality going up to
Lords. 'Baron Bookstall,' doncha. Conservative Party will want
new Leader. Embarrassing competition among ordinary candidates.
Bradlaugh walks in. It s their way. First they revile a man,
then follow him. True, they never physically kicked Dizzy down-
stairs, as they did Bradlaugh. But up to 1873 many's the time
they wished they could. Our stout friend knows what he's about,
you bet. 'Bradlaugh, Beer, and The Bible!' not at all a bad cry."
Never can quite make out whether Lawson 's joking. Must think
over this.
Business done.—Bradlaugh, Leader of House pro tern., defeats
Liberal Opposition.
Thursday.—Black Rod up to his larks again. Never saw an
elderly respectable-looking gentleman like this so fond of practical
jokes. Always, about this time of the Session, lurking at doorway,
waits till some Member is on his legs; listens till he comes to point
of his observation, then with drawn sword coerces doorkeeper to
enter, and bawl at top of voice—" Black Rod!"
Forthwith, "in defiance of Magna Charta, in despite of Bill of
Rights, representative of the people
must plump down into seat whilst
the salaried hireling of haughty aris-
tocracy prances up the floor." That's
Picton's way of putting it. Picton
a little pictorial, but not altogether
inaccurate. Usually Black Rod waits
to catch Minister on legs. The other
day marched in whilst Old Morality
on his feet. Later, shut up Stan-
hope; to-day had satisfaction of
choking off Sage of Queen Anne's
Gate. But Black Rod's days of
supremacy numbered. Sydney Bux-
ton takes him in hand. Means to
see he comes in at proper time—say
ten minutes after House has ad-
journed. Sage also on the war-path.
"He had me this afternoon, I
admit," he says. "But if, when
Vote for House of Lords is reached,
I don't move to reduce his salary by
£500, my Christian name's not
Labby."
Little procession of two, which
usually follows Speaker to House of
Lords on these State occasions, in-
creased by one.
Addison, Q.C., has carried useful
Bill, clipping wings of harpy who
hovers over Penny - readings, and
comes down for penalties for breach of copyright in songs. Musical
Copyright Bill, in batch of Measures to receive Assent. "I must
do the Spectator," savs Addison. So goes out in train of Speaker,
amid cheers from both sides. Business done.—Committee of Supply.
Friday.—Great Libel
Case came on on appeal
in Commons. Times

nell replies, "You're

matter rests.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.


THE COMMON CRICKET, OR THANKYS1R IRRITANS.
VOCES POPULI.
AT THE ITALIAN EXHIBITION.
In the Sculpture Gallery.
A group of British Visitors are dubiously inspecting an immense
"Monumental Fireplace" representing rocks, in the centre of
which a marble Mermaid (heroic size), is emerging from a gigantic
shell, and toying absently with an octopus.
First Visitor. Very peculiar, eh? {Consults Catalogue, and finds
the work described as "Decus _Pelagi," which doeslnot help him
much.) Um-a fancy piece!
[Suddenly loses interest in it, and moves on.
Female V. (to her Husband). It looks like a drowned diver; but
then, -what is that long thing, like the end of an eel, sticking out of
the shell?
Her Husband. That's her tail—she's a mermaid, you see. And
an octopus has got hold of her arm, while she's pinched in that shell.
It's very well done.
F. V. Oh, very. But not at all a pleasant subject, is it?
Husband. Weil-^considers, without being able to arrive at any
opinion)—that depends on the view you take of it.
■ F. V. (wavering). I suppose it does; but still—(forgets what her
objection is exactly, and becomes languid)—oh yes, no doubt.
Jocular V. (to his Wife). How d'ye think that would look in our
back parlour, eh, Polly?
Polly. I wouldn't have it, not if you was to give it me, I wouldn't.
"Why, they haven't left no place to stand a clock and ornaments on.
■Mr. Highsniffe (who is endeavouring to form the taste ofhis fiancie,
Miss Phyllis Tyne). You don't mean to tell me you like any of these
things!
Miss Phyllis. Well, I don't pretend to be partial to statuary as a
general rule; but I do like this. It's all so natural, with the eyes
put in and everything. Why, look at the beads in this girl's neck-
lace !—and I'm sure you can count every stitch in that jersey! And
the boy trying to button his shirt; and the black girl who has just
been vaccinated; and the little girl caught reading a book she
oughtn't to—they 're as real as lifeT
[Mr. Highsniffe comforts himself by reflecting that one can't
hare everything in this world.
Is the Picture Gallery.
A Visitor (examining a representation of the " Flight of the Pope
„ standing up in the boat.
•no's that crouching down
Eugenio IV.h). That's the Pope, you see, standing up in the boat,
Second V. Yes, I suppose so; but
behind the shield, in the red bonnet?
First V. (who has not noticed this before). That! Oh, that's his
wife, I expect.
In Boom V. are some Colossal Canvasses, which produce an
intimidating effect upon the spectators, who stand before them in
gasping silence.
First Spectator (on recovering speech). Appears to be a battle, or
something of the kind, going on, eh? (has a misgiving that this is
rather a rash conclusion). I don't know, though.
Second S. Oh, it's a battle—it's certainly a battle. What battle,
1't say, unless it's the battle of—(tries to recollect the name of
vol. xcv.

any ancient battle, but fails). Very likely the catalogue will tell us.
Ah, of course, Imera—in Sicily, you know (he gives this piece of
information as if he had not just found it in the Catalogue).
First S. Imera—to be sure it is! Let me see, it was fought
between the Sicilians and—and, wasn't it the Romans?
Second S. It was the Romans (thinks there may be somebody
behind who knows, and hedges)—that is, if it wasn't the Greeks. I
rather fancy it was the Greeks.
A Puzzled Person (reading Catalogue). "See Herodotus"—'um.
His Wife. Is that Herodotus on the grey horse?
[P. P. gives it up.
Paterfamilias (to his son). Here, Bob, you're fresh from College.
What's " Hie Optime Manebimus "? Title of this picture over here.
Bob (after a cautious reference to the Catalogue). Oh, it's out of
Plutarch—about the Second Foundation of Rome, and Camillus,
and so on.
Pater. I can read that for myself. What I want to know is, what
the Latin means.
Bob. Oh! (desperately)'," Manebimus is the best man here;" he
was a popular character at that time—a demagogue and all that.
Pater, (suspiciously). I don't see what that has got to do with the
life of Cahxllus.|
Bob (" bluffing"). Camtllus—why MANEBlMUsJwashis other name!
Miss Phyllis (to her fioncf). Oh, come along; never mind these
stupid Italian oil-colours. I'm sure they 're not worth looking at.
Mr. Highsniffe. I'm glad to hear you say so. These—ah (with a
slightly corrective emphasis), oil-paintings hardly deserve any serious
study. Where would you like to go now? There are several things
you really ought to see.
Miss Phyllis. I 've seen all / want—let's go on the switehbaok.
[He yields with an inward shudder, and wishes that her tastes
were less primitive.
In the "Alimentary Annexe."
Mrs. Bryanston. How do you do, Mr. Lapsling? I'm only just
waiting to see these Mandolinist people come on—and then I shall go.
Mr. Lapsling. Oh, really? I—I hope they won't be very long
before they begin, then.
\_It dawns upon him, ten minutes later, that he might have made
a happier remark.
In the Marionette Theatre.
The Puzzled Person (the First Part is beginning, and a bearded
puppet in a turban has just made his appearance on the stage). I
don t exactly see what a Turk is doing in", We Eruption of Vesuvius."
(A female marionette comes on with a jerky caution, kneels to the Turk,
clasps her hands passionately, and then beckons—the marionette with
the beard is evidently deeply moved.) Ah! she's warning him to fly
from the eruption. (Another female marionette enters, and kneels,
after pointing upwards in wild terror.) I fancy there's some mistake
in the programme. It's The Deluge they're doing—snot The Erup-
tion, after all. That's Noah with the beard, and they 're begging
him to take them in the Ark. Yes, that's it, of course. (Scene
shifts to a cavern under the sea, with a fish swimming in mid air,
without making any progress.) I thought so—it is The Deluge. (The
bearded puppet enters, and, after one or two abortive efforts, succeeds
injumping inside the fish.) Hullo! that can't be Noah, though!
Why, of course, it's Jonah—Jonah and the Whale. (Last change
of scene to hall with columns and pillars; procession of four janis-
saries enters marching, with their feet in the air; a small dwarf
follows, and begins to dance with great energy—re-appearance of
bearded marionette with a staff, which he tosses up and catches like a
drum-major, as the curtain falls.) Why, I thought he was inside
the fish. Well, it doesn't seem very connected, to me—but (with a
bright idea) perhaps that was the Ballet Excelsior, Eh? no, that'«
tho Second Part, though. Ah, well, we shall find out by-and-by, I
daresay.
Elderly Maiden Lady (during the "pas seal" by the prima balle-
rina in Excelsior"). Well, my dear, I don't know how you can
laugh, I'm sure—/never saw anything so shameless in all my life—
it ought not to be allowed.
Outside the Colosseum, after "The Triumph of Titus."
Mother (to small boy). Well, Freddy, did you like it?
Freddy. Yes, pretty well. Only I thought they'd have had lions,
and—and—real martyrs, you know.
Latest Knights.—Announced as the "New Musical Knights."
One of them, Sir Charles Halle, is rather an Old Musical Knight,
being seventy years of age, but—H'allez done.'—he doesn't look it
or show it, when he appears at the " Pops" as popular as ever. Sir
John Stainer is a Newer Knight. "The Knight is still young,"
being only forty-eight. He has plenty of time before him to prove
himself a capatle Sir-stainer of his well-deserved reputation. With

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BUSY "WITH BISMARCK.
According to an evening: paper. Prince Bismarck, the other day,
was found playing a barrel-organ in the Imperial Nursery, while the
Crown Prince ana his brothers danced to the music. "You begin in
§ood time to make the Heir Apparent dance to your pipe," said the
erman Emperor, putting his nead into the room, and " looking with
surprise and emotion at the strange scene." To this exceedingly
exciting little anecdote Mr. Punch begs to add another of even
enhanced interest. It runs as follows:—
Prince Bismarck, a few days afterwards, was walking in the
orchard of the Palace, where he had gone to pick a cabbage with
which to make an apple-pie. He met a great she-bear dancing with
the rest of the Royal Family, and was immediately invited to play
catch-who-catch-can until the gunpowder should run out of the heels
of his boots. The Emperor at this moment passing the orchard,
smiled sadly and observed, "My dear Prince, who will pay the
piper? This is indeed a surprise!" Shortly afterwards, Prince
Bismarck imprudently married the daughter of the Barber, and from
that moment to this took for his motto the far-famed German line—
'' Vdtno sbpf"
SARAH LA TOSCA.
But for the existence of such a being as Sarah Bernhardt, such
an author as Sardou would not have written La Tosca. "Written"
is scarcely the word: to be
strictly accurate, I would rather
say, pieced together." The
piece is in five Acts, of which
two are superfluous, though not
from a French dramatist's point
of view, who, by occupying the
stage for' an entire evening,
pockets the whole percentage,
undiminished by any fee for a
lever du rideau. Sensible
Sardou.
If Sa r a n had not been so recent-
ly seen as Theodora, the scene of
La Tosca might have been laid,
with greater propriety accord-
ing to our plain English notions,
—and according to st rict French
notions, for the matter of that,
—in Pagan Rome, or in Egypt
of the Pharaohs; and then the
scene in the side-chapel between
La Tosca and her lover, whil

preserving its cynical truthfulness as depicting one phase of depraved
human nature, would have been less objectionablelto a professedly
Christian audience. La Tosca
whatever she once possessed of
religion has given place to the
most debased superstition.
Her religious sentiment is
akin to that of the brigand
who murders and robs a tra-
veller, and then drops a stolen
coin into a box at some
church door, under the vague
impression that he has ap-
peased a ghost which other-
wise, like the revengeful
spectre of Hamlet's father,
might have made himself
very troublesome.
Given such a character to
purr, to fondle, to caress, to
murmur gutturally, " Mariu!
mon adore"!" (dear me, how
often have I heard mon
adore"" from the same lips!),
to be fondled and caressed
in turn, then to fly out in
uncontrollable, jealous pas-
sion, and at once be soothed
and petted and stroked the
right way; then to be gay
is a purring sensualist, in whom

Sarah La Dame Blanche sees a black
beetle on the dinner-table.
and careless; then to be frightened,
distracted, shrieking, frantic, raging like a wild cat caugnt in the
toils; then to be the cold determined murderess, shrieking curses in
the ears of the dying scoundrel she has stabbed; then horrorstruck
by her own deed, to "wake the corpse " with a private religious rite •
then rushing back to release her lover, and, finding herself at last
duped and deceived, to utter one last despairing cry and commit
suicide,—given such a character, I say, and call her by any name
you please, classical, mediscval, or modern, then the only person to
play it is Sarah Bernhardt. At least, I can think of no other:
nor do I want to. The " situation " in the Chapel, and the " waking
the corpse," are not more
repugnant to our sensitive-
ness in such scenes being
represented on the stage
than" are* the prayers of
Louis the Eleventh to his
leaden statues, and his bar-
gaining with heaven before
the Madonna's shrine, or
the ostentatiouspiet y of the
two unhung ruffians in Fra
Diavolo. Those who are
squeamish on such matters
must stop away from La
Tosca. In action it is, on
the whole, not more terrible
than Theodora, except the
y— <t® situation where she sees the
^jg* knife on Baron Scorpio's
table, and the happy
thought occurs to her '' stick
it into him." Certainly
Sarah's La Tosca is a
marvellous performance.

together for her to appear in,—there is nobody in-whonr anyone can
possibly be interested. M. Dumeny is, after Sarah, the best of the
lot as the amateur painter, Mario Cavaradossi, whose altar-piece
would be a disgrace to any church ; but M. Pierre Berton as the
Baron Scarpia with his exaggerated old-fashioned stagey action,, in
strong contrast to the naturalness of Sarah, and his mouthing elocu-
tion, is to my mind simply ridiculous. I have never seen him look
better, or play worse.
Sarah is going to appear as Francillon on the 23rd. Cannot say I
fancy her in the part of the heroine, which Mile. Bartet played to
perfection. But at all events we may look for an original view of the
character, and the play, in spite of much that is tedious in the
dialogue, is a good one, with several strongly marked characters, _
En attendant, SARAn, in La Tosca, must prove a great attraction,
and could fill the house for a far longer time than M. Mater's season,
which ends Saturday, July 28th. How much pleasanter it is that a
French company should come over here and play in one of our com-
fortable theatres, than that we should have to go to them and sit for

Praps, if ever an Hed Waiter was hutterly estonished, and, indeed
to say flabbergasted, it was on receiving a letter sum little tune ago
with a most butiful red seal of a Markis's Coronet, as I was told it
was, kindly hinformin me that the Most Honourabel the Marquis
of Londonderry, havin removed his Wharf to 9 Elms Lane, nis
Lordship asked me to be kind enufi to send him a horder for some
coals! which his Lordship said shood be delivered at my house with-
out no extry charge, witch I calls truly harrystocrattic libberallity!
His Lordship also uniformed me as he didn't keep no agents, but cud
all his bizziness hisself, excep, I spose, when nis Lordship is in
Bubbling-. Being posserbly jest a leetle short of money jest then, his
Lordship told me as his terms was " Cash on Delivery." His Lord-
ship finished up his hinteresting communecashun by hinf orming me
that his Lordship's price for his Lordship's "best Londonderry
Wallsend" was 24«. a ton.
Well, having herd as how as so many of our principle Nobillerty
and their wives was a g^oing into bizziness for theirselves, I ort not to
have bin quite so surprised as 1 were, but as I had bin told as his
Lordship was allowed a Sallary of about five hundred pound a week
for running over to Dubbling now and then, and pertending to be
King of Ireland, iest for fun, I really at first thort it must be a joke.
Howsumever, I thort as there coudn't be no harm in trying, so I
sent his Lordship a horder for^a hole Tun, and sure enuff his Lordship
sent them the werry nex day, and, to show as there wasn't no mistake
in the matter, not only did nis Lordship call me Esquire on the Coal
ticket, but there was printed on it, in large black letters, "The Most
Honourable the Marquis of Londonderry, Seller J"
There's one grate ad wantage in dealing with sitch iminent swells.
A " Most Honourable Markis" would scarcely send me any slates in
my coles, and wood see as they was all propperly skreened, and with
plenty of nubbly ones among 'em, and all full wait. I ain't got no
fault to find with 'em on the hole, but they rayther partakes of the
April Fool carackter, that is to say, they requires lots of atention, as
sitch harrystocrattick Coles naterally wood do, and if they don't git
it, they fust sulks for a short time, and then quickly extinguishes
theirselves, and there you are.
I thort at one time of writing to the Most Honnerablc Cole Seller
and xplaining this matter to his Xcellency, but I didn't quite no his
Dubbling adress, so I refraned from trubbfing him, besides His Lord-
ship must have plenty to do to see to all the seweral Races he has to
attend to, and to mind as there ain't no " pulling/'
Being rayther particklar myself about spelling, I was summut
surprized to see as the Most Honerable Markis's Carman spelt his
receet, "Pade," but I spose as it stands good all the same. I shall
suttenly continue to patronize the Most Honerable Markiss when I
wants sum more Coles, as it seems sumhow to put us more on a pa
with one another then we was afore; which is suttenly one to me.

II Trovatore. Madame Fursch-Madi —
Fursch come Fursch served—makes
a magnificent Leonora. "Doosid
fine woman!" says the gay Colonel
N-88-N L-s, an authority on all
operatic matters. "Very." replies
Lord R. R-thsch-ld; ''thought
she was French,—Fttrscu-Mardi
or as" and he at once quits the
house till the next Act. The prima
donna gives charmingly, " Tacea
la notte placida," and "Di tali
amor." Ravelli the Reliable quite
up to the mark as the merry Man-
rtco, but scarcely up to Leonora's
figure. Brings down the house with
"Ah si ben mio." "Q,uite a
Conservative song," says Signor
Chapltno, Minting of the days of
"Ben-Dizzy." D'Andrade encored
in'' Ilbalen." Encore declined with
thanks. At end of First Act
Navarrini called before curtain
for being Mio Fernando. Scalchi
powerful: singing with great taste and feeling. "I should like to
give her a few lessons, though!" says the Composer who continues to
write under the name of Walter Austin. "Never too late to learn."
Somehow, audience's enthusiasm cools down, and opera isn't finishing
so brilliantly as it commenced. Seeing this, and wishing to enliven
matters a bit, one of Druriolanus's soldiers strays out of his line
at the end of the Act, and then pretends to be utterly disconcerted
at finding himself between the curtain and the footlights. Signor
Randegoer evidently afraid the soldier is going to sing a solo—un-
rehearsed effect—Druriolanus momentarily paralysed under the
impression that the military super is about to address audience on the
wrongs of Ireland, or the Match Girls' strike, only recovers himself
in time to rush round on to the stage, and find poor military super
retreating from scene as fast as possible. Diversion created dv
incident, and opera goes twice as well after this, right up to end.
Druriolanus will reward this warrior. Promote him to a sergeantry
in the supernumerary forces, and " deoorate hiin," says Lord L-th-m
"with an order." Ah, Leonora, addio!
Saturday.—Aula. First and only time this season. "After
Dorothy," observes Mr. H. S-dg-r to Druriolanus, "Aida's my
pet Opera." "It's my tram-pet Opera," returns Druriolanus,
who never loses a chance, and immediately disappears. _ Drurio-
lanus always brilliant when house crowded and everything going
well. Recalls for Xordica and Scalchi end of Sc. 2, Act II., and
everybody back again before curtain after Second Act. Procession
splendid, mise-en-scene magnificent. Act III.—Novel effect of boat
capsizing, and upsetting the mariner. Unaccountable accident, as.
the singing beinjr so good, there was no likelihood of a squall. Wind
in orchestra did it perhaps. Last Saturday but one. Grand Finale
of the season next Saturday, and testimonial to Druriolanus and
Ravelli the Reliable.
Change op Name with Change of Season.—The Dog-days of
year must be remembered as " The Cat-and-Dog-days."

Members of the Government, of course. Not eleven shillingsworth
of "trouserings" on the Ministerial front.bench!
Thk Cambridge Union.—The Master of Trinity is going to make
a Mrs. of Trinity. The clever young lady, Miss Agata Ramsay, was
"Senior Classic " of her year; and so was Dr. Butler, only rather
more so by some years. Two "Senior Classics" marrying each
other! How fortunate they are not two Senior Wranglers 1
Sunshine for the Eton and Harrow Match.—Most appro-

THE HISTOKY OF A SIGNATURE.
{From Our Life Peer Elect.)
ery dear Mr. Punch,—No doubt the recent
discussion about the signature of Mr. Par-
nell prompted you to apply to me. I will
tell you as shortly as I can, my recollections.
As a boy I used, when addressing mv
school companions, my nickname "Toxic.''
I fancy this title was bestowed upon me with
a view to calling attention to my nose, and
referring to my name Tucker, "Tonk"
was frequently altered into "Konk,"
"Tunk," and "Snout," but I do not re-
member ever using the latter signatures.
After leaving school, I used to sign myself,
when writing to the young lady who sub-
sequently honoured me by becoming my
wife, "Tooty," but this was a term of
endearment that I did not adopt when addressing strangers. After
my marriage, at the request of my wife, I invariably signed myself
"John Hazlewood Tucker," and "Mr. and Mrs. Hazlewood
Tucker" appeared on our visiting-cards.
Later on, when I was honoured with a knighthood for discovering
(and advertising) my patent Cedarwood Cough Mixture, I called
myself Sir John Tucker, and my wife was satisfied with " Lady
Tucker." She told me that she preferred it to " Hazlewood Tucker,"
which, as she observed, "after all, was double-barrelled, and under
the circumstances unnecessary." At this time I occasionally signed
myself "Jack" when addressing my brother Tost, and " Your Dear
Papa, J. H. T.," when writing to my son and heir, aged seven.
The Sandalwood Cough Mixture having rendered me a Millionnaire,
I have, on the promise of a Life Peerage (which will be bestowed upon
me, I nave reason to believe, in company with Sir Frederick Leigh-
ton-), arranged in the future merely to sign myself,
Yours most truly, De Tuckeryille.

CONVERSATION-BOOK FOR OFFICIALS.
Have you any guns for ships?
Certainly. I have twenty guns for ships. They were ordered five
years ago, and were promised to be ready last January.
Were they ready then 'i
No, they were not ready then; but they may be ready by next
June.
Are the ships built that are to take these guns?
The ships should be built that are to take these guns, as they were
promised to be quite ready for sea last July twelvemonth.
But are they ready for sea?
No, they are not; but they may be in six months' time.
Should war be declared, would it not be inconvenient?
If war were declared, it would be ynost inconvenient.
And were war so declared, what would you do 'i
If war were so declared I think I should go on leave.
On leave—where?
Anywhere—outside my native country.
Then you have not much confidence in the Government?
On the contrary, I have every confidence in the Government, but
should war be declared I think that would be the most appropriate
time for self-effacement.

energetic Operatic Manager,—Why not start a "National Carl Rosa

JULY JOTTINGS.
(Extracted last week, from the Journal of an al fresco Pleasurc-scekcr.)
Monday.—Go down on invitation to the Bilkerbury's place in
Surrey " to look at their roses and try their strawberries." Raining
heavily. Still start. Bilkerbuby meets me at station with dog-cart.
Says he hardly thought I would come in such weather." Five-mile
drive. -Pelting the whole way. Arrive drenched. Family depressed.
"Try "the strawberries at luncheon. Find them colossal, watery,
slug-eaten, and tasteless. Bilkebbuby says it is the rain that has
done it, and that if I had only " come down last Tuesday week then
he oould have shown me something like a strawberry." Ask about
the roses. Says they are simply mashed up" with the rain, and
that there's nothing left of them. Spend a dreary afternoon playing
backgammon with Mrs. B. Say I think I'll walk back to the
station. Bilkebbuby nods and doesn't press the dog-cart. Miss my
way, and lose my train. Have to wait at the station three hours and
a half, in my damp clothes, for the next. Afraid I have caught cold.
Home at last. A very gloomy day.
Tuesday.—Off to Tippingford to play in the Home Eleven against
the Roving Batterbridge Juveniles. Pelting cats and dogs. Ground
like a sponge. Both Elevens boxed up in the tap-room of a small
local public-house drinking hot whiskey-and-water. After waiting
five hours and a half rain stops for a few moments, and the Captains
determine to begin the match. We win the toss, and go in. Owing
to the sloppy state of the wicket, we are all got out for eleven in five-
and-twenty minutes. Cats and dogs recommence. Further adjourn-
ment, and whiskey-and-water drinking. Weather not clearing, other
side decide to go out and have their innings, when it is discovered
that both our bowlers and five of the field have left for Town. Oppo-
sition Captain furious, and asks me whether I think I "belong to an
Eleven of Gentlemen." Point to the weather. Rival Umpire asks
"What that's got to do with it?" and offers to fight me. Decline,
and beat a retreat, eventually getting np to Town, escaping notice in
the corner of a third-class compartment. Arrive dripping. Feet in
hot water. To bed miserable.
'Wednesday.—Glass still falling, and pelt continuous. Still, make
up my mind to start for the Feathebflys' Water Pic-nic at Cookham.
Get there, and find the young people determined not to give it up.
Say they are sure it will be very jolly" if we only take umbrellas
and waterproofs enough. Am forced to start. Find myself rowing
bow in a light suit of flannels drenched through with a driving rain
that is swept by a bitterly cold wind in pailfuls over my dripping
back. Spirited, young lady, who is steering, expresses her "'
that it is "great fun." After two hours of this, join other (boats
under some dripping bushes, to have lunch. Everybody in an ill
temper. Get a soaked sandwich, and caU attention to it. Comic
man asks me what else I expected at a " Water Party." No one
laughs. Should like to duck him. Start to return, wind risen to a
hurricane, rain comingdown in a deluge. Take an extra hour-and-
a-half getting back. Hurry up to catch train without waiting to say
good-bye to Feathebtly. Feel too savage to do it. Am all over
aches and pains. Think, on the whole, it is the most disagreeable
day I have ever spent in my life. Go to bed, wondering whether I
shall be able to hobble through my part in the Open-air Pastoral Play
which I am booked for to-morrow.
Thursday.—No change in weather. Worse, if anything. Never-
theless, start for Sir Habby Pottifer's place in Kent, to take part
in a Pastoral Drama, written specially for the occasion by himself,
entitled the Apotheosis of Pan, lor [Sunshine in Arcady. I am to
play Bacchus. Rain coining down in torrents. Find all the players
protesting against giving the thing in " such weather." Sir Harby
insists that we must, as Royalty is expected. Turn out, grumbling,
and begin. Seeing that Venus "has got on a waterproof, I put on an
Ulster, and the Chorus of Wood Nymphs, taking the hint, execute a
"sylvan dance" in goloshes, wraps, and umbrellas. Sir Habby is
hurt. Says he didn't think we would mind "a little wet, just for
once," and that, of course, if we are going "to play the fool in that
sort of fashion," we may.: as well "give up the whole thing."
After a hot altercation on the lawn, held in a roaring wind in the
midst of blinding sleet and rain, Pan absolutely declining to appear,
even in his " Apotheosis," unless enveloped in a coachman's overcoat,
a compromise is arrived at, and it is ultimately settled that we are to
finish the Open-air Pastoral Drama as well as we can in the back
drawing-room. Do this. It falls decidedly flat. Royalties leave
before it is over. Sir Habby grumpy, and almost rude. Take my
departure, vowing nothing ever again shall persuade me to go in for
a Pastoral Drama. Arrive at my Chambers, feeling that, spite the
Ulster, my scanty get-up as" Bacchus has given me a severe chill.
To bed, shivering, and wishing I hadn't stood so long on the lawn in
sandals.
Friday.—Feel that the sandals have done it, and that I have cer-
tainly got a chill. Head splitting. Aches all over. Glass hesi-
tating. Think it really looks like clearing. Give three feeble cheers.
Wonder whether I can manage to get down to the Spixkleby's
Garden Party to-day, and put in an appearance at the Champion
Bicycle Tournament to-morrow. Think I'll see Doctor. Do so.
Shakes his head and makes me telegraph to put them both off. Explain
my symptoms. Tells me I may think myself lucky if I 'get off
without rheumatic fever. Says Monday set it up. Tuesday de-
veloped it. The Water Pic-nic on Wednesday brought it to a nead,
and that Bacchus yesterday evidently finished me. Orders me wet
towel to my head and gruel. Toss about in a troubled sleep dream-
ing I am pursued by a demon Clerk of the Weather, who is playing
on me continually with a four-inch hose of a sixteen horse-power
engine of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade.
Saturday.—Glass gone np amazingly. Sunshine once more. No
use. Comes too late. Still in bed. Wet towel still round my head.
Still taking gruel. On the whole, an irritating ending to a Deastly
week.
NOTES PICKED UP IN THE COURT OF THE L.C.J.
11'15 a.m.—Fairly punctual. Must not go to sleep until all my
friends are settled.
11*30 p.m.—Think there is no more room on the Bench. Have given

12 Noow.—Opening for the Plaintiff still going on. Wonder if
Counsel will last until luncheon interval. Pleasant voice—does not
disturb me at all.
r30 p.m.—Force of habit! Woke up in time to suggest that the
usual mid-day adjournment should take place.
2 p.m.—Find that address to the Jury is not concluded. Very well.
4 p.m.—Force of habit again! Woke up to the minute. Some

4'30 p.m.—Adjourned Court. Shall be interested to find what I
have been trying to-day. Sure to see it in the Times to-morrow!

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
May 8.—I woke up with a most terrible head-ache. I could scarcely see, and the back
of my neck was as if I had given it a crick. I thought first of sending for a Doctor, but I did
not think it necessary. When up, I felt faint, and went to Brownish's the Chemist, who
gave me a draught. So bad at the office, had to get leave to come home. Went to another
Chemist in the City, and I got a draught. Brownish's dose seems to have made me worse,
Have eaten nothing all day. To make matters worse, Cabbie, every time I spoke to her,
answered me sharply—that is, when she answered at all. In the evening I felt very much
worse again, and said to her, " I do believe I 've been poisoned by the lobster mayonaise at
the Mansion House last night." She simply replied, without taking her eyes from her
sewing. "Champagne never did agree with you." I felt irritated, and said, " What nonsense
you talk; I only had a glass and a half, and you know as well as I do "Before I could
complete the sentence, she bounced out of the room. I sat over an hour waiting for her to
return, but as she did not, I determined I would go to bed. I discovered Cabbie had gone
to bed without even saving good-night,
leaving me to bar up the scullery door,
and feed the cat. I shall certainly speak
to her about this in the morning.
May 9.—Still a little shaky, with black
specs. Cabbie had commenced her break-
fast when I entered the parlour. I helped
myself to a cup of tea, and I said, perfectly
calmly and quietly, "Cabbie, I wish a little
explanation of your conduct last night."
She replied, "Indeed! and I desire some-
thing more than a little explanation of your
conduct the night before. I said, coolly,
"Really, I don't understand you." Cabbie
said, sneeringly, " Probably not; you were
scarcely in a condition to understand any-
thing" I was astounded at this insinua-
tion, and simply ejaculated"Caboline!"
She said, "Don t be theatrical. It has no
effect on me. Reserve that tone for your new
friend, Milter Fabmebson the ironmonger."
I was about to speak, when Cabbie, in
a temper such as I have never seen her in
before, told me to hold my tongue. She
said, Now I'm going to say something.
After professing to snub Mr. Farmerson,
you permit him to snub you in my presence,
and then accept his invitation to take a glass
of champagne with you, and you don't limit
yourself to one glass. You then offer this
vulgar man, who made a bungle of repair-
ing our scraper, a seat in our cab on the
way home. I say nothing about his tearing
my dress in getting in the cab, nor of tread-
ing on Mrs. James's expensive fan, which
you knocked out of my hand, and for which
he never even apologised; but you both
smoked all the way home, without having
the decency to ask mv permission. That is
not all. At the end of the journey, although
he did not offer you a farthing towards bis
share of the cab, you asked him in. For-
tunately, he was sober enough to detect
from my manner that his company was not
desirable."
Goodness knows I felt humiliated enough
at this; but, to make matters worse,
Cowing entered the room without knock-
ing, with two hate on his head, and holding
the garden-rake in his hand, with Cabbie's
fur tippet (which he had taken off the
downstairs hall-peg) round his neck, and
announced himself m a loud, coarse voice,
"His Royal Highness the Lord Mayor.
He marched twice round the room like a
buffoon, and, finding we took no notice,
said, "Hulloh! what's up? Lovers'
quarrel, eh?"
There was a silence for a moment, so I
said, quietly, "My dear Cowing, I'm not
very well, and not quite in the humour for
joking, especially when you enter the room
without knocking—an act which I fail to
see the fun of." Cowing said, "I'm very
sorry, but I called for my stick, which I
thought you would have sent round." I
handed him his stick, which I remembered
I had painted black with the enamel paint,
thinking to improve it. He looked at it
for a minute with a dazed expression and
said, "Who did this?"
I said, "Eh? Did what?"
He said, "Did what? Why, destroyed
my stick! It belonged to my poor uncle,
and I value it more than anythuig I have
in the world. I '11 know who did it."
I said, "I'm very sorry. I daresay it
will come off. I did it for the best."

House of Lords, Monday, July 9.—Regrettable coolness sprung up
between House of Lords, and House of Commons. Can scarcely be

affectation of personal disregard. Commons began it. Every Session
on opening day pass series of Sessional Orders. One prohibits Peers
and Prelate* from interfering in Elections. This particular Order
been passed for generations. Nobody a penny the worse; nobody a
halfpenny the better. Pleased the Commons; didn't hurt the Lords.
This year Lords suddenly woke up to indignity of the whole thing.
Barons of England swore on hilt of Crusader-forefather's sword not
going to put up with this sort of thing. That doughty Baron, Hals-
buby (Cr. 1885), in particular outraged.
'"Sdeath," said lie. "These beggarly Commons do assume too
| much. By the bones of my forefathers, the white dust of which
choked Salamn's host, this shall be seen to. A Halsbury! A
Halsbuby!"
That's an excerpt from Lord Chancellor's private conversation on

attention of Rowton. moved Resolution to effect that action of Com-
mons in the matter should be ignored.
"Let us," he said, dropping into modern English. "assume a
don't-know-yah air towards these fellows. That'll
rile 'em more than anything else."
Suggestion unanimously adopted. Noble Lords
adjourned in condition of high elation.

Plantagenet Peer, Braboubne. "Teach 'em to

tating to Us. A Peer not to interfere in a Par-
liamentary Election, forsooth! Then what's to
become of Me and my personal influence?"
Business done. — In Commons,
pegging away at Local Government

Tuesday. — Old Morality ap-
peared at Table with bulky bundle
of copybook headings. Desire to
do our duty; animated by one
feeling; nothing further from our
thoughts: most anxious to meet
views of House; no desire to affect
legitimate discussion; profoundly
regret; a great property in which
J/l'i If ^SUST na^'on h;ls a deep, a large, and
a ves^ interest; would not use
the power placed in our hands to
interfere with the liberties of Hon.
"Attention!" Members; I may be allowed to
travel somewhat farther, and say;
certainly, Sir; always guided by a due sense of my responsibility;
desire to act in the interests of the public service; in this I do not
wish to be understood; when I say this, I must also state; we
should not be justified in allowing; I am afraid we should not think
it right; and so on, leading up to final conclusion to appropriate all
the time of the House for Government business.
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate jeeringly criticises proposals. Doctor
Gkandolph, LL.D., much distressed at this frivolity. Severely
birches Sage. Then turns upon Government, tears to shreds the
amiable copybook headings, sprinkles Treasury Bench with frag-
ments. Old Morality proposes to take Local Government Bill
through Committee, pass all Supply, adjourn early in August, resume
for Autumn Session at the end of October. Dr. Grandolph demon-
strates practical impossibility of this arrangement. Shall be here
till September carrying out first part of programme. How could
House he asked to meet again in October?
"Grandolph 's quite right," said Bates, clasping his hands in
habitual devotional attitude. "If programme's carried out. shall
certainly have an Autumn Session, but it '11 last
straight through from now till November."
Bad quarter of an hour on Treasury Bench.
Deliverance from unexpected quarter. Gladstone
takes Government under paternal wing.
"Keep your eye on your father," he says, "and
your fatner will pull you through."
So he does, insisting as price of deliverance that
Life Peerages Bill shall be abandoned. Old Mo-
rality gratefully gasps forth assent. Message sent
across to Lords. Been debating Life Peerages Bill
all night. Just agreeing to read it a Second Time
when Old Morality's note arrived. The Markiss
boils over with rage; nothing for it but to drop Bill,
which he does in magnificent passage of withering
Bcorn. Sends note to Old Morality to say would
like to see him for few minutes.
0. M. sends back word, verv busy indeed. In fact
has an urgent summons to other end of town. Back
d'reckly.
Business done.—Autumn Session arranged for.
The Ven. and Rev. Thursday.—Lords having it all their own way this
week. Commons not in it. To-night, all the world
knows that The Macallxtm More is to move Vote of Confidence in
Government with special reference to Irish Administration. Ordi-
nary attractions of speech by the Dook increased by natural curiosity
as to issue. Will the Lords pass Resolution, or will Opposition, mus-
tering in overwhelming force, defeat it? Quite exciting prospect.
Nothing like little uncertainty to make debate draw.
Walking towards House beheld three cloaked figures, cautiously
proceeding along Corridor. Knew them at once, in spite of disguise
and shrinking gait. 'Twas Granville, Spencer, and Rosebery,
helping each other along, mutually cheerful.

slight

"I at least will die hard," said the Red Earl, plucking a dagger
from his boot.
"Ha! ha!" said Rosebery, resolutely, though with
tendency to chattering of teeth.
"We must dissemble," said Granville. "Argyll's a terrible
man when blood of Macallt/h More boils."
A crowded House. Privy Councillors throng steps of Throne.
M.P.'s packed in pens at Bar. Lock-
wood seized opportunity to make sketches
for his forthcoming portrait of " Duke of
Argyll as Bantam Cock, Crowing on his
Own Dunghill." Peers' benches crowded.
Bishops in lawn. Ladies in side Galleries,
and in high feather.
"Glad I didn't carry out first intention
to come in kilt," said the Macallttx
More, modestly glancing at galleries,
whence fifty pair of bright eyes scanned
his manly form.
Just as preliminary business cleared off,
Stratheden and Campbell blew their
nose. In the distance sounded something
like earliest effort at tuning bagpipe.
Macallt/m More started like ancient
war-horse at sound of trump. A great
occasion. Rose to its full height and
his own. Perhaps a little historical in
his treatment of subject. Had avowedly
come to praise the present Government.
Lagged on the way to bang Gladstone on
the head and scarify Spencer. Pretty
to see the Red Earl, when opprobrium
heaped upon him, stoop and furtively
- feel if the dagger was still in his boot.
• For full hour by Westminster clock
Macallum More enjoyed himself. Pre-
sently would have pleasure of hearing
. the Markiss and others extol his speech,
Our Artist Q.C. whilst Opposition feebly struggled against
flood of eloquence and force of argument. The debate would stand
out in forefront of historic battles royal. London would ring with
it in the morning, and the distant glades of Inverary faintly echo its
grander passages. Everybody wound up to fever-heat by his elo-
quence; yearning to join in fray. Better not take up too much time.
So at end of hour and quarter sat down. Gazed naughtily round
attentive Senate. Who in the urgent race would win the prize of
place and immediately follow him? The black-browed Markiss, the
glucosio Granville, the Red Earl with his secreted weapon, or the
ribald Rosebery, capable of speaking disrespectfully of the Equator?
(Did the other day actually allude to Dook as a " portentous political
pedagogue.") A wondering silence fell over the crowded benches.
A rustle of garments, a murmur of whispered conversation, some-
thing like a titter rippling along Front Opposition Bench, and then
—the Lord Chancellor on his feet putting the Question!
It was all over. The House had listened:, and concluded with one
accord that there was nothing in the oration suggesting reply.
Debate a monologue. Opposition broke forth into unseemly laughter,
Ministerialists answered^ with angry cheer. As for the Macaixt/K
More he could not understand it.
"A low practical joke," he said, glancing suspiciously at Rose-
bery; then with head thrown back, and chest more than ever pro-
tuberant, he stalked forth.
Business done.—Local Government Bill in Commons.
Friday. — Gog and Magog had their noses pulled to-night-
Pickersoill proposed to deprive Corporation of ancient right to
appoint to the offices of Recorder and Common Serjeant. Attorney-
General said " No." Much cheering from Gog and Magog. Then
Grandolph supported Amendment. Henry James followed; Old
Morality capitulated; Gog and Magog groaned. . .
Business done.—Local Government Bill advancing by leaps and
bounds.

and General Bombastes, and it may be interesting to add that, in the original version, the
finale ran thus :—

Fusbos {considerably astonished). Zounds! the King's alive!
General Bombastes {suddenly titling up). Yes! and so am I, too.
But in the French version this order will not be exactly followed, as General Bombastes
will sing the second line. Fusbos, much astonished, will exclaim, " Tiens! il rit encore!"
and the King will sing the last line. So far, the rehearsals have been eminently satisfactory.
THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
May 21.—The last week or ten days terribly dull. Carrie being away at Mrs. James's,
at Sutton. CniMiNos also away. GowrNo, I presume, is still offended with me for black-
enamelling his stick without asking him.
May 22.—Purchased a new stick mounted with silver which cost seven-and-sixpence (shall
tell Carrie five shillings), and sent it round with nice note to Gowing.
May 23.—Received strange note from Gowing. He says: "Offended? Not a bit, mv
boy. I thought you were offended with me for losing my temper. Besides, I found, after all,
it was not my poor old uncle's stick you painted. It was only a shilling thing I bought at
a tobacconist s. However, I am much obliged to you for your handsome present all the same."
May 24.—Carrie back. Hoorah! She looks wonderfully well, except that the sun has
caught her nose.
May 25.—Carrie brought down some of my shirts and advised me to take them to
Trillip's round the corner. She said: "The fronts and cuffs are much frayed." I said
without a moment's hesitation, " I'm 'frayed they arc." Lor! How we roared. I thought
we should never stop laughing. As I happened to be sitting next the driver going to town
on the 'bus, I told him my ioke about the "frayed" shirts. I thought he would have
rolled off his seat. Thev laughed at the office a good bit too over it.
May 26.—Left the shirts to be repaired at Trillif's. I said to him: "I'm 'fraid they
are frayed.'1" He said without a smile, "They're bound to do that, Sir." Some people
seem to be quite destitute of a sense of humour.
June 2.—The last week has been like old times. Cahrte being back, and Gowing and
CmsilNGS calling every evening nearly. Twice we sat out in the garden quite late. This
evening we were like a pack of children, and played " Consequences. It is a good game.
June 3.—Consequences again this evening. Not quite so successful as last Saturday.
Gowing having several times over-stepped the limits of good taste.
vol xcv. E
June 4.—In the evening Carrie and I
went round to Mr. and Mrs. Cummtngs' to
spend a quiet evening with them. Gowing
was there, also Mr. Stillbrook. It was
quiet but pleasant. Mrs. Cummjcngs sang
five or six songs—" Maggie's Secret," and
"Why don't the Men propose f " being best
in my humble judgment. But what pleased
me most was the duet she sang with Carree
—classical duet, too. I think it is called—
"/ would that my Lore." It was beautiful.
If Carrie had been in better voice, I don't
think professionals could have sung it better.
After supper we made them sing it again.
I never liked Mr. Stillbrook since the walk
that Sunday to the "Cow and Hedge," but
I must sav he sings comic songs well. His
song, " We don't Want the Old Men now"
made us shriek with laughter, especially the
verse referring to Mr. Gladstone. But
there was one verse I think he might have
omitted, and I said so, but Gowing thought
it was the best of the lot. "Chactin a son
gout," as the French sav.
June 6. Trillip brouglit round the shirts,
and to my disgust, his charge for repairing
was more than I gave for them when new.
I told him so, and he impertinently replied,
"Well, they are better now than when they
were new." I paid him, and said it was
a robbery. He said, "If you wanted your
shirt-fronts made out. of pauper-linen, such
as is used for packing ana bookbinding,
why didn't you say so."
June 7.—A dreadful annoyance. Met Mr.
Franching, who lives at Peckham, and who
is a great swell in his way. I ventured to
ask him to come home to meat-tea, and take
pot-luck. I did not think he would accept
such a humble invitation, but he did, saying
in a most friendly way he would rather
"peck" with us than by himself. I said.
"We had better get into'this Blue'bus."
He replied, "No blue-bussing for me. I
have had enough of the blues lately. I lost
a cool 'thou' over the Copper Scare. Step
in here." We drove up in stvle home, and
I knocked three times at the front door
without getting an answer. I saw Carrie
through the panels of ground glass (with
stars), rushing up-stairs. I told Mr. Fran-
chino to wait at the door while I went
round to the side. There I saw the grocer's
boy actually picking off the paint on the
door, which had formed into blisters. No
time to reprove him, bo went round and
effected an entrance through the kitchen
window. I let in Mr. Franching, and
showed him into the drawing-room. I went
up-stairs to Carrie, who was changing her
dress, and told her I had persuaded Mr.
Franching to come home. She replied,
"How can you do such a thing; you know
it's SARAH'sholiday, and there's not a thing
in the house, the cold mutton having turned
with the hot weather."
Eventually Carrie, like a good creature
as Bhe is, slipped down, washed up the tea-
cups, and laid the cloth, and I gave
Franchino our views of Japan to look at
while I ran round to the butchers to get
three chops.

MAGHERAMORNE!
(A Plaintive Ditty, as sung recently, with more or less suc-
cess, be/ore a certain Boyal Commission.)
Let me down gently. Treat me not unkindly,
Because, poor victim, I have been deceived.
For what else could I do but trust them blindly?
Who would their simple ways have not believed?
I came down to the office almost daily;
Moved in their midst. Ah! how could I have guessed,
Their souls, when they were meeting me so gaily,
With thoughts of filthy lucre were possessed!
So treat not my confiding trust with scorn
But pity me, poor, duped Magheramorne!
Promptly to Hebb, whom Mr. Hare had shown up,
I pointed out his wrong, quite moved to tears.
But when they told me Goddard's game was thrown up,
1 frankly own I would not trust my ears!
But here my largesse, it is fair to mention,
We paid to Vulliamy, my Board and I;
His salary, together with his pension,
Because,—well, I can't really tell you why!
Still, meet me gently. Treat me not with scorn.
Regard me as poor, weak Magheramorne!
Ah! if you can, once more just reinstate me
Amid the splendours of my former power:
And in your fancy once again translate me
From out the clutch of this all-evil hour!
Think what it is for one who knows not jobbing
To be associated with a craven crew,
Accused of bribing, double-dealing, robbing,
And in their shameless course involving you!
Think what it is, and pity your forlorn,
Dejected, duped and dazed Magheramorne!

5 ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENIUS.
LEGAL "EXHIBITS."
W this lnnd nf RpRvtnn.
On Thursday of last week there was what the newspapers call a "Scientifl0
At Home" at the Temple, when various electrical appliances were exhibited, and
the haunt of the lawyers was illuminated from outside by electric lamps—but
ought not the illumination to have come from within? The subjoined are a few
of the articles which may have been on view:—

In great roles I must appear,
^j|B^^ Present costumes must
1. The Wig of the Future—warranted not to make one's hair come off. In
connection with The Patent Judge-Awakener, warranted to make one's case
come on.
2. An Automatic Grand Jury—all ready "charged," by a Recorder or
Judge, with electric force, and guaranteed to find true Bills for eight consecutive
hours without renewing the supply.
3. The Judge's Friend. Being a robe formed exclusively of the dried skins
of electric eels, causing the wearer a series of mild but continuous shocks,
effectually stimulating the intellect and preventing sleep.
4. Patented Arrangement—for suddenly converting the interior of a Court of
Law into a first-class Restaurant, so as to obviate the necessity of the mid-day
adjournment. Cleverest Members of Junior Bar act as head waiters. Barons of
beef for Mr. Baron Huddleston's Court. Hash for Counsel.
5. The Mechanical Juryman—with a label, " Put a ton of forensic balder-
dash into the (jury) box, and the figure will return a verdict according to the
weight—of the evidence.

6. A Model Costs-Reducer. New method (been tried once) of drawing up
Solicitor's charges and taxing them simultaneously. Has taxed the inventor's
ingenuity for years. So far it has only failed to act on a single occasion.
7. New Way of "Taking Silk"— by subjecting silk-worms to unpleasant
electric vibrations.
I must take no bread nor butter—
8. The Phonograph, or Storage of Judgments. Lord Chancellor (twenty
years hence). "Usher, turn on my predecessor in Juggins v. Bellamy. Ilather
squeaky. Perhaps Lord Halsbiky had a cold that morning. Still, there's
his opinion in favour of the Plaintiff's view. That settles it. Judgment for
Defendant, with costs."
"Butter" I shall miss, alack!
When I cease to be "too utter,"
9. Punishment on a Novel Plan. "Fourteen Days, or six prods of the
Galvanic Titillator." (Machine shown, and tried.)
To the Francois I '11 go back.
Our Pleasure-Seeker seeks to restore himself by taking afternoon tea
at a damp table under a dripping tree, until driven by stress of
weather into the Conservatory, where a " Watteau Concert" is
going on. Three Gentlemen in velvet Court suits and white wigs
are singing a trio describing " What a merry, merry life we
Gipsies lead! " with a toughing chorus. Concert concludes with
"Vocal Polka" by three young Ladies, in costume, illustrating
the joys of washing with real pails, linen, and soapsuds. Not
greatly exhilarated, the P. S. repairs to the Lake. Here a
languid row of spectators are gazing from under umbrellas at a
Professor in a tight suit of black, who is standing on his head at
the bottom of a glass tank while his feet are waving above the
surface. The Professor rights himself, and puts his head above
water to bow, and make a damp little speech. "7 shall now
show you—Eating under water! Sits at bottom of tank and
consumes a biscuit. Several Spectators drift away, their curiosity
satisfied. The P. S., after watching the Professor and his Pupil
gambolling in the Lake like porpoises, begins to feel depression
coming on again, and enters the Exhibition, hoping to gain some
idea of the Commerce and Lndustry of Denmark.
VOCES POPULI.
Scene.—The Grounds on a July afternoon. One heavy shower is
just making way for another. A light fog. Military Band
conscientiously performing to rows of wooden chairs. Attendants
hoisting strings of limp Chinese lanterns to posts, and baling
rain-water out of coloured oil-lamps. Enter a Pleasure-Seeker,
who has been ordered by his Doctor to " divert his mind as much
as possible." He feels a little uncertain where to begin his diver-
sion, as the saddles of the galloping horses in the Steam-Circus
look too soaked to be inviting; but, seeing a couple picking their
way through the puddles towards the " Danish Grotto of Mys-
teries," he follows.
AT THE ANGLO-DANISH EXHIBITION.
A Gloomy Man in a Friar's habit receives their threepences, and
leads the way into the interior, which is entirely dark. The
Lady of the couple giggles.
The Friar (in a solemn voice). Go straight on, ami do not be afraid.
(He stops before a sort of ticket-hole in the canvas rock, through
which they dimly perceive an illuminated transparency depicting two
insipid young persons on a garden seat.) Youth and Decay.
In THE GttOTTO.
In the Exhibition.
The Gentleman. "Where do you make out that Decay comes in,
GuVnor?
The Scene is characterised by a profound calm. Exhibitors behind
stalk rouse themselves from torpor as the P. S. passes, and
attempt to attract his attention.
First Exhibitor (hopelessly). Have you heard the new organ-top,
Sir? [Spins it on a plate: it drones in a devotional chord, reminding
the P. S. of a Cathedral Scene on the stage.
Second Ex. Excuse me. Sir, but have you seen the wonderful new
invention for drawing corks?
Friar [with sombre triumph). Here! (Pulls string—figures on seat
change to skeletons.)
The Lady (unappalled). How funny! Do you mind doing that
oyer again r
[The Friar seems hurt and depressed by such a request, but com-
plies. He then leads the Party to a Canvas Cavern, where,
upon a board at the threshold being trodden upon, a rickety
skeleton emerges.
The Lady (still calm). Law! What are those two twinkling things?
Friar (suppressing his annoyance). They are the flaming eyes of
the apparition.
Third Ex. (imploringly). Will you allow me to show you this
patent self-threading needle, Sir?
The Lady. I suppose that's done with candles inside of its head?
[Friar declines to reveal this prim secret, and proceeds to another
cave, where four more skeletons are grouped in a faint green
light. He pulls a secret string, and two of the skeletons
extend their arms with a grisly rattle.
Fourth Ex. One moment, Sir. The advantage of using our patent
pickle-fork is that you avoid spearing, pricking, stabbing, or wound-
ing the pickle. Sir; you press it gently with the knob—thus!
[illustrates this humanitarian device with a bottle full of small corks.
P.-S. hurries on, like Ulysses passing the Sirens. At one stall
the Exhibitor is asleep, and a Fireman is tickling his ear with a

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Wkmyss Reid's Life of W. E. Forster is a most Keidable bio-
graphy, of special interest at the present moment. Here, from the
commencement of the mo<it dramatic portion of it,—that is, from the
day he became Irish Secre-
tary until his resignation—
the outsider is allowed more
than a mere peep behind the
scenes, during the perform-
ance of the earlier acts of
the Irish Home Rule Drama
at St. Stephen's. A fair-
minded student, possessed
of no special knowledge, will
probably be struck by two
things: first, the over-
whelming anxieties of the
Irish Secretaryship; and,
secondly, the light-hearted -
ness with which some mem-
bers of a Cabinet can bear
the trials and troubles of
one of their own number.
I put down Forster,
and, pour me distraire, I
take up: Percy Fitzgerald's
Chronicles of Bow Street. "What's]Hecuba to him, or he to
Hecuba f "—I mean what's Bow Street to Fitzc.erald, or Fitz-
qerald to Bow Street, that he should select this subject for his busy
pen? He has, however, produced a chatty couple of volumes, full of
interest to the student ot human nature, who can see the humorous side
wherever it exists, of the curious stories of knaves, fools, dupes, and
deceivers, heartless criminals and astute detectives. The stories of
"Old Patch" and other rascals are entcrtaininfr in a cynical sort of
way. But one of the best anecdotes is of an incident in the career of
Adkins "the Little Ferret," the pluckiest of detectives.
Like most of my friend Frrz's entertaining" compilations, rthe
stories seem to have been strung loosely togetherjtrom time to time
as he came across them at haphazard: and the formTand style of the
book suggest that friend Fnz treated it in a Gampish-cordial fashion
—that is, the MSS. was " on the mankel-shelf, and the author put his
pen to itwhenhe was so disposed." The consequence is that Chronicles
of Bow Street, instead of Deing a work by "Frrz," is rather a work
by "Frrz and Starts." Very entertaining all the same, savs

A WEEK'S OPERATIC SCORE.
Tuesday, July 17.—This week is last week. Odd jumble of time;
but so it is. This Tuesday is last Tuesday—of Opera Season.
Crowds to hear Boito's Mefistofele, in a Prologue, Five Acts, and an
Epilogue. (Didn't count the Acts, but think there are five.) Pro-
logue magnificent: carried on by only Edouard de Reszke,
conductor and orchestra visible — chorus invisible. Edouakd is
almost an Oratorio in himself. Enthusiastic applause at fall of
curtain very gratifying to Signor Mancinelli, who has written
an Oratorio, and has conducted the Prologue con amore. Then
a scene as bright and lively as any in Gounod's Faust. Staple of
story of Mefistofele identical with that of Faust. Odd not to hear
all Gounod's familiar airs in Boi'io's Opera. All the soldiers here,
but not the March. How they can come on without it is a puzzle.
And no Valentine! Only Wagner here, as a friend of Faust s, who
is as un-Wagnerish as he can be, but this is before he composed
Lohengrin. What an Opera Gounod's Faust and Boito's Mefisto-
fele would have made combined! Immortal!—at least we should
never hear the last of it. If it began at eight, when would it be
over? Miss M'Inttre, as Margherita, charming. Mmc. Scalcdi, as
Maria,—a very willing martyr. Opera full of melody and movement.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN IMPORTANT PERSONAGE.
One day last week, according to a report in the Times, "Lord
Erne was appointed Imperial Grand Agister of the World." For
what reason nas Lord Erne received this appalling dignity, which to
describe in appropriate terms would require the genius of a Milton
or a Dante? It was conferred upon Lord Erne at Carrickfergus,
County Antrim, at an Orange Lodge. So the world, being round as
an orange, is to be one huge Orange Lodge, of which Lord Erne is
henceforward " Imperial Grand Master," like Mefistofek in Boi'io's
opera.
By the way, what sort of an Erne is this " Imperial Grand "? Is
he a Tea-Erne or a Funeral Erne? How has he Erne'd this dignity?
Is he, 'Arrt would like to know, any relation to 'Erne the 'Unter?
And, in fact, on behalf of the vast majority of the World, of which
his Lordship has been appointed Grand Xlaster, we ask, Who is
Lord Erne i
ADELPHI NAVAL AND MILITARY MANCEUVKES.
Mr. Grundy is fortunate in being associated with Mr. Pettitt—
the pettitt child of melodramatic fortune—in the "new and original"
Drama (so new, and so original!) at the Adelphi, entitled The
Union Jack.
Except that the male dramatis persona: are soldiers and sailors,
and that out of eleven scenes, two are at Aldershot, and one on
board a vessel bearing the happy combination-title "H.M.S. Wel-
lesley," there is nothing extraordinarily nautical or military about
the play. That the plot justifies its authors' description of their work
as new and original" is soon made evident by the incident of the
petty officer, Jack Medway, [What a capital name for a sailor! so
appropriate, you know! None of your common hackneyed "Bill
Barnacle," or " Tom Tug," or "Jack Mainbrace"—oh, dear, no!]
striking his superior officer and being court-martialled; and then the
newness and originality of the story are further shown by the presence
of a Wicked Baronet who is also "an Army Contractor" [Happy
touch this, brings " Wicked Bart." up to date], and by there being
a good deal of hiding behind doors and curtains, and plenty of over-
hearing and seeing what wasn't intended to be overheard or seen,
and everything happening just at the right moment, too, so as to clear
the innocent and confound the guilty; and having so far proved the
newness and originality of the plot to the entire satisfaction of the
audience, will it be believed that the Wicked Bart, has actually com-
mitted a forgery, and that the second villain holds this in te'rrorem
over his head, until first villain, unable to stand it any longer, stabs
second villain, and then tries his best to get poor petty officer Terriss
found guilty of the crime? And then, so fresh and full of novel sur-
prises is this play. Would anyone who has ever seen a melodrama
imagine that the unfortunate heroine actually falls ill, escai>es from

Nautical Situation. Terriss the Tar, the Swell of the Ocean, escapes
with the Heroine in the Captain's Gig.
her captors, and staggers about the country in a blinding storm
of snow, until she faints by the wayside and is rescued by her lover?
Isn't all this " new and original? Rather! or at all events if it
isn't now, it was—once upon a time. Such is The Union Jack. For
a hero of this sort of melodrama, the Messrs. Gatti are fortunate in
possessing a
"Rara avis in Terriss."
But if his authors continue writing for him long speeches to be deli-
vered on every possible occasion, opportunely or inopportunely, full
of claptrap and theatrical sentiment as "new in original" as the

play itself, this sturdy melodramatic actor will soon run Mr. Wilson
Barrett very hard indeed, though the latter, at present, as far as
preachif ying goes, can give Mr. Terriss half-a-dozen lengths and beat
him easily. The truth is, that this melodramatic stereotyped hero
has become rather a bore, and I shall not be surprised if the honest
patrons of Adelphi drama do not resent the next attempt, if it be
unwisely repeated, at entertaining them with this school-boyish kind
of play.
Mr. Charles Cartwright, as the scoundrelly Captain Morton,
was thoroughly artistic. I doubt if even that unexceptionable stage-
villain, Mr. Wlllard, could have played it better. And this is the
highest praise. The ladies were all good;
especially Miss Olqa Nethersole, in the one
genuinely pathetic situation of the play.
Miss Olga is not the " leading lady," but the
misled lady, and at the end of the play when
everybody is happy, no one cares twopence
what becomes of her. "Poor little Me!"
She is quite out of it. Miss Clara Jecks is
just the very Polly Pippin required by the
new and original Adelphoi" Pettitt and
Grundy Bros.; and Miss Eleanor Button,
as Mrs. Stone, one of the Wicked Bart.'s
"creatures," suggests by her sardonic smile
possibilities of such sensational crimes as
might make over again the fortune of Miss
Braddon, and inspire Mr. Farjeon with a
plot as cheerful as that of Uncle Silas.
Of course, however successful the play may
be, it can never " go without a hitch as long
as there is a nautical character in it like Mr. Mr. Shine as British
SHINE in a sailor's costume. There is, how- Sailor, with Robert
ever, one new and original mystery about Macaire's old creaking
the play, and that is—Why is it called " The snuff - box. Nautical
Union Jack?" The Union Jack is occa- effect: Little Cove and
sionally alluded to in the dialogue, but the only "'6 Creek,
time it is visible is when the comic sailor sticks up a small toy-flag
over the window of the old toll-house on the highroad, and wittily
remarks that the cottage thus decorated looks like a ship. Of course
the play is successful; of course it will "run "; but if no nautical
piece can, as 1 have proved, "go without a hitch," certainly a play
called The Union Jack must be of "flagging" interest.

There is not. for the quidnunc, a city so sweet
As St. Petersburg now while the Emperors meet.

Yet not find such a chance for a staggering par."
It is not that the Kaiser will give me a " tip,"
Or the Czar in my ear a state-secret let slip;
That either will whisper his wish or his will,—
Oh! no, there is something more promising still.
As an oracle now for some days I may shine,
A Blowitz—though but at a penny a line.
I have only some awful war-rumour to start,
To shock—somebody's—nerves, or chill—somebody's—heart!

What canards I' 11 let fly from your shores, with what fuss!

Improvements in Theatres.—In the new Theatre being built for
Mr. Hare, the stall-chairs are on wheels. They are standing out in
the spacious hall, and on arriving at the front door, the visitor's hat,
coat, and stick, are immediately removed by a hidden machinery
which wheels him into the exact situation he is intended to occupy.
An electric-bell at his side has to be sounded for refreshments, and
another for a cab or carriage, as the case may be. When the vehicle
has arrived at the front door the visitor is noiselessly trundled out
backwards, without disturbing the audience, the receding chair
allowing him to see the performance until he passes through vam-
pire trap-doors" into the hall, when his hat, coat, gloves, umbrella,
stick, goloshes, Sec., are fitted on to him again, when is carried
out under the portico, and with a gentle and pleasant force, is pro-
jected into his carriage or oab, of which the door will have Seen

"And so. my little ones," said the old man, pointing with his stick to a mass of
factories, suburban villas, and public-houses, "you want to know what sort of a place that
was when I was a young man, many, many years ago?"
"Yes, yes!" cried the children, as they dragged the veteran on to the top of an electric
omnibus, that, belonging to the London ana South-Western Railway Company, was
stationary, and likely to remain so for some time.
"Well, you must know," continued the white-headed grey-beard, "that in those days it
was all open country. If I am not mistaken, where you now see that crowded burial-ground
there was a brickfield that used to be the pride of the Duke of Cambridge. It was to save,
if I remember rightly, persons from being shot to death by thousands that the Duke ordered
the Volunteers away!"
"How very good of His Royal High-
ness," lisped little Maby.
"Ay, that it was! It was either to save
slaughter, or to use the land for running
up houses—I forget which. But, as you
see, they have run up houses since."
"Ana what was Wimbledon like in the
days of the Volunteers ?" asked Richard.
"Well," said the old man, smilingly,
"my memory is not so good as it used to
be; but what I recollect most distinctly
is a trophy connected with Hop Bitters.
It was shown to the public in a large mar-
quee, called the Exhibition Tent, from
ten till dusk; and I fancy, too, that beside
this trophy, were boots, and dozens of
champagne, and cigarettes, and soap adver-
tisements, and walking-sticks, and all
sorts of queer things."
"Dear me, how funny!" giggled little
Mary. "And what were they for?"
"To encourage the love of rifle-shooting,
I imagine; but I am not quite sure. The
people who presented them may have had
some other object in view, but of that I
know nothing. Then there were all manner
of fancy tents, furnished in the oddest
fashions; and then there were Ladies loung-
ing about, doing nothing in particular; and
for a fortnight it was a regular pic-nic."
"Was there any shooting?"
"To the best of my recollection there
was. I fancy it used to be called pot-
hunting. I don't think that many of the
Volunteers used to shoot—I mean not the
real ones. I remember, distinctly, that
the strangest costumes used to be worn at
the ranges."
"Was there much discipline?" asked
Richard, who was now putting the ques-
tions.
"I don't think there was much," replied
the old man, "except, perhaps, amongst
the 001106."
"Do you remember who were the greatest
marksmen in 1888?"
"To be sure I do. The winner of the
Queen's Prize was an engraver who used
to work on the noblest paper in the whole
world; while the Albert Jewel (which was
the any-rille-equivalent to the Queen's
Prize), was carried off by Quarter-master
Arrowsmith, who as you know, is a mil-
lionnaire."
"Surely not the Mr. Arrowsmith who
published ' Called Back,' and the 'Tinted
Venus,' and whose latest edition de huce
(the thirtieth) of 'Tracked Out,' at ten
guineas a copy, has received only recently
so warm a welcome in every quarter of
the civilised world?"
"The very same!"
'' And when the camp of the National Rifle
Association was expelled from Wimbledon,
and tried first on the Brighton Downs, and
then at Wormwood Scrubs, and next at
Heme Bay, and subsequently for some
time in Olympia, until last year it was
held in the Thames Tunnel — did it
flourish?"
"That, my dear little ones," said the
old man, who was getting rather weary of
the conversation, you must judge for
yourselves. You now have the past and
the present before you, and consequently
are in a position to tike your choice f"

tion reversed. Instead of Bobby being chivvied,
and finally chucked out, Bobby seems to have
chivvied the Public in casual way. Graphic
descriptions of Rev. Gentlemen with hats bat-
tered; Hon. Members rushed backwards and
forwards across S(mare, and then taking cabs
to go home. Old Morality, recovering from
state of coma into which Parnell had fright-
ened him, abruptly moved Closure. By curious
association of ideas, this reminded Cunning-
hame Graham that his gold pencil-case was
not closed when he passed it to the 'Orny
'Anded One. Rose to mention this incident.
Speaker putquestion. C. G. stood in attitude of
defiance, still thinking of the'Orny 'AndedOne.
Conservatives yelled. Speaker shouted "Order! Order!"
Cunninghame Graham tumbled back into his scat, "and Freedom,"
at it again, "shrieked when Kosciusko fell."
Business done.—In intervals of miscellaneous popping, three
clauses added to Local Government Bill.
Tuesday.—House been for some weeks engaged in race against
time with Local Government Bill. Contest being on go-as-you-
please system determined to-night to run; tremendous scamper; at
four o'clock on Clause 67; finished up before
midnight with Clause 125 and last.
Pretty to see Caleb Wright standing at
Bar with mouth open, watching Bill jump
along clause by clause.
"Been Chairman of the Tyldesley Local
Board man and boy for forty years," said he,
in a hushed whisper: "but never got through
business like this. A mile a minute—a clause
every sixty seconds! Tyldesley not in it!"
Towards half-past twelve, on Clause 120,
Courtney began to show signs of distress.
Five Clauses yet to pass; only half-hour to do
it in. Old Morality sat restless on Treasury
Bench; strong impulse on him to move the
Closure. Ritchie smiled feverishly; tried not
to look at clock. Charlie Beresford, practical
at critical moment, brought glass of hot
rum for Chairman. Edward Clarke con-
tributed sponge and a lemon. Thus refreshed
in and out, Courtney got up another spurt,
staggering past the post with Clause 125,
and ten minutes to spare.
Curse of Camborne interposed, and
suggested that progress should be reported,
and last Clause left over. Howl of angry
reprobation greeted suggestion. Would
dearly have liked to vex everybody by
moving to report progress; but at last
moment courage failed him. So ultimate
Clause agreed to, and the Curse went home
to roost.
Business done. — Last Clause of Local
Government Bill through committee.
Thursday.—Local Government Bill finally through Committee, new
Clauses, Schedules, and all. House cheers ; Ritchie blushes. Abra-
ham proposes to lead off chorus, " For he.'« a Jolly Good Fellow ;"
Dilwyn pointed out that that would be out of order; might lead to con-
flict with Speaker. So melody remains mute in Abraham's bosom.

"A Clause every Sixty
SccomU!"

Nevertheless, everybody agrees that Ritchie has'done uncommonly
well. Comparatively a young Parliamentary Hand, with no experi-
ence/of taking Bill ^through House, has carried one of the biggest
measures of modern times. For such success much depends on
nature of Bill; but a great deal on the Minister in charge. Har-
court says he knows many men, who in most favourable circum-
stances couldn't have earned Bill. Everybody knows one, but in
Harcourt's presence doesn't mention name. Ritchie, throughout
long struggle, has been clear-headed, courteous, firm wherever firm-
ness was quite safe; when making concessions, adding to the grace
of giving by doing it promptly and cheerfully; never bumptious;
resisting all temptations to be smart, and clever enough to hide his
cleverness. Several men may have reason to believe that they have
done pretty well in the long debate; but Ritchie has carried his
Bill.
Curse of Camborne back again. Roosting with him a disappointingly
brief exercise. Balfour moved Second Reading of Bann Drainage
Bill. Appears that this is a fresh injustice to Ireland.
The whole country seething with indignation. In such
circumstances might reasonably expect Leader of Irish
Party, or one of principal Lieutenants to move rejection.
But it is an English Member that comes to the front.
Conybeare moves rejection of Bill. Bluntly announces
he's going to talk it out.
"We'll see about that," says Macartney.
Lay low and said nuffin till just on stroke of
midnight. Another sixty seconds' vituperation,
and the Curse of Camborne could have carried
out his threat. Macartney moves Closure just
in nick of time. Closure carried; main question
put; Irish Members evict each other • noisily
tumble out of House; after Division,
as noisily come back; Orders run
through; object to everything; Curse
of Camborne in full blast; Speaker
threatens to "Name" him, where-
upon Curse subsides, and House
mliourns.
"Ah," said Herbert Gardner,
strolling out; "glad it ended that
way. If Speaker, in 'naming'
Conybeare, had accurately described
him, afraid he must have dropped into
unparliamentary language. Then
we'd have had to call Speaker to
The Grand Young Gurdner. Order, which would have rather com-
plicated things."
Business done. Local Government Bill through Committee.
Friday Xight.—The Curse really has gone home to roost this time.
Been writing to the papers, personally attacking Speaker. This
breach of good manners stirrea Grandolph to deepest depths.
"If there's one thing I like, Toby," he said, just now, "it is to
see respect shown to our pastors and masters. Do anything you
like with me; but don't expect me to stand tamely by if anyone
scouts constituted authority.
So Grandolph moved that the Curse be suspended for the rest of
the Session. House secretly delighted at prospeot, but dissembled
its joy.
Oh. hang it!" Members said. "That's too much. Give him a
month."
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate pleaded for fourteen days, and cost*.
Finally, House shook off the Curse for a month.
Business done.—Conybeare suspended. A few Votes in Supply.
The Umbrella at the Opera.
Says Bousfield to Harris, "I must keep my gingham."
Says Harris to Bousfield, "To stalls you can't bring 'em."
To"Bousfield (r. Harris), says Bayley, the Judge,
"You '11 pay all the costs, and the action is fudge.
When the Op'ra you visit,—by this you '11 abide,—
If you stick to your gingham, you must stick—outside."
Bryant-and-May'8 Young Girls.—Match-makers indeed! They
no doubt make excellent "strike-on-their-own-box" and other
matches for B. and M., who, having for once met their match, have
behaved most sensibly, and yielded with a good grace to reasonable
demands, but in the West End, a young lady, no matter how lovely,
if she only had nineteen shillings a week at most, couldn't expect
to make much of a match without assistance. Yet match-making
mothers have been known to make splendid matches for their
daughters even when thev have been absolutely penniless. Won-
derful persons these West End matchmakers!

ARRY ON ST. SWITHIN.
Dear Charlie,
I'm down with rheumatics, and scrawls this 'ere letter in bed,
With a elber as sore as Jemimer, and 'ammers at work in my 'ed.
Bloomin' nice state o' things for July, Charlie! Sum-
mer 's 'ad me on the 'op,
For a fellow must be a fair turmut to stand such a
Season of Slop.
I 'ave seen a few mizzlyish ones, but my eyes and a
band-box, dear boy!
This bangs 'em to bits; it is somethink a teatotal frog
might enjoy.
JRain f Bust it, the word .isn't hadyquate now, and if
Science would teach
'Ow to talk of our weather O.K., she must tip us some
new parts of speech.
St. Swithin be jolly well jiggered! He.'s got me on
toast, and no kid.
I'd been piling the dibs for a outing, and saved up a
couple of quid,
So I jined a swell party of right 'uns who'd rented a
prime four-in-'and,
For a tool down to Dorking by road, and, by Jove, we meant doing the grand.
If you'd witnessed the muster at Hatchett's, at ten-thirty sharp Toosday week,
You'd ha' bust arf your buttons orf, Chablte. It mizzled, a reglar damp reek,
Like a cook-shop in Winter, my pippin; and as for our party, great Scott!
You 'd a swore as you never popped lamps on a funnier wropped-upper lot.
The top-coats and muckingtogs, Chablie, the rugs, and the hulsters with 'cods!
For a party of Gents in July! Oh, I tell yer 'twas reglar good goods.
Britons hout for a 'oliday? Bosh! North-sea pilots in shin-plaster suits,
And Friars in brown bed-gowns, and Bobbies with tippets and double-soled boots!
That nicks hus more nearer like, Charlie. Yours truly was toffed up superb,
In a thick hoatmeal suit of splashed dittos; and as I stood there on the kerb,
A puffing a prime Larrynargar, my waterproof slung on my arm,
I tell you I fetched Piccadilly, and. worked on the gals like a charm.
Well, we took a nip round at the bar. Brandy neat was my tipple; sounds rum
For tne dog-days, old pal, I '11 allow, but then dog-days is all a dashed hum.
Lemon-squosh is a capital lotion when Summer is fair on the job,
But to lap lemon-squash on a hiceberg is shivery work, s'help me Bob!
Well, we started. Oh, Charlie, that ride! Which yours truly ain't sugar or salt,
To melt in a shower; we packed close, liquored up every time we'd a nalt;
Puffed sputtering cigars like dashed chimneys, or asphalter's cauldrons, and yet
We couldn't keep in any warmth, nor we couldn't keep out any wet.
Tried tojoke, my dear boy, but each wheeze, like the weather, was watery and
I had a toon hup on the 'orn, but I made jest the muckiest mull.
Couldn't squeeze out one fair sisirary; and when there's a rowdedow round,
'Arry 'ates to be out of the 'unt, as you know by this time, I '11 be bound.
Hutter frost, my dear boy, and no herror, that run down to Dorking by road,
And next day I wos doing a doss with rheumatics as bad as be blowed.
This mucky mix-up they call Summer! The Seasons are 'aving a game,
And that sloshy old squirter, St. Swithin, they tell us, old pal, is to blame.
St. Swithin! He's wus than Sir Wilfrid, His whack's forty days and no more,
But he's now like Old Joe in the song, for he kicks up behind and before.
He has spiled the whole Season this year, for he's drownded both June and July,
And it's pelting like fun as I write, although Orgust is now precious nigh.
Mucked Henley! My Houseboat—leastways I'd the run of it, Charlie, old pal,
The Boss bein' Bagshot, the Booky, who hired it to please his new gal
Our Houseboat, the Margery Daw," was as smart as they make'em, no
doubt,
But the spree gave yours truly the hump; it wos jest one perpetual spout.
Couldn't do a lark round with the ladies or git a fair boss at a race.
Ony wish I could spot old St. Waterworks • hang him, I'd sit on his face!
As to Wimbledon, well, that wos wus. Wot's the good of the toppingest togs
In weather like washing-day, Charlie, a season fit only for frogs?
As to cricket, oh, criminy crikey! It's muck, my dear feller—sheer muck!
When McDonnell, can't play Sussex " lobs," and when Walter Read's done
for a duck,
To squat on damp seats, doubled up like a cab-driver caught in a storm.
May be wot Surrey mugs would call "sport," but I tell yer it isn't my form.
Lawn-tennis? Oh, turn it up— turn it up! Beastly to see pooty gals,
With shiny black muckingtogs smothered, a-hiding their snappy fal-lals.
A trottin' about with damp racquets, their dear little noses all red,
'Anging round on the chance of a game, when they'd better be tucked up in bed,
Why the great " Bounding Brothers" theirselves, those top-sawyers at service
and " smash,"
The Renshaws, carat play in a puddle or mud-swamp with science and dash.
Saw them pull off the finals, wet-footed; fair cautions for pluck and for skill:
But Will only seemed arf in earnest, and Ernest scarce played with a will.
And here I am mugged up in blankets, and lapping a go
of rum 'ot! [that's all going to pot.
'Ow's yerself and the country, old 'ermit? I s'pose
Teatotallers, tadpoles, and turmuts, may like this
Unlimited Slosh, fbarney will wash.
But don't call it Summer, dear boy, for I'm blowed if that

How bored these rambling Royalties must be!
A morning call, a Five o'Clock Bwell Tea,
Or other hollow "function " of Society,
Has as much vital interest and variety
As these parades where crowned toff meets toff,
And Hohenzollern bows to Romanoff.
Say I " drop in " on Jones and Jones's wife;
We bore each other nearly out of life,
And part much wearier, but nothing wiser.
Is it much different with Czar and Kaiser t
Mrs. Jones gives me tepid tea, a look
At her old Album or new Birthday Book;
The Russ the Teuton banquets when they meet,
Shows him his Army, and parades his Fleet.
Good Mrs. Jones and I contrive to chat
About my Tennis, or her Persian Cat;
I caring for her Cat, she for my Tennis
As much as a blind nigger might for Venice.
Teuton and Russ make after-dinner speeches.
And which the hollowest depth of bathos reaches
Might tax a cynic Talleyrand to tell.
They vow they love each other passing well,
(As I admire dear Mrs. Jones's" tabby)
Whilst each laugh low the inward laugh of Labdy.
Mrs. Jones tells me that, upon her life,
She's pining for a sight of my sweet wife—
They 're social rivals, and they love each other
As—well, as William loves his northern brother.
The Muscovite—or Swede, it matters not—
Drinks to the Teuton's health, talks royal " rot"
Concerning " bonds of friendship," and the traces
That bind in one fast " team" two rival races.
So their "agreement" is by bunkum ratified;
William '."smiles graciously," the Czar "looks
gratified,"
And Special Correspondents—wondrous creatures—
Who read, in passing smirks on Royal features
Imperial policy—proclaim aloud
Autocrat twaddle to the gaping crowd.
Well, all this smiling sham, this humbug solemn,
Ekes out an article, or pads a column.
But, mighty Cesar! how these great and gracious
"Forked radishes," these vagrant and veracious
Imperial Panjandrums must be bored!
I fell asleep at Jones's—nearly snored!—
But better tepid tea and twaddling tattle
Than bunkum-banquets which may lead to battle!
"Of course I see you're joking," said Mrs. R., with
a knowing look, interrupting her nephew—who had just
commenced reading aloud the title of a paragraph in
a newspaper, "A University for Wales." "'iou can't
take me in quite so easily. University for Whales, indeed?
"And yet, she added, reflectively, "when 1 was in
Cornwall, I heard them frequently speak of a 'School of
Herrings." So you may be right, after all."

ST. SWITHIN TRIUMPHANT. THE RECORD OF A JOVIAL JULY.
"Charge, Chester, Charge!" — and, of course, Chester did
charge, and pretty well too, for lodgings and hotel accommodation
during the Festival. But not exorbitantly. The weather sent every-
thing down, including prices. Madame Nordica and Grace Damian
in excellent form; when these two sing together it is specially good
for the former, who sings with Grace; and as these artists, with
Messrs. Lloyd and Santley, must have dined at least two or three
hours before performing, they all, being with Miss Damian, sing
with GRACE-after-dinner. Everything very perfect. Miss Belle
Cole.—Princess Cole, daughter, I suppose, of the ancient highly
popular Monarch, who was, as everybne knows, so fond of music
with his own chamber-trio of strings,—well, Miss Belle Cole, not
quite up to the high level of the others. But consider the weather!
And she being a Cole that can sing, might only have required a
little Coke-sing to come out all right. Her chest-notes were forcible,
but not too forcible, by comparison with the locality, which, if her
notes were chest, was, it must be remembered, Chester. Altogether
satisfactory, except to Canon Blencowe, who, we are informed,
objected to patronise the sacred musical performance in the Cathe-
dral. Well, he didn't come; and, if so, he acted like an indifferent
Canon,—went off, with a slight explosion perhaps, but hurting
nobody. Sir Arthur Sullivan thought that this Canon might have
been loaded with reproaches.
Honest Opposition.—That of Sir Wilfrid Lawson, and Teeto-
tallers, to all " Imperial Measures." A great pint this.

INTERVIEWING BY MACHINERY.
(By One who now knows How to do it.)
1 had received an intimation from the conductor of a popular
London paper that I was to he visited by one of his representatives,
so I pulled myself together and looked up my note-hooks. I pon-
dered for hours over my past life, and called to mind its most telling
incidents. I arranged my house in the most artistic fashion, and
awaited events rather anxiously. At the appointed time a lively
young gentleman introduced himself.
"Now, my dear Sir," said he, "all I want you to do is to sit
quietly and attend to me. You need not speak yourself. I am so
accustomed to this sort of thing that I can save you all that trouble.
Iron-grey hair—military moustache—about fifty. Think you are
about fifty, and the colour of your hair is hereditary?"
I nodded.
"Quite so. Well, that will do for a start. I think you have been
a soldier: had adventures of the usual kind in South Africa. Lived
with the Boers and Afghans. Eaten half-raw mutton, and slept for
nights in huts made of mud? Eh? That's it, isn't it?"
Again I bowed my head.
"Certainly," and he jotted down a few more lines in the note-
book which he had taken from his pocket. "Literary man too.
Written lots of books. Novels—romances. You start a plot by
getting a central idea. Then you think it out. Then you find the
proper sort of persons to carry out your notion. Put them down and
give them names P Then think out your last incident. Get it and
go backwards till you come to Chapter First. Then go to the seaside
and think it over again—all of it. Then begin your work and finish
it Eh? That's the sort of thing, isn't it?"
Once more I silently acquiesced.
"Fancy too you were once a doctor. Laboured amongst the very
poor. Heart crushed by the misery of the East End. Saw the usual
characteristics of ' Horrible London.' Once visited a Chinese Opium
den—heathen Chinee—old woman with a small pipe—squalid sur-
roundings. Eh?" I made the same gesture as before.
"Just so. Then I think you have been fairly athletic. Were in
your school Eleven and rowed in your College boat. Still have the
bat, and took away the rudder. Got both of them hanging up in
your study. Was rather fond of following the Thanet Harriers.
Once caught by the tide at Heme Bay and (mounted) had'to swim
for your life. I think I am right—stop me if I am wrong."
/■JI did not stop him.
\fv Live in this house. Usual sort of old-fashioned mansion. Bro-
caded curtains, and dark-coloured wooden chests picked up in Brit-
tany. Pictures of your father, mother, grandfather, and grand-
mother. Value them all. However set highest price on a small
Sicture of himself, once given you by his Royal Highness. Fond of
ogs—that black poodle can do some tricks. Like flowers in your
garden; water them every day when your toil is done. Can plav on
the fiddle, and sometimes indulge in a game of whist at the Club.
I think that is about all you have to tell me, except when you said
good-bye you shook me warmly by the hand, and once more got back
to the work my entrance had interrupted."
And before I could reply he had jumped up, rushed down my steps,
taken a Hansom, and gone off to interview somebody else.
"Play Up! Musio.r/E !"—" It teems a pity," says Our Own
Times Correspondent, writing from Berehaven during the Naval
Manoeuvres, that bands should note be all but abolished. Rightly
or wrongly, Lord Charles Beresford is credited with the change, ' &c.
What! Lord Charles, a prominent supporter and member of the
Organising Committee of the Italian Opera, "forbidding the bands"!!
We cannot believe that Our Charley can have been so misguided as
to be out of harmony with popular sentiment. Let every ship be
like the Old Lady of Banbury Cross, and have music wherever she
goes, to cheer up our hearts of oak, and set the tars' toes going to
the hornpipe.
Slight Confusion.—" Very glad," observed Mrs. Ram, "to read
that Mr. Santley is back again. He's much better employed in
singing, than in rinding some Pasha or other in Egypt"

ROBERT AT THE CRISTIAL PALLIS.
Thanks to the kindness of a frend of mine who is engaged there,
I went larst week with a horder to the ;Cristial Palhs, Dut after
Kitting in without not paying nothink, I
found to my grate estonishment, as I
couldn't have a seat in the Theater on
the same libberal terms, and on picking
out a nice one rite in front, I was acshally
arsked no less than seven-and-six for it!
Of coarse I wasn't a going for to pay
sitch a sum as that jest to near a Eye-
talian Opera all about Don Oeewarni—
which I am told is short for Mr. John—
so, after a good deal of squabbling, he let
me have one at the back for harf-a'
crown.
Luckily for me, one of my old Coppera
shun patrons was there, and he came up
with his usual good-natered Bmile and
said, "I didn't kno, Mr. Robert, as you
was a Etalien skollar; are you?" To
which I replied, "Not a werry fust-rate
one, I'm afraid, Sir; but I knos that greety means a great singer,
and that aUboney means a werry stout lady." "Well," he said,
larfing, "if that s all, praps yon'd like me to sit by you, and tell
you all about it?" "That I suttenly shood," says I, ,! if you '11 be
so kind." Witch he were.
Well, after all the fiddlers and trumpetters and the big drummer
had played away a lot of rubbish, jest to git their hands in, up went
the Curtain, and sure enuff there was a werry ansumly drest gennel-
man, whose name was Leppereller, and he began a singing, as I was
told, all about what a noosance it were for him to be a dordling
about out there in the cold while his Marster, Mr. Geewarni, was
amusing of hisself indores. Presently in comes his marster and a
werry stout lady all in wite a dragging of each other about most
horful, and then the Lady runs away, and in cums her father and
tells Mr. G. as he ort to be ashamed of hisself for to hact like that,
upon witch he pulls out his sword and they fites, and Mr. 6. kills
the lady's father, bang on the floor, and then runs away. And that's
the hend of the fust seen, witch didn't strike me as being werry
moral, till arter I'd seen the next one, and then I didn't think so
werry badly of it. In the second seen, in cums Mr. G. and his
servant, Mr. Leppereller, a larling, and a singing all about the fun
they've jest had? when presently in comes one of Mr. G.'b old
sweethearts, who gives it him pretty hot for leaving her as he had
done, when he tells her as it's all rite, as his frend Mr. L. will
xplain, but as he's got a werry perticklar engagement hisself, off
he goes.
Mr, L. then percedes to xplain everythink to the pore Lady, and
if it hadn't been as my Copperashun patron had told me what was
coming, I never coud have bleeved that any one gennelman coud have
behaved so shamefull, or that hundreds of most respeotabel ladies,
old and vung, coud have set and lissened to it all as cool as so many
cowcumbers! What a rewelashun!
Mr. Leppereller unfolds a long list about 10 foot long, which, he
says, contanes the names of all his Master's sweethearts! and then
he tells the pore Lady how many there are and where they all lived!
So many in Itterly, so many in France, so many among the Turkeys,
none, I mprowd to say, in England, but in Spain one thousand and
three!! Glad I am as Mrs. Robert wasn't there to hear the shame-
fool tail! But ewen that wasn't all, for that imperent servant goes
on to xplain that there was among 'em Marshonesses and Countesses
and Barrownesses and Citizenesses, and ewen Servants, in fact, sum
of all sorts and all sizes! I never coud have bleeved it if I hadn't
have herd it all with my own years, and my kind trend's together,
and then off he runs, and ewerybody acshally larft and clapped their
ands!
In the next seen of this shameful hoperer there is a pore willage
gal a going to be married, and Mr. Oeewarni acshally trys to per-
swade her to go with him to his carsel close by! But three ladies
and gennelmen, all dressed in black, faces and all, stops him jest in
time, and gives it him pretty hot, and serve him rite, but he don't
seem to care much about it, for in the next seen he and his imperent
servant comes in larfing as usual, tho it is a churchyard, with ony
one toom in it, and that is the pore gennelman's as he killed in the
werry fust seen, and it has on it a picter in stone of the dead old
Gent a seated on his favrit horse. Well, drekly as Mr. G. sees it,
he makes his pore servant harsk him to come and have supper with
him that werry nite at 12 o'Clock sharp, and he nods his stony head,
and says as he will! No wonder as the pore servant was amost
fritened to death, for it made ewen me quite start agane.
Well, the werry next seen shows Mr. G. at supper with sum of
the most owdacious-looking ladies as I ever waited on, and they all
drank away at reel Shampane, as I was hinformed as Mr. Orqustt/8
Arris was sitch a reel liberal Manager that he allers guv his peeple
reel suppers and reel wine, like a reel Gennelman as he is. Well,
presently, as trew as I sets here a riting, in comes the stony-looking
Statty as was last seen on Horseback in the Churchyard, and sings
out as he has cum to supper, as he promised for to do. And then
hout runs all the pore fritened ladies, tho I saw one on 'em as took
food care to emty her glass fust, tho she was so terrible agitated,
hen the Statty naterally harsks Mr. G. to shake hands with him,
which he werry foolishly does, for of course it's so cold that when
he's got a good hold of it he carn't let it go agane till he falls down
dead on the floor, and is ewen then so cold that his face is all blew!
And then down came the Curtain, and it was all over, and we was
all so pleased to see how werry propperly Mr. G. was punished for
his owdacious goings on, that we all clapped our hands and went
home.
And if this is the sort of morality as is tort by all Etalian Operas,
it will be a jolly long wile before I takes Mrs. Robert to see one,
tho I must say that both me and my kind frend, and all the Gennel-

RECENT SUMMERY PROCEEDINGS.
In the Country (selon la Saison).
How provoking that the Blue Hungarians should have thought
that the weather would have stopped the garden-party, and that in
consequence only the
ophicleide has come
down from London.
I do not think, some-
how, he is producing
very much effect con-
cealed among the palms
in that conservatory.
Seeing that the rain
is falling in torrents,
it would certainly have
been better to have
postponed the per-
formance of these pas-
toral players.
That dance of drip-
ping wood nymphs
would have been much
more effective if it had
been given without
the aid of goloshes and
Fashions in the Present Eain. umbrellas.
Dear me! why here is the river that has overflowed,its banks,
come up in full flood to the drawing-room windows!
Surely that must be the peacock perched on that garden- seat float-
ing away bottom upwards in the distance.
I am afraid that the poor Old Vicar with two feet of water
running through his study must be feeling rather rheumatic.
Ha! there goes the whole hay-crop carried away over the lasher.
I wonder whether I could get any salmon-fishing in those cucumber
frames.
If this weather continues, I really think a visit to town would be
desirable.
See, here is the house-boat at the front door come to take us to the
station.

Notion for a Juvenile Dramatic Art School.—The excellence
of Mr. Saville Clarke's charming Tableaux Vivants (at3-30, Anglo-
Danish Exhibition) should suggest the idea to some enthusiastic
Comedian—[why not to Mrs. Kendal, the clever trainer of the Heal
Little Lord Fauntleroy.']—of starting an Infant Dramatic School,
as a real nursery for the Histrionio Art. The Fairy children here
are delightful, all so pretty, and evidently such very Good Fairies.
Mr. Clarke only made one mistake, which hardly counts, and that
was in representing the King as clothed. Tho whole point of Ander-
sen's story is the child exclaiming, " Why, he has got on no clothes
at all!" It was the Naked Truth r. Courtly Flattery and False-
hood. Miss Annie Delatour's solo in the sixth tableau is well
worth listening to; she is an invisible Fairy, as is Miss Thorn-
ton, who also sings prettily during the next tableau. So the pupils
could learn music as well as acting, and would be instructed in
declamation by "The Orator," Mr. George Temple, and enter
themselves as "Students of the Temple."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HOW TO GET OUT OF IT.
[Critic to Editor.—Dear Sir,—You told me I "mustn't pitch into the
new piece," which I certainly should have done but for your Kindly instruc-
tions. I think I've managed the task rather neatly.—Tours, A. Trimmer.
As a model specimen of how to get out of saying that a piece is utter
bosh from beginning to end, we publish the accompanying in the interests of
true Critical Art.—Ed.]
We heartily congratulate Messrs. Colwyn Malaprop and Timothy
Grand on the triumphant success which attended the production of
their new
and original
Melodrama
at the Oracle
Theatre yes-
terday even-
ing. It is
sure to run
for at least
five hundred
nights, and
at the end of
that period
no doubt the
two play-
wrights,
who work
together so
harmonious-
ly, will have
another
piece ready
to take its
place. And
when we say
this, it must
be clearly
understood that we do not pledge uurselves that this last arrived of our
entertainments is either new or original. As a matter of fact we have
seen everything contrived by our authors a score of times before, and
are sick to death of forged bills, mislaid marriage certificates, and
substituted children. We loathe deserted wives and sirenically
influenced (if we may coin an epithet) husbands, and can see no fun
in the low comedy of smashing a band-box, or gentle satire in
speaking disrespectfully of somebody's mother-in-law. But what of
that, and what does it matter? Has not Messrs. Malaprop and
Grand given us a good, healthy, honest, wholesome play, that will
set the hearts of many a gallery boy (and, if it comes to that, of
many a gallery lassie too) beating as hearts have ever beat since
good old Father Adam walked through the Forest of Ardennes in
the company of the melancholy Jacques f Ay, and it is so, and we
heartily thank our authors for what they have done for us.
In these days of mock realism and sham sentiment, it is a good thing
to find that men can speak out, as it were, straight from the elbow,
as readily in the Theatre as in the Church. Not that there is any
particularly noble language in the piece under review. On the con-
trary, the captious may think that Mabel, telling her best-loved
child to steal a shilling, accidentally left on the mantelpiece, in order
that she may pay the cabman "more than his full fare, open to
question on the score of morality. But what of that? What does it
matter? The Authors aro not writing for sour-visaged Puritans,
but for good, sound-hearted, round-faced, honest John Bull, and
his rosy-cheeked wife, and his giggling, girlish, and gentle-eyed
daughters.
Again it may not be altogether true to nature to make Major-
General Sir John Abercrohbt, K.C.B., dining at mess as the guest
of Staif-Sergeant Tomklns in full uniform after the inspection of
the hitter's regiment, but if there is to be no poetic licence, beer may
as well be abandoned and skittles regarded as a game whose rules are
lost for'ever in the dim realms of a distant obscurity! For what do
we go to a play-house? Assuredly not for Shakspeare or the
musical glasses, to say nothing of prunella! So long as the fare is
sound at the core, what more can we want? And if the play of last
night was not only improbable but impossible from the opening scene
down to the end of the tag which was the signal for the lowering of
the green baize curtain, suroly the fact remains that the work was as
sweet-scented as hay, and as homely as a bean feast or a barn-door
fowl. Given this and what does the rest matter? As Othello
observes, "Not a jot, not a jot!" And the swarthy Moor of Venice
was right. The great master who "thought him out" in the little
cottage in Stratford-on-Avon was never wiser, never sager, never
freer from cant and nonsense than when he wrote "hold up the
mirror to nature to show vice her own image and virtue the habit in
which she lives," or words to like effect. Ah, " Sweet WrxxrE" was
indeed a judge of the frailties of poor humanity! He knew that the
flats must be "joined," and the scenes painted with a ten-pound
Rouge is a coarse pigment, but cheeks are',pale without it
he fierce glare of the blue-hued lime-light! Again, the
brush,
under the
hypercritical may declare that acting is a lost art, and assuredly they
would find some reason for their cross-grained assertion in the acting
ofjlast night. Mr. Avenue strutting the stage and appealing'.to the
chandelier with outstretehed arms is not exactly the sort of hero we
find in a modern drawing-room, nor is pretty Mils Haresfoot, in
white muslin in a snow-storm the ideal heroine of nineteenth century
romance. But what of that—both the lady and the gentleman are
prime favourites with the Pit, and if the dwellers in the Stalls slumber,
why then let it be more to their shame than to their glory! Out
upon the querulous questioners of the likely and the commonplace!
What do we want with their hypochondriacal murmurings? So long
as the play is pleasant to the palate and healthy to the understanding,
we can do without the applause of the reviewers and the hearty
enthusiasm of the burners oi midnight oil.
In conclusion what could be better than the title of the drama?
In selecting "Six-foot Rule Britannia" our authors have shown a
discrimination far above all praise. That it has nothing whatever
to do with the motive of the piece is a detail unworthy of criticism.
No, let us rest and be thankful. Let the play of last night run a
thousand nights—if possible longer. And when it becomes our
pleasant duty to have to record its successor, may we be in a position
to write a critique as valuable as that which with a hearty shake of
the hand to all concerned—authors, actors, managers, and scene-
painters—we now bring to a genial and welcome conclusion!
THE GllEAT UNKNOWN.

Portrait of the Pub-
lic Prosecutor.
The stern-faced resolute old man once more approached the
Treasury. He had been .there several times before, but on this
occasion there was a new Messenger at the
entrance, and consequentlythere was a chance of
his gaining admittance. With some trepidation,
he passed the porch unquestioned, and now he
was on the road to the being of whom he was in
quest.
"I shall see him," he murmured, "and prove
to an unbelieving world that he is not a myth."
Almost with a smile on his pale harsh features,
he knocked at a door and entered.
"No," said the clerk whom he had questioned;
"you have come to the wrong place. All we
have to do is to look after the Divorce Division.
We represent the Queen's Proctor. If you want
to intervene we will help you to do it, but we
can't go further than that."
"But where shall I find him ?" asked the dis-
tracted veteran.
"How should I know?" answered the official,
testily; and he turned to some one else.
Disheartened but unconquered, the aged wan-
derer uttered a sigh and recommenced his search. He entered a second
room and made his customary application.
"Now, really," said an official who was busily engaged iu dis-
cussing a plate of sandwiches and a glass of sherry, "it is several
degrees too bad to worry a fellow at his lunch!"
Surely you can tell me the name of your chief?"
"The name of my chief is nothing to you," was the brusque reply,
"but I can tell you his office. He is Solicitor to the Treasury."
Baffled once again, the wandering greybeard retired to the streets.,
and sitting down beside a lamp-post, uttered a series ofpiercing yells.
"This is disgraceful! " exclaimed a passer-by. "This man is a
nuisance. Constable, arrest him!"
"Very sorry, Sir, but I have not the power," replied the police-
man.
'' Not have the power!" echoed the wrathful pavement promenader,
and then he turned to the weeping white-head and observed to him,
"I have half a mind to take you before the Public Prosecutor."
"Take me before the Public Prosecutor?" repeated the now
radiant investigator. "Pray, pray do!"
"You would not like it! "was the stern commentary.
"Would not like it!" For a moment the ancient could not
speak for emotion, and then he continued—" Why, it would realise
the dream of my life! But if you do, you must he a cleverer man
than I am, for I have been hunting for the Public Prosecutor for the
last twenty years, without being able to find him."
"Not find him! Why here is his portrait!" A.nd with this th«
good-natured passer-by presented the old .man with the original
picture, of which the sketch ornamenting this article is a rough, but
not altogether unsuggestive copy!

HER MAJESTY'S SHIP "BLUNDERER."
A Warning Dockyard Ditty, as Sung by Cheery Jack.
D'ye want to know the trimmest craft that might have sailed from
port,
When we went a manoeuvring, mates, in Eighteen-eighty-eight ;—
A regular tip-topper of Lord George's special sort,
With every dodge aboard of her to bring her up
to date?
Then listen as I tell ye first about her steady
pace,
As proud she'd meet the Channel waves a
slipping neatly under her
At near hve knots an hour—not the speed to win a
race?
May be: but that's the record of Her Majesty's
ship Blunderer.
A record that, you '11 say, my mates, it won't take
much to "beat.
P'raps not, and like enough it is to stir a lands-
man's mirth;
But still her pace is all that she can manage, and the fleet
Take precious care, when out with her, to give her a wide berth.
For something in her steering-gear goes wrong, and then d'ye see
She runs foul of another craft, whose bulwarks straightway
dashing in.
She, after heavy loss and damage finally gets free,
Her own tliree starboard boats and all her gun-ports gaily
crashing in.
But, there, mates, they had built her five-and-twenty years ago;
So first they let her out a bit, and then they took her in,
And cut her down, and patched her up, and made a sort of show
Of giving her another inch or two of iron skin.
And so, mates, taking stock of all her points both fore and aft, [her,
Although, d 'ye see, it may be that you mightn't have a doubt of

It's possible while thinking her a tidy sort of craft,
That on the whole, if going a cruise, you'd just as soon be out of her.
So, if her boilers prime a trifle, mates, why, what's the odds,
Becos her engines and all that was put in second-hand;
And if her steam-pipe's leaky, and she busts her piston-rods,—
Well, that's the sort of thing, d'ye see, Lord George can under-
stand.
And if it comes to firing of her guns: then you may swear
Each un '11 start her breech and rings, and blow her blessed muzzle
out;
'Tain't much. But going aboard of her? It ain't that I don't dare;
But what's the use? And that's the question, mates, I tries to
puzzle out!
Moral.
So when these here manoeuvres is all finished up and done,
And Admirals and Captains stop their little larking tight,'
And the chaps who write for papers have helped to make the fun,
And talked big of the "Enemy," who never came in sight,
It mav be that My Lords," when taking stock of recent slips,
In duty to Britannia, since they take service under her,
May manage just to wipe out from their coming list of ships,
Such a racy roaring craft as Her Majesty's ship Blunderer.
"Devoutly to be Wished."—All good men, and true friends of
Ireland, hope that the Irish leaders, by entirely clearing themselves
from all suspicion of complicity with crime, will prove that they are
members of an honest National, and not Assassi-National League.
The first person (singular!) to hear of Mr. O'Kelly's arrest was
Mr. Chance. The Government, unable to give an answer when
questioned, heard of it subsequently quite by Chance. What a
lucky Chance!

The Descent ok Man,—by Parachute, out of Balloon,
on Saturday last,—when "Professor" Baldwin accom-
plished the " sensation " of descending from a Balloon at
the Alexandra Palace, when one thousand feet high,
"with," to quote the words of the scientific person's
Manager, "nothing but an umbrella to aid him in his
descent. It is true that the " umbrella" looked uncom-
monly like an ordinary parachute, but for all that the
leap seemed to be sufficiently dangerous to please the
Many-headed. TheJiProfessor" (it would be interesting
to identify his University^-did he graduate in Skye rj
claims to "drop from the clouds with ease, grace, and
rapidity." No doubt at all times he will be able to insure
the third characteristic of his flight. On Saturday he
apparently lost his balloon, but he did not lose his life.
It is to be hoped that he never will, although precedent is
against him. In the event of his getting some day a drop
too much, or rather too many, it will be important to
learn whether the coroner's jury will bring in a verdict of
misadventure, suicide, or murder. In the event of the
latter, the Authorities, who could have prevented the
accident but would not, may, perhaps, figure as accessories
before the fact!
Lambeth Conference; — The Lawn-meets for the
English and Colonial Bishops were so frequent, that
Bish ops in partibus will now be known as Bishops in

took fourteen Colonials to one of these al fresco enter
tainments.)
PLAY TIME.
Titere were to have been three Dr. Jekyll* and Mr. Hydes in the
field. One so far afield as the Croydon Theatre; at least, so said the
St. James's Gazette young man last week. But in the meantime
there have been injunctions and legal difficulties. Perhaps if the
Law is satisfied there may yet be The Strange Story of Dr. Band-
field and Mr. Mansmann, at the Lyceum Comique and Opera
Lyceum. Regular muddle. It is long since the Opera Comique nad
something in keeping with its title. The last time was when Optra
Bouffe, with full orchestra, was played there; now there's no Opera
Bouffe, but only a Band-mann.
One piece doing first-rate business in town just now is, I should
say, Mr. Pinero's Siceet Lavender, at Terry's Theatre. And
deservedly so. Capital part for Terry, who plays it admirably, though
occasionally dropping into exaggeration of style which would be more
suitable in burlesque. Mr. Alfred Bishop as the kind old Irish
Doctor is a life-like portrait; and so too is Mr. Brandram Thomas's
well made-up picture of the old remorseful Colonel, who has been a
bit of a dog and a good deal of a snob in his younger days. Miss
Carlotta Addison is the very ideal of the "lone and lorn one"—
a still youthful Mrs. Gummidge—who lives to heap coals of fire on
the head of her betraver, or rather, to nurse him in his illness, and
S've him his gruel, which she does with a will, and gives it him hot.
iss Maud Millett presents us with a pleasant sketch of the fresh
young English girl, capitally contrasted with her second-class Yankee
lover—for as she is not quite the typical aristocratic English girl, so
he is not by any means a type of the superior American,—while her
Aunt is represented by that clever actress Miss Victor as an amusing
specimen of a good-natured, vain, underbred middle-aged woman.
The story—very interesting, and the plot well constructed, with
one slight exception—seems to have been founded on the episode of
Pendennis falling in love with Fanny Bolton, the daughter of a
Temple porter. Dick Phenyl is a superior kind of Eccles; but all the
same is a sketch from real life. Miss Norbeys as the heroine, is, of
all inginues, a great deal too ingenuous. She is Thackeray's Fanny
Bolton, only,—conscious of an audience. [ So simple and innocent does
she strive her best to appear, that, not knowing the story, I began to
think she was a consummate little hypocrite, and that in the Second
Act we should find she had been playing Sainte Nitouche, and should
probably see her enjoying a champagne supper after the manner of the
'pretty little souls" in The Pink Dominoes and other kindred pieces.
By straining to emphasize her " Sancta Simplicitas," she suggests the
idea of such "an artless thing" as was Miss BeckySharp on quitting
school. The play, generally, suggests Thackeray Theatricalised. The
lover is uninteresting—lovers mostly are—and Mr. PrNERO delights in
making this commonplace young man, who is very much in love,
drop into sham poetry, and talking to Dick Phenyl—of all persons!
—about "every beat of his heart saying Lavender "—" every news-
paper-boy crying Lavender," &c, &c, and all that sort of thing,
which no young man in real life, unless he were an affected, [esthetic
nincompoop, would ever dream of saying. When Tom Robertson
gave us modern lovers on the stage he knew how valuable was the
eloquence of silence, and how natural it was for an ordinary Society
Soung man when deeply in love to be uncommonly taciturn. But
[r. Pinero wants this sort of character to talk, ana to talk a sort
of TENNYSON-and-water,—weak "T" in fact.
These are trifles. The audience takes it for granted that lovers
will talk nonsense, and though they do have their doubts as to the
genuine simplicity of Sweet Lavender herself, and do not look
forward hopefully to the future domestic happiness of her husband,
yet on the whole they are thoroughly interested and return home per-
fectly satisfied with having passed an exceptionally pleasant evening.
Obvious.
We must get John Bull's business out of this kink,
Officialdom's credit must soon be restored;
Or in Civil corruption the country will sink,
And national honour will "go by the Board."

A SONG OF WILLOW.
{Made at Lord's in the miserable two-hours'
interval between two tremendous Thunder-
showers in the /torrid Season of'88.)
Srao, "Willow"? Ay! But who may
wield
The willow bat this wild, wet season.
When, a sheer swamp, the cricket-field
Is only fit to shake and sneeze on?
When smartest "fielders" flop and plunge,
When pluvial down-pour scarcely ceases;
When balls are pap, and pads are sponge,
And " creases simply water-creases?
Say who can cut, or drive, or slog,
On black and bladeless mud-morasses?
Or bowl on wickets like a bog
That has been trampled by wild asses?
Not Grace himself nor Walter Read,
The sodden lead-like lump of leather
May urge across a miry mead
After a week of such June weather.
What chance, when "turf" means sticky
slime
Even for A. G. Steel or Lohmann?
How should " the Champion" place or time
With Jupiter Pluvius for foeman?
Slow wickets help the bowler? Yes!
But love mud-swamps? No, that's an error.
There may be too much, muck and mess
E'en for "the Tempter" or "the Terror."
For topping score or brilliant catch,
So bad a time I never saw, Sir;
Fancy the Oxford-Cambridge match
Running four days, and then a draw, Sir!
We seek the field to funk and freeze,
Oh, happy Shrewsbury, Stoddart lucky,
To be at the Antipodes
Away from quagmires cold and mucky!
This is no time for tent and sward,
But warm fire-side or cosy pillow.
Sing Willow? Bah! the cheeriest bard
Could only sing the Weeping Willow!

THE GREAT ADVENTURER.
Dear Mr. Punch,
This is what has happened. She and
I are really seriously attached to each other.
She would make an adorable wife, and I'm
sure I'm designed for domestic happiness, as
I'm always falling in love, which is quite
beastly. It keeps me continually miserable:
first, when the girls don't care for me, and
secondly, when they do. Bogie (I call her
Boole because she has such beautiful red
hair) is a perfect girl, and we should cer-
tainly be very happy, but when, in the most
gentlemanly way, I told her father about it,
he asked me a lot of impertinent questions
about my income, which was really in the
worst possible taste, as he knows very well
that I naven't any. However, I've written
a poem, which, if not entirely original, is
adapted to circumstances with some skill, and
I think you will own that, even if it doesn't
scan, it is quite true.
The people who review books are always
asking Why are there so many Minor Poets?
I can tell them one reason. It's because
there are so many sordid fathers of the .only
girl a fellow ever really loves. He hinted
something about an adventurer'—like a man
in a farce at a Matinee—so I call my poem,
Love the Adventurer (only, unfortunately, he
doesn't). Here, however, is the effort:—
LOVE THE ADVENTURER.
When Love seeks a business-man's daughter,
His hopes he will dash
By asking how he means to support her
Without any cash:
The hat that is sat on
You may have it blocked next day,
But when the old man tries that on
Love must get out of the way.
You may warble love-songs in an agreeable
baritone,
You may wear small gloves of a mild canary-
You may write for the papers, [tone.
Or have evolved the plot of a really new and
original play;
But you '11 only lose love's labours;
You can't make him see things your way.
You may train the eagle
To stoop to your fist;
(Though it's quite another thing to inveigle
The creature to desist.)
You may move (with a crowbar)
The Lioness to give o'er her prey;
But there is really no bar
To the inquisitiveness of a proposed Father-
in-law, in the matter of prospects and pay.
Yours, in depressed circumstances,
Lovelace Lackland.

After dinner House rapidly filled up.
Eleven o'clock not a seat to be had; side-
galleries crowded; Peers' Gallery thronged;
Charles Russell thumping away at his
learned friend the Home Secretary;
Edward Clarke followed on other side;
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate said what was
necessary to carry debate over. A ourious,
awkward, ill-managed arrangement of busi-
ness, which served nobody s purpose and
necessitated appropriation of another night.
Business done.—Parnell Commission Bill
discussed.
Tuesday.—Black Rod at his jokes again.
Funny at first, buta trifle monotonous; rather
Jails upon House towards end of Session,
oke is to hang about door till Commons get into thick of business;
then send in doorkeeper to bellow " Black Rod!" Began the Session
with tripping up a Minister. Fastened now on Sage of Queen Anne's
Gate. Came in upon him the other night when putting a question.
To-night Sage just launched forth in nis indictment of Attorney-
General re O'Donnell versus Times, when Black Rod appeared.
Business peremptorily interrupted; Speaker and Mace go off to
Lords to see Lord Chancellor and other old women in cloaks bow-
wowing on Woolsack.
Black Rod introduced "new piece of business to-night. Sent door-
keeper in to bawl " Black Rod!" just as House was loudly cheering
Sage. _ Doorkeeper's shout consequently drowned in uproar. Nobody
heard it. Black Rod entered practioally unannounced. Sage, with
his back to the door didn't see nim enter. Proceeded with remarks.
"Order! order!" cried the Speaker, who had spotted Black Rod.
"Well, Sir," said Sage, apolo-
getically, "I was only desiring
to point out-—"
Order! order!" shouted the
Speaker.
"Certainly, Sir, I will bow to
your decision, though I really
don't know"
"Order! order!" roared the
Speaker, with his eye on Black
Rod advancing towards the table..
Sage, looking round in bewil-
derment, at this fresh exhibi-
tion of Speaker's interference
with freedom of speech, caught
sight of Black Rod. His jaw

"Life would be endurable
only for its Peers," he said, when
he recovered presence of mind.
"The Lords pursue me even in
the House of Commons."
"Curious thing," said Black
Rod, winking at Sergeant-at-
Arms, as they crossed the Lobby
in procession. "Always find
Labby on his feet when I chance
to look in at Commons."

bated. Chamberlain, not often Just in Time,
heard now, arrived just in time to speak. A model speech, full of
point through its forty minutes, saying exactly what he had at heart
in clearest phrase, and with irresistible force. Whether one agrees
with him or not, on intellectual delight to listen. Incomparably the
best debater in House. Not an orator like Gladstone, but still
unapproachable as a debater. Fancy Chamberlain profits by recent
infrequency of his speeches in House. Have time and opportunity
to compare him with more familiar speakers. Remember what he
said in far off June days at Birmingham? Was it fifty years ago,
or only three ?:—
"I sometimes think that great men are like great mountains, and that we
do not appreciate their magnitude while we are still close to them. You have
to go to a distance to see which peak it is that towers above its fellows; and it
may be that we shall have to put between us and Mr. Gladstone a space of
time before we shall know how much greater he has been than any of his
competitors for fame and power."
Similarly, but not precisely, the conditions under which Chamber-
lain now occasionally speaks in House give opportunity for appre-
ciating his quite unique position as a debater. All nignt long, all
through the weary week, men make speeches round about a subject.
Then Chamberlain comes in and talks. As Plunket says, "A
wonderful difference between a man who has a speech to make, and a
man who has something to say."
Business done.—Parnell Commission Bill read Second Time.
Thursday.—"Demme!" says Markiss o'
Granby, Buxton's put spoke in wheel of
Black Rod."
Simile perhaps not quite perfect, but de-
scription fairly accurate. Buxton asked
how long we 're to have Black Rod bursting
in on House like a venerable oatapult? Old
Morality says he's been talking matter over
with Lord Chancellor. Arranged that sug-
gestion made by bis Hon. Friend Toby, M.P.,
a fortnight ago, shall be adopted. Black Rod
to do his bursting in before public business
commences in Commons. This, of course,
takes all the fun out of the thing. Not be
worth while turning up now if he can't
interrupt a Minister answering question, or
intercept the storied wisdom distilled from lips
of Sage of Queen Anne's Gate.
"Another of our treasured institutions
gone," says Cavendish Bentinck. "Soon
will have nothing left worth living for."
Balfour had four bad quarters of an
hour at Question Time. Irish Members
bubbling up all round him, snapping
out interrogatories. Balfour took
them all round—one down another come
on. Imperturbable throughout, only
an added hardness of manner, a degree The Markiss o' Granby.
or two more frost in his tones, indicating severity of contest.
Old Morality announced arrangements for winding up first part
of Session. Expects House to be up on 11th of August. To that
end proposes programme which, if carried out, would keep House at
work till Christmas. Programme in point of magnitude much more
like Queen's Speech on opening Parliament in iebruary than sug-
gestions of Leader of House closing up tracks at end of July.
"It's all right, you'11 see," said Old Morality. "Remember in
younger days, when I was still attendant at a seminary, we used, for
the perfection of our style of caligraphy, carefully to copy out re-
marks lithographed at the top of a ruled page. One of these, I
remember, ran to the effect, Throio plenty of mud, and some of it
will, in all human probability, adhere. That's the principle upon
which, animated as I am bv a desire to meet the convenience of
Hon. Members, and conserve the interests of the public service, I lay
before the House this somewhat extended programme. We shall not
get through with it all: but we shall emerge having achieved more
than if we essayed to do less. In other words, as we used to write
in the days already alluded to, If you aim at the stars, you may
succeed in sending a stone through the windows of the second-patr
back."
Business done.—Report Stage of the Local Government Bill.
Friday.—Local Government Bill through final stage in Commons.
Four Peers, representing Upper House, playing whist since Seven
o'Clock, waiting for Bill. Stout and long pipes supplied out of Civil
Service Estimates. Half-an-hour after midnight word came Bill
was through Commons, and compliments going on all round. Four
Peers put away cards, finished stout, presented attendants with
broken pipes, and marched into Lords. One took a seat in front of
Woolsack, and presided, three others spread themselves as much as
possible about Chamber, and formed a House. Bill, solemnly brought
m, ordered to be read a First Time. House adjourned.
"Have another rubber P" said Noble Lord, who had presided.
"Think not. Getting late. Besides, we have finished the stout."
So they went home.
Business done.—Local Government Bill read Third Time in
Commons, and First Time in Lords.

THE PARACHUTE.
Lively Aeronaut. "Happy Thought! Blowed ip I'll comb down
till the Weather changes!"
TWO AMERICAN "EYE-OPENERS."
("Still Alarm" at Princess's, and Still More Alarming at Lyceum.)
Eye-Opener No. 1.—On the first night of The Still Alarm, after
the sensation scene in Act III., representing "The Central Fire
Station, New York," the actors were called before the Curtain, so
was the author, who didn't appear—at least I didn't see him—and so
were the horses, one of which was led on to bow its acknowledg-
ments. The burning and shining fire-engine, which also received
the honour of a summons, modestly remained behind the Curtain, as
did also the meditative greyhound, whose part in the piece stood out
far more than that of Mr. Harry Nicholls, who as a good young man
tried his very best to be funny, but despairing of success, had recourse
to pretending to play the bones with a couple of spoons, then a tray as
a tambourine, and finally his hat as a concertina, and at last finding
that these original devices somewhat failed in their object, he relapsed,
during the remainder of Miss Fanny Leslie's solo dance, into moody
Bilence, evidently wondering within himself why he had ever been
born, and bitterly meditating on the hollow absurdity of the old pro-
verb which asserts that " Necessity is the mother of invention." If
ever there were a moment when the necessity for doing something
really humorous was imperative, wasn't it now on this first night of
The Still Alarm f
The style of Mr. Lacy, who plays the hero, is something between
that of a sententious American Lecturer and the " Massa Johnson"
of every Nigger Minstrel troupe. He is supposed to represent, says
the programme, "An American fireman of to-day." and if he does
so, correctly, then, however active and spry the "American Fireman
of to-day" may be in answer to a call (not before the Curtain, but to
a fire), his manner in private life is marked by a peculiar kind of
squirming action, coupled with a drawling, sing-song, nasal intona-
tion, which, if intended to be irresistibly fascinating, singularlv fails
in attaining its object. Whatever may be the attitude of Mr. Harry
Lacy's Jack Mauley towards others, be it of love or hate, there is one
person with whom he is always evidently on the very best of terms,
and that person is—himself. The best performance in this old-
fashioned piece (which only differs from most of this kind in not
having a wicked Baronet in the dramatis persona—but then Baronets,
good or wicked, are not indigenous to New York) was that of Mr. H.
Parker as the drunken old actor. He reminded me of Benjamin
Webster in Janet Pride, with a considerable touch of Mr. George
Honey as Eccles in Caste.
Of course, the Fire-piece will draw on account of this one scene,
vol. xcv.
which is well worth seeing, as a practically vivid illustration of the
rapidity with which a fire-engine can be turned out, fully equipped,
at the shortest possible notice, in the Central Fire Station of New York.
The action, by the way, seemed to me rather incomplete, as the engine
was driven off by Jack Manley alone, and. the firemen were left
behind to form a tableau at the descent of the Curtain. The
orchestra ought to introduce "Sound an A larm!" into the pverture.
Eye-Opener No. 2. "The Strange Story of Box and Cox; or,
A Puzzle for Bouncer" at the Lyceum.—I must defer my criticism
on The Strange Story until I have quite recovered from the awful
jumpy, creepy, crawly effect produced on me by Mr. Mansfield's
extraordinary performance last Saturday night. "And is Old
Double dead?" He is, and he isn't. "For 0 it is such a norrible
tale !" as Mr. E. L. Blanchard used to sing. Ugh! Ugh! Lights
there! What ho! Lights, I say! "Why, being gone, I am Dr.
Jckyll again!" I read the book long ago, and quite forget why
Dr. Jekyll's inferior self is called Mr. Hyde. Who gave him that
name? But more of this anon, when I have had time to reviewMt
calmly. Now it's all Hyde and Hanwell, and Quilp as Grip the
Raven, raven mad, crving, "I'm a devil! I'm a devil I" Mr.
Mansfield looked so like the late Mr. Creswick, that most middle-
aged play-goers must have expected him to turn into Sheppard.
The Strange Story of Shepp ard and Cresicick!! It is a ghastly
extravaganza, with a marvellous " transformation scene." So slight
is the human interest in the story, that it might as well have been
produced at the Egyptian Hall of Mystery, as The Strange Story of
Messrs. Maskelyne and Cook. Hush! 'tis the Night Watch! Put
out the lights! close the shudders—ah !—I am not Dr. Jekyll nor
Mr. Hyde^ut still Yours tremblingly, Jack-in-the-Box

Held skill at will, and power in full command,

With powers unimpaired, though late o'erstrained,

JEUNE POUR LA JEUNESSE!
Mrs. Jeune, writing to the Editor of Truth, makes the fol-
lowing appeal (which Mr. Punch gladly seconds) on behalf of her
Children s Boarding-out Fund:—
"May I make one more appeal for a little extra help for my Boarding-out
Fund? Through tho kindness of your readers and my friends, I have reci ived
£363 13a., and with that money hare sent 386 children to the country at a
cost of £303 is. lid. But the holidays arc beginning next month, and I hare
200 more waiting anxiously to know whether they are to have the much-
dreamt-of, or longed-for holiday. Will your readers help me to send them >
One pound sends a child for three weeks. How much health and happiness
that little sum represents, perhaps we can never fully realise. But we may
take it on the word of those who, perhaps, can judge, that no money is better
spent—no good more unalloyed than that which gives the little London
children their country holiday."
One pound sends a child for three weeks to the fields!
A fiscal fact this for us all to remember,
How seldom a sovereign such interest yields!
Three weeks, mark, in August, or e'en in September.
British Public stump up to a ri^ht handsome tune,
And mako Autumn fulfil the fair "Promise of Jeune."

JACK AT THE WINDLASS.
(Dibdin adapted to the Day.)
Come, all hands ahoy to the anchor!
Manoeuvres are now all the go.
Land-lubbers whose hearts are all rancour
On Britain's sea-glories would blow.
They say foreign foes would just kick us
About on the boisterous main;
But these shore-going Timons won't trick us,
We've licked, and can lick 'em again.
With a will, ho! then pull away, jolly boys,
Our sea-trim has altered, we know;
But we 're in for't, then dash^it, what folly,
For to be down-hearted! Yo-ho! [boys,
We look rum in a hulk and our rigging.
ISome hare gone ashore, and some sunk.
,Tho Warrior went winkle-digging.
The Sandfly went wrong ; but why funk?
The old Wooden Walls are slap out of it,
Iron is now all the rage.
Some blunders we've made—there's no doubt
So did Old Salts, I '11 engage. [of it,
With a will, ho! &c.
We must go with the times; that's my maxim.
Old England expects us to win;
Bull doesn't much mind how they tax him,
So there's something to show for his tin.
Do you think Jack will sulk or turn craven?
No, no! he will work, tight, and smile,
Same with big war-hulks at Berehaven,
As with old wooden ships at the Nile.
With a will, ho! &c.
Here's me, now, aboard of the Ajax,
For fun or for fighting agog;
Bull knows how to find, and to pay, Jacks,
And Jack's game for glory or grog.
Once to handle a blade and hitch trousers,
Sufficed Jack for talents and charms;
By Benbow, that will not do now, Sirs,
In these days of whopping big arms!
With a will, no! &c.
The Gunner must now be no bubber,
Straight shooting as Science is classed;
The Steersman must not be a lubber,
Our ships are so big and so fast!
No jollity, Nancy-Iovo, wrapp'd in,
No fondness for fighting and flip,
Will now tit a fellow to Captain
That marvel an Iron-clad Ship.
With a will, ho! &c.
Some praise our new ships, some abuse them,
They're ugly, no doubt, as they're big;
What Jack has to do is—to use them.
He '11 do it too, boys, dash my wig!
Jack never was known for a railer,
We 're here for rehearsal—no joke!
But to do his darned best show your Sailor,
Be hulls built of iron or oak.
With a will, ho! then pull away, jolly boys,
Our sea-trim is altered we know;
But spite some.big blunders, 'twere folly, boys,
For to be down-hearted! Yo-ho!
All tiie Diffebence.—Me. J. A. Hamil-
ton, in his new volume on Daniel O'Connell,
warns us not to judge the great Irishman
"by an English standard." What the present
Irish leader objects to be judged by is not
so much an English Standard as an English
Times.
ON THEIR METALS.
The 0. N. R. and the L. & N. W. R. are
making a race for it to the north, and
eclipsing all previous records in fast railway
travelling. In future the Euston " Scotch-
man" will get to Edinburgh in eight and a
half hours, and the King's Cross one, "for
one month only," in eight! A month of such
steeplechasing is quite enough for anybody.
The hundred and ninety-four miles to York
done without a break!—or rather, with only
a continuous automatic break. Sportsmen,
going north, instead of singing "My Heart's
in the Highlands," will feel inclined to sin|j,
"My Heart's in my Mouth." And what is
to prevent the " one month only" from be-
coming the Great Northern's "permanent
way"? We notice that.the Nortn-Western
interval for dinner at Preston will be reduced
to twenty minutes—twenty minutes allowed
for shunting the hungry traveller into the
Refreshment Room, coupling him to a meal
of three courses, and shunting him back
again. In fact, you first bolt into the Re-
freshment Room, and then bolt in it; you
eat in haste ana repent at leisure. Why
not call these new train-services a training
in dyspepsia?
A Case or Geousf. Injustice,—it will he,

A ROW IN THE HOUSE DURING "TIKES v. CRIMES" DEBATE IN COMMITTEE.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Souse of Commons, Monday Night, July 30. — " Toby," said
Joseph G ill is, in a broken voice, whilst a tear ran down his cheek
and fell upon his watch-chain, where it stood like the dewdrop on
the collar of gold that Maiachi wore which he won from the proud
invader,—"Toby, I don't know whether you're of a musical turn,
but, if you can give me the key-note, I should like to sing what we
used to call in Parry.'i^uncA; Dimity. "Whether the Session be
long or short, I can go now in peace; to-night's done me a power of

een the right sort of thing. Cheered me withered heart, made me
feel ten years younger. Excuse me, but the Speaker's up, going
through the Orders, and I must go and object."
Truly Joey is translated. The old gleam in bis eye, the old swing
in his stride, the old rigidity of the forefinger extended to "object."
! Thought he was reformed, but only suffering from lack of opportu-
nity. As Henby Fowxeb said the other day, when I was speaking to

[August 11, 1888.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A very lively night. Began at Question Time, when Parnellites
made dead set at Balfour, with occasional raids upon the Chair.
But this nothing to deve-
lopments in Committee on
Parnell Commission Bill.
Benches crowded; inter-
ruptions constant; cheering
and laughter incessant.
Impressive scene when Har-
couet thought he heard a
smile from Gorst. Stopped
short in speech; wouldn't
go on till Gorst had finished
his smile, and assumed
customary judicial air.
Wilder still when, just on
stroke of midnight, Cham-
berlain spoke.
"Pickle getting peppery,"
said Charles Forster.
"Think I'll strut oft whilst
coast clear. Not so lithe as
I was; still, lithe enough."
Five minutes to Twelve
when Chamberlain sat
down. Courtney about to
put question, when Parnell
slowly rose from below
Gangway. Debate must
needs peremptorily close at
midnight. What could
Parnell say in four min-
utes? A good deal more
than was pleasant for some
to hear. Turned upon
Chamberlain with placid manner, smiling countenance, and bitter
tongue; trickled down upon him stream of vitriol. Drop by drop
it fell, searing and burning. Only four minutes to say it all in.
But had finished before Big Ben broke in with sound of midnight.
Irish Members leaped up in tumult of uncontrollable delight. Above
the roar, like shout of mob thirsty for some one's blood, rose cry of
"Judas! Judas!" This was Tay Pay's contribution to harmony
of sitting; subsequently withdrawn, and apologised for. But what
of that? Conybeare. the great authority on points of honour, has
established code in tnis matter, accepted in sympathetic circles.
As he has written, "the withdrawal of an unparliamentary ex-
Sression does not do away with the effect produced by using it, and
oes not imply any alteration of a deliberately expressed opinion."
Business done.—In Committee on Commission Bill.
Tuesday Xig?U.—Debate on Commission Bill on again. Seems to
have been a mistako somewhere. General im-
pression was that Parnell had been doing some-
thing j midnight assassination, moonlighting,
houghing of cattle, or some other nocturnal diver-
sion. Turns out House assembled, not to consider
possibility of Parnell's guilt, but certainty of
Chamberlain's. At opening of proceedings Par-
nell appeared in position of Public Prosecutor.
Got Chamberlain in dock, and publicly pum-
melled him. House amazed, sat and listened with
open mouth.
"I suppose," said Lewis Pelly, his hair
rising Pelly-melly, and uplifting his hat,
"we shall next nave a little pamphlet on
Chamberlainism and Crime."
Parnell more than hints that Chamber-
y/, lain when Cabinet Minister was playing fast
and loose with men steeped to the lips in
crime. Quite an unexpected treat this.
House summoned to debate on troublesome
Bill, suddenly found itself treated to piquant
dish of scandal. Every seat occupied. Mem-
bers standing at Bar, leaning over gallery,
flocking behind Speaker's Chair. Cham-
berlain as quiet and collected as Pahnell.
Admits he had communications with Irish
Chief between 1880 and 1885. But interviews
were sought by Parnell, and what passed
faithfully reported to Gladstone.
Through both narrativesold friend, O'Shea,
flits. Chamberlain says O'Shea was Par-
nell's agent in arranging interviews. Parnell says O'Shea
arrived at one of the interviews whilst he was there with Justin
McCarthy. It's all O'Shea. Seems to have been impartial agent
for both sides.

"Pelly-Melly."
"That's all very well," says Campbell-Bannerman. "But we
mustn't forget the old axiom. What says Coke upon Littleton—or
was it Littleton upon Coke? Quifacit per alium, facit per Shea."
After Chamberlain-Parnell fizzleover, Debate on Commission Bill
went forward. Proceedings decidedly explosive. Edward Watkin,
who knows something about railways, says reminded him of nothing
so much as train approaching station on foggy afternon. Fog-
signals exploding every two minutes. Old Morality had terrible
time. Appears that Walter, of Times, happened to call at Gros-
venor Square, whilst preparations for.Commission Bill going forward.
Interview nothing whatever to do with Bill. An old friend just
passing by, looked in to say "Howdy?" Bill might have been men-
tioned; but so was the weather. O'Shea seems to have had nothing
to do with this meeting. Position nevertheless harped upon till Old
Morality loses his temper • frankly tells Sage of Queen Anne's Gate
he's another. Sago much hurt at tnis wild language, but on ground
that Old Morality is unduly excited, magnanimously forgives him.
Business done.—Parnell Commission Bill in Committee.
Wednesday.—Matters livelier than ever. Joseph Gtllis skipping
about like a young lamb. Flits from side to side, in and out by the
door, across the lobby and back again.
"Not precisely up to usual style of Puck," says Albert Rollit,
looking on admiringly. "But,—everything going wrong, everybody
by the ears and Joseph Gillis hopping around—reminds me of scene
in the wood. Expect to find him catching Chairman's eye and
saying as he skips, "Mr. Courtney, Sir;
Up and down, up and down;
I will lead them up and down:
I am fear'd in field and town;
Goblin, lead them up and down!"
Tim Healy wanting to know more about Old Morality's morning
callers. "How about this visit of Walter?" says Tim, as if he
were inquiring whether the grocer had called; "and Buckle—what
did Buckle call for? Walter, we know, was an old friend. Wa9
Buckle an old friend?"
Gladstone in terribly high spirits. Thumps the box, shakes his
fist at Goschen, and nearly talks himself hoarse. Goschen affected
almost to tears. Then Harcouet comes in, big
and blatant, roaring and rampant. Lulu,
standing on guard at lobby-door, bringing up
the British Constitution in the rear whilst his
father leads it in the van, hears the parental
voice and is soothed.
Closure moved: Courtney puts question;
declares "the Ayes have it!1'; Parnellites
bellow "No!" Division threatened; Glad-
stone shakes his head in token of dissent.
Question put again. Parnellites sit dumb;
only O'Hanlon up in the side gallery with
small day-book on his knee roars No!"
O'Hanlon in the grocery business when tem-
porarily out of politics. Bather neglected home
affairs of late. Thinks opportunity favourable
for making up accounts ana lost time. So finds
snug corner in gallery, brings out day-book
and bill-heads, pegs away for an hour. Getting
•n with work nicely when Closure incident
comes on. Hears his friends shout "No!"
when question put. Doesn't observe Glad-
stone's signal of dissent; goes on making out
his bills. Meets Courtney's reiterated assertion
that " the Ayes have it!" with steady shout of
"No!" All eyes turned upon him. Just put
down another half-pound of sugar to Mat
Maloney, 13, Main Street, Derry, when House
cleared for Division; then emissary sent up to
explain situation. O'Hanlon sees it all;
Question again put; sits mute as harp on
Tara's wall; Closure agreed to and sitting
adjourned. Business done.—Committee again.
Friday, 1"30 a.m.—Commission Bill through at last. A dull sitting
compared with those that had gone before, varied by charge of breach
of privilege against Times. Been saying things of Gladstone, John
Morle y, and.even of Habcourt! Talk designed with more than usual
plainness to pass away time. Arranged that at One o'Clock this
morning', whatever Clauses left should be put without debate. Scene
expected at One o'Clock; impatiently awaited; nothing came of it:
Courtney put Clauses one by one; no one said him nay, and so Bill
passed through Committee. Esslemont (in the drapery business at
Aberdeen), emulous of O'Hanlon's success on Wednesday, got into
corresponding position in opposite gallery; produced day-book and
bill-heads ; worked away, intending to challenge Division on Clauses.
Splendid advertisement for Esselmont and Mackintosh. "And so
cheap," the canny Scot observed to himself. At last moment heart
failed him. Clauses passed, and opportunity

'Lulu."

In Our Celebrities—St?Airs and Sonneschein—M. W alert has a
good photograph of Mr. Gladstone, in a peculiar reddish glow of
light—suggestive of his blushing for Dr. Biggar and some of his
recent associates, or of a Grand Old Sunset. Then next in order is
Sir Algernon Borthwick meditating on the strange laws of News-
paper Libel; and thirdly, Mr. George Lewis in resplendent gaiters
with an ornamental vase on the table by his side, which is probably
characteristic of something—perhaps his vase'd legal knowledge,
though I can hardly suppose, far-fetched as some of L. E.'s jokes are,
that this was really the meaning of the ornament at G. L.'s elbow.
Then there are Mr. Barraud's Men and Women of the Day, in
which appears Mrs. Gladstone, who clearly ought not to have heen
separated from her husband this year of ;nll years when they are
Golden Unionists. She looks remarkably happy, either at being in
the company of such distinguished photos as that of Admiral
HEWETT,.V.C.,and Dr. Richter, or at the idea of being re-united to
"Mr. G.," when the volume is bound up and the photos are re-united.

Second G. Hurt himself P Not he! One of the skilf ullest acrobats
in the country, Sir. Knows what he's about, I can tell you.
Third G. Nonsense, Sir! Never intends to do it. All a put-up
job to gammon the public.
First G. Well, but I don't quite see the pull of that, don't you
know.
Second G. {scornfully). Don't you, though f Why, you must be
jolly innocent, you must. He '11 get the Gate Money, and we shall
get the gammon. Simple enough—except to simpletons.
_ Fourth G. {old-fashioned Tory). Well, I don't think such exhibi-
tions ought to be allowed. Can t think what Government can be
about not to interfere. The performance, Sir, is both dangerous and
demoralising.
Third G. Well, you've come to see it, anyhow.
Fourth G. {with dignity). Sir. my motives in doing so differ from
those of the mob. I hate mobs. It is because this business is
pandering to the mob that I protest against it. I am here to—well,
in point of fact, to protest. {Excitedly.) By Jove, he's off!
Third G. {dryly). Not yet! I see you're going to "protest"—
with a pair of opera-glasses. However, you needn t flurry yourself.
There'H be a hitch somewhere presently, and then either the per-
formance will be postponed, or something perfunotory will be fobbed
off on the public instead of the real thing.
Second G. {hotly). Nothing of the sort, Sir. I happen to know
that this is a perf ectly bond ftde business. You, I suspect, are inte-
rested .in a rival Snow, and pooh-pooh this performance because
it is not on your own programme.
Third G. (angrily). Not in our programme f Why we've had the
real thing in reserve for years, with a far better artiste than yonder
fumblcr ready to accomplish it, only—thanks to fellows of your sort
—we've been prevented from presenting it to the Public.
Second G. Oh, ah, I dare say. That s always your cry.

balloon collapses! Great Heavens, he's off!—he's falling like a

ance is tested—wait till our man has a try, and you '11 see. (Snorts.
First G. Well, anyhow, it's a clever feat, and Professor Ritchie
is a cool customer. If that Parachute only lasts, and doesn't collapse,

THE NEW CRUSADE, AND THE FIVE CHAMPIONS OF CHRISTENDOM.
"I address myself to Christian England, because nowhere can I find a greater respect for liberty and human dignity; for it is England, who, in this
age, has taken the initiative in the abolition of slavery in the West Indies, and this she has done with an indomitable energy and a perseverance which
have at last obtained the concurrence of all nations, and the triumph of a noble cause. Noblesse oblige. After having destroyed Colonial slavery,
England owes it to herself, to support, by her sympathies, those who wish to destroy African slavery,—a hundred times moro horrible."—Cardinal
Lavigerie, at Meeting of the British ana Foreign Anti-Slarery Society, held in Prince s Hall.

Noblbssb oblige! Right, eloquent, high
preacher
Of Christian chivalry to willing ears!
When England owns not Duty for chief teacher,
Slights nonour, or takes counsel of her fears;
When the long wail of the enslaved, tormented
Dusk victims of the gold-god's cankered lust
Stirs not her heart, with sluggish peace con-
tented.
Her name is nullity, her fame is dust.
Noblesse oblige.' This, like the war-drum's

Than Saladln's desert swordsmen swart

'Tis ours to close in stern and truceless duel
With the dread incubusthat haunts the dark
Of the Dark Continent. Oh, land of shadows,
Which the whole Western World seems now
to throng
In ardent search of Trade's new Eldorados,
Whose spoils there lie for the astute and

One shadow darker, deadlier than all others
Lies like a line of sinister eclipse
Across your torrid sand-tracks. "Men and

How glibly the old pulpit-tag still slips
From thoughtless tongues; and there they
lie and perish
In myriads, prone, done cruelly to death.
Where are the nopes brave Gordon dared to
cherish,
For which stout Livingstone his latest

Drew painfully 'midst leafy wildernesses?
Still on the roads our heroes strove to clear
The ceaseless, ruthless, blood-stained Slave-

The fiendish Arab lurks, a shape of fear
By forest-path, lake-border, hutted village,
Where women toil, men sleep, or children
stray,
Pauscless as pestilence, intent on pillage,
Heady to ravish, prompt to fire or slay.
Think on that tiger-throng and the red ravage
They make midst Afric's homes unchecked,

The long dread marches, and the slaughter

All the black horrors of the accursed trade.
Lavigerie pictures them till fierce compassion
Throbs like the fire of hatred in the heart.
Think of it, careless votaries of Fashion!
Think of it, affluent masters of the Mart!
This too is Trade! Mammon means Moloch
often
Even in factory cage, or Sweater's den;
But there, no love may aid, no solace soften
The doom of men the prey of fellow-men.
Men? Miscreants, demons, tigerish torturers,
rather,
With whom we, save with sword, no
terms should hold.
And in t hose realms the Christian nations gather
In hot earth-hunger, eager quest of gold.

And of civility, meet, as rivals there;
Thither the polished Frank for wealth is
turning. [care

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM A NAUTICAL KNOW-NOTHING.
All at Sea with the X. T.Z. Squadron.
I hope you have received my previous contributions all safe and
sound, for in them I have described to you all that has occurred to U3
since the "Declaration of War" up to date. Seeing how at one
moment the Authorities seem up to any larks, and the next appear
to take the whole thing in grim earnest, I shouldn't be surprised to
hear that my letter had been washed overboard, or seized, or done
something to that had prevented it ever reaching you at all.* What
a time I've had of it! You know, as I told you, I began by hiding
under the Admiral's table, and copying out has sealed orders to send
you, and then, when I was discovered, and said it was only "my
fun," and I thought "it didn't matter, as they were only playing at
lighting," and he said " he had half a mind " to have me put in
irons," to teach me how to conduct myself on board one of Her
Majesty's ships, I really felt so disgusted, that, if I could have got
off, I should certainly have thrown the whole thing up then and there.
However, the incident passed, though 1 'm bound to say it left a
nasty feeling behind. It is owing to this that I am rather vague as
to what we are supposed to have been doing. When I go upto a
First-Lieutenant, and slap him cheerily on the back, and say, "Well,
Mate, how's the enemy this morning r" he only mumbles something
in a resentful manner, but gives me no information. I fancy, as far
as I can gather, we are supposed to be watching a hostile fleet, or
else we are blockading one; though, now I come to think of it, per-
haps we are supposed to be blockaded ourselves. I must try and
solve this, and then perhaps I may be able to give you some definite
idea of what our movements mean. They certainly are curious.
For the last few days we have been continually creeping along in-
shore, then on, suddenly sighting the " Enemy," dashing out,—at
least, so it seems to me,—about 200 miles into the Atlantic, for the
purpose of slowly creeping back again somewhere else. To-day there
has Deen a good deal of signalling going on, and on a local Coast-
guard Station displaying the question, Have you any message for
Whitehall?" I managed to get the advantage of the petty officers
who were looking out the flags, and, I think to the surprise of every-
body, quickly ran up "Walker!" This again seemed to annoy the
Admiral, and a fresh nasty feeling has been the result. I believe
he has threatened to put me on board the first torpedo-boat that
comes within hail. However, meantime, I have made the acquaint-
ance of a communicativo Marine, from whom I have gathered
several items of what sounds like reliable information. He has
pointed me out some vessels in the offing, which he says are the
Stagnation, Rattletrap, Blazer, and Ophicleide, who are watching
us, and that, when we get within one thousand yards of them, the
"fun will begin."
Apparently hard-up for any excitement,the Admiral bears down on
the quartette with alacrity, and we are soon in the midst of them. They
have commenced blazing away at us with their guns on all sides. Two
of ours won't fire, but that doesn't much matter, and I don't suppose
it would in real warfare, for, what with the noise and excitement,
we seem to get on well enough without them.
After about an hour and a half of this, the other side suddenly
stops and sends off a despatch-boat, bearing a flag of truce. It brings
an Umpire, who says, that he has ruled us outof the game as " sunk."
The Admiral's only reply is " Gammon!" The Umpire expostulates
and says, that if that is the way his authority'is to be treated, "the
sooner the whole thing is understood to be a gigantic farce the better,"
to which the Admiral rejoins that he doesn't care a couple of brass
farthings whether the whole thing is regarded as a gigantio farce or
not, but that "he is not going to strike nis colours in deference to the
expression of a bit of beggarly opinion in an out-of-the-way nook on
the Irish coast."
This apparently settles the Umpire, who retires threatening that
he will communicate with Whitehall. The Admiral thereon puts our
head about, returning to the bay, which, reaching about dusk, we
are, owing to there being some hitch in the working of our signals,
taken for one of the enemy by our own ships, and greeted by a succes-
sion of heavy broadsides from the Dunderhead, Jackass, Catapult,
Slop-basin, Blue-bottle and Boot-jack, who continue pounding away
at us until they discover their mistake. The local Umpire upon this
gives it as his opinion that as such a catastrophe might have occurred
in real warfare, he is obliged to rule us as sunk," and therefore,
out of the game. The Admiral merely again rejoins "Stuff and
nonsense!" and says that " real warfare or sham warfare," he is not
going "to be ruled out of his ship, by the decision of any petty-
fogging Umpire alive, as long as he has a single blessed plank of her
afloat under nim." The Umpire says that that's all very well, but
"it is not the sort of spirit in which to carry out the Naval Man-
oeuvres," upon which the Admiral tells him to "Shut up and mind his
own business." Upon this the Umpire merely retires sulkily.
Taking advantage of an inquirv by signal from the station as to
whether we wanted any coals, and wishing to find out if there was
* This is the only contribution wo have received from our Correspondent.—Ed.
any conveyance to take me if I could manage to get ashore, I just
ran up the answer, "No. But can I get a four-wheeler on the
coast?" On this being reported to the Admiral, it has apparently
put him in into a very Dad temper, for he has ordered me to be put
in irons for the night. This is very unpleasant.
I have just remarked to the communicative Marine, that I think
it rather a strong measure, considering that I have only been
playing at being on board a man-of-war. He says, no doubt that is
so, but that it won't do to be "too larky with the Admiral." Anyhow,
the incident brings this communication to an abrupt olose. More in

THE TRAVELLER'S DREAM-BOOK FOR AUGUST, 1888.
(Prepared by the Cleric of the Weather, but subject to considerable
variation.)
If you dream of—
A miens.—You must expect rain in a foreign town without home
comforts.
Bath.—Go there. Ask for hairdresser.
Boulogne.—Look for the perfumes of the Port in an East wind.
Brighton.—Don't, at least not yet: better try Jericho.
Calais.—Accustom yourself to a rough sea-passage with the glass a
few degrees above freezing.
Coventry.—Try it for the sake of your friends.
Dieppe.—Prepare for a storm-beaten Casino without visitors.
Etretat.—Welcome a watering-place where it is too cold to bathe.
Florence.—Fancy Italy in the unhealthy season.
Oenoa.—Learn to love dirt in a desert.
Heidelberg.—Imagine a Castle in a Scotch mist.
Interlachen.—Confine your attention to an excellent table d'hote at
the Switzerhof.
Jericho.—Try Brighton instead. It is Jewly here all the year
round.
Kiel.—Picture to yourself dulness at its worst, and beat the record.
Lyons.—Think of silk, and rest satisfied without paying a visit to
its chief manufactory.
Madrid.—Acclimatise yourself to bull-fights, and if you contem-
plate suicide choose the arena to an overdose of chloroform.
Naples.—See the Bay in a fog, and don't die, if you can help it.
Paris.—Pass through before you are drenched.
Quebec.—Rather far off, which may be an advantage, if the sun in
Europe has retired on permanent leave of absence.
Ramsgate.—Go there. Air confers immortality, vide recent local
sanitary reports. Nobody dies at Ramsgate: if they want to do so,
they immediately leave the place and go somewhere else.
Rotterdam.—Get your umbrella and open it.
Suez.—Better try Southend; livelier.
Turin.—Do not weep if you find the rain as constant as at the
Italian Exhibition.
Uig.—Spend all your time and money in testing whiskey.
Venice.—Confess that a gondola in a thunderstorm is not much
more amusing than a Hansom cab with the glass down.
Waterloo.—Imagine that it's rather, fun to drive in a coach up to
your eyes in an Ulster.
Whitby.—All clever people at Whitby. Here " Les grands esprits
se rencontrent." Hence the name. Don't you go to Whitby. _
X—Exeter.—Try it, and get out of it. Be Enterer and Exiter.
Yarmouth.—Avoid the bloater aristocracy.
Zurich.—"On the margin of Fair Zurich's waters"—give your-
self a margin—or better—leave it to your imargination.
And if you dream of no place at all—why, thank your lucky stars
and stay at home!
Manners Make the Foreman.—At the Old Bailey last week
the learned Recorder of London was charging the Grand. Jury, when
the Foreman suddenly charged back. No wonder there was a " sen-
sation in Court." Perhaps this Juryman was too " Grand" to listen
to legal advice. He seems to have token Chambers for a Flat!
Probable.—Dr. T-nn-r, M.P.. is said to be writing some New
Nursery Rhymes, to be called Tullamore Tra-la-las. He has got as
far as " Barr, Barr, black-sheep," but here the Muse has failed him.
Theatrical Forecast for August and September.—Mr. Charles
Wtndham will make the ascent of several mountains, giving per-
formances in various languages of David Garrick. lie will also
try the N. W. Passage; if he doesn't like it, he '11 give it up, and
do a little Polar Bear shooting. Mr. Windham will play for one
night only in Japan, and on his road home he will give a Matinee,
under tho patronage of the Grand Llama of Thibet. He will
inaugurate nis Winter Season with an entirely new piece entitled
David Garrick.
03» N0T1CB.—Rejected Communications or Contributions, whether MB., Printed Hatter, Drawings, or Pictures of any description, will
in no case be returned, not even when accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed Envelope, Cover, or Wrapper. To this rule
there will be no exception.

Why not take hint from Irish ex-constable who's going
about Eastern Counties in a "Home Rule Van, and
have van of my own in benighted South of England P
I will.
Next Day.—Van procured. Smells distinctly stuffy.
Several vans, in fact, because directly I mentioned sub-
ject, Granville said "he mutt come too!" So did
Spencer, Habcourt (why Harcoukt?), Shaw-Lefevbe,
Hebschell, and Rosbbery. Each of 'em has a van:
but Rosebkry says I'm in "the van of progress," and
must go first. Start next week.
Monday.—Our Caravan starts from Town amid indes-
cribable enthusiasm. Whole of Piccadilly, Knights-
bridge, Hammersmith Road, and as far as Hounslow,
packed with crowds to see us puss. Query—Does not
this show that opinion of London is changing on Home
Rules' Shaw-Lefevbe says, "Not a doubt of it."
Granville suggests "making detour to avoid mob."
Wish he wouldn't speak of "mob" when he means
electors. If one says, making detour to avoid electors,"
folly of such a course at once apparent. Only get ten
miles out of Town by night-time. Put up on a common. Hesschell rather
doubtful if we "aren't making ourselves liable to action for trespass." Wish
he wouldn't bring out inconvenient legal knowledge just now. Have made five
speeches, Habcourt six. Query—Isn't it unwise of Habcoubt to challenge
oratorical comparison with me in this way?
Tuesday Morning.—Wake up with happy notion. Why not signals between
different vans? Rosebkry takes to idea at once. Spends day in erecting com-
plicated series of flags on roofs, which can be pulled by strings from inside.
Also invents signalling code. [N.B.—Interesting subject for pamphlet, Signal-
ling.] We all learn it, except Habcourt, who's studying maps, as he's
volunteered to be our guide. Says he knows the country by heart.
Wednesday.—Got to Farnham. Agricultural district. Gratifying reception.
Villagers turn out in hundreds, also turn out horses, and drag us into village.
Long speeches. Give rustics lecture on Irish Land Tenure. Rustics go offto
hear Habcourt, who's bellowing as usual. In evening horses can't be found
anywhere. Some London thieves are suspected of having organised the reception,
and eloped with horses! Query—is this a dodge of Salisbury's? Or Argyll,
in revenge for recent soliloquy in Lords? Must inquire. Begin notes for my
forthcoming article on "Our Nomadic Population."
Thursday.—Somewhere in Hampshire. Shaw-Lefevbe made speech before
breakfast. Stupidly spoke of agricultural labourer as "Hodge." Labourers
very angry. When I try to pacify them with seductive speech on Home-Rule,
they say they want to know about Allotments! Don't Remember Mitchels-
town," but do remember "Three Acres and a Cow." Find they believe in
Jesse—singular delusion! In afternoon, Habcoubt found out guiding us all
wrong. Seems he was trying to sneak down to New Forest. Provoking I
Friday.—Only drawback to complete enjoyment so far has been weather.
Rain incessant. Home-Rule Van leaks badly. Can't study Irish History, or
compose speeches with stream of rain-water coming down small of one's back.
Awkward—hear that Spencer, in moment of forgetfulness, and apparently
fancying himself still Viceroy, has heen saying "he wouldn't whine about
imprisonment if he were Irish patriot." What made him say this? Put up
signal—" Do you refer to Dillon?" No answer. Curious. After an hour or
two, Sr-ENCER sends round boy who looks after his horses to say, "he doesn't
understand the code." Fancy this an excuse, but don't like to say so.
Saturday.—Slight contretemps. Wheeler (a bay horse—Rosebeby calls him
a Botany Bay horse—Interesting subject again— Colour in Horses"—why is
one bay, another roan? What is the Home Rule about this?) goes very lame.
Other horse doesn't care about drawing van by himself, and tries to lie down in
road. Harness in tangle. Have to try and put it right in pouring rain, as boy
has gone off to village inn "to get help," he says, but really to get glass of
beer, I believe. Most unconstitutional. Shall suspend boy when he comes
back, I think.
Signal to Rosebeby to come and assist. No reply. Singular! Send
driver round (but isn't this contrary to code?), and find that Rosebeby has
gone off to see somebody's stud-farm near here. Rosebeby seems to regard
whole affair as sort of picnic. Worst of it is that he's taken Granville and
Harcoubt with him. Habcoubt would be invaluable just now to sit on horse's
head while I undo harness.
On his return Rosebeby suggests that van is too heavy, and that I had better
lighten it by "chucking out some of the Irish Histories." Surprised at
Rosebeby! He explains by saying that he finds "the less fact he puts in
speeches, the better they go down."
Sunday. — Dies non. Propose church. Shaw-Lefevbe anxious to go.
Rosebeby, it seems, hasn't brought prayer-book. Spenceb and Granville
both want to mend holes in their roofs. Harcourt asleep. Hebschell offers
to mediate with neighbouring Vicar, and tells him I '11 read lessons. Good
fellow, Hebschell. I do.
Monday.—Curious thing occurred to-day. Met another van! A political one
apparently. Painted outside with pictures of moon-lighting outrages. Asked
driver (big man with black beard) if he was in favour of Home Rule. He
merely answered "Yah!" Who can have invented this opposition van?
Perhaps Randolph. Now I come to think of it, boy attending horses very
like Randolph. Mention suspicion to Granville. He pooh-poohs idea—
Randolph away in Africa or America, he says.
Mysterious van follows us everywhere. Comes to villages we've left, and
distributes Primrose League tracts and blankets to adults, and sweetmeats to
children. Query—isn't tnis corruption? Can't ask Hebschell, because he's
gone back to town to attend (he says) at obsequies of Board of Works.
Tuesday.—Rosebeby complains this is " slow." Couldn't we all dress up as
nigger minstrels? Remonstrate privately with Rosebeby, who admits he Lad
no sleep last night, owing to bedclothes being saturated, and smoke from
stove. He says, "Gbanville and Spenceb both favour nigger plan—or if
not, dismissing vans and going to first-class hotel." Can this be true? And
I'm not half through my educational course of Irish history, which peasants
are dying to hear.
Still suspicious of opposition van. Now believe Argyll's inside. Why can't
Argyll stay in Isles? Can man on box be Salisbury himself?
End of Tour.—Exeter.—Down here at last! Down with rheumatism, too.
Harcoubt's van disappeared near Southampton. Gbanville telegraphed for
at Wells. Rosebery left behind in hospital at Bath. Shaw-Lefevbe worn
and haggard, but still here; seems quite as lively as when he started,—but
that's not saying much. Shall rest a week, and then back to Hawarden,
not at all ra/i-quished; only a fortnight spent on wheels is enough for anybody.

Scrooge. "I sat, could you lend me something to put in the Plate,
Mr. Marlet? I've only got a Sovereign!"
MarUy. "Oh, a Sovereign 'll do."
PICKING THE WED-LOCK.
To the Eililor.
Sik,—I see that some of your Correspondents are asking, "Is Marriage
a failure?" How fortunate that the public should have become suddenly
interested in this question just as the Dull Season has come round again!
Perhaps, with judicious management, the subject could be made to last on to
the Autumn Session! My view is that it is simply a matter of intelligent
selection of the locality where the marriage is contracted or annulled. I,
myself, have already been married in eight different States in America, and have
found no difficulty in securing eight separate divorces on no ground whatever.
As there are about thirty States, I look forward to continuing this process for
some considerable time, and as I take care to "go where money is," I am now in
the possession of a modest competency, entirely due to prudent matrimonial
ventures. I advise those who are unhappy in wedlock to take courage—and a
ticket to Colorado. Yours cutely, Gay Rover.
Sr»,—How Marriage can be called a failure I cannot understand. Take my
own case. I recently indulged in some disastrous speculations, which landed
me, before I knew where I was, in the Bankruptcy Court. All that I had
was taken to feed my avaricious creditors; but fortunately my wife had
property settled upon her, which they could not touch, and I was living in
comfort, as a result of that arrangement. It is true that I am not able to
keep more than four hunters, but I console myself by thinking that my
creditors also are not completely happy with their composition of sixpence in
the pound, which was all I felt justified in offering them. I often tell my wife I
never knew her value till now. So far from Marriage being a failure, it has
turned Failure into a triumphant success!
Yours chirpily, Undischarged.
Sir,—I don't think I am particularly hard to get on with, yet after only
six months of marriage 1 have been obliged to send my wife home to her
relations, allowing her five hundred pounds a year simply in order to get rid of
her! She says my temper is unbearable, but if one can't chuck one's own wife
out of a second-storey window for venturing to argue with one, I should like to
know whom one is allowed to chuck out? Then when I
knocked her though a glass door and (as she says) injured
her head, which was always rather soft, I was acting
simply on principle and from a high sense of duty,
although the Police Magistrate took a different view of
the occurrence. Is it not intolerable that wives should
venture to contradict any opinion expressed by their hus-
bands? This is the sort of "Marriage Not" which
every husband is bound to cut. I must in fairness add
that mine never openly disagreed with me but once,
when the chucking-out took place; but after that she
used to look as if the were going to disagree, which is
even more aggravating to a man of sensitive disposition
like Yours truly, A Matrimonial Victim.
FOOL BRITANNIA!
(A new and original Manoeuvring Cantata, arranged for
production at the Imperial Naval Concert Room, Whitehall.)
The Scene is supposed to represent the progress of a weird
Incantation conducted by the Wizard of the Admi-
ralty, in which, revealing to the astonished gaze of an
assembled crowd of mystified British Landlubbers
the wonders of his Department, he compels them, by
the exercise of his magic arts, to express their aston-
ishment and admiration.
Chorus of British Landlubbers.
Hark! Again the cannons' thunder
Almost overwhelms our chorus!
We are fairly dazed with wonder
At the sights he sets before us!
As we read the evening papers,
We in mute surprise are gaping.
Admirals prodigious capers
Cutting, real warfare apeing;
Cruisers hither, thither Hying,
Property quite disregarding,
And, accepted law defying,
Private householders bombarding!
Health resorts in vain contesting
With some ironclad's distant flashes,
Have, by dozens, though protesting,
Ruthlessly been laid in ashes.
See, e'en Margate has surrender'd
Pier dues both, and local band!
Heme Bay, brought to book, has tender'd
Millions down by note of hand!
For Rosherville what fate's in store
AVe dare not ask! {They turn away shudder-
ingly.) We '11 see no more!
The Wizard of the Admiralty {continuing the
Incantation).
But nav! for sure there's plenty more to see.
And nere just onee again I must repeat,
What evident to all of you must be,
The fact that you possess a first-rate fleet.
You've had, I think, a telling proof or two
Of what " My Lords," when put to it, can do.
Such guns, such coals, such crews, such speed combined,
You 'fl in no other rival Navy find!
There hasn't been a hitch. Naught's gone amiss!
An Inquiring Taxpayer rises through the ground.
Inquiring Taxpayer.
Perhaps, then, you '11 explain to one what's this?

Then the Northampton's engines have gone wrong.
The Racoon leaks at every blessed chink;
The stokers of the fleet by dozens sink,
Unequal to their work, because untrained.
If there's no hitch,—these things might be explained f
The Wizard of the Admiralty.
And I am the party to do it,
For each charge that against us is laid
I straight to its source will pursue it,
And soon prove that 'tis recklessly made.
I 11 answer each empty-brained gaper
■Who provokes all this critical fuss,
And show him it's all right " on paper,"
And " on paper"'s sufficient for us.

A PASTORAL PLAY. (A EEMINI8CENCE OF THE PAST JULY.)
Argument.—Mr. and Mrs. Bbondebbury Brown (of North Kensington),
roused to emulation by certain recent open-air performances, have invited
their friends to witness a selection from The Tempest in the garden of their
villa, "Fontainebleau" (which derives its title from two remarkably fine
plane-trees at one end of the lawn).
Scene—The Auditorium. Mr. and Mrs. B. B. discovered in readiness
to receive their Guests.
Mrs. B. B. {with a desperate cheerfulness). Do you know, Bbon-
desbury, dear, 1 really do believe we shall have it fine, after all?
B. B. (not a Pastoral Enthusiast).
I shouldn't be surprised if it did
clear up—about midnight.
Mrs. B. B. "Well, if it doesn't

of propitiating the Powers that

Do you know what a Pastoral Play is f
B. B. (grimly). I'm beginning to find out, my dear.
The First Guests hopefully (as they make their way down the little
cast-iron staircase to the lawn, which is roofed over with sail-cloth,
and provided with rout-seats and chairs). They can't possibly mean
to have it this evening—we shall be able to get away all the sooner!
(To their hostess.) Oh, Mrs. Brown, how unfortunate! such hopeless
weather for it! We really ought not to have come at all.
Mrs. B. Oh, but indeed—we 're not afraid of a few drops of rain—
you shan't be disappointed I (General fall of jaws.) We're going to
begin as soon as ever a few more people come. You shan't go away
without your Tempest!
[Guests, realising that they are in for one, at the very least, seat
themselves with hypocritical expressions of delight.
Behind the Curtain: Under the Plane-Tbees,
The King of Naples (to Ferdinand). I say, old fellow, if we're to
lie down and go to sleep here, we must have a little sawdust thrown
down first. The ground's sopping!
Ferdinand (also Stage Manager). Oh, don't bother me, my dear
fellow! Where the dickens am I to find sawdust?
The K. of N. (unkindly). Thought you might have spared us some
out of your calves!
Miranda. I have to go to sleep, too; and that couch is simply
aked!
Ferdinand (irritably). Soaked? Of course it's soaked! It's
Pastoral. We must put up with it, that's all. My dear child, what
on earth have you got on your feet?
Miranda (regarding her goloshes ruefully). They 're mother's. She
made me promise to wear them if the ground was at all damp.
Ariel (to Maid, who has come round by the path). Well, Tucker,
what is it now f
Maid. Your Aunt's love, Miss; and she must insist on your putting
on this.
Ariel. What a shame! (To King.) I can't act Ariel in a water-
proof, can I?
The K.of N. (sardonically). Oh,whynot? We must try and borrow
an old sou'-wester for Prospero^ though, or he'll be out of the
picture. (Angrily, aside to Ferdinand.) Hang it all, we'd better do
the whole thing under umbrellas at once!
Caliban (to Miranda). All /know is, I hope we shall begin soon.
If I stand about in a damp hump much longer, I shall be ill. Just
feel it. [Miranda feels hi* hump delicately, and commiserates him.
Prospero. Never mind your hump—see if you can tell me how to
make this confounded beard of mine stick on—the rain's washed off
all the gum.
In Front—Before Play Begins.
Mrs. Harlesden Smith. Oh, I shall see splendidly here, thanks,
dear Mrs. Beown, how well you have arranged it all! It's really not
at all cold—well, if you would go and fetch my cloak, Hablesden,
perhaps it might be more
Miss Ladbroke Hill (to Mr. Kensal Green). Such a charming
idea, these garden theatricals. So different from a hot stuffy
theatre!
Mr. Kensal Green (putting up his coat-collar). It certainly is the
reverse of stuffy here! Plenty of air!
Miranda's Mother. I do wish they would begin. I can't bear to
think of my poor girl standing about on that nasty wet grass all this
time—so bad for her!
Ariel's Aunt.—If I had guessed it would turn out such a night as
this, I would never have allowed my niece to accept the part—and
even as it is
[The curtains drawn aside, and play begins; Prospero instructs
Miranda concerning the family history in the midst of a
heavy downpour. One of Abiel's shoes come off in the
mud.
Miss Ladbroke Hill. How well they did the lightning then,
didn't they?
Mr. K. G. Oh, it's all genuine—the Browns are determined to
do the thing well. Thunder, too, you see? There's nothing mean
about Brown!
Miranda's Mother. That dreadful lightning! Oh, Mrs. Brown.
do please tell them to come away from the trees—it is so dangerous!
Cecil's Aunt. Oh, do; they might be struck down at any moment
—it's tempting Providence!
Mrs. Brown (in despair). It—it's only «iee<-lightning. Please—
please don't say anything about it to them now—it will only put
them out. They 're getting on so nicely!
Enter Caliban (on stage—moist, but maledictory).
"As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed ....
Drop on you both—a south-west blow on ye!"
Prospero (with feeling). "For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt
have cramps!"
Mr. K. G. (sotto voce). If Caliban don't have them, I shall!
Enter Trinculo (on stage). "If it should thunder as it did before,
I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose
but fall by pailfuls. . . . Alas, the storm is come again!" &c, &c.
[Real thunder—rain descends pitilessly.
Mr. K. G. Really a triumph of stage-management!
Enter Ferdinand on stage, bearing a log (he throws it down with
a heavy splash). "There be some sports are painful."
Mr. K. G. (who has been sitting for some time with a stream of
water from the roof trickling down the back of his neck). Pastoral
Plays, for example.
[Scene with Miranda is proceeding in pelting rain, which extin-
guishes most of the lamps which light the scene, when
Miranda's Mother (riies). I can't help it, Mrs. Brown,—flesh and
blood can't bear it. I can't sit here ana see that poor child catching
cold under my very eyes. Minnie, dear, come in under the tent out
of the rain this instant! Do you hear? I order you!
[Sensation in audience.—on the whole, hardly of disapproval.
Miranda. In a minute, Mamma. "I am a fool to weep at what I
am glad of." (To Prospero.) I really must go. It's no use, when
Mamma once makes up her mind. [Prospero acquiesces sulkily.
Ariel's Aunt. I was just about to say the same thing, dear Mrs.
Sudbury! Pastorals or no pastorals, I can't let my sister's child
commit suicide. Fanny, come too—and bring your waterproof.
Ferdinand (helplessly). But, I say, how are we to get along with-
out Miranda and Ariel?
Miranda's Mother. That I can't pretend to decide—but I should
have thought you gentlemen could have finished it alone—somehow.
Or I don't object to Minnie's acting, provided she keeps under the
tent and speaks her part from there.
[Ariel's Aunt makes similar concession with regard to her niece.
Prospero. No, I don't think that would do. (To Mrs. Brown.)
Perhaps we had better stop for this evening—there doesn't seem to
be much ohance of the weather improving, and—(candidly)—I'm
afraid it really is a little damp for the ladies,—eh, Brown?
Mr. Brown (basely). Well, if you ask me, I think we've all had
about enough of it. [Mrs. B. conceals her mortification.
Guests (eagerly). It's been too charming, too delightful—but we
mustn't be selfish, must we? It would be cruel to expect them to do
any more. And they are so wet, poor things!
[They adjourn with ill-disguised relief and profuse expressions
of gratitude.
In the Drawing-boom—Later.
Mrs. Brondesbuby Brown is shedding a quiet tear by the chimney-
piece; Mr. Brondesbury Brown is humming, as he lights a
candle with one of the programmes.
Mr. B. B. (with offensive cheeriness). Do you know, I shouldn't
wonder if we had a line day to-morrow—the glass is going up again.
Mrs. B. B. (in a muffled voice). It may, if it likes.
Mr. B. B. Come, come, Polly! I'm sure everything went off
very well—considering. I only hope none of the people will get rheu-
matism after it—that s all.
Mrs. B. B. I dud-don't c-care if they all die!

SENSATIONAL TO A DEGREE.
{Report of a Lecture by a Professor of the Future.)
Yesterday the recently-appointed Professor of Popular Science delivered
his inaugural lecture to the students of the Four Inns of Court in the Drill
Hall of the D. 0. Rifle Volunteers. It will he remembered that following the
lead of the Authorities of the Inner Temple, who some time since gave a
"learned At Home," the Masters of the combined Bench have recently estab-
lished a chair or rather, trapeze of Athletic Philosophy. The apartment was
filled with students and utter-barristers, who exhibited the most lively interest
in the spirited proceedings.
The Professor, who appeared in academical costume, said that he was much
pleased to see so good an attendance, as he wished to teach by example rather
than by word of mouth. He would first go through a few performances.
Upon this he threw off his gown and disclosed a closely fitting suit of spangles.
The band of the Inns of Court Volunteers having struck up a lively tune, the
Professor quickly sprang into the air, and catching the bar of a trapeze, went
through a series of evolutions of the most extraordinary and intricate character.
Returning to the ground he resumed his gown and bowed bis acknowledgments
to the thunder of applause that greeted his return to the reading-desk.
"You have seen," he observed, "that it is perfectly easy to fly through the
air with the assistance of the horizontal bars. And the principle may,be carried
further. I have here a small steam-engine, and by sitting on the safety-valve,
thus, I accumulate an amount of force sufficient in volume to raise me some
distance from the ground. In the event of the boiler bursting I shall, no doubt,
rise to a very considerable altitude; indeed "at this point the Professor's
learned discourse was interrupted by the bursting of the boiler to which he had
called attention. Several of those present attended the subsequent inquest, which
brought the proceedings to a sensational, if somewhat, melancholy conclusion.

ROBERTS STORY OF JACK THE GIANT.
I coodn't refuse a offer as I reseeved the other day from a good
old frend to spend from Satterday to Munday at dear old Broadstares,
more espeshally as hinside his hinwitashun he henclosed a return
ticket. Ah! that's wot I calls inwiting a trend in a trooly royal
manner, tho' I am told as Royalty sumtimes forgits that nice little
atenshun, and leaves poor Docks and Markisses to pay their hone
fairs, which don't seem quite fare to me.
I didn't find much change in nice quiet Broadstares. There's the
same old black Peer, and the same nice wite cliffs, and the same
butifool yaller sands, and the same brite blue sea, and the same little
imperent tavern as will call itself the Albion! As if there cood be
2 Albion*! But there was one thing as I soon missed, and that was
my old trend Jack the Boatman. Jack was a grate giant of a feller,
and the idle of all the children. Lor, what fun he used to have on
the sands with the pretty littel darlings, to be sure. They used to
call him Jack the Giant. I've sumtimes seen three or fore of 'em on
his back at wunce, and he on his hands and nees a pertending to be
their orse, and they a spurring and a wippin on him like mad.
Well, it seems that larst Summer a Lady used to cum on the Sands
every day with her Servent and a pore littel feller of a boy, about
five or six year old, who had amost lost the use of his pore littel legs,
and the Doctor had told his pore Mother that the only chance of recov-
ering the use of 'em was sea-bathing, but nothink would induce the
pore littel chap to go into the Sea. He used to screem and struggel
so that it was shocking to hear and see him. So his pore Mother nad
to give it up, but she came ewery fine day on the Sands, and sat as
close to the sea as she cood, in opes sum day to tempt him in.
Well, one day sumbody happened to tell Jack all about it, so what
does he do but he goes and he sets hisself down by the side of pore
littel Frank, that was the littel chap's name, and he began a forking
to him all about the Sea, and wot fun it was to go and catch a lot of
fishes and bring 'em home and have 'em for dinner. And that's all
he said that day. The nex day he did the same, and the nex. and
Frank got so used to him that he quite missed him if he wasn't tnere.
So one day Jack says to him, Woodn't you like to git on my
back, and let me be your horse and take you into the Sea?" And
little Frank says, "No, I shoodn't," says he, "for I don't want to
git wet, and don t mean to." "But suppose I promises that you shan't
git wet," says-JACK, "what then?" "Then I don't think I shood
beleeve you," says he, larfing out quite merrily. "But suppose
your Ma says as you may trust me, woodn't you beleeve me then?"
Yes, I think I shood," says he. So at larst after a good deal of
perswadin he lets Jack take him on his back and in they goes a littel
wayB into the Sea, and Jack brings him back to his delited Ma as
appy as a king and as dry as a bone.
After a time Jack got him to have his shoes and stockings off and
to ride on Jack's back further into the Sea, and his Mother made
| him a pair of butifool blew rains, and bort him a littel whip, and he
used to go riding into the Sea as bold as a lion, and shouting out to
his delited Ma to see how brave he was. Well, after a time the pore
littel feller's legs got quite strong, and he could ewen manage to wark
a littel.
But now cuius the curiusest part of my story. Not one penny
wood Jack take from the gratefool Mother for all his long services.
No one knew who she was. She seemed to know noboddy, but she
had plenty of money, and was as ginerous with it as a Princess cood
be, but nothink wood Jack take, till one day, when he was a going
away for a munth, he managed to stammer out that, if she didn't
think it a libberty, he shood like to have littel Frank's pictur. I
think as he called it his Haughtygraff, for Jack wasn't much of a
Skollar. However, you may be sure as he hadn't long to wait for
it, and away he went.
Whether it was that he missed Jack, or whether it was a chill as
he got one windy day, or what it was, noboddy seemed quite to
know, but by the time as Jack came back pore littel Frank was
worse than ever, and was at last confined to nis bed. Jack used to
go every day to see the pore littel darling, and could alwavs get a
smile from his little wan face, even when his pore Mother failed. But
it was all in wain, and before long it was all over, and the pore littel
feller was at rest.
They buried him at the old church at St. Peter's, and you may be
sure that Jack was there, and if his greef wasn't quite so grate as
his pore Mother's, it wasn't a werry long ways off it.
Jack took just one long long look into the littel grave, and then
went his way.
He left the place the next morning, and forgot to say where he
was a going to, and hasn't cum back yet, and sumthink strikes me
as he won't cum back there no more.
It seems a strange thing that a grate, hulking, ruff, uneddicated
Boatman, like Jack the Giant, shood have had such a soft, loving
heart, but so it was, and so it has been, and so no dowt it will be
till we 're all gathered together sum day, rich and pore, big and littel,
Waiters and Wicounts, learned and unlearned, into one loving fold!
I think I must be gittin both old and foolish, for pore Jack's
story quite spylte my nollyday, and sent me home as sollem as a
Churchworden. Robert.

Six o'clock struck, and still Mr. John Bullson was digging at
the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side
chiefly; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather
enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of mental
doubt, Mr. Tempus's terrible tale went by before his mind in a scroll
of lund pictures. He would be aware of an open nark-like space
near a great city, then of the vague, shadowy, undehnable figure of
a man, or men, it was impossible to determine which, moving
swiftly yet furtively: then of two other figures walking in confi-
dential converse; and then these met, and that shadowy but sinister
human Juggernaut struck and trod the two others down, and passed
on, regardless of their dying moans. Or else he would see a room in
a poor house, amidst thriftily-tilled and poorly-productive fields,
where the toiling tiller thereof lay asleep, dreaming, and shuddering
at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the
curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there
would stand by his side a figure, again misty but menacing, to
whom power was given, and even at that dead hour he must rouse
and do its bidding.
The figure in these two phases haunted Mr. Bullson all the night;
and if at any time he dozed over it, it was but to see it glide the more
stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly, and
still the more swiftly and secretly through wider labyrinths of lamp-
lighted city, or narrower tracks of gloom-shrouded villages; posing
oratorically but dimly, like a blend of Veiled Prophet and platform
perorator; lurking, phantom-like, by dark entry and behind stone
wall, or scanty hedgerow, with purposes uncertain and unsatisfying,
sometimes imitative, at least, of dignity, valour, and beneficence,
sometimes, as it were, carrying the aspect or suggestion of craven
cruelty or blatant imposture; but always, to the perturbed mind of
the dreamer, equivocal, troublous, terrifying. And still the figure,
or figures, had no face by which he might certainly know it; even
in his dreams it had no face, or one that battled him by its indistinct-
ness, and melted into the suggestion of many before his eyes; and
thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in Mr. Bullson's
mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold
the features of the real Mr. O'Hyde. If he could but once set eyes
on it, he thought, the mystery might lighten, and perhaps roll
altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well
examined. He might see a reason for his friend's strange preference
or bondage (call it which you please), and even for the startling
manifestation of a seemingly paradoxical will. And at least it
would be a face worth seeing—for many reasons; the face of a man
—or men—without bowels of mercy, or full of patriotic pitifulness, as
was diversely maintained with most contradictory fervour of belief;
a face which had but to partially and indistinctly show itself to raise
up in various minds such opposing spirits. _
"Poor M'Jekytx," he thought, my mind misgives me; he is in
deep waters! This Master 0^1 yde, if he were studied, must have
secrets of his own: black secrets, by the look of him—in some phases,
at least—secrete compared to which poor M'Jekyi.l's worst would be
like sunshine. Things cannot continue as they are. Ay, I must put
my shoulder to the wheel—if M'Jekyll will but let me.
• •••••
Hitherto it was his practical ignorance of Mr. O'Hyde that had
swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was what seemed
forced upon him as knowledge. It was already bad enough when
the name was but a name, of which he could learn little more. It
was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attri-
butes; and out of the shifting, unsubstantial mists that had so long
baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of
a fiend.
• «••••
The problem he was thus debating was one of a class that is rarely
satisfactorily solved. "There must be a solution," said the per-
Slexed gentleman. "There is a solution, if I could only find it,
od bless me, the Thing seems hardly human! Something like

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Frankenstein's Monster, shall we say, only intimately, inseparably
related to its creator by a sort of clinging identity in dread duality?
Can it be the old story of Dr. Fell? Or is it the mere radiance of a
foul soul that transpires through and transfigures its clay continent?
The last, I think; for 0, my poor old Patrick M'Jektll, if ever I
read Satan's signature upon a face, it is on that of your mysterious
associate."
• *#*#•
M'Jektll, indeed, stood at times aghast before the acts of O'Htde;
but the situation was apart from ordinary law, and insidiously
relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was O'Hyde, after all, and
O'Hyde only, that was guilty. M'Jektll was no worse; he woke
again to his good qualities, as man, citizen, and patriot, seemingly
unimpaired; ne would even make haste, where it was possible, to
undo the evil done by O'Htde. Thus, at least, self-love asserted;
and thus conscience was made to slumber.
#•••*#
And M'Jektll himself? Do recent incidents seem, like the
Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of his
judgment? Does he begin to reflect more seriously than ever before
on the issues and possibilities of his double existence? Do things
indeed, as his somewhat hot and injudicial accusers roundly
assert, seem to point to this: that he is slowly losing hold of his
original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with his
second and worse? Or, as his more partial friends declare, and as
all good and kindly hearts would ardently desire, is the exact contrary
the case? Is it, not the fear of the gallows, but the horror of being
O'Htde that now alone can rack Mm? Does he indeed hate and
fear the thought of the brute that slept within or raged beside him?
Has he now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with
him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was now co-heir
with him to death; and beyond these links of community, which in
themselves should make the most poignant part of his distress, does
he think of O'Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not
only hellish but inorganic, anarchic, opposed to all essential
humanity as to all ordered law?
Who does not hope so? What man, not blinded by national
prejudice, or hardened by Party spite, does not desire that closer
inquiry may bring only clearer proof of the effective dissolution of
the dismal and deadly bond, be it close and abiding as angry foes
assert, or light and transient as tolerant friends maintain, between
Dr. M'Jekyll and Mr. O'Htde?
LETTERS BEFORE PROOFS.
Dear Me. Punch,
The practice of publishing letters that were dashed off by the
writers at a moment's notice, and without any intention of being read
by anyone save the recipient, has become so fashionable that I am
thinking seriously of printing a collection that I have made myself.
But before doing so I would like to ask your advice upon a point
connected with the matter. First, however, I had better give you a
few specimens from what I call my " note "-book.
The first is from a well-known statesman relative to the conduct of
a colleague. For the moment I suppress names, but you may take it
from me that they are full of interest:—
Dear Vapid,
I consider one of the most incapable dolts it has ever
been my ill-fortune to meet. At the Cabinet yesterday, when the
Bill was considered, he made himself a laughing-stock by his
ignorance and vulgarity. I felt quite distressed that I should have
to dine with him in the evening. But my wife would not let me off,
and I had to take her and myself to his hideously hospitable board,
and I need scarcely say spent an utterly miserable evening.
Yours, &c., i .
Here is another. It is from an eminent tragedian, and refers to
the first appearance of a fellow player :—
My Dear Old Man,
What an idea! You absolutely think that can
play Hamlet! Why, the man has no more notion of acting than the
Man in the Moon: Why, he cannot even speak the Queen's
English, much less deliver blank verse! Awkward, ungainly,
indistinct! The best thing he can do is to return to the ploughfield,
from whence, I imagine, he must have been called away on reaching
his majority. I would write more were it not that I have to sup
with him after his painfully wearisome performance.
Yours, &c, .
Here is another about a not very popular Judge, written by one
of bis Brethren on the Bench:—
My Dear Mr. Vapid.
You ask me what I think of Mr. Justice ?This is
rather a difficult problem, as I never think of him at all. As a
lawyer, he is beneath contempt, and as a man, or, rather, manikin,
he is painfully absurd. Nothing can be more ridiculous than his

A NASTY ONE.
Colonel Smithson (of the Poonah Marines). "By tiie way, my Boy
at Sandhurst hopes to get into your Regiment some day."
Little Snipson [of the Royal Hussars Green). "Aw—I—aw—hope
your Son is up to our Form!"
Colonel Smithson. " Vour Form? Dash it, he's over Four Feet
high, anyhow!"
bearing on the Bench, where he jumps about like an imperfectly
educated cock-sparrow, and makes faces and shakes his head like an
organ-grinder's monkey. For all this, he is to be my host on
Tuesday, and therefore I think I had better reserve further
criticism until we meet. Yours, &o., .
Yet once more:—
Dear Vic.,—Can write? No. I answer in the negative
because I have just waded through his last novel. I had to skip
three-fourths of it, and the remainder I found to be a hash of
somebody else's work! He has asked me to be present at his Silver
Wedding Day. Of course I am going, but I wish I could change the
appointment for his funeral. Yours, .
There, Mr. Punch.' What do you think of the above? Shall I
publish them? Yours truly, Victor Vapid.
Answer.—Shall you publish them? Why, certainly! They are
sure to please—everybody!
Poor Mr. Bandmann! About ten days ago he appeared at the
Opera Comique in a character, or rather two characters, totally un-
suited to his physique, and for his pains the evening's performance
was greeted with a fair amount of derision. Subsequently he was
awarded in the columns of the London Press critiques of the most
uncomplimentary character. Later still the entertainment was pre-
sented before an audience that warranted, by its appearance, the
reflection that, as a pecuniary speculation, the venture might be
unfortunate. And, latest of all, somebody applied at the Royal
Courts and asked that he might be sent to prison I The Judge, how-
ever, was merciful, and on Mr. Bandmann undertaking not to play
in the characters any more until after the Long Vacation, allowed
him his freedom. It is possible that his Lordship may have seen the
eminent tragedian in the dual character, which would, of course,
account for the view he took of the requirements of the situation!

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
July 30.—The miserable cold weather is either upsetting me or
Carrie, or both. We seem to break out into an argument about
absolutely nothing, and this unpleasant state of things usually occurs
at meal times. This morning for some unaccountable reason we were
talking about balloons and we were as merry as possible, but the
conversation drifted into family matters, during which, Carrie,
without the slightest reason, referred in the most uncomplimentary
manner to my poor father's pecuniary trouble. I retorted, by saying
that " Pa at all events was a gentleman," whereupon Carrie burst
out crying. I positively could not eat any breakfast. At the office
I was sent for hy Mr. Perkupp, who said he was very sorry, but I
should have to take my annual holidays from next Saturday.
Franchinq called at office, and asked me to dine at his Club, "The
Radical Conservative." Fearing disagreeables at home after the
"titf" this morning, I sent a telegram to Carrie telling her I was
going out to dine, and she was not to sit up. Bought a little silver
angle for Carrie.
July 31.—Carrie was very pleased with the bangle which I left
with an affectionate note on her dressing-table last night before going
to bed. I told Carrie we should have to start for our holiday next
Saturday. She replied quite happily that she did not mind except
that the weather was so bad; and she feared that Miss Jibbons would
not be able to get her a seaside dress in time. I told Carrie that I
thought the drab one with pink bows looked quite good enough, and
Carrie said she should not think of wearing it. I was about to
discuss the matter, when remembering the argument yesterday,
resolved to hold my tongue. I said to Carrie, I don't think we
can do better than ' Good old' Margate." Carrie, not only to my
astonishment raised an objection to Margate for the first time, but
begged me not to use the expression "Good old," but to leave it to
Mr. Stillbrook and other gentlemen of his type. Hearing my 'bus
pass the window, I was obliged to rush out of the house without
kissing Carrie as usual, and I shouted to her, "I leave it to you to
decide." On returning in the evening Carrie said she thought as
time was so short she had decided on Margate, and had written to
Mrs. Beck, Harbour View Terrace, for apartments.
August 1.—Ordered a new pair of trousers at Benjamin's, and told
them not to cut them so loose over the boot. The last pair being so
loose and also tight at the knee, looked like a sailor's, and I heard
Pitt, that offensive young cub at the office call out " Hornpipe!" as
I passed his desk. Carrie has ordered of Miss Jibbons a pink
Garibaldi and blue serge skirt which I always think looks so pretty at
the seaside. In the evening she trimmed herself a little sailor-nat
while I read to her the Exchange and Mart." We had a good
laugh over my trying on the hat when she had finished it, Carrie
saying it looked so funny with my whiskers, and how the people
would have roared if I went on the stage like it.
August 2.—Mrs. Beck wrote to say we could have our usual rooms
at Margate. That's off our mind. Bought a coloured shirt and a
pair of tan-coloured boots, which I see many of the swell clerks
wearing in the City, and I hear are all the "go."
August 3.—A beautiful day. Looking forward to to-morrow.
Carrie bought a parasol about five feet long. I told her it was
ridiculous. She said, "Not worse than your coloured shirt." So
the matter dropped. I bought a capital Hat for hot weather at the
sea-side. I don't know what it is called, but it is the shape of the
helmet worn in India, only made of straw. Got three new ties, two
coloured handkerchiefs, and a pair of navy-blue socks at Pope
Brothers. Spent the evening packing. Carrie told me not to
forget to borrow Mr. Hiqgswortits telescope, which he always lends
me, knowing I know how to take care of it. Sent Sarah out for it.
While everything was seeming so bright, the last post brought us a
letter from Mrs. Beck, saying, "I have just let all my house to one
party, and am sorry I must take back my words, and am sorry you
must find other apartments."
August 6th.—Memorable this year as " The First Heat."
Omitted from the "St. J. G." Repertoire. — "Under the
Greenwood."

SHOOTING GROUSE ON THE MOORS.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Xight, August 6.—Curious place.
House of Commons. Summoned to-day to take Report Stage of
Parnell Commission Bill; everybody discussing probable course of
debate; would Amendments be moved? If so, bow many? Would
speeches bo made? If so, how long? In the end House never
reached Commission Bill at all. Scotch Members, envious of pro-
minent position reached by Irish, determined to do bit of obstruction
on own account. On the whole, rather dreary business. If we must
have obstruction, prefer Irish brand. Wallace began it at Saturday
sitting—not Wallace of Elderslie and Auchinbothie, but Member
for East Edinburgh. Pragmatical person who delivers Latin tags
with Perthshire accent. Suddenly dawned upon him that he is a
humorist. Discovery made on Saturday. Girded in hippopotamic
manner at Lord- Advocate; House always laughs when it looks on
of thinks of Lord-Advocate; laughed when Wallace said something
rude about him; Wallace delighted with unexpected success;
hammered away at joke on Saturday afternoon; brought it up a^ain

Exit Lord Claud.
to-night; hammered on for thirty-five minutes. Speaker at critical
moment prevented manslaughter by peremptorily shutting up
Wax lack at thirty-seventh repetition of joke.
"In my experience," said Speaker, "I have never known the
latitude usually allowed to an Hon. Member so
much abused as on this occasion."
Wallace surprised into really humorous remark.
Been boring House for over half-an-hour when
Speaker interposed. Now, resuming seat, com-
plained that, "inconsequence of Speaker's ruling,"
he must sit down without having delivered the
speech he had prepared from a sense of duty to
his constituents and his country! Good, that—for
Wallace.
"Off and on I've sat in this House for twenty-
three years," said Lord Clacd Hamilton. "Have
seen and heard some things in my time. But if
Scotch Members are going to practise obstruction,
I think I '11 go." So writ moved for new Election,
and Cliiltern Hundreds fresh Steward.
Lords, not to be outdone by Scotch
Members, had their little joke. To-day-
Bank Holiday. Other branches of labour-
ing classes struck work all over the
country; so Lords, who usually begin
business at half-past four and adjourn at
five minutes to five, determined to make
a night of it. Took Local Government
Bill in Committee. Pegged away till
quarter to two to-morrow morning; got
Bill clear through Committee.
Business done.—In the Lords, a good
deal; in the Commons, none.
Tuesday.—"Heard the news?" said
Admiral Field. Met him crossing the
Lobby on starboard tack, close-hauled, a newspaper reefed in his
hand, and Hag of distress Hying. "Awful!" he said, laying-to,
and jibbooming his lee scuppers with his pocket-handkerohief.
"Oban taken by the Channel Squadron. Aberdeen bombarded
by four line-of-battle ships forming part of Admiral Fitzroy's
Attacking Squadron. Forth Bridge destroyed, and not a stone
standing on Inchkeith, in the Frith of Forth. Always said it would
come to this. Came into House little late to save my country. But
done my best. Been laughed at, sneered at, snubbed by First Lord,
who doesn't know a halyard from a yard that isn't haled; and now,
you see, where we are."
Admiral shook in my face the news of hapless Aberdeen, and
unfortunate Inrhkiith, and sheered off to blast
other ears with the direful news.
Meanwhile, House of Commons going on with
Commission Bill, just as if hand of invader were
not laid heavily on Scotland. By desperate coup
Old Morality had snuffed out all Amendments
on Committee stage. At One o'Clock on par-
ticular morning Clauses peremptorily put from
the Chair, and carried. Here they come up again
on the Report Stage, "like Snarleyow, the
Dog Fiend" says Admiral Mayne, who still
reads Markyatt. Anyhow, a dogged debate.
House, curiouslv full, considering end of all
things at hand. Hakcourt looks in after dinner.
Rapidly catches up drift of debate; plunges in,
"like elephant in a tank," as Chaplin says;
splashes splendidly; seized opportunity to speak
disrespectfully of profession of Law, sneering at
"Old Bailey view" taken of BUI by Home
Secretary. This brought up Edward Clarke
with lively speech, that greatly delighted House.
Went straight for Haiicocrt, regardless of dis-
parity of size. Bit and snapped, and, on the
whole, made Harcourt rather wish he'd stopped
another half hour at dinner. House sat long way
into to-morrow morning. Still didn't pass BUI.
Business Done.—Report Stage of Parnell Com-
mission Bill.

'You nmv mid you
Mayne't."
Old Saw.
Thursday.—Strange thing happened to-night.
Time, Eleven o'clock. Indian liudget on. James
Stuart demonstrated afresh how a really able
man in own line can prove utter failure in House of Commons.
Eight Members present, including Speaker. Half asleep myself.
Roused by hearing noise like crackling of thorns under a pot. Came
from man next to me. Looked up; found it was Wallace.
Noise continued. Strange contortion of features. Getting alarmed.
"What's the matter, old fellow P" I said, cheerily, trying to
make light of it. Colic?"

Absent from the Post o.
Danger.
"No," said Wallace. "I'm laughing."
"Oh," I said, quite relieved. "But what are you laughing at?
Not at Stuart, I hope P"
"Bear me, no! Field, don't you know, and Lord-Advocate,
and the bombardment of Edinburgh,
and why wasn't he there 'i Capital!
More crackling of thorns under the
put ; additional facial contortions.
"Ah( that was very funny," I said,
"but it happened a long time ago.
Came on at Half-past Four; now it's
Eleven."
"Yes, I know," said Wallace.
"Heard it at the time; only just seen
the joke. Often takes me that way;
sometimes it's a day after; occasionally
a week. To-night I've been rather
sharp. But it comes sooner or later.
Assure you, though you mighn't think
it, there's very little in the way of a
good joke J miss, take the Session
through."
Nice, well-meaning man, Wallace;
though, regarded as a companion, a
little embarrassing; appropriates his
daily share of humour by sort of slow-
match process. Never know when you
have him.
Glad he finally saw the little joke
about Lord-Advocate and Edinburgh
got up at Question Time between Field
and Lord-Advocate.
How was it. Field asked, that Lord
Provost of Edinburgh, as Lord High
Admiral of Firth of Forth, took no
steps to defend Leith against attack
by tleet, which led to bombardment of Edinburgh?
Lord-Advocate, with just a twinkle of mirth on his massive
countenance, gravely replied that that distinguished naval officer,
the Lord High Admiral of the Firth of Forth had only a phantom
fleet under his command, and had acted wisely in keeping it out of
sight. Humour being contagious, Caldwell asked Secretary of
State for War how it came to pass that Lord- Advocate holding
commission as Colonel in Militia, was not at
post of danger? Stanhope, in delightfuUy
official manner, explained that the land
forces not being called into action, the gallant
Colonel's services had not been needed. A
most admirable bit of fooling. Fortunate,
however, end of Session near, and Wallace
will be out of harm's way. Wouldn't do
for him to be often taken as he was to-night.
Business done.—Indian Budget.
Saturday.—Winding things up to-day.
At it yesterday with extraordinary effect.
At Question Time Old Morality indicated a
dozen Orders of the Day to be dealt with
before the Adjournment; looked like Three
o'clock in the morning again; but by
Eleven all over. Arranged that, after Royal
Commission on Monday, Parliament shall
adjourn till Tuesday, 6th of November.
Irish Members appalled at prospect of being
silent for nearly three months on pain of
going to prison. Charm of British legis-
lation is, that what in Member speaking
from below the Gangway is but a choleric
word, is flat blasphemy in same Member
speaking at Clonakilty. Say what you like
at Westminster. For saying half as bad at
Westmeath, you 're clapped into prison.
"A strange world, my masters," says Joseph
Gillis, in reflective mood.
Thing is to make most of present oppor- , „ . , . - „
tunities". This Irish Members do. 6ther "An unbroken front.
Members want to go home. But Akers-Douglas on guard at the
door. Presents unbroken front of resistance. "Wait a bit, dear
boy," he says, persuasively. "You needn't dine here to-night, but

Business done.—All.

"Over the Border with Charlie."—The question between
Mr. Parnell and Mr. Walter is, it seems, to be settled in Edinburgh.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A Page for a Romance of the
Middle Ages.
THE WHITE ETON.
(A Companion Story to " The Black Arrow.")
Prologue.—Robin Hood-d- Thought-it.
On a certain afternoon in the late springtime, the bell upon Bolton
Moat House was heard ringing: at an unaccustomed hour. Far and
near people began to desert their labours
and thronged together. An express had
come calling the whole village to boot
and saddle. For the days of Sir Walter
Scott had returned again to Merrie
England, and the British language had
become all but unintelligible.
Sir Aixover Oaths the Parson and
Colney Hatch were arming for the
fray, and good Poultry Yard the Archer
was reading to the little children the
pages of G. P. R. James, wherein he
found certain hints that helped him
bravely in his phraseology.
"Poor shrews!" he exclaimed. "I have no natural lord but
King Harry the Tent, and it is an ill wind that bloweth to me-
ward no good but what may be found in a quarrell fixed in a windac."
"Y'are a strange looking rogue," replied the children, clapping
their hands with glee.
"Nay, be it so," replied the old Archer. "By my sooth, Toss-pot
and Shuttlewit run in, but my Lord Good Counsel sits o'one side
waiting!" No doubt the worthy churl would have said more to the
same effect had not an arrow at this moment sung in the air like a
huge hornet. It struck old Poultry Yard between the shoulder-
blades, and pierced him clean through as he fell among the cabbages.
"By my faith," cried Colney Hatch, "and in good sooth, dash
my wigge, but it hath a scroll that will make Sir Allover turn paper
colour and pray like a windmill. Fetch me a link, and let us read
the writing stuff."
"Powltree-yaird fro' Rob Hood-d-thort-it."
"Nay, I like it not," said all the retainers.
"It is a libel," cried Sir Allover the Priest. "That every run-
the-hedge in a green jerkin should fasten a scroll so, runs hard on
sacrilege—hard!,"
"It boots not, but put to it will wash. Sir Parson," responded
Colney Hatch. "Here is unseasonable talk for those who are un-
friends. Nay, y'are wrong, and sayest yer much more and I will
clout me a yard of arrow through your inwards."
"Now, well a-day!" exclaimed Sir Allover, "what means it?"
"It is wrote on a White Eton, good Sir Priest!" respectfully
replied one who had been making too free with the wine-skins.
"And what may that be?" returned the ecclesiastic, showing
increased interest.
"A White Eton is a sort of neckgirdler of shirtcloth, may it please
ye, and also as good a title as a Black Arrow, and as appropriate!"
Now was it found that Robin Hood-a-Thought-it had written
on his scroll that he had plenty of " Whvte Etons," from whence he
had sent thither the specimen circlet, and intended to use them upon
the bodies of those who had given him offence. Upon this the Priest
gave Dick a sealed packet with this superscription:—"To my Ryght
Worshypful Master, Sir Daniel Knyght, be thys delivered in haste,"
and thus, having secured the " y," the messenger hurried away to
obtain the wherefore.
Book First.—Lad and Lady.
Sir Daniel and his men lay in about Tea Kettley that night,
warmly quartered and well patrolled. But the Knight was one who
never rested from money-getting.
"Bring up yon fellow," cried ne, and one of the retainers led up a
poor cringing old man, as pale as a candle, and all shaking with the
fen fever. Ye deal in treason, rogue; ye trudge the country
leasing; y'are heavily suspieioned of the death of severals."
"Right honourable and my reverend Lord," the man cried, "here
is some hodge-podge, saving your good presence."
"Well a day!" returned the Knight. "Go to! Y'are too cunning,
fool-fellow, for a livelihood of seventy shillings!"
And Sir Daniel, who was a very merry Knight,—none merrier in
England,—took a drink of his mulled ale, and lay back smiling.
It was then that he addressed a lad who was stretched in a mantle
on the floor, after taking off his visored head-piece and unloosing a
sanguine-coloured cloak.
'A sturdy boy! 1 will make you a marriage of a thousand
pounds, and cherish you exceedingly. Now eat me a porridge."
Thus the claims of quaint English having been satisfied, the action
proceeded apace, and in less than it takes to write it, Dick and John
were far away from Sir Daniel and going through a variety of
adventures miles from Tea Kettley. They did the fens of Bolton
Moatly Forest thoroughly, losing horses, seeing false lepers, and
coming across the originals of those fair bowmen who,
round cloth jerkins and snowy neckgirdlers, were called " the White
Eton Boys."
"Have ye read the works of Shakspeare?" asked John.
"Faugh!" said Dick; "y' are a milk-sopping baby not to know
that your Bard of Avon lived hereafter—aye, when Harry Sixt was
long dead, and Harry Eight—to say naught of Betsie—were
flourishing. An I guessed rightly, I should call ye a poor shrew of
a sniveller! But why did you ask—I mean why putteth you me
to the question?"
"Because, forsooth, it remembered me that in As You Like it,
may it please ye, a lad and wench marched about together, one
disguised and the other not, as we do?"
"Nay," retorted Dick; "if that be your tune, so be it, and a
plague be with you! Nay, blow me no nose! I love not snivellers!"
Each turned aside, and. then began walking off severally. Thus
they had many adventures of a more or less mysterious character,
until, after parting in a ditch and meeting in a chapel, they found
themselves separated by the necessities of the story. For, as the old
Chronicles hath it, "Can ye make bricks without straw?" And,
again, "What availeth a lot of characters unless, may it please ye,
you can put them in a number of startling situations?"
So boy and girl between them, with the assistance of winking
tapestry, purposeless spies, and dialogue containing a good deal of
the second person singular, managed somehow or other to get through
two hundred and fifty pages, without counting varlets, outlaws, and
men-at-arms. But in good sooth the work was as tough as a Church
steeple of a Lenten Sunday!
Book the Last.—Couleur-de-Rosy Reading.
And the two hundred and fifty pages having been passed, it now
was time to bring in something about Richard Crookback, and
the Wars of the Roses. Thus it happened that one day, Dick, having
armed himself more like a gentleman than usual, heard the sound of
a trumpet. He came within sight of a booth, and found a most fierce
encounter raging on the road before it. There were seven or eight
assailants, and but one to keep head against them. Dick, drawing
his sword, putting a quarrel in his cross-bow, waving his lance,
unslinging his mace, loading his hand-cannon, and using his dagger
with considerable dexterity, was able, after about an hour and a
half s hard work, to render very valuable assistance.
"Ahorse! ahorse! my kingdom for a horse! So much for Buck-
ingham!" said the attacked one when his assailants had been van-
quished, and then, turning to our hero, demanded, "How knew ye
who I was?"
"I am ignorant of whom I speak with," Dick answered. "Fact
is, I don't in the least know "—then, gracefully pulling himself up,
he continued, "an it please ye, I forgot myself! I have me a
habit of slipping into English of the Nineteenth Century unawares.
I should have said, by my sooth, and by my halidom, but, my good
Lord, I know not your arms. But I see ye have the humpc!"
"Humpe menohumpe," replied the other, and a singular sneer
played about the young nobleman's mouth as he made answer.
Then he added—" Rut the time is ripe for making you Sir Richard.
Ye have pleased me—kneel me a kneel!"
In the bottom of his heart Dick already entertained a great
terror and some hatred for the man whom he had rescued; but
the invitation was so worded that it would have been cruel to
refuse or hesitate, so he hastened to comply, and was Knighted.
"And now, good Sir Richard," said the Crookback, "you may
get married as soon as it may please ye, and have done with it."
Bowing gracefully, the young man departed to find out and engage
in mortal combat Sir Daniel, who, he had discovered recently, had
been his father's murderer. Just as he was on the point of finishing
the traitor loon in question, it occurred to him that the wicked
Knight should die by the aid of an arrow. For had not Robin
Hood-a-Thought-it said as much at the beginning of the story?
So, stepping aside, he awaited events. Hereon all of a sudden a
bow sounded like a note of music.
An arrow flew, carrying with it a stiff linen circlet, marked "Six
groats the twelve ones. The circlet wound round the Knight's
throat, and choked him.
"Is the circlet white ?" he gasped
the book?"
"Does it justify the title of
It is white." replied Dick, gravely;
called a White Eton.f'
'and therefore may be
Sir Daniel stared wildly, tried ineffectually to follow this reason-
ing, uttered a piercing cry, and died in much agony.
Dick hurried away, entered the church (accompanied by the White
Eton Boys), and was married. When he came forth into the frosty
air and sunlight, the long files of the army were already winding
forward up the road. But the wedding party turned upon the other
side, and sat down with sober merriment to breakfast. And the
"merriment" was the "soberer" because each dismal reveller was
haunted with the apprehension that some day their exceedingly
tedious and uneventful lives would be recorded by a Nineteenth
Century chronicler! An it please ye, so they was!

THE FUN OF THE N. P. FUND.
In the little Blue Book annually published by the
Newspaper Press Fund, there is a comical misprint in the
report of the Chairman's speech at last year's banquet.
The Chairman, followingthe wise custom introduced by
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales at every public dinner,
wishing to get to the cigars and the real business of the
evening after the first toast, quoted the well-known
words of Mr. Ducbow, who, when rehearsing an eques-
trian drama at Astley's, found the dialogue tedious, and
exclaimed, "Cut the cackle and come to the 'osses." But
the reporter and the printer between them have thus
reproduced it at p. 13: "' Cut the cattle and come to the
asses.'(Laughter)." "Laughter!" We should think so
—rather! Sir Edwabd Clarke, Q.C., Solicitor-General,

CARRY YER BAG, SIR?"
THE RIVAL-TO-THE-BIC-COOSEBERRY CORRESPONDENCE.
Letter No. 1.
Sib,—I notice in the columns of one of your Contemporaries that
the question has been raised, "Is Marriage a Failure V and if you
will allow me I should like to answer it.
Sir, how can marriage be a failure when the household is well
conducted? Let me take my own case. I am a man of great mental
attainments, and with a power of organisation that must command
respect. Sir, I am not satisfied to leave the care of the home to
hands other than my own. Taking for my model the "paterfamilias"
of the famed law-giver, Justinian, I consider it my duty to per-
sonally superintend the details of domestic management. Thus I
think it advisable to arrange with the cook the menu of the dinner,
and to consult with the housemaid as to the times and seasons most
suitable for the cleansing of the various apartments, for the proper
condition of which I hold her responsible. And if occasionally our
meals become a little complicated, and the sweeping the drawing-
room carpet is entirely overlooked, those are matters only of temporary
annoyance, and the great principle that the man should be the head
of the household is maintained in all its beautiful significance. _
From this you must not imagine that I devote my entire time to
the arrangement of the proper functions of my servants. On the
contrary, I have plenty of leisure for improving the mind of my wife.
It is my duty, as it is indeed my pleasure, to read to her works of
an elevating rather than an entertaining character. Moreover, when
it is fine I am always ready to take her with me to see such Museums
as that of the School of Mines in Jermyn Street, or the excellent
Anatomical Collection attached to Surgeons' Hall. From this you
will gather, that while seeking for instruction I do not ignore the
claims of amusement. After these few hints as to the method I
pursue in rendering my home a happy one, it is unnecessary for me
to indicate further whether in our case marriage is a failure.
I am, Sir, yours, Somebody's Husband.
Letter No. 2.
Sib,—I have just seen a rough draft of which the letter sent to you
by my husband is a carefully prepared copy. As he is not looking,
will you allow me to answer the question, Is Marriage a failure?
by the significant word, "Rather!"
Yours truly, Somebody's Wife.
Letter No. 3.
Sib,—as an American, will you permit me to join in your interest-
ing Correspondence? The institutions of the free United States
enable the enterprising Benedick to marry, and then obtain a divorce
with the greatest possible; convenience and dispatch. Thus I have
had considerable experience in Matrimony. I have consequently
entered into the bonds of Wedlock more than once, and can therefore
conscientiously declare that Marriage is not a failure.
Yours truly, Tbue as Steel.
'Letter No. 4.
Sib,—For the last thirty years—in fact, since I reached my
eighteenth birthday—I have given this all-engrossing question my
most anxious consideration. In spite of the peculiar custom of Leap
Year, I nave not yet been able to put the problem to a practical test.
So, speaking for myself, I fear I must confess that Marriage is a
failure. 1 ours, singularly, A Matd of Lea.

when he is obliged to give up his Club and his Music Hall, his pals
and his smoke? No, Sir, it is not good enough for

Letter No. 6.
Sib,—Take it all round with the rough and the smooth, the worries
of unpaid bills and the trips into the country, the black looks of one's
husband, and the laughter of one's children, I really do believe that
Marriage is not a failure. Yours faithfully, 'Abriet at 50.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

COMING DOWN ON THE SWEATERS.
"Quoth Dun-Ravin,
Never more!"
THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
August 4.—Got up at six, but as it was pouring wet, and we had been
thrown over in respect to our apartments at Margate, and (as Carrie
wisely observed), Monday was Bank Holiday, we would abandon our
visit till Tuesday. We became more than reconciled to this, for the
first post brought a nice letter from Willie (son by my first), acknow
ledging a trifling present which Carrie sent him, the day before
yesterday being his twentieth birthday. To our utter amazement he
turned up himself in the afternoon, having journeyed all the way
from Oldham. He said he had got leave from the bank, and as
Monday was a holiday, he thought he would give us a little surprise.
August 5 {Sunday).—We had a bottle of port for dinner, and drank
dear Willie's_health. He said, "Oh, by the bye, did I tell you
I've cut my first name, 'William,' and taken the second name,
'Lupin.' In fact, I'm only known at Oldham as 'Lupin Pooter.
If you were to 'Willie' me there, they wouldn't know what you
meant." Of course, Lufin being a pureiy fancy name, Carrie was
delighted, and began by giving a long history of the Lupins. I
ventured to sav that I thought William a nice simple name, and
reminded him he was christened after his Uncle William, who was
much respected in the City. Willie, in a manner which I did not
much care for, said sneeringly, "Oh, I know all about that—Good
old Bill!" and helped himself to a third glass of port. Carrie
objected strongly to my saying " Good old," but she made no remark
when Willie used the double adjective. I said nothing, but looked
at her, which meant more. I said, "My dear Willie, I hope you
are happy with your colleagues at the bank." He replied, "Lupin,
if you please, and with respect to the bank, there's not a clerk who
is a gentleman, and the ' boss' is a cad." I felt so shocked, I could
say nothing, and my instinct told me there was something wrong.
Aug. 6. Bank Holiday.—As there was no sign of Lupin moving
at nine o clock, I knocked at his door, and said we usually break-
fasted at half-past eight, and asked how long would he be? Lupin
replied that he had had a lively time of it, first with the trains shaking
the house all night, and then with the sun streaming in through the
windows in his eyes, and giving him a cracking headache. Carrie
came up and asked if he would like some breakfast sent up, and he
said he could do with a cup of tea, and didn't want anything to eat.
Lupin not having come down, I went up again at half-jrast one, and
said we dined at two; he said he "would be there." He never came
down till a quarter to three. I said, "We have not seen much of
you, and you will have to return by the 5"30 train; therefore, you
will have to leave in an hour, unless you go by the midnight mail."
Ho said, "Look here, Guv'nor, it's no use beating about the bush.
I've tendered my resignation at the bank." For a moment I could
not speak. When my speech came again, I said, "How dare you.
Sir? How dare you take such a serious step without consulting me r
Don't answer me, Sir,—you will sit down immediately, and write a
note at my dictation, withdrawing your resignation and amply
apologising for your thoughtlessness." Imagine my dismay when he
replied with a loud guffaw, "It's no use. If you want the good old
truth, I've got the chuck!"
A daily Advertisement informs us that "She is in active pre-
paration." L'Histoire des Femmes. She's getting herself up

THE PLAINT OF THE GRAND PIANO.
I was a grand piano once—nay, hearken what I say—
The grandeur is no longer here, it left me yesterday.
One leather-souled executant at a sitting could demolish
The mellow pride of tuneful years, of tone, and power, and polish.
A dapper man, with weary brow, and smile of conscious pow'r,
A Jove, prepared to improvise tone-thunder by the hour,
Is Nasmyth Hammermann, whose touch would disconcert the dead.
Whose foot would rush with pedal-crush where angels fear to tread.
He kept his soul in patience while lesser people played,
As one who bears with cruder views that taste-bound souls degrade;
He pitied plaintive melody and winning modulation,
Biding his time—and then it came—the afternoon's sensation.
He hovered over the keyboard, like a wild beast over its prey,
And he tossed his head, and he rattled his wrists—and then he began
to play;
To play! And in that crowded room was none with heart to see
That what was play to him and them was worse than death to me!
He struck a chord, as a hawk strikes a lark who is dumb with fear,
And his fingers spread over the octaves like a slander in full career,
And my overstrung nerves that waited the worst nigh sprung from
the shuddering case
As he finished his horrible prelude with an awful bang in the bass.
He gloated; I waited: and then began a butchery great and grim,
And melody screamed and harmony writhed, and form, rent limb
from limb,
Was hurled in murderous largesse to the careless, ravening crowd,
Who chatted and laugh'd the louder, as my agony waxed more loud.
He checked his course, and he wirgled round, till he found the soul
of pain,
And he thumped it with pitiless fingers, again, again, again!
Then, like a pawing horse let go, he tore at headlong pace, [bass.
And drowned the tortured treble's cry in the roar of an anguished
My tenderest tones, that answer clear the artist's lightest touch,
Were vank'd in handfuls out like hair in some fierce maniac's
clutch, [pride.
And my beautiful keys, that never yet had sullied their tuneful
Like elephants with the tusk-ache in ivory anguish cried.
Hark to the murmurs sad and low, self-struck upon my strings,
Such music as a dying love, unknown, unsolaccd sings,
For yesterday's undreamt disgrace can never not have been,
And I must shrink from music now, and sob " Unclean, unclean!"
The girls have practised on me.in endless ladders of scales,
Whereby they mounted to castle'd heights, and the realms of fairy
tales; [last
And I loved their wayward endeavours, and my patient sweetness at
Won them to tell me their love's young dreams as I hallowed their
childhood's past.
And the Governess, meek and modest, who counted the tale of bars,
Would slip from the sleeping children, and the schoolroom worries
and jars; [forgot,
And the tender heart would open to me, and, work-a-day woes
The i>encil-cramped hands would tremble, and the tears from her
heart welTd hot.
They called her a Perfect Treasure, but 'twas I alone who knew
The tale of the young life's struggle, so tender and brave and true;
And when she touched me I told it, and somebody listened and
learned, [returned.
And the winter-time went out of her life, and the daffodil days
And Maud in her tempers would bang away—Sweet Maud—for I
often heard
The fortissimo suddenly ended in a kiss like the chirp of a bird.
And Mabel's curious reveries—how soon a piano discovers
When a girl gives one hand to her music, and the other is clasped in
her lover's.
Perchance some tender hand again may soothe my tortured heart,
May heal the scars of Hammermann with balm of rare Mozart;
Perchance the Nocturne's mystic feet may through my caverns stray,
When great Beethoven's passion-storms have cleansed the plague
away.
But no, farewell that happy past; henceforth I 'ni only fit
To play the concertina's part to wandering niggers' wit;
Or, as a street-piano, find as jubilant a goal
As a wet day in China when you do not know a soul.
Yet it may be my past deserts may win a loftier place,
Low in the outer walks of Art, not blatant in disgrace;
And Music's tutelary powers may bid their Outcast go
And be the sacred musio in a panoramic show,
And moan " The Village Blacksmith" when the lights are burning low.

A Creepy Crawly effect. neel„ of h«a b£tg. YLewntii I make
a present to Mr._ Rider Haggard of a final chapter, with a moral to
k—to be found in the application of it—which I will call,—
REDAH'S REVENGE!
First Last, and Only Chapter.
On the dried wing of a Fly-leaf, brought to me by the maiden
Konstant Red AH, I make out these words :—
"For Heaven's sake, whoever you are, try to help me. I have been
the slave of this awful Riteraggard for nearly four years. He caught
me in King Solomon's Mines; he charmed me, for he is a wizard,
with She: and he tortures me now by means of his slaves, Allano
Quarterman, Baddely Good, and Sir Henri/ Cotcardis. Don't desert
me, or Riteraggard and his Impi. the Pubbeli-Shahs, will have
another novel ready in less than a week, and I shall be forced to devour
every word of it. Help! help! help! I can bear this no longer.
"Yours, Jack Liwrey."
"Great Heavens!" I gasped. "LrWRET 1 it must be my old
friend, Jack Liwret, of Liverpil, the great Novel Hunter." I too
had suffered at the hands of Riteraggard and his Impi, and I was
determined that they should not have another victim if I could
prevent it. Konstant Redah's eyes gleamed with a vindictive
light. She had often tried to put down the tyrant Riteragoard,
but could not. Now was her chance. So at once we were on the
march. Within a few minutes we were in the Boshibook's country,
near Rtteraggard's Impi and the Pubbeli-Shah's Eraal. When I
reached the Koppie-Right I lay down on my littery bed and took
an inspiriting draught of Punch. It was lucky I did so, for now a
strange thing happened.
Out of the thick red and blue coverts that surrounded the Koppie-
Right ■arose a swarm of fly-leaves, darkening the air like locusts, and
through this black density came flashes like red rays of the setting
sun. "It is the Impi's advertisements," said Konstant Redah,
coolly, replying to my exclamation. "I know them. Behold!"
I looked, and from underneath this swarm, kicking up a dust all
among the Koppie, right and left, came slowly on, as if by forced
marches, Riteraggard himself. Chokebore Allano Quarterman,
Baddely Goon, Sir Henry Cowardis, Old Gobbo the Clown, a
lot of savage Elephants, Rhinoceri, Lions, Tigers, Crocodiles, Snakes,
in fact the whole menagerie and travelling troupe. The men were
all armed with repeating rifles loaded with Saymold ammunition.
Riteragoard had an old fifteen thousand Storey's repeating rifle,
with which he was shooting in every direction at random.
"Help! help! They are cramming Maiwa down my throat!"
I heard in the Tukwokwe dialect. It was the voice of the great
Novel Hunter, Jack Liwrey.
Not a moment was to be lost. With a dexterous whirl I sent my
Paypir-knife whizzing through the air. Riteragoard, to avoid it,
stepped backwards, and, with a yell Buch as I have rarely heard, fell
on to one of his Pubbeli-Shahs, and both tumbled backwards into
their own trap,—a trap intended for one horse, but quite suitable for
a different kind of animal.
Raising my kill-bore-repeater, I put the contents of one barrel,
Baddely Good just as he was preparing to let off a joke, and he
with his face to the earth. It was all over with him, and then, be
Sir Henry Cowardis could recover from his surprise, I let him 1
the second barrel, and down he went, too, dead as a two-days''
§lass of ale. Wheeling round I saw that old villain, All.
iUARTERMAN, preparing a yarn which was to come spinning at
head and catch me as in a net. But at the critical moment I let'
and, with a great groan, he, too, fell lifeless, and, though I ai
Christian, I cannot Bay I felt sorry for any one of them. As for,
beasts of the menagerie, they were only pantomimic mechap
animals, after all. Many collapsed like bladders on being pricl
and others I ordered to be broken up, together with RiTERAGGAj
whole bag of tricks.
When I came up to the trap, I found that it had been turned o.
and the poor steed, cleverly contrived to imitate a kind of wir,
Pegasus, nad got entangled in the harness, but Riteraggajid, ha^
managed to crawl out, had disappeared into the coverts of ,
Koppie-Right. Here he was subsequently found by Konst
Redah, who tortured him for hours by declaiming long extracts f \
his own eccentric books. I left him to her. It was her revei
The poor Pubbeli-Shahs and the other Impis begged for mercy, an

As to poor Jack Liwrey, the great Novel Hunter, he threw b,

And keep a sharp eye round your Island.
Be sure your officials are movers,
To prove by these Autumn Manoeuvres,
W'hich strike me as funny,
The need of more money
To keep up a Fleet for the Island.
"Bbitannia and Neptune
Have hitherto kept tune
In each saying, 'This shall be my land ;'
Should the foes of Old England,
Or all they can bring, land,
We still must show play for the Island.
We must fight for our right to the Island,
Our Fleet must encircle the Island;
If increase it you must,

For it's worth it, your tight little Island"

going for to order a hole dnzzen at wunse. And the
young chap says, says he, quite carm and collected,
"We've got sum 47."
; Sum '47!" says I, with perfound cstonishment.
"Why, wot's the price P"
'Don't kno," says he; "but I'll arsk the Guv-

ain't we, Guwemor?" This brort that gennclman out
pretty quick, and he says, says he, "'47 Port! No, I ony
wishes as we had; but we ain't got no Customers down
here for sitch wine as that. N "think but cheap Claret
gos down here," says he, bitterly. "Ah!" says I, " I've
had sum xperience of both, and" I agrees with what I herd
a Alderman say the other day, that Claret wood be Port
if it coud." "Rite you are," says he; "but unfort-
nightly for me, all the Port as I drinks gos down into my
grate Toe!" "Ah," says I, "I don't know, and I don't
care, where mine gos to, but I alius drinks it wenever I can

in triumf, and werry good it were, and both me and the
Missus injoyed it mutch, she ony drinking three glasses
and me ony drinking all the rest. And the wine made
me that libberal, that I soUemly promist her jest sitch
another treet on her nei buthday.
We finnished up our more than ushally large screes of
Banquets on larst Wensday week, wen we had all Her
Majesty's Minnisters at the Manshun Ouse, and didn't they
all look jolly appy to think as their work was all hover till
next Guy Fox Day, habsent be the homen! Lord George
Amiiton tried hard to friten us all by telling us all as he
had jest reseeved a telacram from the Admeral of the Fleet
saying as they had taken Habberdeen and Heddingburrow,
and was about starting to hinwade Lundon, when ne hoped
if they seized our poplar Lord Mare, we shood be quite
reddy to ransum him! I was that estonished as I neerly
spilt a lot of wine as I was anding round. But I needn't
have bin alarmed, as a Gent near me said that fortnetly
there was about 14 millyun golden suverains a lying in the
Bank close by, and that wood no dowt satisfythe inwaders!
But wot a state of things all this reweals! The Prime
Minnister didn't seem to care werry much about it, but as
he's jest a going off to Deep, in France, of coarse he '11 be
all right, and can wash hisself of the hole affair. Strange
to say too, the Rite Honnerabel the Lord Mare follered
his prudent xampel and started for Forren Parts the werry
next day but wun, so remembring as the better part of
discression was waller, I emediately followed sute, and cum

Last Friday, when setting on the Jetty, a thinking of this thing and the
other thing, wondring what became of all the Turtel during August, why the
Nigger Minsterels didn't wash their faces now there was plenty of water for 'em,
or sum ekally intresting matter, I suddnly thort to myself, what a jolly
thing it must be to have lots of reddy monev. Not Houses, and Lands, aud
Shares, and all such trubbels, but lots of reddy money. Draws full of golden
suvereigns!
I think I knows one thing I should do. I should fill my pocket with about
a handfull of 'em every day, and out I should go, " taking my walks abroad," as
the Poet says, and I should pay a suvereign for everything, and say to everybody,
"that will do." Good Gracious Me, what a idear! I should begin by having uiy
boots cleaned, and giving the boy a suvereign and saying, "That will do, my
Lad." I should buy a penny Newspaper, and do the same; then I should go
in somewhere and have a little lunch and do the same. Fancy the Waiters
estonishment, poor feller, and then I should call a Handsome Cab, and have a
littel ride, and I do believe I should even estonish Cabby; and every time I
dined out—and I should take preshus good care to belong to lots of the City
Gills—when I asked for my At, I should pitch a sovereign into the plate and walk
out smiling at the Waiter's Glee.
Ah! talk about Poppylarity and Riverence, why, I should beat Lord Sorls-
bury and Mr. Gladston, and the Archbishup of Caxterberby into three cocked
hats.
The Great Dook's was the only case of the sort I ever heard on, and he was,
in this respeck, what I think the French calls, Eunick. He used to give a
suvereign for a Play BiU and say to the estonished Cellar, "That wLU do!
I carries out the idear to some small extent in my own umble way. I buys
the Echo every day, it's my favorite paper because I finds news there that I
don't find no wheres else, and I allers pays a penny for it, for which penny I
calkerlate as I gets a haporth of news, and a haporth of respeck, and if there's
one thing I pines for, even more than pine Appel, it's Respeck.
It was my Wife's Burthday larst week, so I promist her a bottel of Old Port,
to witch she is uncommon parshal, probberbly coz she so seldom gits it, witch
is the rule of the Road in most things I fancys. So I gos to the pnncipel Wine

Messrs. Ashhuiist, Morris and Crisp make use

They show me where to sign;
I dream at night of " Table A,"
And shout competing line."
No matter what the Company,
I 'm down for just one share;
Though large or small the venture be,
My name will still be there.
At first I used to sign with pride,
It seemed a goodly thing.
With men of means to be allied,
In each linancial "ring."
But soon the dream was o'er, and now
I loathe the very sight
Ofpens and paper, and my brow
Grows pallid as I write.
I've come to hate my very name,
To curse the thing I am;
I'm " limited" in all but shame,
My single share a sham.
I'm not an avaricious man,
I care not for myself;
But each scheme seems a ghastly plan,
That brings me in no pelf.
Promoters flourish on their tips,
And " booms" within the House;
I sit and watch with hungry lips,
A cat without a mouse.
In spite of everything I sign,
In spite of all I do;
For reasons that I can't divine,
They never raise my " screw."
The monev rolls before my eyes,
A true Pactolian stream.
Alas! the golden vision dies,
A base illusive dream.
Promoters come, promoters go,
They gather gold galore;

I sign for evermore.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty

Magistrates has decided that foxhounds are
no exception to the muzzling order, but liable
to be muzzled. Should this decision be en-
forced, the results of a fox-hunt will be no
more unpleasant to the fox than the mere
over-exertion of running away, and the conse-
quent exhaustion which will bring the chase
to a stop. The fox will be none the worse
than if he had been run to earth. How jollv
for the fox! If the Bench had consisted
entirely of Cheshire cats, they couldn't have
come to a more anti-canine decision. It's
enough to make a Cheshire cat laugh; and,
as for "Sly Reynolds" himself, he 'II go home
after a run, use his brush, which he will not
have left behind him, and spend a pleasant

THE PACE THAT KILLS.
(Further Correspondence.)
-I can hardly find language in which to convey to you the
tremendous impression made on me hy a journey recently made in
one of these newly instituted " Racing" trains to the North. The
sense of hurry was overwhelming, i rom the moment in which I
was hustled out of hreath, hy mistake, with a first-class ticket
into the corner of a third-class compartment, to that of arriving at
Edinburgh an hour and seventeen minutes late, I never enjoyed a
single interval of repose. Imagine the ceaseless whirl through stations,
the masters of which were watching the train tear by with a dazed
stare. As we swept past Grantham refreshments were flung at us
from the platform. We reached York at a tremendous rush. Seven
invalid okl gentlemen were trodden under foot in their efforts to get
into the train.
It seems we had beaten the record by five-and-thirty minutes,
which led me to believe that I should be able to partake at leisure of
the excellent dinner of soup, fish, two entrees, joint, salad, pickles,
and bread-and-cheese, provided for the passengers in the refreshment-
room. Imagine my surprise, therefore, on being told that, if I
wanted to dine, I must do it in three minutes and a half; and as
"beating the record," as the waiter smilingly observed, "was the
order of the day," I got through as much of it as I possibly could in

that limited time. So great, though, was the scurry, that I found
myself again en route, without having had an opportunity of paying
him. And now our troubles began. At Thirsk, after struggling
heavily against the north-east wind, our engine broke down. This
was replaced, but our pace did not mend, and a few miles before
Berwick we came to a dead stop. Inquiry confirmed my worst fears.
It seemed that the strain had proved too much for them, and that
the guard and driver had both gone off their heads simultaneously,
and bad to be removed to a neighbouring lunatic asylum. Owing to
these contretemps, we reached our destination somewhat behind
time, but found the officials nothing daunted, but full of enthusiasm,
they having just heard that the rival Company's express had only
just got in with both its driving-wheels off. They are therefore con-
fident that to-morrow will again find the Company "beating the
record." How long they will continue to do so is a problem that
puzzles your much-impressed and over-wrought contributor,
A Stitch in Time.
Sib,—It is all very well to cry up the magnificent performance of
running 200 miles without a break, but I would caution any intend-
ing traveller to see that he does not attempt the feat in a compart-
ment with three escaped lunatics. This was my experience yester-
day. The train had hardly moved out of the station before I
discovered the dangerous character of my companions. In a few
minutes they were all at my throat. The struggle was a long and
desperate one, but I am fortunately a bit of an athlete, and by the
time we had passed Grantham I had secured two effectively in the
umbrella and luggage nets, and had fixed the third with the point
of a walking-stick underneath the opposite seat. The last nour
passed with these three maniacs glaring at me was, however, not
pleasant travelling, and I have certainly no wish to repeat the
experiment. Yours, Nothing if not Circumspect.
The following letter, which comes fittingly as a conclusion to the
above Correspondence, has just reached Mr. Punch as he was going
to press; and, as it seems to him to announce a very wise decision
on the matter, he has much pleasure in subjoining it:—
Sir,—After three weeks' testing of the racing and other qualities
of our respective engines, by which we flatter ourselves they have
both, in turns, shown that thev have been able, when put to it, to
"beat the record," we have determined, by mutual agreement, on
and after the 31st inst., to return to our normal ways, and observe,
as nearly as we can, the hours of departure and arrival of our trains
as fixed in the advertised Time-tables of our respective Companies.
The fact is, keeping up " the pace that kills " necessitates the heap-
a great deal of coal on—an expensive process, that, as figures
readily show, must soon come to a full stop. Our motto is,
therefore, pro tern., "Itequiescamus in pace," whioh means that,
for the future, we are going to rest and be thankful with a good,
but moderate pace. As long as the "Scotchman" can fiy from
London to Edinburgh in something like eight hours, we fancy the
public will have no occasion to quarrel with
Your obedient Servants,
The Directors op the Two Contending Companies.
PHILALOO!
A Lay of the Late Session.
Am—" Killaloe."
Well, 'tis ended as 'twas born, in shindy and in scorn,
The Session whose right name is Philaloo;
It was like a dreadful drame, and seemed shaped upon the schame
That we've laughed at in the land of Parlevoo!
Men did everything but swear at the Spatker in the Chair,
And they hinted he said things that were not true,
And the Irish sort of spite, and French manners impolite,
Faith, we've larnt 'em in the school of Philaloo.
Chorus.
You may talk of Boneyparte,
His fierce rage was rude as hearty,
But the passions now of Party
Lick the Corsiean. Hurroo!
We beat Boulanger aisy,;
In coarseness crass and crazy,'
In spache that's long, and strong, and wrong,
We shine at Philaloo.
"What, lick us i" Mossoo would cry. ""Why, of. course wu can,"
says I.
"Is that a thing to rouse a Frank's surprise?"
A boy straight up from Clare is the chap to raise your hair,
And—rhetorically—black your Party eyes.
What Mossoo would call " racarme " for all Paddies hath a charm,
So bad language fairly flew about the place. {
"Judas!" aloud to cry, and each other give the lie,
Were among the pleasant features of the case.
Chorus.—You may talk, &c. j
i
Oh, boys, there was the fun, you should see it ere 'twas done,
All courtesies one by one did disappear;
When the Conybeares and Tanners put an end to all good manners,
The talk sometimes was horrible to hear.
The insult and the oath,—well, there's law agin them both,
But for unwritten codes we need not care.
Fellows find it wiU not do to talk much at Philaloo,
Unless they've got a curse or two to spare.
Chorus.—You may talk, &c.
Well, we've raved about the rint, and a dale o' time we've spint.
Says the Spayker, "By St. Patrick, I'm perplexed.
For when ' gentlemen,' ye see, go on like this at Me,
I hardly know what to be up to next."
Had he axed me, I'd have said, "You had best go homo to bedj
And mix no more in Philaloo affairs.
In the papers soon ye '11 trace that our Party Spouting Placo
Is closed for alterations and repairs."
Chorum.—You may talk, &c.
If Billingsgate you'd try, or give Bargees the go-by,
Or make yourself a blayguard, just for fun,
You've just one thing to do—get a seat at Philaloo,
And your mother soon won't own you for her son.
Sure the endless Party shine is a prisint moighty fine,
But what it will be you may well suppose.
For imagine, don't ye see, what a Philaloo there '11 be,
When the prisint Ayes change places with the Noes!
Chorus.—You may talk, &c.
Encore Verse.
Well, I'm glad to find it's true ye 're ashamed of Philaloo,
And the conduct of the Mimbers that ye send.
May the Session that is past of such Sessions prove the last,
Or Parlyment itself perhaps may end.
'Tis not only Irish there who abuse, and rave, and swear,
The Saxon does his share, ye '11 find that thrue.
If to "justice " he'll consint,"and not ax us for the Rint,
Shure we '11 all behave like doves at Philaloo!
Chorus.—You may talk, &c.

MASTER TOMMY'S DOMESTIC MANOEUVRES.
Suggested by some Recent Make-believe Naval Experiments.
How to Make them Fancy the House is on Fire.—Having prepared
two of the top-floor chimneys, by stuffing them with the contents of
several feather pillows steeped in petroleum, light these, and proceed
quickly to the coal-cellar, where, kindling a large bonfire of news-
papers, old school-books, kitchen chairs, and door-mats, rush up the
stairs, crying " Fire !" at the top of your voice, and raise the alarm.
The house being by this time full of blinding smoke, shout to the
butler to open the back windows, and pump freely into the rooms
with the garden-engine. This will increase the consternation, but
ou will have to provide for the excitement of the crowd that will
ave by this time collected in front of the house. To do this, rush
to a window on the second floor, and, flinging it wildly open, tear
bed-curtains and sheets into lengths rapidly, and join them together
for an escape-rope. Now, having secured the page-boy, and
threatened him with a thrashing if ne makes any resistance, let him
down by this into the area. To give more effect to this, do it with
jerks. This will have so impressed the crowd that they will have
already summoned the Parish engines, that will now be playing
vigorously on the front of the house, and drenching it from top
to Dottom. The origin of the "Alarm" having by this time been
discovered, you will probably be called on for an explanation, where-
upon, pointing to the fact, from experience, how well they would
have been prepared to meet it, if there had been a real fire,
you express your complete satisfaction at the result, and frankly
intimating that you now consider the incident closed, refuse to enter
into any further conversation on the matter.
^4n Impromptu Little Dinner.—This experiment may be best tried
at the house of an invalid uncle and aunt, who are noted for their
hospitality, and pride themselves on the excellence of their cuisine,
the object being to show how, with scarcely any preparation, a very
satisfactory dinner may be provided on the spur of the moment for
a decent number of perfectly unexpected guests. Getting hold of
your aunt and uncle's visiting-list, proceed to ask four-and-twenty

of their friends to dinner at a short-date, taking care to tell them
there is "no need to reply to the invitation." The day at length
arriving, and the guests ljeginning to assemble, hurry out and order
in twenty-four bloaters, the same number of mutton-chops, and two
dozen of stout respectively from the fishmonger's, butcher's, and the
public-house in the immediate neighbourhood. The dinner is now
provided. After some awkward pauses in the conversation, your
uncle and aunt still being unconscious of the reason of the assem-
bling of their guests in their drawing-room, the butler, much to their
surprise, now announces it, and all forthwith adjourn down-stairs to
partake of the repast. This does not take long, and the guests, the
matter still being unexplained to them, and, rather resenting the fare
that has been provided for them, depart early, taking their leave
more or less abruptly. Your aunt and uncle being at last left alone,
though still profoundly puzzled at the whole proceeding, are bound
to admit that, although they have not done it exactly in the style they
would wish, they have most undeniably given a quite impromptu
little dinner.

There was a dead silence! Then one of them, extending a bronzed
hand, cried, in an appealing voice,—
"A penny, good Sir—a penny!
His eyes flashed tire, and he indignantly refused the boon.
"A penny, good Sir—a penny!" they repeated, with increased
importunity.
Then he hurled at them a defiance.
"If you are not off at once, I will give you into the custody of the

With an unearthly yell, they threw up their arms, and, taking to

THE PLEASANT WAYS OF GLORY.
Lord Wolseley, when recently giving his evidence before the
Army Estimates Committee, admitting that while an English. Major-
General of Bri-
gade received
£1279 per annum,
an officer of corre-
sponding rank in
the German Army
drew only £700.
seemed inclined
to defend the ano-
maly on the plea
that what was
expected socially
of the former in
this country
would not enable
him to do it for a
lower figure. In-
deed the distin-
guished witness
went further than
this. Alleging
that the rates of
pay for regimental
officers were fixed
at a time when
men purchased
their commissions,
he proceeded to
admit that this
same time was one

1 List, List, oh List!"
when the Army was looked on as a profession into which men went
very much for their amusement, for which they paid partly them-
selves. Quite so. •, -•>
But with all respect for the opinion of " Our Only General," it may
surely be pointed out, that whereas now the Army is decidedly not a
profession into which men go " only for their amusement," it need
not follow that the traditions of expensive living formerly regarded
as its inevitable social concomitant must be accepted as an official
necessity from which there is no means of escape or evasion. Yet
that some sort of idea of the kind prevails, and is generally accepted
as a palpable though unpalatable fact, there cannot be any doubt.
No subaltern can live on nis pay, nor is he expected to. Indeed,
every obstacle is put in his way to prevent him.
Plain Dick and Harry, as soon as they are out of Woolwich or
Sandhurst, and who in many cases have sat down at home in perfect
contentment to the family dinner on cold mutton, find themselves
suddenly waited upon bv flunkeys in plush breeches, and living en
prince, surrounded by all the luxury and comfort of a well-appointed
London Club. There is no getting out of the expenditure, and the
subaltern's pay is, as a matter of course, immediately swamped. And
the evil seems to permeate the whole system, for the officers of
higher rank appear to be no better off, Lord Wolseley alleging that
he had known men who had refused commands because they were
expected to entertain the wholo neighbourhood, and could not in
consequence cover their expenses out of the pay they received.
In fact, the life of the British officer, as thus revealed, seems to
resolve itself into a prolonged struggle to keep up a false position on
insufficient means. And at present there seems but little hope of
any remedy. For when we have only about two hundred of the
new guns ready, and two thousand are required, and when our foreign
stations, wanting an equal number, are supplied as yet only with
twenty, and whilst the non-commissioned officers and men in the
British cavalry number 18,500, and the horses to mount them only
reach the figure of 11,800, to say nothing of departmental short-
comings and blunders cropping up daily on all sides, it seems almost
futile to raise a fresh pry about such comparative trifles as heavy
mess bills and excessive regimental expenditure.
Still, when the lively difficulties and dangers that at the present
moment threaten the Army have been in some measure lightened and
alleviated, it might be worth the while of Our Only General to try
to set on foot some reform that would teach the British Officer that,
to place before himself a simpler standard of living, and one more
compatible with his means, would in no way derogate from his claim
to be considered an English Gentleman.
The Bee and the Honeymoon.—The wedding-dress of the
Princess Letitia, who is shortly to be married to her uncle, the Duke
of Aosta, is to be embroidered with Bees, the emblem of the House
of Bonaparte. No doubt the " going away" costume of this youns:
lady, who has made so singular a choice in the selection of a husband,
will also include a bee—in her bonnet!
THE TRIUMPH OF CAPITAL.
AN ODE.
(Picked up at the Crystal Palace, after the National Co-operative Festival,
August 18, 1888 ; and presumed to be intended as a sort of poetic
counterblast, from, another point of view, to Mr. Lewis Morris's
optimistic Ode, "The Triumph of Labour," sung by 4000 Voices on
that occasion.)
Come, let us sing together an old song.
The triumph of the truly strong.
The victories of Gold we celebrate.
Our Mammon still is great.
Let us our chuckling voices tune to praise,
Come, let us sing together the old and joyous song!
Who threatens to emancipate the clown?
Free workmen from their master's frown?
We wish them joy of their preposterous task.
Mammon may wear a mask,
Of too bold flaunting of his gains afraid.
But still the Sons of Toil are Slaves of Trade.
Interests, in union strong, the workers' claim disown.
There is a strife not fought with sword or gun,
Where, 'midst smug Peace, War's wrong is done;
Still, face to face, in hostile camp they stand,—
Capital, Labour's band,—
The rich man holds his own with smiling ease,
And if sham pagans do the poor man please,
Let the fools tootle; it is rare good fun.
"Time's curse is almost done"? Nay, friend, not yet,
Whilst grabbers grab, and sweaters sweat.
Optimist bards may pipe the pastoral reed;
Pan-pipes won't soften Greed.
Were workers really "strong through brotherhood,"
Panic would swiftly spread through Mammon's brood;
But, spite of poet's song, there's little danger yet.
Pooh! Let them pipe, and for one day rejoice;
Let maudlin Morris give them voice;
We know that what has been, is, and shall be.
Lewis, your fiddle-de-dee
Of optimistic Odes won't give Man power.
Eh P "Peaceful union bloom a perfect flower "?
Nay; much more like a "plant," for all their noise.
Co-operant donkeys bray forth solemn mirth;
Ours is the fulness of the Earth,
Culled, by strong hands, whose labour magnifies
The harvest that we prize.
Look round! and see how rich that harvest grows!
Whilst we 've Wealth's golden fruit and Pleasure's rose,
Labour's last "triumph, bard, though loud, is little worth.
See how around the slums the cellars fill
With triumphs of the Sweater's skill:
"The man's strong work, the woman s deft and fine,"
To swell our hoards combine.
See them sit pinched and pallid, dull and dumb;
In that strange den, that s dubbed
E'en children work;
an English home,
play their poor mouths won't fill.
Therefore let Toil make merry and seem glad;
The vision need not make us sad;
We, in Wealth's wider, stronger brotherhood,
Cling close, for our own good.
We sing the only bond that really binds,
God Mammon's golden link. Wealth little minds
The thing poor fools call " Union,"—they are mad.
And we—we sing together our old and joyous song!
Quite Bradlauohable.—An evening paper observes, "that while
Christians orthodox and heterodox are ready with their millions to
endow churches, there does not seem to be a single wealthy unbeliever
who is willing to endow Mr. Bradlacoh, or even to rescue him from
the debts by which he is embarrassed." Of course, as the Junior
Member for Northampton is a person of ability, this is very very sad;
but as the Agnostic by his name announces that he "knows
nothing," it is not altogether strange that he should avowedly
remain in ignorance of the requirements of his distinguished, but
alas, unfortunate co-anti-religionist. Mr. Bradlaugh may be a
big gun in his own circle, but, when the hat goes round, he is not
likely to provoke quite as much enthusiasm as an eminent eccle-
siastic—say, as a Canon of a cathedral.

My heart's in the Highlands, a-ehasing the deer.
The hills of ould Erin are greener, I knowt
But for sport, at this moment, they 're plainly no go.
My heart's in the Highlands, &c.
This is clearly the place for this species of game.
Here 1 think I may manage to track and take aim.
'Tis a monster, and proud of its high-antlered crown;
But just give me a chance, and I 'll yet hring it down.
My heart's in the Highlands, &c.
My heart's in the Highlands. Great Gladdy is clear
That if 1 've a chance of success, it is here.
He knows the ground well, and he wishes me luck.
Well, / wish it were night, and the quarry well struck!
My heart's in the Highlands, &c.
I shall manage a pop at you yet, please the pigs!
Though I do feel a little bit like poor old Briggs:
My elbows so ache, and my knees are so sore:
Still I'm bound so stalk on, though it's rather a tore.
My heart's in the Highlands, &c.
They didn't expect me—those Cockneys did not—
To come out as a crack Caledonian shot.
Goschen's swaggering challenge of course was mere bluff.
Horroo!!! Yet I wish that these rocks were less rough.
My heart's in the Highlands, &c.
Yes, my heart's in the Highlands,—but so are my legs,
AVhich are stiff at this moment as two timber pegs.
But oh, just to hear a swift bullet go cr-r-raunch
Through yon animal's back-tone, or into its haunch!
My heart's in the Highlands, &c.
How little they like me, the Sassenach lot!
A sleuth-hound's slow patience, plus skill as a shot,
Are needful for stalking a quarry like yon.
Well, a lesson we '11 learn ere all here is done.
My heart's in the Highlands, &c.
All hail to the Highlands! All hail to the North!
The home-land of William, the country of worth!
And if to yon brute its quietus I give,
I '11 shout for Auld Scotland as long as I live.
My heart's in the Highlands—that is to say, here-
My heart's in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer.

My heart's in the Highlands wherever I go!

A WORD ON BEHALF OF A PERSECUTED RACE.
What a blessing is a sympathising Mother-in-Law! How beauti-
fully she rounds off all the sharp corners of life's right-angles. And
when, as in my case, she happens to be blessed with a large amount
of exquisite literary taste, accompanied with a devotion to truthful-
ness that nothing can shake, where could a confiding Son-in-Law
look for a more perfect treasure?
We have been spending a few days at Eastbourne, my Wife, my
Mother-in-Law, my Brother-in-Law, Alfred, and myself. My Wife
being an invalid, and Alfred being fond of sailing, which I
emphatically am not, Mother-in-Law accompanies me in my daily
stroll, and I find her quite a model companion. Being of what is
called, I believe, a literary turn, I sometimes, on these occasions, try
my feeble wing, and soar into the loftiest regions of imagination. It
is on these occasions that I find the honest candour of my companion
so advantageous. For instance, now, we strolled the other day,
despite the merry East Wind, as Charles Kingsley used to call it,
—poetically, of course, for practically, I must confess that I cursed
and swore at it nearly all the way home, of course, sotto voce, as they
say at the Opera,—to Beechey Head. I never, by the bye, remember
who Beechey was, probably, as I wittily suggested to Mother-in-
Law, a distant connection of Sir Hion Beech, a Lord of the Manor
of Epping Forest, judging by the size of his Head, at which she
laughed so merrily that I promised that we should have a Pic-nic
there next summer. We strolled about till near sunset, and then
turned homeward, when my companion, seeing my ardent look fixed
upon the restless sea, asked me what I saw? Without a word of
reply I sank down upon the chilly turf, and taking out my pocket-
book, I pencilled down, in less than a quarter of an hour, the
following thrilling impromptu :—
"How the sun shimmers upon Beechey's Head I
While the pale twilight bubbles on the lea!
Hark t*> the echo of the Coast Guard's trend,
Whose telescopic glance oft sweeps the sea!"
I almost blushed as I placed the manuscript in her hand, and I
eagerly watched to see what effect it produced upon that candid and
truthful relative. "She read it twice, she read it thrice," as Tenny-
son sings, and then taking both my hands in hers, she said, looking
full into my eyes, "John, I could not have believed it, had I not
witnessed it; why this one stanza contains, not only the exquisite
music of Shelley, but also the noble realism of Browning, and
both are combined to make up a picture that will stamp itself for
ever on my fond memory."

Who can wonder that on that eventful evening I at length con-
sented that dear Alfred should reside with us until his Mother
could make other arrangements for him. J. Litgue.

THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.
say, Brown-, let's try and oet into the same Mourning-Coach as
Major Bardolph. He always comes out so jolly on these occasions!"
I
THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
August 11.—Although it is a serious matter having our boy Lupin on our
hands, still, it is satisfactory to know he was asked to resign from the Bank,
simply because " he took no interest in his work, and always arrived an hour
(sometimes two honrs) late." We can all start off on Monday to Broadsteps with
a light heart, though nearly half my allotted fortnight's holiday has been wasted
in correspondence with the Manager of the Bank at Oldham.
August 13.—Hurrah! at Broadsteps. Very nice apartments near the station.
On the cliff they would have been double the price. The landlady had a nice
five o'clock dinner and tea ready, which we all enjoyed, though Lupin seemed
fastidious because there happened to be a fly in the butter. It was very wet in
the evening for which I was thankful, as it was a good excuse for going to
bed early. LurrN said he would sit up and read a bit.
August 14.—I was a little annoyed to find LuriN, instead of reading last
night, had gone to a common sort of entertainment, given at the Assembly Rooms.
I expressed my opinion that such performances were unworthy of respectable
patronage, but he replied, "Oh, it was only 'for one night only. I had a fit of
the blues come on, and thought I would go to see Polly Presswell, England's
Particular Spark." I told nim I was proud to say I had never heard of her.
Carrie said, "Do let the boy alone. He's quite old enough to take care of
himself, and won't forget he's a gontleman. Remember you were young once
yourself." Rained all day hard, but Lupin would go out.
August 15.—Cleared up a bit, so we all took the train to Bargate, and the first
Eerson we mot on the jetty was Gowing. I said, "Hulloh! I thought you
ad gone to Barmouth with your Birmingham friends?" He said, "Yes, but
A
August 18.—Gowing and Cummings walked over to
arrange an evening at Bargate. It being wet, Gowing
asked Cummings to accompany him to the hotel and
have a game of billiards, knowing I never play, and in
fact disapprove of the game. Cummings said he must
hasten back to Bargate; whereupon Lupin, to my
horror, said, "I '11 give you a game, Gowing—a hundred
up. A walk round the cloth will give me an appetite for
dinner." I said,'' Perhaps Mister Gowing does not care to
play with boys." Gowing surprised me by saying, " Oh
yes, I do, if they play well," and they walked oft together.
August 19 (Sunday).—I was about to read Lupin a
sermon on smoking (which he indulges in violently) and
billiards, but he put on his hat and walked out. Carrie
then read me a long sermon on the palpable inadvisability
of treating Lupin as if he were a mere child. I felt she
was somewhat right, so in the evening I offered him a
cigar. He seemed pleased, but, after a few whiffs, said,
.„ _ together and. have games,
duced Lupin, saying, "You will be pleased to find wo have our dear boy at
home!" Gowing said. "How's that? You don't mean to say he's left the
Bank?" I changed the subject quickly, and thereby avoided, any of those
awkward questions which Gowing always has a knack of asking.
August 16.—Lupin positively refused to walk down the Parade with me
because I was wearing my new straw helmet with my frock coat. I don't know
what the boy is coming to.
August 17.—Lupin not falling in with our views, Carrie and I went for a
sail. It was a relief to be with her alone, for when Lupin irritates me, she
always sides with him. On our return, he said, "Oh, you 've been on the
'Shilling Emetic,' have you? You '11 come to six-pennorth on the ' Liver Jerker'
next." I presume he meant a tricycle, but I affected not to understand him.
Thisis a good oU\ tup'ny—trv one of mine," and he

August 20.—I am glad our last day at the seaside was
fine, though clouded overhead. We went over to Cum-
mings' (at Bargate) in the evening, and as it was cold,
we stayed in and played games; Gowing, as usual,
overstepping the mark. He suggested we should play
"Cutlets," a game we never heard of. He sat on a
chair, and asked Carrie to sit on his lap, an invitation
which dear Carrie rightly declined. After some species
of wrangling, / sat on Gowlnu's knees and Carrie sat
on the edge of mine. Lupin sat on the edge of Carrie's
lap, then Cummings on Lupin's, and Mrs. Cummings on
her husband's. We looked very ridiculous, and laughed
a good deal. Gowing then said, "Are you a believer in
the Great Mogul?" We had to answer all together,
"Yes—oh, yes," (three times). Gowing said, "So am
I," and suddenly got up. The result of this stupid joke
was that we all fell on the ground, and poor Carrie
banged her head against the corner of the fender. Mrs.
Cummings put some vinegar on, but through this we
missed the last train, and had to drive back to Broad-
steps, which cost me seven-and-sixpence.

anything?

journey is a long one, would not Allison's History of

Passenger. I thank you, but I think something lighter
would please me better. I am leaving busy toiling
London, in search of leisure—recreation.
Stall-keeper. Then, perchance, the poet's song would
please you. We have Paradise Lost, that mighty work
of mightier Milton. Or, should you prefer the Drama's
claims, here is Shakespere, in twelve handy folios.
Passenger. Nay, I know Milton and the Bard of
Avon by heart. I would give prose romance a turn.
Stall-keeper. Well, then, Sir, I can recommend an
edition, fuUyillustrated, of that great Wizard of the
North, Sir Walter Scott; or prefer you something
still more modern? We have the History of Lord
Macaulay, which, they tell me, is quite a romance.
Passenger (smding). I see you are fond of quaint
conceits; but have you no modern novels?
Stall-keeper. Ay I Indeed, we have, Sir! The works
of George Elliot and of Thackeray.

LIKA, JOKO GOES YOTTIN.
A LONC VACATION STORY BY A. BRIEFLESS, JUNIOR.
Yoc must know that my Chambers are not entirelv mv own.
As a matter of fact, I occupy personally a circular window divided
into compartments and shut in with a green baize curtain from a
room of larger proportions (belonging to another tenant), through
which I have to pass before I reach my own well-ventilated
sanctum. The other tenant and I take about a fourth of the com-
plete suite, the remainder being rented principally by Bandsman,
the eminent leader of the South Northern Circuit. To tell the truth,
we are rather proud of "keeping" (as they say at Cambridge) with
Bandsman, as we hope to gather some or the briefs that may fall
from the great man's writing-desk. I have a very slight acquaint-
ance with him personally, my conversations with him having been
composed chiefly of "Good morning" or "Good evening" passed to
one another on our meeting in the passage common to both our rooms.
However, of course I know him very well by sight, and have noticed
that he is a severely precise, neat, and quiet kind of man. I have
heard that he intends some day to be Lord Chancellor, and is now, so
to speak, in training for that dignified position. My excellent and

admirable clerk, Portington, who, as a rule, is no great respecter of
persons, always talks of Bandsman with bated breath, and rushes
forward to open the outer door when the great man prepares to leave
the Chambers. It is necessary to explain this, and further to add,
that with the good-fellowship habitual to men occupying the same
Chambers, by an unwritten law we are permitted to use one another's
rooms in the absence of their proper proprietors. My own particular
room is popularly supposed by those of my unprofessional friends
who occasionally honour me with a visit, to be the cupboard, in which
I keep my wig and gown, when not arguing abstruse points of law
with the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, and other
learned personages. From this it will be seen that Bandsman's
apartment is far more imposing than my own.
Some little while ago I had reason to believe that I might receive
certain Vacation business from a Solicitor who had been kind enough
to say that he considered himself under an obligation to me ^1 had
bailed him out when he had been arrested at two o'clock in the
morning while attempting to let himself in with a corkscrew, which
it appears he had mistaken for his own latch-key), and consequently
I had warned Portington that should any client ask for me it would
be as well if he showed him into the rooms of my co-chambennan,
Mr. Bandsman.
"He is rather eccentric," I had said, on bidding my excellent and
'be a fir"
admirable Clerk adieu, "and may possibly be a little excited when
he calls; so merely show him in, and do not disturb him if he goes to
sleep." Portington bowed, and said that he quite understood the
situation. On the following morning as I was entering my Chambers
I was met by an American acquaintance, for whom I have a very deep
respect, but who is not entirely accustomed to the staid ways of
what he calls this "plaved-out old country." He button-holed me,
and told me that he nad been looking out for the London friend of a
friend of his in the States. He could not find the said London friend,
so now was hunting for the said friend's children.
"My friend's friend's name was Smith,—Robert Smith," he
observed. "He was living in 1824. That is so. I have advertised
for his descendants, if any. If you hear from any of them, why just
you let me know."
"My dear fellow," I replied, "I shall be only too delighted if I
can be of any service to you. But surely it's a little vague"
"Not at all! A card will do anything in the States. Why not
here? I have put your name and address to the advertisement.
Yes, Sirree. So if you hear from any of them, why just you write
to ' Poste Restante, Rome,' where I am due the day after to-morrow.
Good-bye!"
And before I could say anything in response, he had seized my
hand, wrung it heartily, hastily jumped into a hansom cab, and
was being driven at a gallop towards the Victoria Railway Station.
A little flurried by this rather unexpected encounter, I paused a
few moments to regain my composure, and then entered my
Chambers.
"He's come, Sir," said Portington, as I walked in, "and I have
shown him into Mr. Bandsman's room. He's rather a rum 'un. Sir;
but I suppose it is all right. But you won't be long, I hope, Sir, as
Mr. Bandsman's Clerk tells me that Mr. Bandsman is coming up to
town at two o'clock, and will want to use his room for several
consultations that can't wait until the end of the Vacation."
"Oh, certainly, Portington," I replied. "No doubt I shall not
require the room for more than half an hour."
Upon this I assumed my best manner (I usually adopt a cheery
and genial air when dealing with clients—it puts them at their ease),
and entered the apartment in which my anticipated acquaintance
was seated, and greeted him with great cordiality.
"Delighted to see you, my dear Sir," I exclaimed—and then I
stopped. To mv astonishment I found, instead of my expected
visitor a rough-looking person in a velveteen coat and a fur cap,
with a newspaper in his right hand, and a thick short stick in the
other.
"Ax your parding. Guvnor," said this person, with rather a
threatening air, "but I've come about this 'ere advertisement."
He handed me the newspaper with a marked passage in the second
column of the front page.
"You are Briefless, ain't you?" he asked, roughly. I nodded,
and glanced at the marked passage. To my horror I found it was a
request that aU persons claiming relationship with a Robert Smith,
living in 1820, should call upon me at my Chambers, when they
'' would hear of something to their advantage."
"Now," said the person, looking at his stick, " I ain't going for
to stand no nonsense. I 'ave wasted 'arf a day 'ere, 'cos I turned up
before the doors was opened. Bon Sunn was my uncle. What's
the summut I'm going for to 'ear to my advantage?"
I really did not Know what to say or do. I could not help feeling
greatly annoyed at my American acquaintance's thoughtless im-
petuosity.
"So you are old Bob Smith's descendant, are you, my worthy
follow?" I exclaimed, with a heartiness I was far from feeling.
"None of your gammon," he replied, roughly; "but stump up
now you knows my rights. Cos why—if you don't stump up it won't
be pleasant for you."
Greatly upset by his threatening demeanour, I was about to
remonstrate, when Portington ushered in two more rough-looking
persons and three muscular females. The five additions to our little
circle produced as many marked newspapers, and immediately called
my attention to what they described as their "rights."
My worthy people," I began, "I fear there must be some mis-
take."
They anathematised the suggestion, and all six of them advanced
towards me with a demeanour that made me devoutly wish that we
had included a police-constable on the strength of our clerical esta-
blishment. I saw that I must temporise.
"My good friends, I was a little unprepared for your visit, but if
you will wait here a few minutes, I think I can satisfy you. And
now I will retire."
The rough-looking men were inclined to bar my exit, but the three
females, with the observation '' that anyone could see as I was a
gentleman as meant to be'ave as a gentleman," suggested that I
should be allowed to go on the understanding that I returned in five
minutes with the " summut" I had presumedly promised to give them.
The men accorded a grudging consent, and I walked away. Once
outside, with a hurried remark to Portington that I might not
return until the commencement of Term, I left my Chambers.
Later in the day I passed Pumphandle Court, and from a loud
altercation I heard going on within (in which I distinctly recognised
the voice of Bandsman raised in angry expostulation), I much fear
that my unwelcome visitors (who seemed to be still in possession),
had seriously interfered with the serenity that usually is the charac-
teristic of my eminent co-Chamberman's important consultations.

IS SMOKING A FAILURE?
Sir,—I have not the least doubt that the discovery made by
Medicts, dating from the Middlesex Hospital, that smoking Turkish
and Egyptian cigarettes is most injurious to health, is absolutely
correct. I have often wondered why it is
that I feel so uncommonly queer after
dinner; now at last the mystery is ex-
plained. It is all due to the "Wady
Haifa Paragons" that I have been in the
habit of smoking, but which I shall now
abjure in favour of a pipe and some extra
strong Virginia shag. I assure you that
often and often I have felt just as if my
throat were on fire, and have habitually
gone to bed in my boots, awaking the next
Beer or But-1 he Smokers morning with a perfectly splittinjg head-
Mixture, ache. Yet I have been most moderate in
eating, and have steadilv limited mv drinking to two bottles of
Tokay and half a bottle of Scotch whiskey per evening, which surely
nobody can call an excessive supply. Some ridiculous friends have
insisted that I am suffering from alcoholic poisoning, and have induced
me to try this retreat, kept—I fancy—by a medical chum of their own;
but you can judge how mistaken the treatment here is when I say that
I am limited to two glasses of weak '' Vin Ordinaire " a day, while the
presiding physician does not care in the least how many noxious and
poisonous cigarettes I indulge in. Need I say that, after these
awful revelations of Medicts, I have given a weekly notice of my
intention to leave this retreat—"beat a retreat," I may perhaps
call it—and resume my old modes of life, minus my old penchant for
cigarettes, but plus pipes and cigars, ad lib. t
Yours, eye-openedly, A Toper.
The Home fur Inebriates, Losticittles, Cornwall.
Sir,—my mucous membrane is in an awful condition! Do you know
what it is to have a couple of Doctors exploring your larynx for three
hours, as if it were a part of the Dark Continent'( I do. They say
that my laryngeal regions—by which I think they mean my throat,
only a natural delicacy prevents them putting it so plainly—affords
a most interesting study, because in all their experience they have
never seen anything look half so bad! This is comforting to me. Now,
after Medicus's disclosures as to the horrible " unclassified alkaloid
poison " in Egyptian cicrarettes, I cannot have a doubt whero my ill-
ness has come from. Where it will go to, time and my Doctors wiU
have to decide between them. And then for Medicos calmly to con-
fess that the alkaloid poison is "unclassified!" I don't feel, how-
ever, as if it would do my "laryngeal regions" much good even if
it were classified.
Yours, mucussedly, A Dabbler in Egyptians.
P.S.—A sanitary expert has just told us that our house happens to
be planted over an old cesspool, and that all the domestic pipes
connect directly with it. Possibly, after all, the alkaloid is not so
guilty as we thought.

A LESSON FROM THE AUTUMN MANOEUVRES.
THE EFFECTIVE USE OF MOUNTED INFANTRY.
THE PRINCESS PAPOFFSCHIN'S LITTLE DINNER.
(A Story d la Mode for Those who Know.)
The sitting of the International Conference for the Suppression of
Bounties on Sugar had been prolonged to an unusually late hour.
The assembled Ministers had been dealing with a delicate phase of
reciprocal engagements, and had determined not to separate until
they had at least a rough draft of the Convention in something like
a completed shape; and having accomplished this, they were about
to rise, when a Messenger entered, and nanded a note to the Baron.
It was a scented epistle on rose-leaf paper, and ran as follows:—
Mon Cher Baron,
You must be weary after your labours of this afternoon, and
will need relaxation. What do you say to a petit diner chez moi to
refresh you? Persuade, then, your good confreres to join you, and
come, all of you, sans cereinonie, just as you are, and honour me
with your company. I may, peut etre, have des nouvelles de Constanti-
nople to give you. Mais, nous verrons ce soir, n'est-ce pas f Come.
Yours always devotedly, Fedeorevna Papoffschin.
"It is from the Princess," said the Baron, his face beaming with
a kindling radiance as he glanced at the contents of the dainty
missive before him. "She asks us all to dine with her quite inform-
ally. Listen!" Then he read the little note. There was a murmur
of approbation from the Conference. Instantly they rose as if by one
accord, and hurriedly collecting the business papers before them,
thrust them into their respective coat-pockets. They had all of
them only one reply to make. They accepted with enthusiasm. Nor
was this surprising. The Princess Fedeorevna Papoffschin was
no ordinary woman.
Born in Russia, she soon after the death of her husband, the Prince,
had appeared in diplomatic society in Belgrade, and had rapidly, by
her intelligence, tact, and capacity for intrigue, succeeded in getting
herself such an acknowledged factor in the stirring political move-
ment of the times that she nad received her passports, and had been
requested to leave the country at twenty-four hours' notice. Trans-
ferring in turns her residence to Vienna, Madrid, Berlin, and other
European capitals where similar experiences invariably after a time
awaited her, she was next heard of as the intimate friend of several
Parisian statesmen of note, and though her career in the French capi-
tal had come to a rather sudden termination, owing to the connection
of her name with a celebrated cafe chantant scandal, she seemed to
have preserved enough of her reputation to assure her a hearty welcome
among the leading lights of English diplomatic society. Regarded
as intimately acquainted with the secret counsels of the Sultan, her
friendship was eagerly cultivated by the heads of the Foreign Office,
and it was not an uncommon sight to see her surrounded in some
West End salon by a thronging crowd of politicians and statesmen
hanging on her lightest word. Indeed, it was stated that the Premier
himself was so deep in her confidence that the entire direction of his
Eastern Policy had latterly been due to her advice and influence. It
was not to be wondered at that the Conference accepted her invita-
tion with alacrity. A chance of an informal evening with the fasci-
nating Princess in her delightful mansion in Mayfair out of the
season was not an experience to be missed, and at a little before a
quarter to eight three four-wheelers conveying the expectant Pleni-
Sotentiaries were making their way up Piccadilly to their coveted
estination.
In the course of the same afternoon the Princess had prepared for
their advent. She had sent for her Major Domo. "I nave a little
dinner this evening," she said. "We shall be eighteen." Then she
added, significantly, "I am expecting diplomatists."
VOL. XCT.
The man bowed profoundly. He had understood his orders. He
knew that the dishes were to be drugged, and the champagne
doctored with morphia.
• •••••
Several courses had been disposed of, and the dinner was appa-
rently promising to be a great success. Never was hostess more
bewitehingly entertaining; never were guests more enthusiastic.
On the right of the Princess sat the Baron, on her left the German
Count. The conversation was airy and brilliant.
"How about those promised nouvelles from Constantinople,
Princess?" !asked the Baron, endeavouring to give the talk a
practical turn. But his fair hostess only replied with a little timely
badinage, and motioned to the servant to nil up her interlocutor's
glass with more champagne. So the dinner sped on. The cuisine
was pronounced excellent, the wine superb. But little by little,
almost imperceptibly, the conversation Degan to quiet down. It
halted strangely. Then it dropped altogether. It seemed as if all
the guests were gradually becoming so absorbed in some private
reflections of their own, that they did not care to break the silence
for the purpose of imparting their thoughts to their neighbours.
Then some of them closed their eyes.
The Baron, who noticed the soporific influence stealing over
him, thought that he must somehow have been taking too much
wine, and elected to hold his tongue. He struggled against the
feeling for a short time. Then he succumbed. In like manner, in
a few more minutes, so did all the rest. And it was not to be won-
dered at. They had had bromide of potassium in the Potage d la
Maintenon, and had just partaken of a Salade d la Masse mixed
with chloral hydrate. This had finished them. They had all of
them sunk back into their chairs, overcome by a profound narcotic
slumber. Then the Princess rose. She approached the wall, and
touched a little brass knob. Instantly a panel slid back, disclosing a
chamber beyond.
"Entrez, Monsieur VAmbassadeur," she said, addressing some
one within. "Voyons! Ces Messieurs are ready to receive you."
She had scaroely spoken when a tall personage, wearing a fez,
crossed the threshold. This was the Turkish Ambassador, and he was
followed by twelve Secretaries of the Legation.
".You are sure, Madame, they will not wake?" he asked, cau-
tiously surveying the prostrate forms before him.
The Princess replied by striking a loud dinner-gong. Not one of
the sleepers stirred. The Ambassador was satisfied.
"To your work, Messieurs," he said, addressing his subordinates.
In another minute the pockets of all the unconscious Plenipotentiaries
had been rifled of their contents which were being rapidly but methodi-
cally transcribed by the practised Secretaries.
The task did not take long. It was over in four hours and three-
quarters. The papers were returned to the pockets of the different
Ministers from which they had been respectively abstracted. Their
coats were carefully rebuttoned. Then the Turkish Ambassador
withdrew.
That night he telegraphed to Constantinople in cypher. ^
A little later, eighteen cabs in charge of eighteen policemen were
conveying the now recovering Ministers to their respective homes.
That which contained the Baron, now partially aroused, had drawn up
at his own door. As he descended, though still dazed, he seemed to
notice the Policeman's uniform.

The Policeman smiled.
The Baron stared inquiringly at the smiler, then staggered feebly
up the steps, entered the house, and went to bed.
The next morning the Marquis and the Baron received a telegraphic

that the Sultan proposed an immediate seizure of Egypt.

It simply dies out like an ill-lighted ember.

But " First Love" is stable enough—in the Stubbles!

years ago it was a case of stealing a sovereign—with an axe! History
repeats itself.

son from being entirely unsympathetic
of going away for a holiday r"
Yes; Hobson is thinking of it. As a matter of fact, he has so far
thought of it that he is now sending a letter to order a berth in one
of the London and Edinburgh steamers. "Will I join him?" To
do or to attempt doing something I have never yet done, has for me
a certain fascination. I have never been from London to Edinburgh
by steamer. A minute ago my determination not to take a holiday
was inflexible; now it is flexible. My iron will—or my iron'' won't
—is bent, not broken.
"Not a bad idea," I remark to Hobson.
He replies that he prefers this way of going North to any other.
Happy Thought.—"Hobson's choice." Ido not say this aloud to
my old and valued friend, because it is just possible that, his name
being " Hobson," it may have been said to him before.
"Yes," he repeats, after some silent consideration of the subject,
"I certainly prefer going by steamer to any other way of getting to
Edinbro'."
"Well, but how many other ways are there ?" I ask, as, should
he be able to mention a greater novelty, I should be inolined to adopt
the suggestion.
"I mean," he returns, "that it's better than going by train." I
thought so. Putting aside walking, driving, riding, bicycling,
tricycling, and. ballooning-, the alternative is "training" or
"steamenng."
"Excellent for health!" says Hobson, who studied medicine
years ago in Edinburgh, and, in consequence, has always been con-
sulted by his intimate friends, in an amateur way, ever since.
"Twenty-six hours of sea first-rate," he adds, expanding his chest,
sniffing and smacking his lips as if at this moment he were actually
inhaling the Seabreeze and relishing it.
"I'm such a bad sailor," I observe, hesitatingly. "If I go, I'm
sure to be ill,—at least," I add, with a reminiscence of a few sur-
prising exceptions to the rule, "it 'sjlmost a certainty."
an air of scientific
you're well. I'm
going alone; only too glad of a companion. Look here, I '11 alter
one berth into two berths in my letter." And before I have time
to make any further objection he has ordered the seoond berth,
drawn a cheque for prepayment, stamped and closed the envelope,
vanished for a second or so as far as the pillar-box, where I see
him dropping it in, and at the lost moment cannot find it in my
heart and voice—(" heart and voice," quotation from National
Anthem) to call out to him from my window, "No, I won't come!"
So, my will, or won't, being temporarily paralysed, and he having sent
the cheque for two, I make no further objeotion, but begin considering
what I can do when I once get to Edinbro'.
Happy Thought.—If I am ill, as he has studied medicine in Edin-
bro], he may be able to give me something that'll put me right in
an instant. If he possesses the secret, by the way, he ought to make
a rapid and colossal fortune out of it. This recalls to my mind a
book of travels entitled The Earl and the Doctor. They went
together everywhere. The Earl with guns and fishing-rods, and the
Doctor with medicine-chest. Capital idea for both of them. Excel-
lent for Earl when ill, equally so for Doctor when they returned.
Such combinations might be more frequent. The Captain and the
Lawyer, The Musician and the Sailor, &o., &c.; perhaps the best of
all would be The Duke and Two Doctors, one being M.D., and the
other D.D.
"Where'sHobson going? "Well," he explains, "I'm going to
pay two or three visits to friends." Ah, then we part at Edinbro'?
Yes, we do." And here he leaves me—as he will in Scotland—being
very busy. What shall I do alone in Scotland? "Alone in

traveller is suggestive of asking for another glass of light creaming
beer. "Bock agen " with me would mean ' Back again to London?
Bock agen, Whittington!" But why go all the way to Edinbro'
by steamer, merely to come bock agen?"
I am beginning to be almost angry with my old and valued friend
Hobson, in his absence, for leading me into this trap,—a trap to
catch a companion,—and I am about to sit down in my sanctum,
where my books and papers seem to beseech me to remain, and write
to Hobson a retractation of my decision, when I hear a tremendous
shout in the passage.
"Woo-Hoop!"
This is followed by a voice whose tone indicates unusual strength
of lung, exclaiming, as if the inquiry were urgent and anxious,
"How are you r"
The door is burst open, and, as if impelled by a mighty wind,
there appears before me a big man, youngish, beaming with health
and high spirits, dressed in a country suit.
"How see you?" he repeats boisterously, and then once more,
"Old chap, how are you?"
In another second he has grasped my hand warmly, and I am
delighted to see him.
"Hullo!" I cry out, for his tone is catching, "why what brings
you here?"
_ "Cab, my boy!" he shouts, heartily, he generally shouts, unless he
sings, but whatever it is it is done with tremendous and overpowering
heartiness,—even his whispers are hearty. "Just on my way to see
the Wicked Uncle and Good Aunt. Passing through London"
here he lowers his tone, laughs, and bursts into a snatch of a song—
"Off we go to London Town,
Teo ho! my boys!
See the King in his golden crown,
Yeo ho! my boys!"
and then he laughs in perfect enjoyment of appropriateness of the
quotation and continues hurriedly, '' I thought I d call in" (call in,—
he means, call out), "and say," nere he raises his tone again, "How
are you?"
As nobody ever speaks of him, or to him, but as " D. B.," it is not
always easy on the spur of the moment to call to mind what his
name really is. When asked, I have to think for some seconds, and,
generally failing to remember, I have to answer, apologetically,
Well, really, I forget what his name is at this moment, but we
always call him ' D. B.'"
His real name is Davie Bated, and he is in a general way "in the
City" with a partner. Now he is on a holiday, without a partner.
Going North.
I tell him that I also am thinking of going North.
"Don't think," he Bays at once, and just as loudly as ever; "don't
think—do it. Come to Johnnie Budd's. I'm going there now.
First-rate fellow! Capital chap! I '11 tell him you 're coming. You
know Johnnie, don't you?"
It never occurred to D. B. to ask me this last question before invi-
ting me to Mr. Budd's.
Ireply deliberately, "Yes—I know him; but not sufficiently well
to go to his house without an invitation."
Nonsense!" he exclaims, quite annoyed with me for making
such an objeotion. Then he bursts into a popular refrain—

you've noticed for yourself, if you 'appen to want a snack o' fried

MALA FIDE TRAVELLERS IN WALES.
Welsh Justice, Chairman of Quarter Sessions, and likewise of
Local Rench (to Publicans in attendance). Now mind, all you
publicans, and innkeepers, and hosts,
and tapsters, have a care how you
serve anyone whomsoever with wines,
and beers, and porters, and ales, and
swipeses, and metheglins, and spiritu-
ous or fermented liquors, on any pre-
tences or occasions, at any times on
Sundays. You are not permitted, or
suffered, or allowed, or authorised to
supply peoples with beers, look you,
simply because they have come three
miles to get them. In my opinions, and
judgments, and sentences, that is no
sufficient journeys to make them bond
fide travellers. I pray you take notice that, as far as I am concerned,
if any oharges comes "before me, I shall look, and see, and inquire, and
determine whether publicans have tried ordinary means, and
interrogatives, and questions, to discover if persons were bond fide
travellers in truth, look you now. A bond fide traveller is one who
is travelling for purposes, and objects, and necessities. For instance,
a bond fide traveller would be a man travelling to get work, but
not one who came a certain distance to get beer. As an example
of a frivolous, and trumpery, and make-believe excuse for tippling
and toping, I know a case in which a man had the cheek, and the
effrontery, and the brass, to say that he had walked all round the
three-mile stone. Don't tell me of constitutional walks, and exer-
cises, and thirsts, and needs of refreshments. Let me warn you,
and admonish you, and exhort you to sell no one a glass of beer
for no better causes and reasons than being tired and exhausted
with a Sabbath-day's journey, whether short or long. 'Tis no
matter for their fatigues, and wearinesses, and drynesses, and droughts,
that makes them call for it, because, look you, they want it, and
their desires and inclinations demands it, and their exhaustions
craves for it against the laws and statutes in such cases made and
provided for restraints of their appetites and offences. So now go
your ways, shentlemens, and get you about your businesses, and see
that none of you be brought before me for selling drink to any
traveller, howsoever faint, and foot-sore, and thirsty, on a Welsh ,
Sabbath, forasmuch as, look you, I would beseech you, and intreat |
you, command you, and, moreover, compel you to make it a dry
Sunday. [The remarks of thiswise Magistrate may perhaps occasion
British tourists to think twice and three times before devoting their
holidays to an excursion in " gallant little Wales."]

Why that sort of thing won't do at present? Ask Blaine!
True, I did introduce you a few months ago
To Columbia.* Politeness, my dear, half pretence!
I found—didn't you ?—it was really no go.
And although at that time I could " sit on the fence,"
That rail it's no longer quite safe so to ride;
I must seem to get down, dear,—and not on your side.
Tut! tut! Broken vows, and all that sort of thing?
That's a most extreme view, now, to take of the case.

But bound to you? Nay, my dear child, that's absurd.
If you talk about bonds, I am off like a bird.;
Miss Protection may not be so pretty, or young,
I do not pretend on her person to dote;
But she claims, well, I won't say my heart, but my tongue,
And I want to win, not her love, but her vote.
Needs must when—Democracy drives, don't you know,
And one can't quite afford to be careless of dot.\
Come, come! don't be angry! A fellow, I'm sure,
May philander a little with no bad intent.

That friendship one day we perhaps may renew,
But do stand aside for the present, now do!

And if I smile on her just now I '11 go down.
So, for politic reasons I put on a frown.

It is stated that two dogs belonging to a Deputy named Lagueree.
"the henchman of General Boulanger," have been taught to howl
whenever M. Ferry's name is mentioned. It is really a pity thus
to waste time, and demoralise such decent animals as dogs.
M. Lagueree would find it simpler to retain certain of the two-
legged curs of Creed and puppies of Party, who may be safely
trusted, and that without being taught, to yelp hideously whenever
a particular Statesman's name is uttered in their hearing. Could
any honest dog " drop into poetry," he would, doubtless, deliver
Dr. Watts's familiar lyric in some such inverted fashion as follows:—
"But, doggies, you should never let
Your purchased yelpings rise;
Tour honest mouths were never meant
Let scribes delight to snap and bite,
For 'tis their nature to;

"A Rare Old Plant."—There is much taBc in Vienna of a

prognosticating all atmospheric changes three days in advance.
Well, the Abrus veregrinus, or " Paternoster Pea," may possess all
the powers claimed for it. But, Mr. Punch's opinion is, that the real
"Weather-plant" this year at least—is the Weather itself!

PORTRAIT OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO DRAWS TJP THE
METEOROLOGICAL REPORTS.
"Another Depression is coming!"
[Just as he was about to take his Holiday too I
ACROSS THE WATER.
( With the Lord Mayor.)
Well, it is all over now, but it has been a wonderful success. Dendermond,
comparatively insignificant Flemish town though it is, has certainly known how
to emphasise the glorious fact that it has given from its sons a Lord Mayor to
the City of London. Such a Procession! There were "mediaeval" trumpeters
and drummers, young persons with banners, in classical costume'; "Commerce"
represented by a steamboat full of ladies accompanied by sailors of all countries,
and followed up by effigies of "Painting," "Industry," Music," and "Science,
together with a group showing Rodrecht VIL, Van Bethttne, Lord of Dender-
mond, presenting to the town a charter, dated 1333. This last personage was, I
think, owing to the fact that he was attired in chain armour, frequently taken by
the crowd for the Lord Mayor himself, and vociferously cheered in consequence.
I found the townspeople, however, rather vague as to their estimate of our
Chief Magistrate's position and privileges, and had to be continually explaining
to them in indifferent Flemish that when at home he neither shared the Wool-
sack with the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords, commanded the Life
Guards in person, or sat down every night of his life to a grand banquet at
the Crystal Palace with a thousand picked members of the British Nobility.
Nothing though that I could say appeared to detract from the exalted estimate
they had formed of his general dignity, and when the effigy of London came upon
the scene, surrounded by allegorical figures of "Foresight," "Constancy,"
"Vigilance," "Civic Virtues," ^'Dancing," "Deportment," ''Athletics," and
"Stenography," the enthusiasm of the spectators knew no bounds, and they
fairly snouted themselves hoarse. Then came music and fireworks, and later,
several groups who had been dining, congregated round me, and insisting that I
must be the Lord Mayor, beg^an to cheer me disagreeably. I, however, remon-
strated in dumb show, and pointing to a window in the Town Hall where the
Burgomaster could be seen at that very moment for the tenth time in the act of
embracing the portly and smiling form of Mr. Polydore de Kkyser himself,
succeeded in diverting their attention.
The next day the Lord Mayor started on his return journey, smothered in
trophies. He made a short halt at Ghent and Bruxelles, his stay at the latter
place being chiefly remarkable for a thoroughly racy comic after-dinner speech,
made on the occasion by Mr. Sheriff Da vies. That the whole party after a capital
outing has arrived quite safe and sound in town again is here recorded with much
satisfaction by your careful and observant correspondent,
A City Remembrancer.
A WORD IN SEASON.
"It U the pride of the Hohcnzolleras to reign at once over
the noblest, the most intellectual, and most cultured of nations."
The EstPEKOK William.
Why, who speaks here? A Kaiser and Commander,
Or some mob-flattering, demagogic pander?
Droll doubling of two parts, the pompous ruler,
And glosing hyperbolic people-fooler!
How martial souls—like Wolseley—who deride
All sentiment upon the popular side
As " sickly," "pharisaic,—Heaven knows what—
Philanthropy, with other kinds of " rot"
With the fine swagger of the soldier classing,—
Must shudder at the HohenzoUern's "gassing "!
Noblesse oblige, my William! Mighty souls,
Like yours and Wolseley's, aim at other goals
Than Cleon and the Sausage-seller, surely.
Flatter the crowd P Is the crown so securely
Poised on the head of despot power to-day
That Raisers can with fulsome phrases play,
Without the risk of bringing on Autocracy
The "torrent of anarchical democracy"
Which scares our pocket-Csesar in a fashion
That moves him to quite incoherent passion?
Take thought, my Teuton Chief, and, above all,
Take counsel with our " Only General."
He is not, like your Moltke, taciturn;
He deals in thoughts that breathe and words that burn,
As prettily as any poet-person
Who martial hero ever turned a verse on;
(The poet's highest function which redeems
Bard songs from being merely baby-dreams.)
He reckons up historic heroes lightly—
I hope, Lord Herr, you've read the last Fortnightly—
Appraises Marlrorouoh, and Napoleon,
And picks some little holes in Wellington.
You ll hardly, Raiser-King, obtain an article
Of this particular sort, without a particle
Of shrinking modesty, from the old chief
Whose age in touching terms asks late relief
From the long strain of splendid service. No,
Your Silent Hero is not fashioned so.
His brief pathetio letter, the appeal
Of time-worn strength to drop the martial steel,
That script historic and your land reply
Beseem you both, Lord Herr, right royally.
But even Moltke's silent tongue might wag,
Mildly against the too thrasonic brag,
Of such an untried C^sab, where huge hosts
Need little to be swelled by boyish boasts.
A Shaving Clause.—Those intelligent and amusing
personages, the Commissioners in Lunacy, in their forty-
second Report to the Lord Chancellor (d propos of a
possibly preventible suicide at Bethlehem Hospital] "while
acknowledging the difficulty of entirely doing away with
razors in asylums," advised that they should be kept
under a double lock. They added to this extremely
sensible proposal the interesting information that, "as a
still safer plan," they "had recommended the daily ser-
vices of a barber accustomed to lunatics." It would be
interesting, however, to learn how such a person could
obtain his necessary qualification. The first attempt to
shave a raving madman is rather suggestive of the last
chapter but one of a "shilling shocker "; and although
people who eschew beards possiblv may not be considered
entirely in their right minds, their eccentricity, at the
most, partakes rather of the characteristics of harmless
idiotey than of the more violent forms of acute mania.
Literal.
Pat may be a lazy and law-breaking sinner,
With cudgels and Plans of Campaign be too free;
But at least he'd have rather more chance of a dinner,
Were it not for the curse of the absentee (absent tea.)
Literaby Diet.—" Much reading, like much eating"
said Sir Theodore Mabtln, in the Llangollen Town Hall,
quoting an old writer, "is wholly useless without diges-
tion." True enough, and food for the mind is indigestible
if too tough. Indulgence in modern French literature of
the baser sort is very apt to create indigestion attended
with nausea.

BALLADS OF TO-DAY.
THE OLD TELEPHONE.
(By Milton Featherly Ionsone.)
It stands as of yore in the dear dark corner,
But the dust has gather'd, the voice has
There, like a little forlorn Jack Horner,
It lingers, unlook'd-for, the old Telephone.
The blinds in the office hang yellow and slanting,
The sun strikes mottled athwart the pane,
And ever a low lone voice is chanting,
From days evanish'd, an old refrain:
Ring, ring-a-ring! Are you there? Who are you?
What do you want? Ring-a-ring! Are you there?
Answer, 0 love! While I rest for a bar, you
Murmur your numbers, my fair, my fair!
Like the joy-bells chiming;
Like a coffee-mill talking alone;
Ring, ring-a-ring!
Whirr! Like a c
Silence! Like poets who sleep at their rhyming;
An answer softer than cushat's moan.
Yes, for a voice on the desert of business
Fell like the dew, though the face was unknown.
And ever my brain with delirious dizziness
Reels when I think of the old Telephone.
Ah, but the world whirls wearily round me,'
And I with the weary world am whirl'd;
Should it suddenly stop, it could scarce confound me,
If .some bright morning, the angels found me
Recklessly round the lamp-posts curl'd.
But, in garden old, or in window'd minster,
From chordless organ, or frozen bird,
From bachelor bold or blushing spinster,
Such soul-sweet music was never heard.
In love's bright play-bill I largely star you;
I hear you ever, my unseen fair;
Ring, ring-a-ring! Are you there? Who are you?
And Echo sobs—There is no one there!
Cce-kious.—A Billiard-player's prosperity seems very
paradoxical. The more "hazard" there is about it, the
more certain it is, and it is largely made by breaks.
ROBERTS EXCURSION.
I had what I calls a reel treat the other day, and as I don't have
it, as sum seems to do, about wunee a week, but jest about as seldom
as possibel, I did jest injoy it. I was orderd down to Rumford, of
all places in this mortal world, to wait on a party of City swells at
the principle Otel there, called, I think, the Golden Carf, or sum
sitch name, and as I was there in good time afore they started on
their desperate hard work of surweying all the principle mountains
of Hessex, and as there wasn't not noboddy hinside the bootiful drag
and its four hosses, the nice good-looking Chairman acshally arsked
me to jump in! Witch I need ardly say as I did, like a bird. Well,
off we set, and may I never be beleeved, if the Landlord of the Otel,
where the gents was a going for to dine after their ard day's work,
didn't git on the box and drive all the fore hosses, and werry weU he
did it too, and didn't upset us not wunce.
And to make the whole set-out quite compleat, we took a trumpitter
with us with about the worry longest trumpit as I ever seed or ewen
heerd on, and wenever we cum near an house or an hoss, he blowed
away to that xtent that I werrily thort as he must ha' bust hisself,
but he didn't. We had a most luvly ride on a most luvly day, our
fore bootiful hosses a running up the Essex mountains and down into
the Essex walleys as if they thort nothink of 'em. We druv
threw some Nobbleham's Park. The young trumpitter, who was, I
think, a bit of a wag, tried to perswade me as the Nobbleham's name
was Peter, but I wasn't quite so green as to bleeve that.
It wasn't a werry cumferal looking house as was in the Park, for
the roof was all off, and all the winders was broke, which guv it
rayther a chilly look, but the Mossyleum, as we seed a little further
on, quite made up for it, for anythink moro nicer, or warmer, or
cumferal looking I never seed.
I think, praps, if they'd both ha' bin mine, I should ha' gone in for
sumthink of a change in the wicey wersey style; but of course there's
no acounting for taste, speshally among the werry hiest horder of the
Harrystockracy. There was a good many solgers and peeple about
warious parts of our ride, and wenever we druv through 'em, I jest
raised my at and made my werry best bow—witch I'm told is werry
much like a serten Royal Prince's—at which they was hevidently
much pleased, for they all larfed quite haffably. I wunder who they
took mo for, in my sollitury grander, drest, as of coarse I was, in full
heavening costoom.
Well, wen we got back, the Chairman, thinking praps as he had
better go on as he had begun in the staggering line, acshally arsked
the driving Landlord to dine with 'em, and, follering my nobel
xample, he didn't want not no pressing, but down he sat. And if
he didn t earn his capital dinner by the way in which he emuscd all
the City swells, noboddy never did. Of coarse I was too much
occypied by my purfeshnal dooties to hear werry much, but wot
little I did hear ony made me long for more. Just one or 2 auneck-
dotes as xampels.
He told 'em as he wunse druv a party of 12 on a fore horse Drag
all the ways to Liverpool, a matter of 220 mile, jest to see a Race
run, and he charged 'em two hundred and fifty pound for the job!
And having gammond 'cm as he lost money by the transackshun,
they all subskeribed together, like reel Gents as they was, and
had a picter painted of the hole concern, Drag, and Hosses, and
Gents, and Driver, and all, and guv it to him at a grand dinner at
his hone house, and, as he werry propperly said, if any Gent here
dowts my word, there's the werry picter! And there to be sure it
were, a hanging in the werry room as the Citv swells was a dining
in! I couldn't say much about the rest of the party, as I'd never
seen 'em, but the likeness of the Driver was werry striking. Of
coarse jest a leetle bit felattering, but they allers is, or in coarse we
shoodn t buy 'em.
Well, that wasn't a bad story jest to begin with, but I think he
even beat that afterwards, wen he told em that all the hammvtoor
Coaching swells once guv a grand dinner to all the Purfeshnals, at
the Bell Savage on Ludget Hill. His Father, who was a Purfeshnal,
wasn't well enuff to go, so he said to his son, says he, "You shall go
insted of me, Peter,"—which was his name,—" but, wotever you
do, don't get drunk!" Werry wise and frendly adwise, but,
unfortnetly, offener given than follerd.
The night came, and they all set down, I think as he said about 60
in number, and a rare dinner they must have had, for the Bill came
to fore ginnys a head! Ah, they was sumthink like times, them
was. And what a gloryus Chairman they must have had! He ort
to ha' bin a Sheriff at the werry least. For about 3,o'Cl~'l'*iT','

"CLASS" LEGISLATION.
(Further Correspondence.)
Sib,—Look here, the sooner first and second-class travellers dis-
appear altogether the better. Nobody wants 'em. Take my word for
it, if the big Companies only know what
they are about, they will take pretty sharp
to running nothing but third-class trains.
The fares should be tidy cheap, say at the
rate of a farthing for five miles. But what
would be the upshot? Why, such a blessed
influx of traffic that they would hardly be
able to meet it. Talk of dividends, why
the prospect ought to make the shareholders'
mouths water, for the big bulk that
never travel at all would be on the move
like one o'clock, and every loafer from
Seven Dials, and the whole of the Un-
employed would be all cutting up North—or anywhere else on the
spree with, Yours hopefully, A Whttechapel Rover.
Sir,—That the first-class traveller is very hardly treated by the
Companies there cannot, I think, be any question. Take my case.
On a recent journey I had positively to share a whole compartment
with a fellow passenger, ana this though I had paid my fare and had
certainly a right to expeot an entire one to myself. As to second and
third-class carriages, they ought, of course^ to be abolished, with a
view to the provision of fitting accommodation for the patrons of the
first. One first-olass passenger to a compartment would give five to
a carriage; some two hundred, therefore, could be conveniently pro-
vided for in a train, say, of about forty carriages. I do not know
how this would work, nor do I care how it would affect the share-
holders' question of dividends, for with these matters I do not think
the patrons of the line have any concern. But I offer my suggestion
with much confidence, and meantime beg to subscribe myself
Yours, &c, Nothing if not Exclusive.
Sib,—If there is one thing that is clear, it is that the whole system
of our railway travelling needs completely revolutionising. Why, I
ask, should the passenger who has to pass eight hours on a journey,
say to Edinburgh, be cut off from the comforts and conveniences of
ordinary life? It is true that in the Pullman sleeping-car he can
have a bed, and make his toilette; but what, Sir, I ask, is this at the
close of the Nineteenth Century? What are the Companies about in
thinking that in providing him with a paltry bed and basin, they
have properly discharged their functions? The idea is preposterous.
Suppose he wishes to consult a doctor or even a solicitor en route, why
should he not be able to do so? He might even wish to take lessons
in dancing, or have a tooth extracted. No train ought, thereforel to
start that is not accompanied by a duly qualified doctor, dentist,
attorney, and dancing-master.
There should also be a swimming-bath attached to it. And it should
contain a full and complete reference-library, while drawing-rooms,
dining-rooms, private sitting-rooms, stores, saloons for private
theatricals, and an ample gymnasium, should be at the disposition
of all the passengers. Nor is this all. Some may like music. For
these a brass band should be provided; and, as many passengers
may desire some sort of recreation en route, no thoroughly equipped
train should be started unless provided with a troupe of acrobats,
and all the attractive features of a Variety Entertainment. A train
made up on such principles could not fail to secure the patronage of
the travelling public; and Directors will bo wise in their generation
who cheerfully incur the outlay necessary to the instalment of a
service framed on theso lines. All the Publio ask is, "enough for
their money." That the above, then, would be, on the whole, a
move in the right direction, is the opinion of
Yours, oategorically, Taking it East.
PLAY-TIME IN LONDON.
Scene—A public thoroughfare. Enter a Londoner. He is about to
retire sadly when he meets his Country Cousin.
Londoner. Dear me, who would have thought of meeting you here?
Country Cousin. Why not? The rain has spoilt the harvest.
Lon. Well, I suppose I must take you to see the sights. Come to
the theatre this evening? Co to Toole's—eh?
C. C. Went there last night. Couldn't stand it a seoond time.
Lon. Impossible! Mr. Toole in The Don is excellent.
C. C. Mr. Toole in The Bon! Why, he is "touring." They
have got Pevita, a comic opera, at Toole s. Haven't you seen it?
Lon. Not I. Never heard of it.
C. C. Why, it's been played hundreds of times in the Provinces,
so we sent it up to Town. But I won't go and see it again.
Lon. Well, what do you say to the Haymarket— Captain Swift?
C. C. I saw it when it was produced at a matine'e. Mr. Teee very
clever, as he always is in character parts, but I don't care to go again.
Lon, Well, I will take you to the Avenue to see Gladys and Don
Juan, Junior.
C. C. Thanks, much; but I have seen both and can't stand either.
Gladys begins too soon, and Don Juan, Junior, ends too late. And
strange as it must appear toyou, I seldom laugh at Mr. Righton.
Lon. Strange, indeed! What say you to the Adelphi Union Jack J
C. C. Seen it twice, and can't stand it a third time. It really is
very feeble for a melodrama, and I am tired of trick changes.
Lon. Well, then, there is the Vaudeville.
C. C. No, there isn't. It's olosed; and so is the St. James's, and
the Opera Comique, and Drury Lane.
Lon. Really, you seem to know more about the amusements of
Town than I do.
C. C. Why shouldn't I? To tell you the truth, I am obliged to
fo everywhere. You see, I am so accustomed to country quiet that
cannot Btand London noise; so I go every night to a Theatre.
Lon. What for?
C. C. To get a couple of hours' sleep!

RATION-AL DIET.

A Private Box.
In the interests of economy (which, however, will always be com-
bined with a certain regard to efficiency), the Regimental Regimen
in future to be allowed to private soldiers will be as follows, which
the Military Authorities, who arrange
for victualling contracts, and the Con-
tractors themselves, consider more than
sufficient for the wants of growing
youths, and likely to bring quite a rush
of recruits into the Army:—
First Meal in the Day.—This will
consist of two thin slioes of bread and
margarine—the latter not to be laid on
too thick—with half a mug of shilling
tea and a thimbleful of skimmed milk.
(N.B.—Two spoonsful of this fine ma-
tured tea to every six men.) This meal
will take place at 8'30, and for lack of
any more expressive title, will continue
to be called " Breakfast."
Second Meal.—Dinner, which is to be
served at 1'30. Every soldier to have
one whole ounce of meat, including bone;
but he will be expected to make no bones
about it, should he be unfortunate
enough to receive a portion with no meat at all in it. The good
soldier always tries to remember that if he were engaged in a cam-
paign in a perfectly desert country, and if all the Commissariat and
baggage animals had been killed for food a month before, he might
conceivably be called upon to bear privations almost as great; and it
is the constant object of the War Office to aid the soldier in realising
this particular feature of actual warfare. Two ounces of potatoes
are also to be allowed, but these must be weighed before being pared,
and—if possible—directly they are taken from the ground, when a
g^ood deal of earth is likely to be attached to them. Bread, made of
finest alum and bone-dust " middlings," to the extent of an ounce
per man, to be also allowed. A tea-spoonful of grated cheese on
Thursdays. Suet-puddings on alternate Sundays.
Third Meal—Takes place at 4'30, when, having recently dined,
men are not likely to be hungry, and so to waste the national re-
sources. Pint of tepid tea, with three slices of bread and margarine.
Fourth Meal.—Supper. Should the Contractor announce that he
does not feel able to supply a fourth meal at the figure for which he
has tendered, the Authorities will desire to leave the matter in his
hands, feeling certain that he has the highest interests of the Army
at heart. If they are called upon to choose between starving the
Exchequer and feeding the soldier, or starving the soldier and feeding
the Exchequer, they feel bound to select the patriotic alternative.
The above highly liberal and generous scale has been decided upon
after consultation with some of the leading Medical officers at
Reformatories and Workhouses. It is confidently hoped that it will
lead to a great increase in the flesh, bone, and sinew of our recruits;
if, however, it should be found that too much adipose tissue results,
the meals can easily be reduced in quantity, or quality, or both.
Soldiers of a peculiarly ravenous disposition, who really feel that
they could eat something more between 4*30 in the afternoon and the
following morning, will be allowed—after medical examination—to
still the pangs of appetite, by obtaining at the canteen, before going
to bed, two or three drops of a powerful and inexpensive sleeping
draught, which will carry them safely through to next morning's
breakfast. Or, if they choose, they can "recruit" outside in the
nearest dram-shop.
^ BOTICE.—Rejected Communications or Contributions, whether MS., Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any description, will
in no case be returned, not even when accompanied by a 6tampe.l and Addressed Envelope, Cover, or Wrapper. To this rule ft*r9 will be no execution. —

Half-awake Official [rousing himself). Ah! Mr. What's-your
name r Come about that new gun of yours, eh?
Sanguine Inventor. Yes, and this is the twenty-fifth time I've
called about it. Surely, the Authorities can make up their minds.
Come: what do they mean to do about it?
H. O. Well, you see it was to carry twenty miles ?_
S. I. Yes, and go through thirty-six inches of steel plating.

We don't care about such distances and figures.

entirely new departure!
H. O. Yes, but this Department doesn't care about new departures.
It sticks to the old lines.
S. I. But the army that first adopts my gun, will revolutionise all
the conditions of warfare.
H. O. That's just why the Department wouldn't touch it._ It
doesn't want to revolutionise anything. It has got its own principles
and ideas to work out, and it has quite enough to do to keep pace
with them, I can tell you.
S. I. Will you purchase it, or not? You shall have it for £1000.
H. O. Quite out of the question at that figure. But the fact is,
we don't want it at any price. You had better take it elsewhere.
S. I. As you will. I shall certainly take it—to the Continent.

in scientific Continental military circles; and the rumour of its
various excellences at length reaching the Officials of the Perma-

the gun, and so, I suppose, we must have it. What's your figure?
The Representative of Messrs. Middleman. A million and a half;
not a penny under.
H. O. Oh! but come, that's sticking it on rather too stiff. Why,
ten years ago we could have had it for £1000!
The R. of M. M. Very possibly. And you were great fools not

lowest figure. So you may like it or leave it, just as you choose.

a million and a-half for his previous invention, points out that
they are not prepared to negotiate any further for the purchase

OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
Capital number of the Fortnightly; that is, as much as I've read
of it. "Imprisonment for Debt," by Judge Chalmers, should be
studied by
everyone who
wants to get
into debt and
keep himself
out of prison.
I gather from
this article
that impri-
sonment for
debt isn't
^quite tbe
pleasantest
way of spend-
ing a few days
in a recess.
But in his
next, per-
haps, Judge
Chalmers
will tell us
exactly how
tie prisoners
are treated?
Why should
not a caged
prisoner, who
can but won't
pay, be made
to'pay by'settiug him to some work which will bring in sufficient
money to satisfy the creditor and the expenses of his detention?
The literary critic who writes so trenchantly on the Fall of Fiction,
in the same number, ought bv this time to have read Rhedah's
Revenge, wherein I finished off the mighty Riteraggard himself
with the stock-in-trade of his entertainment. Let Mr. Rider Hag-
gard get a new set of puppets, and learn some fresh tunes on his
pipe to which they can dance.
Before changing the subject, I may mention that one of "The
Friendlies" informs me that, in Rhedah's Revenge, I was wrong
in making " Rhinoeen"" the plural of Rhinoceros, fthought I was. I
oughttohavewritten, ashesays," Rhinocerotes," or " Rhinocerosses;"
but then, you see, it occurred to me that "Rhinoeen," having no
existence, were just the very animals that Rider Haggard would
have pledged his veracity as a Romancer that his mighty hunters
had shot. When I come across such solemn affidavits, "I say
g>oh-pooh to him," and my nose, having in it more of the antique
oman than the Greek, becomes rhinocerical." (For which word,
see Dixon's Johnsonary Lathomised.)
The four volumes of Weird Tales have continued to delight me.
There's one by Mr. Edmund Yates, called The Skeleton in the House,
written, a foot-note confidentially informs us, "while he was still in
his twenties,"—which sounds like the British Workman " coming in
his thousands." First-rate vintage " The Twenties,"—wish I had a
lot of them; and this weird tale of Moi Meme's is so racily told, and
with such conviction, that I am heartily sorry he has seen only one
ghost in his life. Or perhaps he has seen a lot of them, and won't
tell. Please E. Y. give us another ghost, there's a good haunted
man, do! 1 've tried all sorts of spirits without effect. Nowadays
I am trying to get one skeleton at all events into my house by con-
jurations of Andrew Clarke, Roose, Thompson, and Banting, by
spells of dry toast, no butter, no white of eggs, no sugar, no starch
(great deprivation this—I was so fond of shirt-fronts fresh from the
wash—quite a ghitton at them), no fat, no potatoes, no pudding, no
sweets, no nothing in fact-and yet the skeleton still weighs fourteen
stone with the flesh on. Would fright do it? I shall go on with
these Weird Tales—one every night at bedtime—and then, "Out, out,
brief candle !" and under the clothes disappears the head of the
Brave Baron de Book Worms.

A propos of some allusion to Pepita, now playing at Toole's
Theatre, we have received a letter purporting to be written by one
of the Managers of this Operatic Company, informing us that " The
B. P. know''—what, he doesn't say—"and" (we quote verbatim)
"their verdict is taken, not a silly paper, and, I am glad to say, we
refuse money nightly." Very magnanimous conduct on the part of
",We." Refuse money nightly! We wish we—" nous autres"—had
the chance. Would we avail ourselves of it? Ahem! Well, we
must at once visit Toole's, and, pro forma, tender our coin? Will
it be refused? or, shall we be let in? And if the latter, shall we be
let in for something good? Nous verrons, "nous autres."

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
August 22.—Home sweet Home again. Carrie bought some pretty
blue wool mats to stand vases on. Fripps, Janus & Co. write to say they
are Borry they have no vacanoy among their staff of clerks for Lupin.
Aug. 23.—I bought a pair of stags'-heads made of Plaster of Paris
and coloured brown. They will look just the thing for our little hall
and give it style: the heads are excellent imitations. Poolers and
Smith are sorry they have nothing to offer Lupin.
Aug. 24.—Simply to please Lupin, and make things cheerful for
him, as he is a little down, Carrie invited Mrs. James to come up
from Sutton and spend two or three days with us. We have not said
a word to Lupin, but mean to keep it as a surprise.
Aug. 25.—Mrs. James arrived in the afternoon, bringing with her
an enormous bunch of wild-flowers. The more I see of Mrs. James
the nicer I think she is, and she is devoted to Carrie. She went
into Carrie's room to take off her bonnet and remained there nearly
an hour talking about dress. Lupin said he was not a bit surprised
at Mrs. James's visit, but was surprised at her.
Aug. 26, Sunday.—Nearly late for church, Mrs. James having
talked considerably about what to wear all the morning. Lupin does
not seem to get on very well with Mrs. James. I am afraid we shall
have some trouble with our next-door neighbours who came in last
Wednesday. Several of their friends, who drive up in dog-carts,
have already made themselves objectionable. An evening or two ago I
had put on a white waistcoat for coolness, and while walking past with
my thumbs in my waistcoat pockets (a habit I have), one man, seated
in the cart, and.looking like an American, commenced singing some
vulgar nonsense about, "I had thirteen dollars in my waistcoat
pocket." I fancied it was meant for me, and my suspicions were
confirmed; for, while walking round the garden in my tall hat this
afternoon a "throw-down" cracker was deliberately aimed at my
hat and exploded on it like a percussion cap. I turned sharply, and
am positive I saw the man who was in the cart retreating from one
of the bed-room windows.
Aug. 27.—Carrie and Mrs. James went off shopping, and had not
returned when I come back from the office. Judging from the sub-
sequent conversation, I am afraid Mrs. James is filling Carrie's
head with a lot of nonsense about dress. I walked over to Gowing's,
and asked him to drop in to supper, and make things pleasant. Carrie
prepared a little extemporised supper, consisting of the remainder of
the cold joint, a small piece of salmon (which I was to refuse, in case
there was not enough to go round), and a blanc-mange and custards.
There was also a decanter of port and some jam puffs on the side-
board. Mrs. James made us play rather a good game with cards,
called " Muggins." To my surprise—in fact, disgust—Lupin got up
in the middle, and in a most sarcastic tone said, "Pardon me, this
sort of thing is too fast for me. I shall go and enjoy a quiet game of
marbles in the back garden." Things might have become rather
disagreeable but for Cowing (who Beems to have taken to Lupin)
suggesting they should invent games. Lupin said, "Let's play
Monkeys." He then led Qowing all round the room, and brought
him in front of the looking-glass. I must confess I laughed heartily
at this. I was a little vexed at everybody subsequently laughing
at some joke which they did not explain, and it was only on going to
bed I discovered I must have been walking about all the evening
with an antimaccassar on one button of my coat-tails.
Aug. 28.—Found a large brick in the middle bed of geraniums,
evidently come from next door. Pattles and Pattles can't find a
place for Lupin.
Aug. 29.—Mrs. James is making a positive fool of Carrie. Carrie
appeared in a new dress like a smock-frock. She said "Smocking"
was all the rage. I replied it put me in a rage. She also had on a
hat as big as a kitchen coal-scuttle, and the same shape. Mrs. James
went home, and both Lupin and I were somewhat pleased—the first
time we have agreed on a single subject sinoe his return. Merkins
and Son write they have no vacancy for Lupin.

worth. The Tower is not a Tour de force. Down a dirty lane
occupied by vans, carts, and crowds of men,—dockyard labourers
waiting for work towards St. Katherine's wharf. Glad to know
that I have arrived half an hour before the boat starts, as, if an
intending passenger were at all late, and if there were but one
waggon more in this dirty narrow lane, and one cab coming up the
street when mine is going down, to reach the wharf itself in time to
catch the boat would be simply impossible. Not a policeman visible,
no official of any sort at hand to regulate the traffic and clear a way
to and from the point of departure. How the exports and imports
ever get out of these narrow thoroughfares without smashing and
jamming, and loss of life, or damage to limb, and how the passengers
—especially the female passengers—for the various steamboats ever
reach their destination in safety is a marvel to me.
Happy Thought.—Yet this stoppage of traffic is appropriate to
the locality. The Tower and '' the block!"
1 meet Hobson at the entrance to the wharf. He assures me,
as his dear friend, that he is as annoyed as I am about the obstruc-
tion, and especially annoyed on my account. "But look here!" he
exclaims abruptly, adroitly changing the subject, "we've got the
best berths in the ship!" and ne leads the way to the steamer,
almost skipping with delight at his own craftiness in securing these
exceptional berths.
Happy Thought.—The Skipper and his craft.
We nave: so much is evident: but two other passengers are to
occupy the two other berths in the same cabin.
"Perhaps they won't come," I say, with a glimmer of hope, and
relying on the probable obstacles in the narrow approach.
"They're here already," says Hobson, with an air of genial
hospitality, pointing out their overcoats and bags, which I thought
were his own.
"I've taken the two upper berths," continues Hobson, still con-
gratulating himself on his acuteness. "Plenty of air, you see"—
here he opens the port-hole—"and the other chaps are very quiet
fellows. I've seen them. It will be all right. I'm sure you'11 like it."
"Shall IP" I return, doubtfully looking at my berth, which is as
high up and about as roomy as the top shelf of the linen-cupboard
in an old-fashioned housekeeper's room.
Problem. How to get there P Not being a bird, I can't fly up. Not
being a gymnast, I can t j ump up. If there' s no ladder, I must evidently
climb up. I mention " ladder" to one of the officials of the steamer
who looks in at the cabin casually,—ship's officers I think they 're
called,—and ship's officer only laughs and goes away again. Clearly
a ladder is out of the question; it certainly was out of the answer, as
far as the merry but uncommunicative ship's officer is concerned.
Consequently, as I put it to Hobson (who can get into his own berth
as easily as possible by merely stepping on to the top of the fixed
washing-stand when closed, and crawling in at the foot of the bed),
the problem developes itself into two parts. First: How to climb
without grazing my knees and doing myself some serious internal
injury from the effects of which I may never recover. Secondly:
How to climb up without considerably inconveniencing the man on
the shelf below, t>y kicking him on the head, stamping on his nose,
putting my foot on his mouth, or otherwise so alarming him, that,
if asleep, he may wake suddenly, forget where he is, think that I am
a burglar, and incontinently seize me by the leg and bring me down
to the floor, when, unless I am stunned and with both arms and legs
broken, there must ensue a combat of two in which the other couple
must inevitably join.
"You'll find it very comfortable," says Hobson; "the ship is
lighted by electricity,"—as if this would help me to climb up into my
jam-cupboard shelf, or send me to sleep when I get there.—" and
the whole place is deliriously clean and comfortable. Let s go on
deck," he says, in a persuasive voice, and I follow him as he skips
up the companion.
We come upon a communicative passenger, who seems to be an
acquaintance of Hobson's. He informs us that, "This isn't the
Company's new boat. The new boat's much better than this."
"This is a very good boat," protests Hobson, as if it were his own.
"Oh, she's good enough, and fast enough," says the communi-
cative acquaintance'; "but she's old. She's fast, though,"he repeats,
as if being " old and fast" were a recommendation to anybody.
"Ah! she's a first-rate vessel," says Hobson, standing to his
guns, on my account, I am sure, otherwise, I fancy, he would agree
with his communicative acquaintance.
The latter continues, "She's still a good seagoing boat," resumes
the communicative acquaintance, "but she's no breadth of beam.
She'11 roll "—[will she. 0 dear!]—"she'll roll, if there's any sea on,''
he repeats, emphatically, as if lie were drawing our attention to an
inspired prophecy, "she'll roll."
Hobson observes with equal certainty, "But there will be no sea
on." All on my account, I'm sure. I'm afraid his forecast would
honestly be in favour of there being " a sea on."
"You should have gone by the new boat," says his acquaintance.
I cannot help asking him how it is that if the new boat is so perfect,
he. himself, didn't go by it P
'I am going by it, next Saturday," he replies, "I'm only here to
see a friend off." And time being up, he bids us good-bye, and in
another ten minutes he is on the quay, waving his hat, and pitying us.
Observing me somewhat depressed by this information, Hobson is
careful to assure me that, in his opinion, we shall have a capital
passage. True, we are beginning well; but then this is only the
river; dirty, but interesting. We have a considerable number of
passengers. There are three horse-artillerymen, with swords and
spurs, who seem rather out of place on board. There are a few
persons, young men and young women, with sticks, rugs, water-
proofs, umbrellas, maps, guide-books, and hand-bags; a reserved
person in an ulster, with opera-glasses; and three awkward youths
of the superior'Arry type, two ol whom are in a state of perpetual
admiration of the third, who is a repulsively larky young fellow, in
a yachting cap, a dirty-looking flannel shirt, false collars, and
probably false cuffs, with a crimson tie, evidently their leader and
model in waggery; a staid and very stout old Darby and Joan, who
seem glued to their seats, and nudge one another from time to time
when they are passing anything that seems to either of them worthy
of notice; these, with a few more middle-aged quiet couples, a
very English-looking person deeply interested in a French novel
witn the familiar yellow cover, and a High Churoh clergyman with a
moustache, represent the tourist element. All the others, both fore
and aft, seem to be attired in the ordinary top-hat and black coat
of London respectability, as if they had strolled down to the wharf,
come on board by merest accident, and been carried off before they
knew where they were.
Most of these persons at once contract with the Steward for their
meals at so much a head for the voyage, and, should the weather
prove favourable, they take twice of everything on principle. On a
rough passage I suppose the Steward has the best of the bargain.
And he certainly plays his cords well, as the time fixed for the
dinner on board is two o'clock, just as the ship is off Southend, when
bidding farewell to the river, we enter on the real sea-passage.
Happy Thought.—H you want to know what sort of passage it is
going to be, ascertain the number of passengers contracting at so

125
much a head for their meals, and then watch the Steward's face after
Erith. If you see the Steward smiling, beware,—if he chuckles and
rubs his hands gleefully, prepare for squalls—and if he laughs out-
right, disappear to your berth, and make such arrangements as your
past experience may suggest.
Hobson is a capital companion. He is most anxious that nothing
should even have the appearance of any likelihood to go wrong. He
never attempts forced jollity, but, naturally enthusiastic, he has cul-
tivated enthusiasm; and naturally sympathetic, he has cultivated
the art of sympathising. I confess to being very soon depressed,
especially with the probability of nasty weather in view.
The skv appears lowering.
"We shall nave a storm, I think," is my melancholy foreboding.
"Oh, no," replies Hobson, cheerily. That dark appearance is
due to London smoke." And then he dilates on the subjects of
smoke consumption, fogs, chimneys, gas, storage of force, and so
forth. In the meantime, I am watching the clouds.
"It's raining, I think," I say, not liking to be certain, and still
hoping against hope, as I see the marks of heavy drops falling, as if
nails had been driven into the deck at equal distances.
"Rain!" exclaims Hobson, putting on his glasses, and looking
about him with an air of the utmost incredulity at the bare idea of
the possibility of such a thing. "RainP No. 1 think it's the spray
from the engine." And he looks round with a chirpy and perfectly
satisfied smile (being much pleased with his own ingenious explana-
tion), just as a heavy rain-drop as big as a pea hits him sharply on
the tip of his nose. He looks up with an expression of childlike
surprise, as if this were some part in a funny juvenile game, and he
had to turn round twice and find out who had touched him on the
seizing the camp-
There is: it comes

stool and making for cover under the awning,
down heavily.
He follows me with his campstool, and his waterproof buttoned up
—for in spite of the sanguine tone of his consolation to others, he
himself is never without a handy and really serviceable Mackintosh
—and looking round on the people all huddled together like sheep in
a storm, he says beamingly, as if he took rather a pride in this down-
pour, "Ah! that's something like a shower 1"
Then he continues:—
"You '11 see, this will clear the air ; it's just what was wanted—
not by us," he puts in, finely anticipating the general objection, "but
by the atmosphere, ana it will be for our benefit, as we shall have a
lovely passage. Wind S. by S.W.!" he exclaims, in an ecstasy of
delight, turning in that direction; "couldn't be better, dear friend;
couldn't be better!"
"The rain makes the deck so sloppy; that's the worst of it," I
grumble.
"That is the worst of it," returns Hobson, triumphantly; "I
quite agree with you, that is the worst of it; but there's no mud, as
there would be ashore, and in five minutes the sun will come out and
the Captain will send a man with a mop, and the deck will be as
dry as a bone. Look, it's stopped now. And there's a dry place
right in the middle of the vessel, where you will scarcely feel'motion
at all."
We enjoy sunshine for a while. But the wily man with the mop
does'not make his appearance as the clouds are once more gathering.
"Looks threatening," I observe; and I mean it.
"Oh, no," Hobson replies, rubbing his hands gleefully; "when
it begins like this, it's always fine afterwards."
"Rather misty," I say, pointing ahead to a dense grey mist into
which we are rapidly steaming.
"Yes, rather misty," he returns, for the fact is undeniable; but
as he has a good word even for a river-fog, he at once adds cheerfully,
"But what a wonderful effect! Look at that boat emerging from
the mist like a spectre!"
"Subject for Mistier,—I mean Whistler," I observe, gloomily.
"Exactly, dear friend, exactly," he replies, delighted to find me
willing to enter into his artistic views of this arrangement in fog
and smoke. Then he points towards the dense mass of grey vapour
which we are now approaching, and exclaims, "Look!" After
which he throws back his head and folds his arms with the air
of a connoisseur regarding some great masterpiece of Art, and says,
"There! There are wonderful effects! Wonderful! wonderful!"
And, as a wandering black barge slowly emerges from the fog, he
repeats to himself, sotto voce, "Wonderful! Beautiful!" in a sub-
dued tone of the most intense admiration. His tone of unqualified
approbation reminds me of the old Herr Von Joel, who used to go
about at Paddy Green's selling twopenny cigars for sixpence apiece,
and exclaiming, "Pewtiful! Pewtiful! Then, as the clouds gather
thicker and thicker, and the fog becomes more and more dense, he
turns towards me, smiling brightly, and says with an air of conviction
that deceives nobody, "Ah! dear friend, we shall have a very fine
passage."
Hardly are the words out of his mouth than down comes the rain
in bucketsful. '' Thunder," as the stage-directions have it, "is heard
in the distance, and the 'scene [is illuminated with vivid flashes of
lightning." We descend below.
"If it's going on like this "I begin, grumbling.
"It won't," Hobson assures me. "The effects of this storm will
be to make the sea perfectly calm, and with the wind in a rather
rainy quarter, we shall have a splendid passage. You'll see. It
will be beautiful! beautiful! You won't feel even a qualm."
And if I'did, he would tell me that the qualm I felt was the best
qualm in the world, and that a calm would follow on a qualm, and
then, if I were very unwell, he would prove to me scientifically that
nothing could be more beneficial to my general health than this short
sharp attack of mal de mer.
We are steaming down the Thames, with every now and then a
stoppage (the signal " Stop her!" being given by a sharp bell and a
gruff voice, as it appears to me,—a similar method being used to indi-
cate " Go ahead again! "), in order to allow time for various huge
unwieldy barges,—laden or empty, which are generally in charge of
an inadequate crew, consisting of a dirty man clinging to a prodi-
giously long pole, with which he is stirring up the mud, a barking
dog very angry with our steamer, and an unkempt indolent boy,—to
get out of our way and save themselves from being run down or
swamped; and we are rapidly passing landmarks familiar to
Londoners who dine at Greenwich, and many more quite unfamiliar
even to them. I am beginning to feel hungry. Good or bad sign?
"First-rate sign, dear friend," replies Hobson, enthusiastically.
"First-rate! Shows it's agreeing with you." Glad to hear it,
but I have my doubts.

And takes good care the Navy nothing gains?
The System!
What is it hoards up useless stores by tons,
What falsifies on measured mile the runs,
And turns out fighting ships without their guns P
The System!
And what, if peace to war by chance give place,
And bring us and our dangers face to face,
Would launch on us a national disgrace?
The System!
So what should Englishmen, without a doubt,
While yet they've time to know what they 're about,
Destroy, tread under foot, smash, trample out ?The System!
"Homburging Them."—Last season H.R.H. the Prince of Wales
found that all the American Dudes at Homburg were sincerely flattering
him by closely imitating his costume, whatever it might be. But a
genuinely happy thought occurred to H.R.H. He arrayed himself,
so the Liverpool Post informs us, in hideous attire, the like of which
was never seen in Tweed or out of it. The Dudes were done, and
H.R.H. bears the distinguished title of the Prince of Wiles.

THE "IRREPRESSIBLE CHINEE"!
(An expansion and new application of the neatest
of American Nursery Rhymes.)
Ping-Wing, the Pieman's Son,
Was a troublesome chap from far Canton.
Wander he would, and wherever he went
He raised up ructions and discontent.
Like little An Sid, with his " yukakan!"
He "velly much bothered urn Melican man."
Ping-Wing, like little Ah Sm,
Was a cute little yellow-faced Chinee kid;
And, like his compatriot, sly Ah Sin,
He had tricks that are dark and an eye to the
tin:
To scrape and store it afar he'd roam,
But he always wanted to spend it at home.
PrNG-WiNG he could "terribly toil,"
A sleek-faced slave—till he 'd sacked the spoil.
Then Ping-Wing, the Pieman's Son,
Would hook it homeward to far Canton,
And live in comfort and cut a dash
At the West's expense with the West's hard
cash.
Ping-Wing, with his saffron face,
Played it rather low down on the Western
race;
For he worked so cheap and he worked so
quick,
And never resented the snub or kick;
And the West conceived it could play and
rest
Whilst Ping-Wing worked for it. Innocent
West!
Ping-Wing he would wash and scrub,
Whilst the Western male abhors the tub,
He would slave and save, and live urxra rice,
Which to Western molars is not so nice.
So the wise West chortled, and argued thus :—
"This yaller Nigger's a useful cuss!"
But the Western wiseacres didn't quite see
The whole of the game of the Heathen Chinee;
And when they twigged Ping-Wing his plan,
It fearfully flustered the "Melican man,"
And raised no end of a hullaballoo
In the land of the bounding kangaroo.
Ah Sid, when a bee by mistake he got,
Found "um Melican butterfly velly much
hot,"
So the Melican man and the Cornstalk bold
Soon found Ping-Wing was too hot to hold,
And, despite his patience and power of work,
Ping-Wing isn't wanted too near New York.
The Congress found that the Pieman's Son
Had much better keep to his own Canton;
That his shifty fingers and saffron skin
Might suit Hong-Kong or might fit Pekin,
Or any abode near the Chinese Wall;
But were not wanted in 'Frisco at all.
Though Pino-Wing toiled, and was meek and
mild,
Chinese cheap labourers domiciled
'Twixt the Pacific and the Atlantic
Were quickly driving the Yankee frantic.
Diplomacy saw it were clearly best
To speed Pino-Wing as a parting guest.
But Peng-Wing, the Pieman's Son,
Is a dogged critter not easily done.
The wild West wanted his neck in the noose
Of " Heads I win, (pig) tails you lose."
But the Treaty shaped that wish to gratify,
Celestial cuteness refused to ratify.
So Senator Scott he ups, and he,
Like Bill Nye, "goes for that Heathen
Chinee."
The Western World for the issue waits,
But all about the Pacific Coast States
You may hear men singing of Chinese crime
To this newest shape of a Nursery Rhyme:—
"Ping-Wing, the Pieman's Son,
Was a troublesome cuss from far Canton.
He laboured hard, and he lived on rice,
But his tricks were dark, and his tastes not
nice.
He burnt the Convention, and then said he,
'Me wonder whar dat Treaty be!'"
"DOUBLING."
In the case of Woodwobth i>. Sugden,
reported last Saturday, Mr. Justice Denman
is reported to have asked—
"Is Mr. Scoden advertised to appear at both
Theatres to-morrow night?
Mr. Bramwell Davit. Yes."
What a wonderful man! What a mar-
vellous being in whose weird existence the
laws of time and space are annihilated, and
the powers of the Chancery Division have
actually to be invoked in order to restrain
Mr. Sugden from appearing in two places at
once!

PLAY-TIME AT THE HAYMARKET.
Not by any means a model of construction, conventional in its
dialogue and action, with scarcely a line worth remembering, with
only a glimmer of comedy-humour here and there in the characters of
^ Lady Betty and old
Seabrook, and with
one strong dash of
misplaced burlesque
melodrama in the
character of the
Demon Butler,
whose part is con-
siderably damaged
by the absence of
topical song and
dance, d la Leslie,
as Jonathan Wild—
with all these de
fects, and in spite
of them, Captain
Swift is, in itself, a
Drama of powerful
dramatic interest,
and so admirably
acted all round, that
it holds an audience
enthralled from the
Dance of the Victim Master and Demon Butler, as (it rise to the fall of the
ought to be) performed at the T.R. Haymarket. Curtain. The story
is clearly told, and the acting is excellent—herein is the open
secret of its success, for success it must have already achieved.
Occasionally marred by some conventional melodramatic starts—
false starts—which with melodramatic asides of the old-fashioned
"Ha! that face!" or, " Ha! that voice!" "Strange!" "'Tis he!"
pattern,—wrongly supposed to be necessary for emphasising "a
situation,"—Mr. Bkerboiim Teee's Wilding, alias Captain Swift,
is a very fine performance. Certainly, the touching and impres-
sive scene of the farewell in the last Act could notpossibly be better
rendered than it is by Mr. and Mrs. Beebbohm Thee; indeed, the
latter I have never yet seen to so great advantage. I do not think
Mrs. Tree ever succeeds in her make-up" for the stage,—too
white, I should say. But to find fault is easy, to suggest the im-
provement is difficult. There is a great natural charm in Mrs. Tree's
impersonation of the otherwise conventional character of a love-sick,
romantic young lady. The faults of this part are the author's; its
virtues the actress's.
Lady Monckton is heart and soul in the very trying part of Mrs.
Seabrook. She seems to be oblivious of the audience, and actually to
be the character she impersonates. The art is less completely con-
cealed than in that exceptionally finished performance oi hers as the
wife of Jim the Penman. But this again is the author's fault.
As I consider it all round, I must own that I do not remember ever
having seen a piece so lifted above the commonplace and conventional
by the talent of the actors, as is this play of Captain Swift. There
is a jarring note in the scene in Act III., between Wilding and Mrs.
Seabrook, and it is this:—the audience share with Mrs. Seabrook
the knowledge that she is Wilding's mother. Wilding is in ignorance
of the fact; so that when Mrs. Seabrook makes affectionate advances
towards him, the unscrupulous Bushranger would see in this what
Captain Hawksley saw in Mrs. Sternhold's affection for him; that is,
additional profit and safety out of this middle-aged woman's vanity.
The audience, undoubtedly, must take this view of the scene, and so,
when Mrs. Seabrook site on the sofa, and says, in a comparatively
light and airy tone, "Come and sit beside me," there is a titter
through the house just at a critical moment when the scene, which
requires the most delicate handling by the actors, without any help
from the author, can least bear it. I fancy both Mr. Tree and Lady
Monckton will agree with me on this point.
Melodramatic music played throughout the dialogue of this same
great scene in Act III. is, emphatically, a mistake; it interrupts the
action, and distracts the attention, tires the audience, and hence
it happens that the charming song of Mrs. Tree's, subsequently
"heard without," which should be so effective, becomes an anti-
climax. This Act should have ended with the exit of Wilding,
which should have been simultaneous with the last note of the song,
and the fall of the Curtain. The letter-reading is another anti-climax.
Miss LECLERCQ'attempts too much with the very common-place and,
for her, very poor and uncongenial part of Lady Staunton.yrho, after
all, is a mere type of the "confidante," or "Charles his friend," in
petticoats. In make-up, Mr. Tree, Mr. Macklln, and Mr. Kemblb
areperfect.
Having naturally alluded to Captain Hawksley, I would ask why
adapt the well-worn business of the cigar-lighting from Still Waters
run Deep f It was highly effective in the scene between John Mildmay
and Captain Hawksley; it is singularly pointless in an analogous
scene between Mr. Gardiner and Captain Swift.
Since Mr. Toole made The Butler a popular character on the
stage, there has been a run on butlers. Nowadays, no piece is per-
fect without a butler in it of some sort, comic, tragic, melodramatic,
or demoniac. It is this last type that Mr. Charles Haddon has
selected for his play of Captain Swift. Mr. Haddon must have had
butler on the brain,—can he affirm that he Haddon't ?—as the gro-
tesque demoniac character has so little to do with the essence of the
plot, that he may be at once set down as superfluous. This Superfluous
Demon Butler, as impersonated by Mr. Brookfield with genuine
burlesque melodramatic humour, just gives the necessary eomio relief
to the play. When Captain Swift is heard making a bag of himself
in September by blowing out his brains off the stage, it is a pity that
the comic countryman Detective (new type, created and patented by
Mr. Charles Allan), and the helpless old Foozle, capitally repre-
sented by Mr. Kemble (another version of Brother Potter, also from
Still Waters), should not have descended all together by a trap
licensed to hold three comfortably, with the Superfluous Demon
Butler standing over them; and perhaps, if there were room in the
trap for four, 1 should add Lady Betty to the group.
The Demon Butler, who is made up rather after one of the acro-
batic Girards, disappoints every one by not sliding over the tables
and chairs as a genuine Girard would certainly nave done. He
is, as I have said, Superfluous; all the use he can be put to is
to help the Deteotive, and, as far as that goes, the Detective,
"from information received," could get on just as well, even
better, without him. Unless the Demon Butler has a prologue,
an entr'acte topical song and dance, and an epilogue, with final dis-
appearance down a trap-door, he will always be " superfluous " as long
as Captain Swift shall run, which ought to be, and I sincerely hope
will be, for many hundred nights. When the inevitable Country
Company go on tour with Captain Swift, the superfluous Demon
Butler might be played without words by a clever pantomimist, and
called the Dumb Waiter." This would be at once economical and
effective. Every lover of good acting should go and see Captain
Swift, on the recommendation of Jack in the Private Box.
ALDERMANO ITALIANO.
At the Guildhall. Prosecution by the National Vigilance Society
for publishing Boccaccio's " Decameron."
"' The book,' said Mr. Avory for the defence,' had been in publication
for over 400 years, and at the present time there were three copies of the work
in the English language in the Guildhall Library, and about 200 in the
British Museum.' Mr. Alderman Phillips, who had previously mentioned
that he had read The Decameron, both in Italian and English, said he did not
intend to send this case for trial, because he did not for a moment believe that
a jury would convict. The case was then dismissed."—Daily Telegraph.
llather a change fromwhat would probably have happened some forty
years ago, in the good old days of John Leech's and Dicky Doyle's
Aldermen, when there were Corporations within the Great Corporation;
when no Alderman could have been alluded to physically as a
No-body, when Wenison was their Wittles, and Turtle was their
only soup, and like Sir John Fahtaff, they " babbled," not of "green
fields," but of "green fat." In those good old days, had this case
come before Mr. Alderman and Sheriff Guzzler (of the firm of
Boozer, Swillyand Guzzler, Portsoken Ward), the report mighthave
been on this wise :—
Alderman. Eh? D. Cameron? Donald Cameron, of course.
Counsel {explaining). The Decameron of Boccaccio, your Worship.
Alderman. Ah! I didn't catch his title—Donald Cameron of
Bock—what was it? There's a Cameron of Loch Something, and
there's a Cameron in the Ward, a most respectable Councillor and
Vintner.
Counsel {further explaining). No, Mr. Alderman, this is a Book.
Alderman. A Book?—eh? Oh, not Bock. Book? Donald
Cameron, of Bookcadgers, did you say?
And so forth. And then the publisher would have been fined, and
the editions confiscated. And now, "on a changS tout cela," as
the (Belgian Lord Mayor would say, and be immediately under-
stood by more than one decorated Depnty. Did the prosecution
of the Zola translations come before Alderman Phillips? No
opportunity of saying,
in the original French {applause in Court, immediately suppressed
by the usher), and I really do not think that a jury, who couldn't
possibly possess my educational advantages, ought to have a chance
of convicting,—as I am sure they will, if I send the case for trial."
That's the sort of Alderman and Sheriff. "Sheriff thou art, and
shalt be more hereafter!" All hail, Future Lord Mayor! The
expiring Mayoralty wants a few little Italian olives, just to give it
some fillips.

MARRIAGE EVIDENTLY NOT A FAILURE.
Joan (to Darby, who is getting stout). "Let its Tie it for you, Darling."
A SERIOUS QUESTION.
Is it not within the bounds of probability that to the highly-coloured pictorial
advertisements to be seen on almost all the hoarding's in London, vividly repre-
senting sensational scenes of murder, exhibited as " the great attractions of
certain dramas, the public may be to a certain extent indebted for the horrible
crimes in Whitechapel? We say it most seriously;—imagine the effect of these
gigantic pictures of violence and assassination by Knife and pistol on the morbid
imagination of unbalanced minds. These hideous picture-posters are a blot on
our civilisation, and a disgrace to the Drama.
LEGISLATIVE WORK AND WAGES.
In proof that the "Payment of Members." if now legalised, would be no
novelty, "Scaccabius" sends the Times the subjoined extract from the
Exchequer records during the period of the "Long Parliament" :—
"Received by mee, John Merrick, Knt. of Thomas pfaulconbridob, Esq., Receiver
Genl. of the Revenue, the some of ffiftie twoe for my weekly allowance of fower pounds as

Michas. last 1645. By warrant from the Committee dated 26th of October 1645. I say
received £52. "Jo. Mbyrick."
It were superfluous to observe that Mr. Meybick could not even spell his own
name, merely because he appears to have spelt it in different ways. Even the
Divine Williams himself did that. But suppose the Legislature were in these
days to decree the award of pay to Honourable Members of the House of
Commons for their attendance in Parliament, and required them to give a receipt
for the money, wouldn't it be more than possible that some of the Representa-
tives of Labour" (to whom wages might be an object) would pretty nearly
reproduce the deviations from the Dictionary remarkable in the foregoing
transcript? A man's a man for a' that. Of course, a good deal depends on how
much "a' that" might be. And an able but unlettered politician would need
hardly declare, as the principal character in some old farce, when taxed with his
orthography, used to say,— It isn't the orthography that I care about, but it'
that dashed spelling."

THE WOLF AT OUR DOOR.
A Morality from Norse Mythology.
[In the Norse Mythology, the Wolf Fenris (Crime), rages for
food in the precincts of Asgard. Ultimately, the Sword-god Tyr,
loaded Fenris with the chain Gleipner, and thrust a sharp
sword into his mouth, to prevent him biting more. Thus, says
the legend, is Crime, which threatens to corrupt the human race,
bound by the apparently slight fetters of Law, and as the power
of the Wolf was broken by the Sword, that of Crime is kept
under by the awards of Justice.]
Wanted a Gleipner! 'Tis very plain
That the Wolf's abroad and has slipped his chain;
For the ruthless red-f anged savage,
In square, in street, and in sordid slum,
Strikes Justice helpless, and terror dumb
With his cruel unchecked ravage.
Law and Order? The catch-word slips
With ease complacent from canting lips.
The Law that Labour's last mite exacts,
The Order that silence for sorrow enacts,
These claim the world's solicitude;
For Property's timorous, Wealth would tread
In peace ana quiet its wine-press red,
Ana Culture shrinks with a querulous dread
From violence and vicissitude;
But Law alert at the poor man's hest
And Order that giveth the humblest rest,
Are these high matters the soul to vex
Of Statesman Y Z, or Policeman X.?
Could Tyr the Sword-god from Asgard come
To a West-end waste or an East-end slum,
Could he take a stroll when the night falls dark
Through Poverty's pleasaunce or People's park,
What would the Norse-god say P Why this.
"It is fearsomely clear that the Wolf Fenris,
As erst in Asgard olden,
Is 'waked by the moon and wants something to eat !*"
True the Law, in blue, is about on his beat,
But the echo far of his falling feet
At the distant end of the dusky street,
The Wolf doth but embolden.
His jaws are wide, and his teeth are white,
His eye is watchful, his tread is light,
The keen curst creature, a hideous sight!
Alone, or hungrily herded.
His play his death, and nis life is prey.
Nay, bold from custom he braves the day,
In the silent waste or the narrow way,
And snatches sudden whate'er may stray
Beyond reach of the weapon wherewith—they say—
Law's vigilant guard is girded.
That Wolf, in faith, hath a shifting face:
Hunger and lust you may ever trace,
And blood-greed red and ruthless.
But now 'tis a visage of youth; anon
The brute-boy's beetling scowl is gone,
And you shudder and shrink as you look upon
Hag-age, hell-eyed, and toothless.
Nothing of harpy or gruesome ghoul,
That fiction shapes in its visions foul,
Naught of fiendish in form or glance
Dreamed in the broodings of wild romance,
Ever took horror of eviller shape.
Gorgon's rival, Chimsera's ape.
This Protean wolf-maw d creature.
Sullen and sinister ruffian now,
Anon with a wanton yet womanly brow,
Again the monster doth mop and mow
With childish form and feature;
Yet wolfish ever, and wolf all through,
This new Fenris of an Asgard new.
But in sage in ermine, or man in blue,
We scarce discover the Sword-god true,
Our Wolf to seize and shackle.
The " Underground People,"—so it is said,—'
Prepared a chain for their Thing of Dread,
Which, "small and slight as a silken thread,"
Was strong as steel, and heavy as lead,
Which gagged the maw, and which stayed the tread
Of the Fenris Wolf. Wake Tyr from the dead,
Our lupine foe to tackle!
Our " Underground People," whom we expect
To—Tyr would laugh at the word!—" detect,"

"SHE-THAT-OUGHT-NOT-TO-BE-PLAYED!"
A Story of Gloomy Gaiety.
Part I.—Led by the Nose.
I have agreed to write down my terrible experiences. A will
stronger than my own desires it. I can but obey. If I could, I
would refuse. For I had hoped to have done for ever with the
novelist who re-
vels in gore.
Moreover, I have
quite forgotten the
inoidents of the
particular book
that has been

permission," and
then" re-written
and adapted" by
an author, a stage

"She-that-must-be-obeyed."
manager, and a lady with the sometimes frequently-reiterated name
of Clo. My memory is a blank, save that I nave a feeling of gentle
pain, as I indistinctly recall a prosy leader-spouting sorceress, who,
to the best of my recollection, before dying turned into a monkey,
and a man who was called Holly, to give opportunities for the per-
petration of mild puns upon his name, and a terrible bore, called Job.
Ah, yes, I remember the last! A nightmare, a horrible nightmare!
—feebly humorous, insipid beyond conception, stupid to the last
degree f And was I to see all this? Oh, horror! Led by the nose!
Part II.—Heard through the Years.
Let me quickly get through my task. I was in the Temple of the
Drama devoted to this fearsome work. I saw around me faces that
I had seen before. In a large box, apparently inconveniently
crowded, sat, or rather perambulated, a pale person in a pince-nez,
who seemed to take the greatest possible interest in the proceedings.
This pale person in the pince-nez fairly fascinated me, and, when I
was weary of looking at the stage (and I confess I was often, very
often weary), I fixed my gaze upon him. And then a wonderful
thing happened. Whenever I glanced at him, whatever might have
been the provocation—however dull and prosaic and profitless may
have been the dialogue,—I never found him asleep!
But to my task,—a bitter one. I saw before me the interior of a
Palace, that somehow recalled to me Nitocris at Drury Lane. There
was one striking article of furniture, a modern reading-desk, that
seemingly had become petrified into stone for the occasion. Then I
noticed a man called the Keeper of the Queen's Records, and those
Records I discovered were three Deeds, looking with their seals about
two thousand years younger than they were represented to be. Then a
portly person appeared, dressed as an ancient Greek, save that his
arms were tattooed after a decidedly modern fashion. Then came a
gorgeously apparelled dame, who, from her proneness to spout
without danger of interruption (in a tone that might mean a fortune
to a curate reading the funeral service) what Beemed to me to be
lengthy leading articles on more or less interesting subjects, and
from her fondness for, and power of keeping well in the limelight,
I recognised as "the One who must be obeyed." And the lady in
the limelight stabbed the ancient Greek with the modernly tattooed
arms, and the Curtain fell for the first time. It would have been
better for my peace of mind if the Curtain (so far as that evening
was concerned) had fallen for ever! But no; I had to suffer for
hours longer! Suffering to be heard through the years—heard
through the years!
Part III.—Seen by the Eyes.
I was in Holly's Rooms at Cambridge. Holly, I found, wearing a
maroon-hued velvet coat, and puce-coloured black-striped trousers!
And then came the infliction of inflictions! Job, the would-be comic
servant! Oh, how hard it was to bear! How hard! Even now, I
shiver and turn cold when I think of him! They were joined, these
strange ones, by the ancient and portly Greek with the modernly
tattooed arms. This last was now dressed in a rather horsey costume
of the nineteenth century; and then a strange thing happened.
Without contradiction he declared, in spite of his portliness and other
appearances distinctly arguing to the contrary that he was only five-
and-twenty! Then this trio examined a box, and in the boredom that
followed, a feeble glimmer of recollection of having read something
somewhere like it before floated through my weary mind. Then the
trio got on a Dhow of peculiar construction, and there was a mutiny
and the stage became very dark. Then a strange thing happened.
The crew, seemingly with considerable exertion, pulled the ship to
pieces, and then drew a carpet over the remains. And the carpet was
violently agitated, and the trio reappeared in a boat, and in the dis-
tance was the painting of the head of a comic negro! And a sense of
deep relief filled my soul as the Curtain descended and allowed me to
see no more! Oh, the weariness of that which had been seen by the
eyes—seen by the eyes!
Part IV.—Caught on the Cheek.
Then came several hours in the land of Kor. I have a recollection
of a lady wearing white muslin and a serpent, who wandered about
always, always, in the limelight. I fancy she must have spoken for
a very long while. And the ancient and portly Greek in the horsey
clothes and tattooed arms, he, too, seems to have had a great deal to
say. And I recall to mind an old man who got a laugh by calling the
person in the puce-coloured and black-striped trousers "a baboon."
And I have a vision too of some mild dancmg by a small and select
corps de ballet. And then I have standing out distinctly in my mind
the black shadow of the greatest bore of them all. Job! Job! Job!
Oh, the feeble "jokes," oh, the melancholy "wheezes!" And I
know that there must have been several scenes, even if there were
but little action. Stay, did I not see Holly dangling in mid air,
supported by an iron wire attached to a hook? But my mind seems
to nave partly slumbered until I came to "The Cavern of the Fire
of Life. Ah, I remember it well. It was an unusual cavern, and
now and again there was a whistle that somehow or other recalled
to me the joint forms of the stage-manager and the prompter, and
then followed a rumbling noise attended by a puff of steam, that
suggested to me a suburban laundry on a slack washing-day. And
at length the lady (who, I gathered, had lived for more than two
thousand years in the limelight), divested herself of most of her
white muslin and all of her serpent, and disappeared in the fumes of
the suburban laundry. And immediately there was some shouting,
and a pleasantly-fat person in grey rags and a white wig staggered
in from the wings and fell on the stage, and was soon hidden from
view by the distinctly welcome Curtain. And there was applause.
Then a young lady in a costume of masculine cut, walked across the
stage, accompanied by an elderly gentleman. And more applause
followed, and various members of the cast crossed the stage, inclusive
of the lady of the limelight. And then a strange thing happened.
The pale person in a pince-nez, in the apparently inconveniently
crowded private-box, suddenly appeared in the front of the loge alone,
and began to address us. He told us that he believed the piece we
had just sat out with so much weary patienoe would "make, with
a few alterations, an exceedingly fine play," and said something
complimentary about the performance of the lady in the limelight.
And this was the great comio effect of the evening! The speaker
who thus praised the story I was told was the author of the story
himself! Caught on the cheek! Caught on the cheek! "Caught
on "—the cheek!

B. & S.
(Extractsfrom, a Diary oj Travel.)
B. & S. are nothing to drink. So Wilfrid Lawson needn't
to order" any. B. is a rising town on
one side of the Estuary of the Rubble.
8. is a rising town on the other.
B. looks down on S. S. loftily ignores
B. Remember in days of earlier travel
spending some time in town of St. Louis,
U. 8. A. Whiled away breakfast hour by
reading what Kansas papers said of St.
Louis, and what St. Louis journals said
of Kansas. Month, September; flies'
abundant. Coloured gentleman told off
with big fan to every couple in coffee
room; fan always going in one hand,
brushing off flies, whilst dishes served
removed with other. Newspaper controversy
of the day turned on subject of flies. Kansas
papers denounced St. Louis as fly-blown.
When coloured gentleman temporarily removed
flies from surface of St. Louis local journal, I
read dignified deprecation of distinction thrust
upon the city. 'We do not," wrote the editor,
"deny an occasional fly in St. Louis; but there
are times when the outlines of objects in the
domestic economy of Kansas are literally oblite-
rated by the pest. Recently, a citizen of St.
Louis entered the principal hotel in Kansas, in-
tending to take his breakfast. 'What have you
got a black cloth on the table for?' he asked the
Boy. 'That's not a cloth,' said the boy, whisk-
ing his fan. 'That 'a flies.' And so it was."
B. & S. do not indulge in open recrimination .
like St. L. and K. But they think the more.
The favours of the Estuary unequally divided. B. gets all the
water; S. all the sand. B. has high tide twice a day; S. once
a fortnight. S. says there's nothing like sand.
"Water for me, says B. S. rigs up boats
on wheels, and careers madly over the dunes.
B. puts to sea in pleasure-boats, stepping
right off its own sea-wall, and smiles with
aggravating insolence at S.'s argosies. B. has a
park facing the sea, enclosed within jealously
guarded gates, accessible only to lordly residents.
The sun arranges matters so that it sets full in
sight of the park. Only Ireland between B. and
the boundless Atlantic.
"Ireland in the way, as usual," said Claud
Hamilton, who, when Member for Liverpool,
sometimes visited B.
But when it comes to the seasons, S. has the
pull over B. B.
has a summer sea-
son. So has S., and
/7 a winter season into
the bargain. At
B., people lodge.
In S. they dwell.

on his face, says it reminds him of

(Cowpeb was the poet of Whitley's childhood;
clings to him still.)
B. is an agglomeration of lodging-houses; S. is
a congeries of residences. In new part of the town,
every house is detached; everyone has a peaked
roof; everyone is built of red brick; everyone has
a grass plot in front; everyone has a little garden
behind; everyone is prim and clean, and passing
rich on the savings of a well spent life. -™0 of Liverpool
8., though it rather looks down on the summer, since B. shares its
attractions and its advantages, is not above entertaining the day-
trippers. They come in thousands, every day from July through
September. Oldham, Manchester, Wigan, Preston, Lm
Blackburn, Stockport, pour in their tens of thousand
teeming mills. Those that land at 13.. presently take steamer, cross
over to S., and return, grievously ill all the way. Those that land
at S., journey in the same way to B. Four hours they spend at
either side, on sand or sea-wall. A pleasant sight to see. All
dressed in their best. Mother and father, sons and daughters, and
babies innumerable. As different from Margate as East from West.
Quaint in speech, odd in man- . ---^
ner, amazing in dress; all
honest pale-faced working men
and women, sniffing the fresh
air and gazing on the unaccus-
tomed scene with infinite gusto.
S. knows 'Akby not, nor is B.
acquainted with 'Arriet.
''Like to see this, dear Toby,"
said W. F. Lawrence, bowing
gracefully to cheap trippers,
who looked as if they might
possibly be electors of the Abercromby
division of Liverjwol. "Quite a change
from Salisbury Plain, which I am more
accustomed to frequent."
At B. came unexpectedly upon Addi-
son, Q.C., of Ashton-under-Lyne. Adds
the last touch of genial attractiveness to
the place. Pretty to see him standing on
marge of Ocean, regarding its going and
coming with friendly glance. Just the
same nere as in House of Commons.
Addison, Q.C., walks up floor, beaming
impartially on crowded benches right and
left. House smiles back on him, and,
before ho reaches appointed place, and ,
his portly person sinks into seat, murmur "A Constituent, I presume!
of welcoming cheer goes round. So it is at B. Addison, Q.C.,
standing with hands in trousers' pockets, and feet far apart, strides
and smiles on the Irish Channel. Irish Channel returns friendly
gleam of recognition; Addison breaks into ripple of happy laughter;
and the sea roars back a delighted guffaw.
Why this should be I don't know, any more than why Addison, Q.C.,
and House of Commons should always be smiling at each other.
But so it is. B. and S. still divided by Estuary of Rubble, are mo-
mentarily united in happv effervescence wnile Addison, Q.C.,
standing on the prim sea-wall, looks across the Rubble at the yellow
sands.
TYPICAL TOPICAL STORIES FOR THE DEAD SEASON.
BEMAllKABLE INCIDENT IN PALL MALL.


The United Service Club (called by the Members of the Junior
United Service Club " The Senior ") was closed for repairs. Taking
pity upon their miserable position—cold and coffee-room-less—the
Committee of the Atheneeum had asked the Members of the Senior
to become for the nonce honorary guests of the more literary Club.
The invitation had been accepted with avidity, and the staid-looking
mansion standing at the south-west corner of Waterloo Place was
crowded with elderly warriors belonging both to the Army and the
Navy. As everyone knows, the Athenieum prides itself upon its
Bishops. The Primate is, so to speak, the speciality de la maison.
But it was September, and few, very few, of the ordinary Members
of the Athenaeum were in Town. On the other hand, the invited
warriors were present in abundance.
It was in the Coffee Room. An exciting soene was being acted.
A waiter had produced an imperfectly cooked chop. The Generals
and the Admirals were very wrath, and the use of the capital " D"
had become most fashionable. It was then that the Bishop of
entered the Coffee Room, and, listlessly seating himself at a table,
ordered a chop. He was composing a sermon, and was unconscious
of the noise around him. At length the should-be succulent viand
was placed before him. He thrust his fork into it, and found that
it was imperfectly cooked. He was about to utter an exclamation
of anger when the steward interposed.
"Nay, my Lord. Curb your profane tongue. See those inno-
cents. Not before the (Naval and Military) boys 1"
And suppressing an oath the good Bishop gave his blessing to the
warlike throng, who sank on their knees to receive it. Ana it was
at this point I awakened from my slumbers, and found that what
I had witnessed was only a dream!

WOOING THE AFRICAN VENUS-
{Some way after Homer's Hymn to Aphrodite.)

[A Charter has just been granted to the Imperial British East Africa Company. This Company will now administer and develop a territory with an
estimated area of about 50,0u0 square miles, including some of the most fertile and salubrious regions of Eastern Africa.]
TnE force, O Muse, and functions now unfold
Of Afrio's Venus, graced with mines of gold;
Who e'en in Bismajrck lights love's furious
fire,
And makes all men woo her with hot desire.
From all earth's cations, Frenchman, Por-
tuguese, [seas,
From Yankee shores and from all Europe's
Adventurous patriots crowd to seek and share
Love of the Libyan Venus. Three there aro
Whose minds are mainly set upon that love:
The Briton, proud as iEgis-bearing Jove,
Who deems her indevirginate, her eyes
Being black and burning, like her own fierce
skies.

He for her preference will do all he can,
Who never faltered in the face of man.
Shunning not strife, or Mars his warlike hanes,
But much preferring Trade; his artizans
Taught all earth's countries all the Arts that are
Associate with things vehicular.
The Teuton next, a stalwart suitor he,
A trifle truculent, a mite too free,
Holding all things in war and wooing fair,
Hoping tomato cheeks and orange hair,
By force of contrast, may avail to win
The dusky Aphrodite—and her " tin."
Thirdly, the broad Batavian, scant of grace,
Who trusts a luoky "start" in the love-chase
Gives him such lead that they who run from scratch
The lumpy " limit-man " may fail to catch.
Others—the Frank, the Belgian—too there be,
But just as Paris had the choice of three,
So the Black Venus seems confronted now
By three chief suitors.
Swart yet stately brow
To which one wilt thou bend in coy selection?
0 coal-black Charmer, all thy swart perfection
Of ebon-moulded limb and sable hair
To the hot winds of torrid Libya bare,
Witches the world as once, in style the same,
"The aU-of-gold-made-laughter-lovinfr-dame "—
As Chapman after Homes calls her—did
At odorous Cyprus. Lifting languorous lid,
Late late in the world's history thou dost draw,
As did the Paphian when her form men saw,
Snow-white and rose-tinct from the waves arise.
Thou art not snow and rose-leaf to our eyes,
But " tawny-fronted," like the Egyptian Queen;
Yet what strange Cleopatra charms are seen
In thy most opulent blackness, that bewitch
All modern men who would be loved—and rich.
Homer—and Chapman—speak in diction bold
Of " Cyprian Venus, graced with mines of gold."
They write of one—but then 'twas not a man—
"Whom all the gold of Venus never can
Tempt to affect her pacts with god or man."
Well, that was not John Bull, but priggish Pallas-
What man unto thy golden charm is callous,
0 ebon-skin'd, yet aureate Aphrodite?
But stay! Poetic flights should not be flighty

And dower with her profitable love?
Anchises with the Paphian had the pull,
Shall it be so to-day with brave John Bull?
It looks a little like it. See him stand,
Love in his eyes, a Charter in his hand!
Such strenuous wooing is most apt to win
Women of mortal or immortal kin.
The swarthy Siren whom all men desire
Looks on him coyly, yet with eyes of fire.
Teuton, Batavian, Frank will Venus shunt?
Well, Bull at least is fairly to the front.
PLAY-TIME AT THE COMEDY THEATRE.
What the plot of Uncles and Aunts may be, I have
only the vaguest idea. Everybody pretends to be some-
body else, nobody is anybody in particular, but the girls,
Miss Cissy Grauame and Miss Vane Featherston—she
isn't in the least vain, I'm sure—are very pretty and
lively. Mr. Penley, with his wonderful make-up and
his quaint silliness, is immensely funny, but the run is
distinctly limited to Mr. Pen ley; and, with the excep-
tion of the scene between Miss Maria Daly and
Mr. Penley in the Second Act, the situations of the
piece contribute very little towards the amusement of
the audience. There is one perfect piece of acting in
it, unexaggerated, simple, un-selfconscious, thoroughly
artistic both in breadth and in detail, and this is Mr.
W. F. Hawtrey as Bates. And who is Bates t Well,
before answering my own question, let me refer to what
I said last week about a sudden run on Butlers among
our most modern dramatis persona;. "Kettle began it"
—Mr. J. L. Toole began it, and every one knows what
Toole's Butler was. He was, per se, unique, inimitable.
He was a Butler who, as a matter of fact, could only
have been tolerated as an old, attached, and very

eccentric servant, retained on account of long-valued service; as rara an
apis as Sam Welter. But Mr. Hawtrey's Butler is all of the modern
time, irreproachable in costume, quiet, and unobtrusive, Bpcaking when
spoken to, and only volunteering remarks when he is quite sure of the sort of
audience he has got to appreciate them. Even then he flatters the vain, empty-
headed, middle-aged Unole, one of the family, by deferentially laughing at the
latter's stupid jokes. To see him carefully and systematically clear away the
breakfast things, fold the cloth, and walk out with the tray, is a study for all
young Actors whose chance for the future may lie in taking subordinate parts.
Nothing is omitted; nothing is over-elaborated. Watch him when he comes
ly a study for young
in suddenly and finds his master in a most compromising situation with two
young ladies. His bearing at the trying moment is not only
Actors, but a lesson to Butlers of all ages.
Mr. W. F. Hawtrey does not make a grinning idiot of his Butler,—pas si
Bates. And let not only Pa' see Bates, but Ma' too, and the rest of the family,
is the recommendation of Jack in the Private Box.

Monday.—Papers full of the latest tragedy. One of them suggested that the
assassin was a man who wore a blue coat. Arrested three blue-coat wearers on
suspicion.
Tuesday.—The blue coats proved innocent. Released. Evening journal threw
out a hint that deed might have been perpetrated by a soldier. 1- ound a small
drummer-boy drunk and incapable. Conveyed him to the Station-house.
Wednesday.—Drummer-boy released. Letter of anonymous correspondent
to daily journal declaring that the outrage could only have been committed by a
sailor. Decoyed petty officer of Penny Steamboat on shore, and suddenly
arrested him.
Thursday.—Petty officer allowed to go. Hint thrown out in the Correspondence
columns that the crime might be traceable to a lunatic. Noticed an old
gentleman purchasing a copy of Maiwa's Revenge. Seized him.
Friday.—Lunatic dispatched to an asylum. Anonymous letter received,
denouncing local clergyman as the criminal. Took the reverend gentleman into
custody.
Saturday.—Eminent ecclesiastic set at liberty with an apology. Ascertain
in a periodical that it is thought just possible that the Police may have
committed the crime themselves. At the call of duty, finished the week by
arresting myself!

Retirement.
There is a Positive Man on board, with a quiet wife and a
"pocket telescope." The Positive Man is full of information as to
every object of interest on the banks, and is invariably wrong.
"That's Rosherville, 'the place to spend a happy day,'" he tells
his wife, in a waggish vein, pointing out a pier, some trees and houses.
"No, Sir," says a trim-looking fellow-passenger, with an insinu-
ating manner, that's Greenwich. Rosherville is farther down."
"Oh—ah—yes," says the Positive Man, as he takes a good look at

Mist again!
Greenwich, and then exclaims, as if he now recognised it perfectly,
"Of course it is. I meant Greenwich when I said Rosherville.
Then, turning to his wife,—"That's Greenwich, where the Chelsea
Pensioners are." And again he is corrected by the Trim Man, who
has in his hand Dickens's Dictionary of the Thames, which he inva-
riably consults before volunteering any information.
Hobson, in his kindliest humour, confides to me that he is deeply
interested in an elderly Gentleman, evidently travelling alone, who
has not spoken to anyone, and is always taking a few hurried
steps from one side of the vessel to the other, and nervously examin-
ing the banks on both sides through his field-glasses, as though he
were expecting a friend from shore to come out in a boat and join
him. The fnend doesn't come, and the lonely traveller—(there
used to be a piece called The Lonely Man of the Ocean. Can this
be its hero P) —becomes more and more restless every minute.
"It is not easy to distinguish objects along the shore," observes
Hobson, approaching the subject delicately.
The Restless Passenger, still looking anxiously through the field-
glasses, replies slowly,—
"No, it isn't. But," he continues, in a plaintive tone, "I can't
—see—where—the Royal Albert Docks are?
"No ?" returns Hobson, with an air of cheerful surprise, and then,
out of sheer good-nature, he begins looking about everywhere for the
Royal Albert Docks, with the evident purpose, should he find them,
of at once presenting them to the Restless Passenger.
"Ah, surelv!" exclaims the Restless Man, "those are the Royal
Albert Docks*'—and he focuses a block of buildings, and the tops of
a crowd of masts, which he can just see in the distance.
"That's Erith," says the Positive Man.
"Is it?" says Hobson, ready to agree with him, for the sake of
making things pleasant all round.
"No—that's not Erith," says the Trim Passenger, fresh from a
surreptitious dip into his Guide-book, "that's Tilbury Fort."
"There's the Arsenal," says the Positive Man, after a short pause.
"What Arsenal, dear?" asks his wife.
"Why, Woolwich Arsenal, of course," he answers, with an air of
superior knowledge.
"No, that's not Woolwich Arsenal," says the Trim Passenger,
with a short nnologetio cough just to break the intelligence gently to
the Positive Man, "that's Gravesend."
"Gravesend! repeats the Positive Man, scornfully.
"I don't think it can be Woolwich Arsenal, dear," objects his wife,
timidly, "or why should 'Rosherville' be written up in large letters?"
This is a facer for the Positive Man, who growls out " Umph!
Very odd!" and seems by his manner to imply that some one nas
been tampering with the names of the localities just to spite him per-
sonally. Subsequently regaining confidence, from the fact that, in
the absence of the man with the Guide-book, on two occasions his
statements have passed unchallenged, he points out Limestone Works
as the Royal Albert Docks, and is immediately contradicted by a
chorus of bystanders, who, unfortunately for him, see "Limestone
Works" as clearly written up as his wife had previously seen "Rosher-
ville." The Positive Man, defeated, shuts up his pocket telescope with
a sharp click, like the Duke of Wellington on a totally dissimilar
occasion, and walks away. Happy Thought.—He and his telescope
both shut up.
With the laudable desire of diverting the Restless Man from his
monomania about the Albert Docks, Hobson remarks, with an air of
lively interest, "Where are the great Sewage Works? I don't
see them."
"Your nose will be of more use to you than your eyes when yon
come within two miles of them," drily observes a little withered-up,
wiry man, like an elderly Scotch terrier. The ladies eye the
last speaker with a look of intense disgust, and the little wiry
man's observation would be passed over in pitying silence by the
company generally, as if they forgave him this once, and wouldn t say
anything about it if he didn't do it again, but for the youthful
leader of the 'Arries, in grey flannel shirt with sham collars and
cuffs, who comes out with a loud laugh, which is immediately
echoed by his admiring companions, and exclaims,—
larly,— Yes, that was rather thick."
"Yes, that teas rather thick."
It is the first time I've come across the word " thick." It bothers
me. I don't see its immediate application.
The little old wiry Scotch-terrier man evidently understands what
"thick " means, as he takes it in a complimentary sense, and forth-
with fraternises with 'Arry and his band.
"Come and 'ave some lotion, old man," says 'Arrt the First,
patronisingly, to his new acquaintance, who must be forty years his
senior. The sun-dried old chip of a very old block, with wiry
iron-grey hair, replies that "he doesn't mind if he does take a
lotion." Whereupon, all the 'Arry band shout with laughter, and
their leader declares openly that in his opinion the little withered-up
old man is " a thick 'un—a regular thick 'un"; and "this is the
verdict of them all," as following their foreman, the jury of 'Arries
descend the companion, and disappear with their new acquaintance.
"Dinner at two," says the Steward, "when we're off Southend.
You can have anything' now, if you like, Sir?"
Ominous question. Note—or never? No; I '11 wait till two, and
chance it.
A tall, languid person, in a deerstalker and an ulster, whom I
have noticed for some time standing near us, and who, I fancy, is
waiting patiently for the reversion of my campstool,—which he
won't obtain, as 1 carry it with me wherever I go,—observes, in the
patronising tone of a man who wishes it to be understood that he is
accustomed to frequent only the " hupper suckles " of Society,—
"Rather an absurd hour for dinner,—two?"
"Except," I say, "when you 're hungry, and then any hour is a
good hour for dinner."
"And," he continues, without noticing my reservation, and speak-
ing severely at me, as if the hours for meals were of my choosing, " I
suppose, tea at seven, and a heavy breakfast at eight in the morning.
All this sort of thing upsets the digestion. It's impossible to feed
at such a ridiculous hour."
"Ton to two!" exclaims Hobson joyfully, and I am grateful for
the interruption as the languid man is inclined to adopt a bullying
tone towards me. "This is doing you good, eh? Didn 11 say so?
Then as I follow him in his blithesome skip towards the companion,
he pauses, and, as if he had a rare treat in store for me, whispers,
with a confidential chuckle, "I've secured the two best seats at the
head of the table next to the Captain! Aha!" And elated beyond
measure with the success of this last instance of his forethought—all
on my account I am convinced, and not the least on his own—he
trips down the stairs, and in another five minutes the bell announces
feeding time, and the passengers troop in and take their places on
either side of a long table at the headf of which is the Captain, a fine
upstanding middle-aged man in a nautical uniform, who bows
reverently over a huge steaming joint of boiled beef rising out of a
sea of pale turnipy gravy, says grace, in which all those who have
contracted with the steward for their meals heartily join,—and then
he sets to work to carve for his hungry family of sixty persons, and
appears as Captain Cakver, playing the part to perfection until
further notice, which is given by himself only when he is thoroughly
exhausted.
Dinner.—Saloon cool. No smell to speak of. Motion of ship
rather moreperceptible here than on deck; out hunger is a sharp thorn.
Happy Thought.—The test of qualmishness has arrived. If I can
stand this, the biled mutton and bilious sauce," and the strange
manners and customs of some of my immediate neighbours, who
evidently are of opinion that fingers were made, not only before forks,
but before toothpicks, I can stand anything. I do; and what is
more, enjoy the dinner and the Captain's conversation—but not the
manners and customs aforesaid—immensely.
As a precaution, and to make assurance doubly sure, Hobson pro-
poses a bottle of champage. Why, certainly: quite a Happy Thought.
I notice that the languid person who thinks two o'clock a prepos-
terous and absurd hour for dinner, is doing remarkably well in
spite of the absurdity of the idea. As for the "high contracting

parties," the Steward must be a loser to-day, as they take twice of
everything. 'Arkv, from somewhere about the middle of the
table calls out, "'Ere, Waiter!"—this causes a laugh among his
admirers—" tell the Captain I '11 trouble him again." To which the

Captain Carver in Ids celebrated Saloon Enteitainment.
Captain, who, _poor man, is only just commencing his own dinner,
mutters knowingly, "No, I'm hanged if you do! " as with a smile
he beckons to an under-steward to remove the joint and carve it at
the side-board.
"It's not like this when it's rough," says Captain Cakveh, slilv
to us, alluding to the run on the joint. I assent to his remark, with
an Old Saltish sort of sea-dog wag of the head; but I do not confide
to him that "/am not like this when it's rough." Hobson pledges
him cheerily in a glass of dry Pommery, and he acknowledges the
toast, being a teetotaller, in a brimmer of gingerade.
After dinner, a sudden shower of rain compels us to seek refuge in
a small cabin, facetiously termed "the Smoking-Room," where the
atmosphere is, to use 'Arhy's expression, "rather thick."
Here 'Arry and his party are in great force, playing a rubber.
"0 Jee-roo-salum! cries 'Arky, when he loses a trick, where-
upon his admirers roar with laughter.
'Arry has not been giving his best attention to the game, and on
his partner, an elderly, business-like looking man, warning him of
the consequences, 'Arry gives a wink at his companions, and says,
"Steady yerself, Emtly:" which witticism sends them into con-
vulsions.
The wiry old Scotch-terrier-like man is also here, pulling at the
stump of a cigar, closely watching the game, with difficulty refraining
from offering advice, but consoling himself by telling the lookers-on
in whispers what he would have done if he had been in the last
player's place, and by significant shrugs and grunts expressive of his
disapprobation of the style of play generally. 'Arry takes a trick
with great delight, in spite of some mistake of his partner's.
"Ah;" says 'Arry to the latter, " you 're not too thick, you ain't."
"Thick" puzzles me. Presently the wiry old man offers to make
him a bet.
"No, old boy," replies the knowing and suspicious 'Arry, "you 're
too thick for me." And his companions shout with laughter.
"When one of his opponents at whist is rather slower than usual in
dealing, 'Arry calls out "Time!" and subsequently requests him,
if he has dealt himself a good hand, to "Walk round and show his
muscle." Fortune favours 'Arry with first-rate trumps,—and
Arry triumphantly coming down with his Ace says:
"'Ow's that for kitchen soup?"
Immense delight of the 'Any Gallery, which is raised to the
highest pitch when he throws down the Queen of Trumps, and in a
sort of tune sings:—
"That's a Beau-ty! that's a Beau-ty!"
When he and his partner ultimately win the game, he leads a
chorus in which all his companions heartily join, and the purport of
which, as far as I can catch the words, seems to be a tuneful expres-
sion of a wish, addressed to some imaginary butcher by an intending
customer, to be informed as to the market price of liver, and a further
demand of a like nature as to the current quotation of kidneys.
There being no more rain, this is the last I see of 'Arry and his
comrades, until next morning when they complain of headache and
evince an inordinate passion for kippered herrings, and boiling hot tea.
We are standing well out to sea. Daylight and the coast-line are
disappearing.
"Now! cries Hobson, who is in ecstasies at the verification of
all his prophecies about the state of my health, and the excellence of
the passage. "Now!" he cries, extending his right arm towards
the horizon, and then turning towards me as if the supreme moment
had arrived when he must unburden himself of a tremendous secret,
"Now, dear friend, there is absolutely nothing between'you"—he
emphasises this with his left hano—"and the North Pole!"
Whereupon he takes one step back, folds his arms, and interro-
gates me with a searching regard, as if he were suspicions of my
still concealing something from him, and so by my reticence com-
pelling him to believe that there is something between me and the
North Pole!
It's a fearful charge,—worse than being accused of disrespect for
the Equator,—and I assure him that as far as I know, there is nothing
whatever between me and the North Pole. And so we sit on deck,
chatting, and congratulating ourselves on its being one of the most
lovely nights we've seen for a very long time.
Hobson delighted. Didn't he tell me it would be a perfect
passage? The lights ashore become few, and far between, and
gradually disappear entirely. Mysterious lights, now green, now
red, approach us, and the Look-out Man, and the Captain, and the
Man at the Wheel, keep up a trio of an hour's duration, led always
by the first-mentioned as tenor, followed up by the Captain as
baritone, and finished by the steersman as basso-profondo.
It must be very annoying for the Look-out Man, who never
announces any discovery of his, such as "Light on the port bow!"
"Light on the starboard!" or whatever it may be without the
Captain immediately replying "Aye, aye!" in a tone which certainly
conveys that he has seen this danger a-head ever so long ago, and is
perfectly aware of it. Very satisfactory to the passengers to know
they have such a Captain as Captain Carver, whom nothing can
t'seape, but still rather disheartening for the Look-out Man, who
seems to be perfectly incapable of giving the Captain any information
which the latter does not already possess.

"This is doing you good!" exclaims Hobson, surveying me with
pride.
"All right up to now," I say. cautiously. "But suppose it should
change to stormy in the night r
"Not a chance of it," replies Hobson. And we descend to our
Cabin, which, fortunately, is at present unoccupied.
Now, how to climb up to my nest?
AN OPPORTUNITY.
London is always a nice place for equestrian exercise, but just
now, in the "dead season," it you ask What's up?" the answer
must be," Roads, pavements, streets,
boards, red flags, &c."
Quite right, of course, and just
the time of year for it. Only, as
there are workmen digging into the
soil of Kensington Gardens and the
Parks, Mr. Punch, in the interest
of Equestrians generally, would
again beg to inquire why on earth
there cannot be—
First,—A ride under the trees from
Kensington to Bayswater through
Kensington Gardens.
Secondly,—Another ride across
Hyde Park, as a trifling variation
on the monotony of Rotten Row
and the dreariness of the ride be-
tween the Marble Arch, which is
now being "restored," though no
one ever had the audacity to remove it.
Thirdly. Apropos of "restora-
tion," why not restore at once the
soft ride all round the Park?
Fourthly. And why not do the
same in Regent's Park, where the only chance for Equestrians is
about half a mile of " the soft" in the Inner Circle?
Fifthly. Why not open up two or three rides in Regent's Park?
Who objects? There's room, and to spare, for everyone, Pedes-
trians and Equestrians alike, and plenty of space for amusements
of all sorts.
Surely George Ranger, our -35dilcs, and the Police Commis-
sioners, might hit on some plan between them for the benefit of the
Liver Brigades of Light and Heavy Cavalry.

So Crime sneaks to the Slum's seclusion.

Live on death-dealing, feed a loathly life,
On the chanoe profits of the furtive knife.
The robber's mountain haunt, the outlaw's
cave,
Guarded by rooks or sheltered by the wave
From feet intrusive, furnish no such lair
For desperate villany or dull despair,
As this obscene Alsatia of the Slums.
Town's carrion-hordes flock hither; hither

Makes mirth a crackling horror; hither slink
The waifs of passion and the wrecks of drink.
Multiform wretchedness in rags and grime,
Ilopeless of good and ripe for every crime;
A seething mass of misery and of vice,
These grim but secret-guarding haunts entice.

Mt Dearest Blanche, 1276> Park Lane< u> 1888-
In spite of being in Town in the middle of September, I have
had such a good time of it! Oh! I do so wish you had been with
us last Thursday. Well, you must know, dear, that Charley (who
has his long leave just now) persuaded Mamma to allow Florence
and myself to go with him to the Alexandra Palace to see Professor
Baldwin take nis sensational leap. As Charley said, "it was
absolutely rippin'!" It was, really! Mamma would not come,
because, she said, "he might get killed!" "Why, of course he
might," replied Charley; "but that's half the fun of it." He
appealed to us; and although, of course, we were not "cruel," or
anything of that sort, yet we were forced to confess that the jump
would have been rather insipid if taken without risk of danger.
"Just so," replied Mamma—she can be awfully disagreeable at
times. "Then you really go to see Professor Baldwin on the chance
of being present at his immolation."
Well, reasonably enough, this made us both very angry with
Mamma for saying such dreadful things, and all the more deter-
mined to go, so when Charley called for us the next morning, he
found us ready waiting, and impatient to be off. We were both
dressed in white, with picture " nats and long pompadour parasols.
We first tried getting down to the Alexandra by rail. But it was
too awful! Every carriage was filled with three times as many
travellers as it should have naturally contained! You can fancy,
dear, what a terrible crush there was! So then Charley very
wisely got a Hansom, which I confess was a little small for three,
but still much better than the railway. And so we drove down,
enjoying the fun immensely, and Charley making us laugh by
telling us how nearly the Professor was run over by a steam-engine
on one occasion. So ridiculous, you know, dear, not to be able to
guide the parachute, but to be forced to come down in all sorts of
absurd places! And then Florence (who, you know, dear, enlre nous,
makes rather a parade of her sensibility), said she hoped we should
not go too near—not where there was any chance of coming across
anything disagreeable. "Oh," said Charley, "if he does fall, I
fancy he will bury himself in the earth in the tidiest manner possible.
So you need be under no apprehension of seeing anything gnastly."
And at this moment the Hansom cabman put his head at the hole in
the roof and told us that he had heard it strike six, and he thought
it would be better if he pulled up on the brow of a hill we had just
reached. So Charley bundled out and helped us girls to descend.
We had scarcely taken our seats on a rug that Charley had spread
for us on the grass, when up went the balloon with the Professor
danglingtoit. "Oh. I am so glad!" cried Florence. "Theysaidhe
might back out of it by pretending that the wind was in the wrong
quarter, or something silly of that sort! Now I do hope he goes up
two miles! It won't be the least bit of fun unless he goes up quite
the two miles!" Well, I must confess, my dear, I was never so
excited in all my life! Up went the balloon, and we saw the Pro-
fessor getting smaller and smaller until he looked quite like a funny
little doll!" By Jove, he's going to jump!" said Charley, who
had been watching the whole affair through a field-glass. And jump
he did! For a moment my heart stood still. He came down like a
stone. '' Smash, I think," observed Charley, quietly, and I thought
I would not have missed it for anything, as we should have seen all
the affair without any of the unpleasant details. All of a sudden,
Charley said the parachute was opening and he was safe so far.
Of course we girls thought that now all the fun was over. Not at
all. The excitement was next, to see how long he would hold
on. "Bet you a pair of gloves he comes down safely!" shouted
Charley. "Very well," I replied, "I will bet he doesn't!" And of
course I was now doubly interested, as my gloveB depended on it.
Provoking! I lost, and Charley was triumphant!
And now, dear, as I hear the bell ringing for dressing, I must put
down my pen. I hope you will get up to Town in time to see the
Professor take one of his wonderful leaps. Good-bye!
Your own loving friend,' Mattd.
P.S.—We went to see the Roman Sports at the Italian Exhibition
the other day. One thing was very absurd. When a gladiator is to
be killed, they appeal to the Vestal Virgins to know if his life may
be spared. And then the Vestal Virgins point to the earth with
their thumbs to say " No." So absurd1 As if anyone would like to
see a man killed before her very eyes!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Good novel Hartas Malurin, by II. F. Lester. So excitingly
interesting. The character of Hartas himself is finely drawn, and that
of the visionary Bastian might have been imagined and described by
Lord Lytton in such a work as Zanoni, or A Strange Story. I hope
there are not manv Bastians about, as his theories would do away with
all moral responsibility, and necessitate the building of Public Lunatic
Asylums on an extensive scale, and a consequent increase of burden
on the unhappy ratepayer. But Mr. Lester is " only purtendin',"
and "there ain't no such person." I am sorry that Mr. Lester's
heroine should be troubled with a profusion of golden hair: I should
have cut that hair, or dye'd it; and I do not think that the lighted
end of a cigar put into the pocket of a damp coat would set a house
on tire, particularly such a nouse as the author has previously been
at no little pains to describe. But these are mere details. The idea
of the story is decidedly original, and to lighten the tragedy of the
tale there are many touches of genuine humour.
I have just seen Messrs. Barratjd's eighth number of Men and
Women of the Bay, wherein a portrait of Helen Mathers, Mrs.
Reeves, looking as if she were trying to imitate the American
Siffleuse, is between those of Dr. W. G. Grace, the Cricketer, and
Lord Justice Cotton, with a wig which, were he Lord Chancellor,
would be suggestive of the Cotton-Woolsack, but, as he isn't, it is
evidently only an old wig that doesn't fit him. Helen Mathers,
the charming Novelist, couldn't be in better company than appear-
ing thus with Grace and Cotton, typical at once of her literary and
personal charms on the one hand, and of her devoted domesticity
on the other. Well selected.
Also the September Number of Our Celebrities. There is about
Walery's Photographs a soft tone that I've rarely, if ever, seen
equalled. The portrait of Sir Morell Mackenzie this month is
perfect as a print, and lifelike as a portrait. The great merit of
this positive likeness is a "negative one; I mean the absence of
the stereotyped background, in which, as in a cold ancestral hall,
with only one chair in it, to which he fondly clings, stands Lord
Stanley of Preston. The fault of background, in my humble judg-
ment, produces a theatrical effect in the otherwise striking repro-
duction of Lady Lindsay's living presentment. Here we nave the
same baronial hall, the same urn of ancestor's ashes, perhaps, in the
distance, only the chair is different, and there is some drapery intro-
duced with a property cushion for the lady's foot, a Wardour Street
table, and a property vase and book. The entertaining and interest-
ing monographs, by L. Engel are drawn from his usual well of pure
and undefiled ENOEL-ish.
Tracked Out, by Mr. Arthur a Beckett, is, I am informed,
having a perfectly unprecedented sale. It is indeed a weird story.
Yet there is nothing quite new under the sun, as, I think, the weird
author will himself be the first to acknowledge when he reads A Tale
of Wonder, by William Makepeace Thackeray, now republished
by Elliot Stock, in a collection of the Novelist s early writings,
compiled by C. Plumptre Johnson, in which the decapitated Head
tells its own decapitated tale, and the criminal is discovered!! How's
this for High, inquires The Sagacious Baron de Book-Worms.
PASTORAL TO THE "BOY BISHOP."
[The World says of Dr. Jaynb, the new Bishop of Chester:—" He cannot
be said to have made any mark there {i.e., at Leeds)." .... "In person,
he hardly realises one's idea of a Bishop: he enjoys a fair, fresh, ingenuous
boy-like aspect, and owns an engaging frank demeanour." and he
will be, by far, the youngest Bishop on the Bench."]

<-OH, DON'T HE LOVE HIS MUMMER!"
In Mr. Harbt Quilter's Universal Revieic for September, Mr.
George Moore runs a-muck against "Mummer Worship." The
well-worn theme of " the status of the Actor" is to the author of that

"Hut More of More Hall,
With nothing at all,
lie slew the Dragon of Wantley!"
strong Zola-esque novel. The Mummer's Wife,—in which, by the way,
while spades are called something more than spades, there is much
unpalatable truth,—like the proverbial red rag to the bull, or .he
ankles of the timid stranger to Georg e Meredith s " distraught goose."
All that Mr. George Moore has to say about the "Stage as a
Srofession" has been said, without mincing matters, long ago in
[r. Edmund Yates's Time (a Magazine), and in the Fortnightly
Review, in Mr. Escott's time. Mr. Moore wanders away from his
text of Mummer-worship, and needlessly and inconsequently attacks
Mr. Chasles Wyndham and Miss Maby Moore for their Continental
tour with David Gar rick. That Actor and Actress should be
received into "Society " at all "does make him so wild." Well, he
needn't meet them. He can keep aloof from Society, and the loss
will, of course, be Society's.
"Because I have cakes and ale," Mr. Moore seems to say to the
Actors, "therefore you shan't be virtuous." And "you shan't even
be respectable, if I can help it," is his implied determination; for-
getting that "respectability is the homage paid by vice to virtue,"
with which cynical definition Mr. Moore should be satisfied, as
covering all his ground of complaint.
The artistic temperament is innately Bohemian, and it feels itself
ridiculous when attempting to shine with the veneer of bourgeois
respectability. But the ostentatious Bohemianism which Mr. George
Moore considers the proper colour for the Actors to live and die
in, with its inordinate vanity, vulgar self-consoiousness, effected
bonhomie, and flippant profanity, is more repulsively snobbish and
revoltingly caddish, than the best silk-hatted, frock-coated Respec-
tability can ever be.
The craze of Actor-worship is rapidly passing away. Buffalo
Bill's popularity with "Society" hit the histrion a serious blow;
so did the momentary success of the athlete. The fault is in the
Worshippers, not in the object of their adoration. Mr. George
Grossmith laughs pleasantly at the craze in his amusing shillings-
worth, entitled, The Clown in Society.
Let the Actor enjoy himself with his Dukes and Duchesses, his
supper and champagne, and do you, Mr. Moore, enjoy yourself
too, with your "couple of Princesses and a Duchess" (which is
your own modest allowance for yourself "in perspective"), but you
needn't throw stones through the window panes, merely because you
catch sight of Comedians in the Duke's drawing-room.
If the Actor's vanity hungrily craves for recognition in what is
termed " Society-," then, like the little boy in the bath, "he won't
be happy till he gets it." And if that makes him happy, Mr. George
Moore, "happy man be his dole." But why envy him? Why blame
him? Blame Society,—and your task is futile and endless.
The Morning 'Post, last Wednesday, mentioned a "Firework
Drama," by Mr. Brock, at the Crystal Palace. Of course the lead-

A TALE OF ONE HUNDRED CIGARS.
Sir,—The ordinary Englishman may fondly imagine that he can
pass his cherished Havannas, up to, say, one hundred, through that
remarkable institution known in France as the Douane. That's
where he's wrong. He can't! At all events, he can't, if he tries_ to
be honest, as I did, and disclose the fact that his paquet contains
Havanna cigars. As is well known, the French Government is a
paternal one, and in its infinite wisdom does not permit anything
but cabbage, choux, to be smoked in La Belle France. Real tobacco
is considered deadly. However, let me at once proceed to the recital
of the One Hundred Cigars. >,
First week of August I wrote, enclosing cheque, to the Army and
Navy Stores, from Royat-les-Bains, to order one hundred of the for-
bidden fruit, I should say, weeds. By return I get receipt from
Stores, and note to say that "the goods shall be forwarded with all
practicable dispatch." So far, so good. Four days after this I
receive from Monsieur lc Chef de Gare du Nord at Paris the following
most bewildering communication:—
Grande Vitesse 1. Trajlc International. Patois.
Monsieur,—J'ai l'honneur de vous informer qu'il est arrive a
votre adresse, en grande vitesse [observe the sarcasm], dans les
magasins du douane, a la Gare du Nord, expedies par M. Army
Navy {sic), a Londres, les colis ci-apres designes: 100 cigarres.
Vous devrez signer l'une des deux formules ci-dessous, selon que
vous prendrez livraison en gare ou que vous preferez vous faire livrer
la marchandise a domicile par le camionage de la Compagnie.
I do so. Sign the "formule" which permits, apparently, the
delivery of our one hundred chez nous. Alas! how little I knew of
the ways, and means, of the Douane. Daily we (myself and
expectant friends) journey down to the Gare de Royat, "pour
demander si les cigarres [why two r's ?] de Monsieur sont arrives."
"Non, Monsieur, pas de paquet pour vous." Quoi faire 1 Nous
attendons. On a Wednesday in August we receive a billet-doux from
the Chef de Gare, as follows:—
"Nous avons recu votre lettre. Les cigarres etant prohibes, veuil-
lez adresser une demande d'autorisation d'entree sur papier timbre
a M. le Directeur de la Douane pour obtenir l'entree des cigarres con-
formement aux instructions, jointes a notre avis 338 du 11 courant.''
I fly—always with my friends, who are now beginning to doubt
whether I ever ordered any cigars at all, and are rather less generous
with their own towards me than they were—to the post-office to
purchase the cherished "papier timbre." Wearetold," Vous trouvez
cachez le man-hand de labac." Thither we wend our weary way, to
learn that"// n'y en a pas ici. C'est d Clermont (town twenty minutes
by carriage from Royat) que vous trouvez ca. Rue Saint Esprit."
My friends will not quit me, so we all go together. Arrived at
Clermont, we find the marchand de tabac, Rue Saint Esprit, and
are, on payment of soixante centimes, armed with the formidable
papier timbre. So off we walk to the nearest cafe, demand ink
and pen, and indite in our most classic French a humble petition to
the Directeur de la Gare du Nord, d Paris. In five minutes more
it is in the letter-box, and we are wending our way back to the iron
waters of Royat. We feel we require tonics. This ends our labours
on Thursday. Allans! du courage! Enfin c'est toujours possible
que M. le Directeur de la Douane finira par nous envoyer nos pauvres
cigarres.
Seated at dinner on the following Saturday evening, we learn,
to our dismay (a heavy rain-storm is at the moment domg its best
to wash the town away), that the ill-fated cigars have at length
arrived at the hotel, but the well-meaning though officious Con-
cierge has sent them away, because he did not know if Monsieur
(meaning the humble individual who now addresses you, "mot qui
parle ") was prepared to pay the trifling sum of thirty-six francs
duty on one hundred cigars! Having explained that I was ready to
pay double, he secured the cigars; and thus, after much time, labour,
journeying, lamenting, and heart-ache, I was rewarded by the receipt
of my One Hundred Cigars! How sweet was the first one (slightly
damp, it is true), but real tobacco 1 All's well that ends well.
Moral.—When endeavouring to pass a cigar through the Douane,
allow at least a fortnight for the function. Ah! Mr. Punch, 1
know you smoke, like myself, good cigars, and I feel that, in your
kind heart, I shall find some of that sympathy which may soothe my
shattered nerves. Vale, amice! Yours, A Mere Bacca Tell.
"Quite English, you Know! "—We see a new Opera announced
for the 25th at the Crystal Palace. It is an English Opera, Libretto

and the other Irish Members concerned. Mr. Graham appeared for Mr.
Walter and Another. Toby, M.P., Q.C.* (instructed by Mr. Georqe
Lewis, of Ely Place, Holbom, W.C.), watched the case for the Public."—
Morning Paper.
Cut this out of morning paper; great deal more; columns of it;
but don't suppose there '11 be room to print it. Yet a most interesting
case. My first brief. Fancy I
have started pretty well. Feel
the wig rather hot, and always
blushing to find gown nearly slip-
ping off. Observe that Charles
Russell keeps his gown well over
his shoulders, whereas Graham,
when addressing Court, generally
has the collar somewhere in neigh-
bourhood of small of his back.
Suppose they begin that way,
working gown up to the shoulders
as they advance towards Charles
Russell's status.
Everything very agreeable.
Wondered, when I went in, what
the Judges would say. "Is the
old min friendly?" I said to my-
self, looking up at Hannen.
Found he was, very. "When I
said I appeared for the public, he
made me a little bow, and ob-
served, "The case of the public is
in excellent hands." Very nice
that. Felt quite encouraged.
Determined to justify good opin-
ion. Opening presented early in
case. When Graham was asked
whom he represented, he replied,
"My Lud, I appear, with my
learned friend the Attorney-
General, for the defendants in
the case of O'Donnell v. Walter."

"Knocking at the door."
Here was my chance. Seized it with alacrity.
"My Lud," I said, hitching my gown over left shoulder, and
cooking back my wig, as I have observed another eminent (J.C. do,
"interposing as amicus curia, I may observe that my learned friend
is a little inaccurate. Ho says he appears with the Atiorney-
General. May I point out, my Lud, that it would be more accurate
to say ' he appears without the Attorney-General ?'"
"Silence f shouted a person in gown, who, I subsequently ascer-
tained, was called the Usher.
Have a good look at the Judges. Hannen in the middle, sitting
in the chair he usually fills as President of the Divorce Court. A
plump pleasant-featured man.
"Looks," says Charles Russell, "as if he was able to bear with
equanimity the failure of other people's marriages."
On the left Smith, a quiet keen-faced man, who says very little,
but evidently thinks a good deal. On the right Day. Day simply
delicious. Haven't seen anything so lovely for years. Never get
tired of watching him. Splendid figure-head for a ship. Widely
opened, stonily-staring'eyes; uplifted eyebrows wrinkling the massive
forehead; lips slightly parted: moves head slowly from side to side
gazing round Court with air of perpetual surprise. Sometimes looks
up at ceiling, as if wondering what it could be for. Then gaze slowly
lowered to desk, marvelling how the doose it got there. Again,
slowly surveys Court. Think I hear him whispering to himself,
"Dear me! What a lot of reporters!" Looks as if he'd never
attempted a joke in his life, or understood one. What a prize mute
he'd make at a first-class funeral!
Case grows interesting as it goes on. Charles Russell por-
tentously bland. Never loses his temper for a moment. Is so
amiable; must be winning hand over hand. Argues for disclosure
of documents, specification of charges. "Let-us-know-what-we-
have-to-meet," and all that sort of thing. Fancy I've heard all
before in the House of Commons: nothing came of it there except
occasional beating in Division Lobby. Now Hannen gravely listens.
Smith (not Old Morality) twinkles with attention. Day solemnly
nods his head with curious rhythmical action of the mechanical Man-
darin. Seems to be something in it, after all. Graham drops his
gown half an inch lower down the length of his spine, and says the
* The Dog has token silk, and never told his oldest and best friend '.—Punch.
VOL, X0TT|
things the Attorney-General and Edward Clarke used to say in
House of Commons. But Hannen swoops down on him like a falcon:
rather paralyses him. Graham wriggles and wrestles, falters and
stumbles. His face settles into stony pallor, pitiful to see. Quite
sorry for him. Think I '11 give him a lift. Nothing like a word of
sympathy in times like this. Write on slip of paper,—
"Threaten to move for a writ of fi. fa.
Haven't clear idea what writ of fi. fa. is. Fanoy it's a sort of
protest, as who should say, "Fi. fa. shame!" Pass the slip of paper
on to Graham. Eagerly opens it. Reads, and looks back at me.
I nod to him cheerily.
"Try that, old fellow," I say.
Graham evidently doesn't catch on. Paleness deepens. Stares at
me angrily. Put open hand to side of mouth, and loudly whisper,
"Fieri facias!"
"Silence!" says the Usher.
Presently Graham cites at large from case of Brown v. Watkin,
also case of Dike v. Stephen; drifts gently to Shaw v. Smith.
Time seems opportune for creating little diversion.
"My Lud, 1 say, addressing President, "as our time is valuable,
perhaps your Ludship, whilst my learned friend proceeds with
his citations, would favour the Court with your views on the
question, 'Is Marriage a Failure?' Your Ludship's remarkable
opportunities for

I thought he'd say that.
At half-past one, adjourned for lunoheon. A little late in return-
ing to Court. Found the O'Gorman Mahon, v/ith. facias nearly as
fieri as Graham's. Seems he wanted to get in without ticket.
Messenger declined to admit him.
"There's my cyard," said The Mahon, pressing pasteboard on
acceptance of trembling minion. "A frind will call upon ye this
evening."
Inside Court Judges got on a long way. In fact, a few minutes
after, the whole thing seemed to come to an end. Russell got all he
asked for, and, there being nothing more to do, adjournment proposed.

He has stated the case of the disabilities of the French Comedians,

that the other side has any case at all. His book, as far as I am able
to judge from the first volume, ought to be a standard work of
reference for students of the French stage in the Eighteenth Century.
Several Correspondents write to me, asking, where can we procure
those Weird Tales which you have twice recommended? Well, un-
fortunately, there was a rush upon them by friends who promised
faithfully to return them; but instead of keeping their word, they've
kept my books. In the meantime I can only say that they are pocket
volumes, adapted to anybody's pooket,—evidently, by the disappear-
ance of my little lot,—consisting of a collection of very old ghost
stories, English, Scotch, American, Irish, familiar, it may be, to
most readers over fifty, but refreshing even to them, and accepted

"Richard and Francis were two clever men;

Their letters are really the conversation of two earnest men, at one

Hobson, with the agility of a Harlequin, has disappeared by the

arranging my plan of campaign, I find myself humming involuntarily
the air from the Bohemian Oirl, "My berth is noble, and unstained
my crest." But, if I come a cropper over this attempt, my crest
won't be unstained.
One struggle for life ... a clutch ... a kick (if there were any-
one in the berth beneath, how wild he would be—and very naturally
— with my toe within an inch of his nose — but, thank good-
ness, there s nobody there ) . . . a gasp ... a momentary spasm, as
if a sinew had cracked somewhere—(didn't Hamlet's sinews crack, or
didn't he appeal to them to " Bear him up ?"—yes—that's what I
say now, "And you, my sinews, bear me strongly up! ")—whoop I—
and I sink breathless, a confused heap of "dishabilly," on the jam-
cupboard shelf, the bed-clothes disarranged, and the floor littered
with bags and campstools, which the next man who comes in will
have to clear away.
As to re-arranging the pocket-handkerchief which does duty for
a sheet, or doing anything with the
strip of flannel meant to represent a
blanket, I give it up in d<

No—certainly a berth on board a
steamer is not the place where "the
weary are at rest," nor am I at all
sure that it is the place "where the
wicked cease from troubling," as one
of our fellow-passengers, entering in
the dark, and, stumbling over the
campstools and bags, swears horribly.
Happy Thought.—Pretend to be
fast asleep. No connection with bags
and campstools. Oh no! "Confound
them! Who could have put them
there? Infernally idiotic!" Quite
so. Good night!
Fellow lodger, who subsequeni
occupies what I may term the gro'

altogether, as I fancy from his manner, unmalieiously, though it pro-
duces no effect on either myself or Hobson, who are both, like Brer
Fox, " layin' low and sayin nuffin'. After some puffing and wrestling
with luggage, —his own, I hope,—our Fellow-lodger switches off the
light, crawls into his hole, and subsides. We are all quiet,—play-
ing at being asleep,—when the fourth lodger enters, and uses more

bad language in the dark. The effect of the darkness is demoralising.
Then he makes grabs at everybody's luggage, tumbling about as if he
were playing Blind-man's Buff, until the first fellow lodger (on the
ground floor at Hobson's) growls out, " Why don't you switch on the
electric light?" Whereupon the latest arrival, who has brought into
the cabin a curiously blended aroma of tobacco and whisky, guides
himself up to the switch by laying hold of the side of my berth, which
causes me to give a warning kick in the direction of where I think
either his nose or his eye may be, just as a quiet hint that he had

amusement. Once more the full electric light is switched on, and
our friend commences his preparations for retiring, humming the
"Boulanger March," with variations from other sources, and inter-
rupted by occasional ejaculatory anathemas on everybody else's
luggage, and especially on the bags and campstools, which latter,
after barking his shins severely with them, he chucks violently into
the saloon, exclaiming, "Out you go, dash you!" and I feel that
the campstools so addressed are myself in effigy. At last he, too.
crawls, like a wounded rabbit, into the hole in the tree (as it were)
underneath my nest, where I distinctly hear him groaning and
rubbing his ancle. Then, as he has forgotten to switch off thelight.
in a few minutes' time a deep voice from below—it is the voice of
Hobson's ground-floor lodger—asks me, if I "won't mind switch-
ing it off, as it's nearest me." My first idea is to continue my
pretence of being asleep; but, on second thoughts, as there is less
chance than ever of getting any sleep with this light glaring right
in my eye, I uncurl myself very cautiously, somehow, lift myself up
without hitting my head, and extend my arm without falling out,
and once more we are in comparative darkness, and I am having
a final struggle with the bed-clothes.
Morning.—Dear friend Hobson up very early. Wish Dear Friend
would stop in bed. He says he wants to see the sun rise. Evidently
he has never seen it before. He is delighted
that I have slept so
well. I am obliged to
admit that I have slept.
Gradually fellow-pas-
sengers reappear. The
majority look as if they
haa slept in their clothes.

Breakfast.—Marvellous solo performances on fish, eggs, chops,
bread and butter, toast, coffee, marmalade. Poor Steward! Hobson
beams on me when I take a chop. "It's doing you good," he says
cheerily. I hope so, I'm sure. All the contractors being in great
form at breakfast, take twice and even three times of everything.
Happy Thought {except for Steward).—They contract, but they
also expand.
We disembark at Granton. I part with dear friend Hobson, whom
I thank heartily for the pleasant trip, givimg him the credit for the
line weather and everything, whereat he repeats, "I told you it
would be all right." and is uncommonly pleased that I am pleased.
Off he goes to his destination, and as the boat hasjust conveniently
missed the only train that would have taken me to Lochglennie, I am
in Edinbro' alone. Title for novel. Alone in Edinbro'! Remember
to have heard of an eight o'clock table d'hote at the Balmoral Hotel.
At the Balmoral.—I like the name of Balmoral. So proper. A
Tialmasky Hotel would attract a class of customers who preferred a
"Hal" without the "moral." Willing and obliging Hall Porter, with
beaming smile, as if he had been expecting me ever so long and is so
glad to see me at last, fetches my luggage out of fly. Pleasant and
affable young ladies at the bureau. None of your stuck-up minxes
with somebody else's hair piled up on the top of their heads. Oh, no!
nothing of that sort. Agreeable, affable; probably " Scotch lassies."
Old gentleman of florid complexion, with fierce white moustache,
and of an upright carriage suggestive of retired Indian Colonel
(on the stage in a farce with Mr. Toole), or the Master of a Ring,
and wearing a peculiar hat with a brim so crisply curled up at tie
sides that, with a few strings and a rosette, it might suit a Junior
Dean, is standing in hall. Know his face: recognise his ferocious
white moustache. He is the beau idfal of Sergeant Bouncer in Cox
and Box. Being alone in the world just now, I am glad to initiate a
conversation with the Veteran. I am commencing when pleasant
young lady, beaming gracefully across counter of bureau, informs
me in her pleasantest manner, with just a flattering tinge of regret
in her tone—(and without any brogue, so she isn't "a Scotch lassie,")
—that the hotel is full; whereupon, the Hall Porter, still with

beaming smile which has not yet faded away, promptly picks up my luggage,
and is off with it to the fly. His rule is, "Welcome the coming Guest,' and
"speed the parting." The "parting"guest, to him as a rule, must be the more
valuable, and more to be smiled at. Where am I to go? More alone in Edinbro'
than ever! On the chance of some suggestion being made, I address the gallant
Bouncer.
The Veteran replies cheerily in broad Scotch,—The McBounccr,—and I gather
his meaning to be, that, if they haven't a bedroom here, they (the Balmoral
Hotel, that is) can get me one elsewhere.
Ye '11 just taylaphone;" says the McBouncer, turning to one of the pleasant
young ladies, and, on hearing this, she at once sounds a bell to bespeak some-
body's attention. The Veteran evidently possesses some local influence. The
Hall Porter pauses, and the smile, which had almost died out with the removal
of the third bag, begins to beam again gradually. Song to Hall Porter, " O smile
as thou wert wont to smile Before that weight of care," &c. Substitute luggage"
for " care," and there's the ballad complete so far. Shining " Boots"—quite
an " Upper leather "—assists cheerfully.
The McTaylaphone replies that he places the best bedroom at my disposal,
and I accept, I am "bedded out" like a plant, but return to the Balmoral at
feeding time, 8 p.m.
Balmorality Dinner.—Large room. Small tables, so that one can dine quietly
alone, or with three strangers at most. It bcing^ just the end of August, of course
Grouse will be on the menu, and of course, this being Scotland, we shall have
dishes peculiar to the country. I don't know what the dishes are, except Scotch
broth, collops, and haggis—(" The Midnight haggis" mentioned by Macbeth),—
but every country has its specialities. Let s see. Here's the McMenuL
"Potage^—that's French, not Scotch; perhaps they mean "Porridge"—no
—" Consomme" au Prqfttrol" (what on earth's that?) and " Puree aux Navets."
"Navets" not Scotch. I read on: all French, nothing Scotch:—" Sole au
gratin, Merlan frit sauce Tartare—Croquettes—Compote—Bceuf Roti—Agneau,
Salade,"—excellent dinner^but no Grouse!
I protest to German Waiter, who doesn't clearly comprehend. English
Waiter, lively and attentive, recognises the justice of the protest. He, too, is
Alone in Edinbro', for the other Waiters are foreigners. He returns, delighted
to be able to inform me that I can have Grouse, "instead of" Beef. I think the
stipulation somewhat severe, but I accept the terms, though I am not treated
precisely on "the most favoured nation (or ration) principle, as I have to pay
half-a-crown extra. The Grouse being excellent, and the whole dinner good,
I am content. Everything satisfactory at the Balmoral Hotel on this occasion,
but, on my return visit, only the following week, when I am leaving Scotland,
I couldn't imagine that it was the same Hotel.
I entered with a smile of recognition for everyone,
as it seemed only yesterday since I had quitted the place.
But "a change had come over the spirit of their dream."
There was no beaming Hall Porter, only a McSulky, who
growled out something, and disappeared. The genial and
courteous Veteran McBouncer was nowhere to be seen.
The affable and sympathetic Fairies of the bureau were
no longer there, though I fancy I spied one of them with
her pleasant face bent over the ledger, not daring to look
up and smile, for fear of the other three, who, Iremark,
are severe, stiff, and unapproachable. Here was I, once
more "Alone in Edinbro', with a bag and great-coat.
"Can I leave my things here?" I ask of a Boots, who,
instead of answering, dives head-foremost down a dark
passage, and is lost to view. Not the Boots of a week
ago,—New Boots; never did like New Boots; no longer
the polished Boots.
One of the young ladies from the bureau has come
out into the Hall, and is standing with her back to me.
I repeat my question, timidly, I admit, but if I am wrong
in addressing her on the subject, she will, I trust,
graciously correct me. Not a bit of it. "Can I leave
my things here ?" I ask, with the utmost deference.
The unapproachable young lady deigns no response,
but walks slowly towards the other side of the Hall. Her
distant manner chills and repels me. It seems to me as
if I had proposed to her and been indignantly rejected.
I cannot, I dare not ask her another question. I fancy I
catch a sympathetic glance from the eye of the pleasant
girl at the ledger. I feel that, with all the will in the
world to be affable and nice-spoken, she can't do it as at
present situated.
The Head Waiter comes down the stairs. I try him.
"Can I leave my "; but before the words are out of
my mouth he too has vanished with a whisk of the
napkin, and is seen no more.
At last, by going up-stairs to the salle d manger, I
procure some attention from a startled chambermaid, who
eyes me suspiciously, but who kindly allows me the use
of soap and water and a jack-towel in a bath-room, there
being, apparently, no properlv appointed lavatory. What
has come over them all P Is this a bad day with the
Balmoralities?
The dinner at 8 is good enough (no Grouse), but the
Waiters bring and take away the dishes in a violent hurry,
as if they had backed themselves against time to make
so many people swallow five or six courses and have
everything cleared away in half an hour from the
moment of starting. So swiftly do the dishes come and
go that when I am at the second course two undersized
German Waiters are hovering about me with the pudding.
Not out of greediness, nor from any inordinate craving
of the appetite, but simply to show them that I will not
be bullied, and that I positively refuse to do a serious
injury to my digestion merely because they have a match
against time, I determine to take or at least, to order,
twice of everything except the soup.
'Saumon sauce Oenevoise, or Merlan frit?" asks a
German Waiter, bending over me insinuatingly, giving
me the choice of two platefuls. I reply sternly, I will
take Saumon first, and the Merlan frit afterwards.
The German Waiter almost collapses. He cannot believe
his ears. But I mean what I say; and I do take both.
This happens with all the other courses. I pull up at
the JZntremets, of which there are four varieties.
Long before I have finished, all the unprotesting table
d' haters, who yield in a spiritless manner to the tyranny
of their oppressors, have stuffed themselves in a hurry
and been cleared away.

I have anticipated my journey back so as to avoid a
second visit to Edinbro'. At present I am intending to
start to-morrow morning, having wired to that effect to

Other than lurid gleams like marsh-fires
fleeting;
Thither the sunniest of summer days
Sends scarce one golden shaft of gladsome
greeting.
June noonday has no power upon its gloom
More than the murky fog-flare of December;
A Stygian darkness seems its settled doom;
Life, like a flickering ember,
There smoulders dimly on in deathly wise,
Like sleep-dulled glitter in a serpent's eyes.
Yet as that sullen sinister cold gleam
At sight of prey to a fierce flame shall
quicken,
So the dull life that lurks in this dread scene.
By the sharp goad of greed or hatred
strioken,
Flares into hideous force and fierceness foul,
Swift as the snake to spring and strong to
capture.
Here the sole joys are those of the man-ghoul.
Thirst-thrill and ravin-rapture.
Held Dante's Circles such a dwelling-place?
Did primal sludge e'er harbour such a race?
It is not Hades, nor that world of slime
Where dragons tare and man-shaped mon-
sters fought.
Civilisation's festering heart of crime
Is here, and here some loathly glimpse is
caught
Of its barbaric beating, pulsing through
Fair (limbs and flaunting garb wherewith
'tis hidden.
Mere human sewage? True, 0 Sage! most
true!
Society's kitchen-midden!
But hither crowd the ills which are our bane:
And thence in viler shape creep forth again.
Whence? Foulness [filters here from honest
homes
And thievish dens, town-rookery, rural
village.
Vice to be nursed to violence hither comes,
Nurture unnatural, abhorrent tillage!
What sin soever amidst luxury springs,
Here amidst poverty finds full fruition.
There is no name for the unsexed foul things
Plunged to their last perdition
In this dark Malebolge, ours—which yet
We build, and populate, and then—forget!
It will not be forgotten; it will find
A voice, like the volcano, and will scatter
Such hideous wreck among us, deaf and
blind, [shatter.
As all our sheltering shams shall rend and
The den is dark, secluded, it may yield
To Belial a haunt, to Mammon profit;
But we shall reap the tillage of that field
In harvest meet for Tophet.
Slum-farming knaves suck shameful wealth
from sin.
But a dread Nemesis abides therein.
Dank roofs, dark entries, closely-clustered
walls,
Murder-inviting nook*, death-reeking
gutters,
A boding voice from your foul chaos calls,
When will men heed the warning that it
utters?
There floats a phantom on the slum's foul air.
Shaping, to eyes which have the gift of
seeuag,
Into the Spectre of that loathly lair.
Face it—for vain is fleeing!
Red-handed, ruthless, furtive, unerect,
'Tis murderous Crime—the Nemesis of
Neglect 1
The Strikes in Paris.—This Tower of
Eiffel being built by an Eiffel-utin' gentle-
man seems to be productive of nearly as
much discord as its prototype of Babel. A
lunatic project, at best, but the onlv sensible

THE (POLITICAL) PLEASURES OF
MEMORY.
We want, indeed, another Samuel Rogees,
(The dullest, sure, of all poetio codgers!)
To sing in sounding verse, as once did he,
The Pleasures of (Political) Memory.
Oh, joy—if you re a Statesman—justtocaBt
A retrospective glance upon the past,
The pamphlets written in your fiery youth,
And then be told you are not speaking truth;
To chat about the Cabinets you have known,
And then to have this charge against you
thrown,
That your remarks are disingenuous riddles,
In fact, that you are telling taradiddles!
0 Memory, friend of philosophic age!
You seem to put our Statesmen in a rage.
Memory, of course, may be a boon, but
then
There seem as many memories as men;
And no two of those memories accord
More than their owners do, which seems
absurd.
They won't agree in style at all exact
About the shortest speech or simplest fact,
Be't yesterday, or twenty years ago;
One vows 'twas thus, another swears
'twas so, [briar,
And, though in speech as bland as a sweet-
Each calls the other an egregious—story-
teller.
Pleasures of Memory f At the phrase one
smiles;
Pleasures of wrangling tabbies on the tiles.
Of scuffling crows over some carrion scrap.
No, Rogers, you need not return, old chap!

THE LONDON BLACKS.
Moore's Melodies at the St. James's Hall are nowadays those played
by the evergreen and ever black-faced Moore and Burgess Min-
strels. The Minstrel Boy never
goes to the wars, as he never per-
forms out of St. James's Hall,—
at least such was once the tradi-
tion. It is now exploded. They
have, we believe, played out of the
Hall, and a cataclysm has not
arrived. On their programme the
title " Christy Minstrels" is not to
be found. Why is this thus?
Are they no longer Christy'uns P
Perish the thought!
On the inauguration of their
Twenty-fourth consecutive Season,
Mr. Eugene Stratton sang " The
Whistling Coon" for the 1135th
time, and the audience, who had
not heard it one thousand one
hundred and thirty-five times,
encored vociferously, but the strict
rules of the primitive Christy'uns
Blackie who never performs do not admit of encores being taken,
out of St. James's Hall. Excellent rule. They should call
themselves'' The Burgess and No-More Minstrels." A propos, where
was Burgess on this memorable occasion? Does Mr. Moore sing for
self and partner? Perhaps Burgess is keeping himself in reserve, and
will burst forth upon us all when the Entertainment achieves its
quarter of a century. Still there must ever be a slight cloud of
sadness passing over the happy faces of the audience at the thought,

that while Moore is working like a Nigger, Burgess is—doing what?
Careering about, enjoying himself? Or also working? Where is
Burgess? Tell me, Snepherds, have you seen my Burgess pass this
way? Depend upon it that when they want a real novelty to
attract all London, they '11 announce
Great Night with the Moore and Burgess Minstrels!
First Afpearajtce of Burgess!!!
They are welcome to this suggestion: but the curiosity of the
public is aroused, and will not De satisfied, except by Burgess.
Plenty of Burgesses in the City of London," Mr. Moore will reply:
but this won't do for us. Loud calls for Burgess! Burgess! and
No Moore at present from Yours truly,
Black Jack in the Private Box.
A LITTLE "CUTTING."
Here is an advertisement from the first sheet of the Times, Sep-
tember 21, which will please Mrs. Lynn Linton, who, "touched
with the spirit of Christianity," is so hard in the Fortnightly Review
on the dear "petite abbSs " of the Eighteenth Century:—
TO NOBLEMEN and others.—A young Clergyman, fond of riding, driving,
shooting, hunting, cricket, and all outdoor sports, would be glad to hear

VOCES POPULI.
AT A HIGHLAND CATTLE AUCTION.
Scene—A Yard. In the open space between the rows of pens the Auctioneer
is trying to dispose of some horses which are, trotted out one by one in the
usual fashion.
The Auctioneer {spectacled, red-bearded, cannv, slightly Arcadian touch
imparled by straw hat, and a sprig of heather in his button-hole). What '11 I
say for this noo? (A horse of a meditative mien is just brought in.) Here's a
heast, and a very (rood heast, from Lochabcr! (The bystanders remain unmoved.)
He was bred by Meester MacFarlane, o' Drumtappit, and ye '11 all ha' haird on
him as the biggest breeder in these pairts. {Heads are shaken, so much as to
intimate that this particular animal does not do Mr. MacFarlane justice.) Trot
him up an' doon a bit, boy, and show his action — stan' away back there!
(With affected concern.) Don't curb him so tight—be careful now, or
ye '11 do mceschief to yourself an' others! (As the horse trots past them,
several critics slap it disrespectfully on the hind-quarters—a liberty which it
bears with meekness.) There's a pace for ye—he a a guid woorker, a gran'
beast—hoo much shall we say for him? (Nobody seems able to express his
appreciation of the grand beast in figures.) Just to stairt ye then—twenty poon!
(Even the animal himself appears slightly staggered by this sum; bystanders
are quietly derisive; Auctioneer climbs rapidly down without interruption
till he reaches six pounds, when he receives his first bid.) Sex poon' is bed
for'm—is there ony advance on sex poon? (Someone in the background:—
"Fifteen shellin".") Sex-fefteen—noo, Meester McRobbie, wull ye no luik
this way? (Mr. McR. responds by a decided negative.) Ye won t? Ah, I
never got ony guid from ye—'cept when I didn't meet ye. (This piece of
Scotch "wut" raises a laugh at Mr. McR.'a expense, but does not affect the
bidding, which still languishes.) Then, he's going at sex-fifteen—for the last
time. Whaur's my bedder at sex-fifteen? (Repentance or modesty prevents the
bidder from coming foricard, and the Auctioneer continues, more in grief than
anger.) Eh, this is too bad noo —I '11 thank no man for
making me a bed, 'cept those that are meant in airnest
No one bed onything for a beast like this! Then I hae to
tell ye ye've not bed near up to the resairve price on it.
(Suddenly becomes weary of the animal.) Tak' it awa'.
(The next horse is led in.) Now, here's a beast that's
well-known, I'm thenkin'. (The general expression
signifies that its reputation is not altogether to its credit.)
There's a well-bred mare—open up, and let her show
hersel'. (The mare is shown, but fails to excite com-
petition.) Ah, ye '11 ony buy screws to-day, an' not the
nice things at a'—tak' her away. (The mare is taken
out ignominiously; Auctioneer, followed by crowd, leads
the way to where a pony and trap are standing har-
nessed). Noo, I'm gaun to pit up the pony an van—just
show them hoo she goes in hairness, boy. (To intrusive
collie.) Out of the way, dug, in case ye get your feet
smashed. (Trap starts off, and is driven out of sight.)
Whaur's the laddie gaun ta? Thenks he '11 show him-
sel' at Nairn, maybe! Ah, here she comes. (Trap
returns at a modest pace.) Stan' back noo, all of ye;
give her room. I '11 sell the mare first, and a beauty she
is—what shell we say? Ten poons—and she's a nice one!
Well, stairt her at five, she may get up. (Bidding gets
up to ten pounds, xchere it stops.) Then she goes at ten,
and I'm very glad she's gaun to a gude auld friend
o' mine—Meester McKenzie, o' Glenbannock. Wull ye
say five mair, and take the hairness, Meester McKenzie?
It's richt hairness! (Mr. McK. declines to be tempted.)
Well, I'm sorry ye wull na, I'd ha liked (sentimentally,
as if it had been the dream of his life) for the mare an
the hairness to go togither and no to pairt them—but as
'tis, it canna be helped. We '11 pass on to the pegs, if
you please. (Passes to a row of pens containing pig*,
and mounts some planks placed along the top.) Now,
these are some proper pegs. (A rush is made for the
rails enclosing the pigs, which instantly become self-
conscious and redouble their grunts). Noo, laddies,
laddies, it's no fair o' ye taking up a' the room i' that
way. I'm quite sure there's a lot o' ye in front that's
no buying pegs—ye hanna the luik o' pairsons that buy
pegs. Stan" by for shame, and don't keep them that
comes to buy, where they canna see sae much as a tail.
Hoo much apiece for these palefaced pegs? Ye've an
awfu' guid view o' them then, Meester Ferguson—luik
this way once again for forrty an' threepence. (Per-
suasively.) It '11 soun' better wi' the threepence. Gaun'
for forty an' three. (The owner of the pigs caUs out
"No ! ") I thocht I made a law here that people having
pegs should gie me the resairve at the time—see what
ye do now, Peter MacPhaihson, make a fule of the buyers
andafuleo' ruysoP !—but (with tolerant contempt) Peter
is not a strong man, wc must no be haird on Peter.

A LIBERAL-UNIONIST BIRD.
The writer of an interesting article on "Birds
of
London," in last week's Saturday Review, quoting the late
Frank Buckland, says that the thrush does actually
sing the following words,—' Knee deep, knee deep, knee
deep; cherry du, cherry du, cherry du, cherry du: white
hat, white hat; pretty Joey, pretty Joey, pretty Joey.'"
Is this bird to be heard in the neighbourhood of Prince's
Gardens, South Kensington? or, if he ever performs out
of London, was he down at Bradford the other day, sing-
ing, with very slight variation, "Knee deep, cheery too,
cheery too, white hat, pretty Joey!" If the London
Thrush did this, wasn't it a Lark!

'ARRY ON MARRIAGE.'
Dear Charlie,
Your larst wos a lark; gave me fits and no error, old pal.
You've 'eard 'Arry was 'ooked after all, and engaged to old Suddlewig's gal?
Come now! who are yer gettin' at, carnt yer? Me
make up to Carroty Meo?
Are you on the mug-lumbering lay, or has someone
bin pulling your leg?
Who give you that orfice, dear boy? It is wonderful
rum, swelp me bob,
'Ow these ere sort o' things get about. Fact is,
'Charlie, I'm fair on the job,
As you know, with the ladies all round; carnt resist
me, the sweet little dears;
But 'ook on to one? Not me, Charlie; leastways,
I should 'ope not for years.
Run in blinkers at my time of life? Try the tandem
with me in the shafts?
Not likely! I likes a short run with the trimmest of
tight little crafts;
Bnt one consort all over the course like, is not
'Arry's form by a lump;
'Ow could you imagine, dear boy, as yours truly 'ad gone off his chump?
Is Marriage a failure, my pippin P "Oh, ask me another," sez you;
"That kibosh 'as 'ad a long innings, and wants yorking out." Werry true!
The D. T. is a regular mug-trap, there isn't a doubt about that,
But you must ha' bin reading it, Charlie, to go and book me for a flat.
"Is Marriage a failure t" old miwies are asking. Of course that depends;
But a dashing young feller like me, with good looks, and good 'ealth, and good
friends, [and nice,
Knows a trick that's worth two on it, Charlie. While life goes on nutty
And the ochre slings in pooty slick, it is blooming bad bizness to splice.
Look at swells! They ain't in no dashed 'urry to church themselves out of
good fun;
And wy? Clear as mud, my dear feller! The cash keeps 'em fair on the run.
When they do get stone-broke prematoor like, as 'appen it may to the best,
Then they looks for a Missus with money, and rucks in along o' the rest.
But the ruck is no plaoe for a racer as hasn't yet parted with pace,
Ain't aged, nor yet turned a roarer, but still 'as a chance of the race.
While a hoss can find backers, dear boy, it will run if it's got any blood,
And when no 'andicapping won't land it, it's time then to go to the stud.
I mean 'aving a run for my money; no 'arness and nosebag for me;
Leastways not at present, my pippin; I like to feel rorty and free,
And the gals likes it too, I can tell yer; lor' bless yer, if I did a splice
D'yer think I should be so much sought for, or found arf as jolly and nice?
Wot mucks me, old man, is the manner in which a chap gets the off-shunt
As soon as he's labelled engaged," and so 'eld to be out of the 'unt.
He may be jest as nice as Jemimer, all flare-up, and everythink fiy,
But when once he gits wot's called feeonsay, the gals jolly soon do a guy!
If this 'ere tommy-rot got about, mate—I mean my engagement to Meg,—
It 'ud spile 'Arry's game with the gals wus than fits or a dashed wooden leg.
No; it's " I'd be a butterfly." Charlie, with me, for a long time to come;
Married life may be ticketed honey, but I know it's more of a hum.
"Spoons" is proper; the best barney out, mate; but marriage—that brings
knife-nnd-fork.
Fancy carving for five, plus the Missus! I tell you, old pal, it means work.
You remember Bob Binks—a rare dasher! fair filberts he wos on a spree,
Now he 'as to grub seven, all told, and he ain't five year older than me.
Met him yesterday, Charlie. "Well Bobbie, 'ow trots it, my topper?" sez I.
"Trot, 'Arry," sez he, "ain't the word; 'ardly runs to the crawl of a fly."
He'd a hapron on, Charlie, and kicksies as must ha' been cut by his wife.
Him as used to sport Kino's best dittos on week days! And that's married life!
"Wot, is Marriage a failure?" I chuckles. "Oh, cheese it, old feller!"
sez Bob,
And—he swore 'twas a cold in the 'ead, but I'm blowed if it wasn't a sob.
"Seven mouths, and six weeks out of work, mate! In Queer Street, and cleared
of the quids!
I should just make a 'ole in the water, if 'tworn't for the wife and the kids."
I stood him a lotion, poor beggar; he'd stood me a lot in his time,
For I was jest fresh on the war-path when Bobbie was fair in his prime.
Great Scott, wot a patter he 'ad, and a mouth on 'im, ah! like the doose;
And now he wears old 'ome-made bags, and can 'ardly say bo to a goose.
"The kids is the crux of the question," says Mrs. Lyttn Linton. In course!
Bobble Binks could ha' told her that, Charlie, and put it with dollops more
She's a-teaohing 'er grandmother, she is, although she's a littery swell, [force.
And as to " the State" steppin' in, yah! the State knows its book fur too well.
If the country took care, of the kids, and diworce was
heed made easy all round,
Wy, I'd marry, mate, early and often, and so would lots
more, I '11 be bound.
But, oh my, wot a mix, my dear Charlie! Free Love
and Free Contract?
my
Oh,
yus!
The Guvment as Grandmother's dear, mate, but wot
would it cost as a Nuss?
In one thing, old pal, I go pairs, with this Mrs. Lynn
Linton exact.
She sez it's a—let'see, wot is it?—a "physiological
fact"
That some chaps who're fair flamers as lovers, are
failures as 'usbands. That's me!
So I mean spooning round like permiskus, and Mrs. L. L.
would agree.
Whether man's poly—wot's it ?—by nature, I'm blowed
if I know, my dear boy,
But a man, if he isn't a juggins, makes fair for one
mark—to enjoy.
If I was a Toff and 'ad tin, I should do as the Toffs do,
no doubt.
Yank on to one gal, a fair screamer, and yet keep my
ogles about.
That's wot I call genuine yum-yum, fair rations aU
round, and no kid;
But it's doosed expensive, dear boy, and not done on a
couple of quid.
Ah! a lot of highflyers is spiked for the want of the
ochre, wus luck!
Wot's the good of a way with the women all round,
when a cove's got the chuck?
No, Charlie, the dowdy-domestic, pap-bowls, p'ramber-
lators, and that
Is not my idea of the rosy, so Meg don't 'ook me for
'a flat.
If it ever should run to a Wife, and—well, trimmings,
perhaps I may marry,
But till I can splice ah lah Toff, - Charlie, no double-
'arness for 'Arry.

PLAY-TIME IN COURT AND LANE.
The Court.—To start her new Court. Theatre, Mrs. John Wood
has achieved a fair success with Mamma. To this success
Mr. Grundy, the ingenuous
hut not obtrusively brilliant
translator, has contributed
very little, as it is obtained
by a combination of con-
scientious acting with a
cleverly-contrived farcical
plot, the construction of
which, however, is not
without its faults. The
First Act is disappointing.
The fun of the Second Act
is rapidly developed by
scene after scene of inge-
nious equivoque. No one
m, could play the odious, un-
principled Mother-in-law
with greater humour than
Mrs. Wood, but she has
scarcely a good line to say,
and the part is against the
sympathies of the audience;
and indeed this is true of all
Is Marriage a Failure?" Ask Mamma at the (,nara(.tcr8 in the piece,
the Court Theatre. Mr Hare k not wel,
but his exhibition of abject terror on unexpectedly encountering his
terrible Mother-in-law is absurdly, though painfully, real.
Mr. Arthur Cecil's friends will be pleased to see him "taking his
whack " with the same gusto he used to exhibit at the breakfast-table
in Friends or Foes, only in different way. Mr. Groves, with his
genial manner, is the embodiment of The Groves of Blarney. The
scene between Mr. Eric Lewis and Mr. Hake, in the last Act, is one
of the best played in the piece. The climax of each Act is unsatis-
factory,—more markedly so in the translation than in the original.
A gentleman striking a lady is unpleasant, and besides this there is
another smack, a smack of Btale Divorce Court garlick; and this,
if only as a mere soupcon breathed over the farcical ingredients of
the comic salad, is just enough to impair the thorough heartiness
of the merriment with which a piece of genuine though extravagant
fun should be received. It is the irony of fate that anyone hearing
the proverbial name of Grundy should be responsible for the English
rechauffe of this essentially French dish.
The Lane.—The Armada is a difficult subject to tackle dramatically.
Drukiolascs and Hamiltonius have tackled it. The play is a series
of stirring pictures of life and character in the sixteenth century,

impersonation of her. I am sorry we did not see the elderly Virgin
Queen—verrin' on fifty-eight—riding, like the Old Lady of Banbury,
on a white horse at Tilbury Fort.
Mr. Leonard Boyne is gay and gallant as the naval hero, though
the authors have made a grave mistake in not giving to him the line
spoken by Lord Burleigh or Sir Francis Waleingham, who in reply
to a patriotic speech from Elizabeth, exclaims, ""lis yourself that
speaks!" This with " Sure," to begin with, and "bedad" to finish
with, would
have brought
down the house.
Mr. Boyne's
speech at Old
Cheering Cross is
capitally given.
That thorough

tor, Mr. Harky
Nicholls, who is
never so much
at home as in
Shakspearian
characters, per-
fectly revels in
the part of a
Cockney of the
sixteenth cen-
tury. His song
on hoard ship is
a specimen of
real racy Eliza-
bethan humour.
I regret he did
not give us a
solo version of
the duet in the
Pantomime,
"Marry come
up! Forsooth!
Go to.'" which he might have sung in the presence of the Grand
Inquisitor. There is a good Servant in Act II., who intrudes
upon his master, Mr. Luiqi Lablache, as Don Somebody or other
(Don Qui '<) at an awkward moment, and announces pleasantly
enough, as a couple of ordinary visitors, "Two Familiars of the
Holy Inquisition," all in black—quite "the wholly Inky-sition"
—who have just dropped in, in quite a friendly way, to make
a morning call. However, as their arrival is the signal for the
Scene to finish, they are welcome.
If I were Druriolanus, I should cut out the lines concerning
"Sons of burnt fathers"—(I didn't quite catch it, and I've mislaid
the playbill)—written in Shakspearian blank verse and spoken by
Milton; I should say, well spoken by Miss Milton. The.lines go
for very lit lie, and as to the tableau representing Seymour Lucas's
picture, I do not know what the original went for, hut the replica
goes for nothing. Instead of Seymour Lucas, see less Lucas.
Altogether a splendid spectacle. Ships wonderful. Sorrv Harry
Nicuulls isn't in the sea-tight. When the tireships appear, he might
have come down to the note, and recited " The Boy stood on the
burning Deck," after which, quick Curtain.
Miss Winifred Emery is a charming Actress, creating a great
effect on everybody except the Black Ink-quisitor, who orders her
off to be cremated; from which shock-
ing fate she is rescued by British
Tars, who rob the Spanish Stake-and-
Onionists of their choice morsel just
when "they'd made their little pile."
Miss Emery sometimes becomes quite
Terry-fied in action and utterance, as,
for example, when she jerks out with
a pause between each syllable. "Not—

just now, he would find his chari-
table sympathy considerably exer-
cised, and might possibly refuse to
obliterate the score against some
actors who commit a breach of the
Third Commandment every night,
emphasis gratia, that is merely for the sake of intensifying the
reality of a dramatic situation. If only as a matter of questionable
taste, this growing habit, which is about on a par with Mr. Mans-
field's using a line from St. Paul's Epistles as an .attractive
advertisement for his recent nightmare Drama at the Lyceum, should
be corrected. This is not a ease of the Frenchman's " Man Dieu!"
which is simply equivalent to our " Heaven*!" or '• Goodness me I "*\

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [October 6, 1888.
DUE NORTH.
Arrival— Welcome—Introductions.
Four hours from Edinbro' to Lochglennie, changing several times,
and stopping at Dunblane for the sole purpose, apparently, of lis-
tening to a pertinacious fiddler. '' Trains may come and trams may
go, but he fiddles on for ever." Twenty minutes with a deaf Scotch
fiddler! Away! Farewell, Dunblane!
Lochglennie Station.—In answer to a porter at the gist of whose
question I can only hazard a guess, I say, "Yes, I'm going to
Sir. Budd." Whereupon he immediately returns—
"Eh, then the mash-sheen's here."
The "mash-sheen" (which sounds as if I had como all the way

"The Mash-sheen."
down here to bathe on the sands) is an open car, outside the station,
guarded by a small sprightly man in a respectable Sunday suit,
top-hat included, who might be anything from a small bootmaker's
assistant to a sheriff's officer in good country practice. Not in the
least like an ideal stalwart Highlander in the national costume. Odd.
Nowhere do I see, or have I seen, the national costume. All trousers,
or knickerbockers, and gaiters. Happy Thought.—The national
costume is evidently "more honoured in the breech than in the
observance." Self and bags bestowed in car, which is, I should say, set
on what maybecalled " Very-rough-Sea-springs." Happy Thought.
—Capital exercise for one of the Livery of the City of London.
At last.' Lochglennie Lodge. Little (.'.') Shooting-Box. Big
Shooting Portmanteau, Grand Shooting Trunk! Little! It may
have been little once—as we all were—but it has grown, and the
population of visitors has overflowed into an Annexe about a hundred
yards from the house.
It has been raining all the morning. It has been raining ever
since I arrived yesterday in Edinburgh, but at this moment there is
a cloudless blue sky. A beautiful view of plain, valley, river, and
heather-covered hills. Not a soul about. Driver is down taking
out bags, and an elderly servant has appeared (no stalwart Highlander
in kilt as yet. Where are they Y—all " kilt entirely ? "), a bell has
sounded, and as if this were a cue on the stage, or a preconcerted
signal, as I have reason subsequently for believing that it is, Johnnie
Budd appears out of a small side-door, a stately Lady walks on to
the chief doorstep, somebody passes her and descends to the garden,
one man with a gun comes out of the Annexe, a third with a fLhing-
rod from out of a shrubbery (why in a shrubbery with a fishing-rod?),
and lastly, before I have time to take it all in, or they all to take
me in, David Baled, D. B., suddenly looks out of a top window,
and, clapping his hands, cries "Now, boys! One—two—three—all
together! ". . . and all together they shout out, "How are you?"
Then they all disappear (including startled horse with cart at a gallop
and little man running after it) as suddenly as they have appeared, like
mechanical figures, except D. B., who romps down an outside stair-
case (such as are common to Swiss chalets), jumps on to the path,
and delighted beyond measure at the success of this well-rehearsed
coup de theatre, grasps me by the hand, and once more exclaims,
"How are you?" Then, in an earnest tone, as if for one moment
he would drop joking, and exhibit the deepest interest in the sUte of
my health, he says, "But "he pauses, and no other way of
framing his inquiry suggesting itself, ne is compelled to repeat, only
slightly varying the emphasis to suit the seriousness of the occasion,
"How are you? But really,"—here he taps me with two finders
of his right hand on my chest—a mode of salutation, he explains,
oustomary between "' The Two Macs' before the row begins," and
once more he inquires—" How are you?"
Before I have time to reply, he continues pleasantly, " You know
my uncle, the Laird," and therewith D. B., introduces me to my host,

The Laird.
a square-built broad-shouldered man of middle height, with healthy
brown complexion, and good working shooting-suit of same colour
to match, with leather over the shoulders, which is more suggestive
to the Cockney mind (my own at the moment) of a Metropolitan Turn-
cock than a Scotch sportsman. Johnnie Budd has an encouraging
smile, but a somewhat nervous manner, as if a trifle uncertain as to
how the new arrival would take this kind of
hearty reception improvised by " D. B."
Finding that I quite enter into the spirit of
the thing — (it's safest for a comparative
stranger to do this at once, as if the way of
the house," whatever it may be, is just exactly
what you had expected all along, and what
you wouldn't have had altered, no, not on any
account)—he shakes hands, a second time,
warmly.
"Delightful place you have here, Mr. Budd,"
I say.
"He's not Mr. Budd here—he's 'the
Laird,'" cries D. B. "Everything here is ' by
order of the Laird.'" And as he says this,
he strikes an attitude, and takes off his cap
reverentially, as I have seen a Russian official
do (on the stage) whenever he has had to
bring in the Czar's name authoritatively.
"The air of Scotland agrees with your
nephew," I observe.
The Laird smiles. D. B. chuckles. I look
from one to the other. What is the matter
with both of them?
"How are you ?" exclaims D. B. He can't
help it. He must start any communication of importance with this
preface, and finish with it too. "How are you?" Then confiden-
tially, "The Laird's not my uncle, and I'm not his nephew. See?"
Here he taps my chest in The Two Macs " fashion—" I call him
Uncle, but he doesn't call me Nephew. At least he does sometimes.
He's only an uncle on the mother's great first cousin's grand-
mother's side. See?" Two Macs entertainment again—"No real
relation." Then he turns to Johnnie Budd, as if for corroboration
—" Are you. Laird.?" To which the Laird, who has been nervously
smiling all the time, and is still rather uncertain as to how I am
going to take it all, replies hesitatingly, as if he hadn't quite made
up his mind on the subjeot of D B.'s affinity to him, "No,—we 're
not near relations. And he impresses the fact on me by adding, "No,
we 're really not."
"No," continues D. B., seriously. "You see I never had any
uncles and aunts to speak of, and so I—your little D. B.—got 'em as
he wanted 'em. When I found someone I liked, I made him an Uncle,
or an Aunt, as the case may be. See?" Two Macs again. "Hullo!
he exclaims—" here's another of 'em!" And, as the very handsome
upright Lady, with powdered grey hair, and a mantilla grace-
fully thrown over her head, whom I have already seen at the
door, advances towards us, D. B. says, "Here's the Good Aunt.
Allow me to present you. Laird's guest, Good Aunt!" and he bows
between us much as the Clown does when he is apologising for
having run full tilt into the Swell's lowest waistcoat button, and
swears he "didn't mean it, 'pon his word of honour!" Where-
upon the stately Lady, with the sweetest smile imaginable, wel-
comes me to Lochglennie, and is about to ask me some question,
when a quiet, very thin, aristocratic-looking gentleman, with
grey whiskers, greyish face, and grey suit to match (very odd:
all the men, I subsequently notice, have Buits to match their
complexions, or complexions to match their suits,—Happy Thought
—so as not to frighten the grouse with too much colour), walks out,
with the puzzled air of a man who has come suddenly out of a cellar
into the broad light of day, blinking like one of the prisoners released
from the Bastille. Before the grey Man from the Bastille has quite
grasped the meaning of the scene before him, D. B. shouts out,—
"Here's another of 'em! How are you? Whereupon the grey
thin man rubs his eyes,—he must have been shut up in a cupboard—
(Can it be the skeleton brought out to meet me?),—and not being
prepared with an immediate and telling repartee, which, I admit, is
difficult to find, smiles good-naturedly at me, and putting out his
hand, as if he were feeling his way along, but really intending
me to shake it, which I do, he says, " Ah! delighted to see you—urn
—how dee do?"
"This," says D. B., holding the skeleton from the oupboard by
the elbow, and. explaining him as if he were a figure in a show; '' this
is the Wicked Uncle, husband of the Good Aunt. His name is Norval
on the Grampian Hills, and one of his ancestors, the McCoLLor of
Collop, had something to do with the murder of M.u;v Queen of
Squats, and he's never been the same man sinoe." All this in a
breath: then he shakes hands with the Wicked Uncle, kisses the Good
Aunt's hand (" Or the hand of the Good Aunt," he says, winking at
me aside, "Ollendorff I "), and beaming on everyone all round, he
votes that " the question be now put," which is—" How are you?"

It now strikes the Good Aunt that I must he hungry, and simul-
taneously it occurs to the Laird that luncheon will be ready in ten
minutes, and that he will show me to my room in the Annexe, where
1 am to be chummed with two other sportsmen. Evidently large party.
"Where's Dolly ?" asks the Good Aunt.
"Dolly?" replies the Wicked Uncle, trying to wake himself up
by taking off his Scotch cap and gently stirring his hair, which is
what theatrical wig-makers term 'sparse,' "Dolly's out with the
Baron, shooting." Dolly and the Baron! Then there are young
ladies here, and a foreign nobleman. Large party. Fashionable one
too. Thought I was coming to a rough-and-ready little shooting-box.
"I haven't seen Nell all the morning," says the Laird, in a tone
of regret.
"She went with Duncan," D. B. answers, "when he was off to
see to the pits."
Aha! all sporting—the young ladies evidently. Dolly has gone
out shooting, Nell nas gone to see about the pits.
"Shall we wait for Grannie to come in to lunch?" asks the Laird
of the Good Aunt, with an air of hesitation.
"I don't think it's much use,",replies the Good Aunt. "Granule
went out driving"
"Oh, no!" interposes the Laird, anxiously; "surely they never
were going to drive this morning—I told Malcolm"
"Ah I " interrupts D. B., " then Granule's gone out fishing a long
way down the stream." _
"Alone?" asks the Laird, who. as I see, is naturally anxious
about the old lady—Ms grandmother, I presume—who must be a
more determined sporting character than Mr. Manton."
"Alone?" returns D. B. "Oh no,—I saw the boy and Ross
carrying the nets and lines."
"Oh, that's all right," says the Laird, quite satisfied as to his
elderly relative's safety. "I'm glad Grannie didn't take the canoe.
It's not safe to fish out of."
"Safe! A canoe for an old lady!" I cannot help exclaiming.
This remark of mine causes considerable amusement. Even the
Laird's quiet smile develops into a genuine laugh. The Skeleton
from the cupboard is tickled too, and repeats to himself, "Old
lady! Aha! that's good!" W. B.'s hand comes down with a slap
on my shoulder as he gives his war-cry of " How are you?"
It is uttered in such a tone of triumph, and the laughter is so
genuine, that I perceive I've made a mistake as to Grannie. At this
moment a hercTilean young fellow, six feet two if he's an inch, with
a comparatively small head—quite in keeping with the herculean
character—on the top of which is a deer-stalker stuck all over with
flies, hooks, and bits of line, as if he had just escaped from a Lunatic
Fishing Asylum, where they would put nooks and flies in the hair
instead of straws, joins our partv. He wears large melodramatic
piratical boots, carries a huge fishing-rod, and is hung about with
straps, leather cases, and baskets, as if he were a pedlar with a lot
of things to sell, and is introduced by D. B. to me as Gbanville
Blunt, Known as "Grannie." Then D. B. surveys the circle formed
by the Good Aunt, the Wicked Uncle, the Laird, Grannie, D. B.
himself, and the boy; and as if it were the cue for curtain and end
of First Act, he laughs all over his face, and exclaims, "How
are you?" which at once disperses the group.
The Laird shows me a deliciomly comfortable bed-room and a
sitting-room in the Annexe which are at my disposal, "commanding,"
as the advertisements say, " beautiful and extensive views." Then
the Laird departs to see about the luu ;h.
Happy Thought.—Put myself au couranl with the company in the
house. "Who are the girls?" I ask. "Girls?" repeats D. B.,
surprised, " what girls? Then, with an air of mistrust, " You 're
joking—you 're trying to get at me—oh, yes"—and he puts himself
on the defensive by resorting to his magio phrase, " How are you?"
He is just off when I stop him, and assure him I'm serious. "Who is
'Nell,' they were talking of, who has gone out with Duncan to the
pits." More laughter. D. B. nearly has a fit, but relieves his feelings
by snapping his fingers, crying "Who-whoop !" and dancing a few
more steps of the Highland Fling; after which performance he stops
to explain that " Nell's the Retriever, and Duncan's the Keeper.
"And what's Dolly? A dog or a cat?" I ask.
"Dolly? Oh, don't you know him? Capital chap—he has the
next room to you. Dolly White, in the Guards. How are you,
Dolly?" he orie3, out, rapping at the partition; to which summons
the immediate response, in a defiant tone, comes back, "How are
you?" "The other chap," he continues—"he's not in now—is
the Baron." Why Baron? "Don't know—always call him 'The
Baron.' Rather think it's because he once went down a coal mine.
There's the luncheon-bell." He pauses at the door, however, as
if he has forgotten to say something of the utmost importance,
and then exclaims, "How are you!"
"Quite well, thank you!" I roar back at him, and he dis-
appears as if I had broken the spell by this happy and truly original
repartee. But somehow, the air is full of, " How are you? and as,
brush in hand, I survey myself in the glass, I stop myself in the act
of saying to my own reflection, "How are you?" This is catching.

ROBERT'S LONG WACATION.
Sutten suckumstances, incloodin a most unnecessary ahundenoe
of rain, combined with a rayther onusual defishency of the currant
coins of the realm—as the loryers ternn what 1 sboud call a werry
near aproach to stuiuptupednesi—in-
dooced me and my fare Partner to give
up our ushal long wacation, this here
yeer, of a hole week at the See Side, or
on the River, and spend it in jolly old
Lundon, the land of my Birth and the
'ome of my blooming manhood.
And upon the hole, I don't reelly
think as either me nor my Partner has
werry much regretted it. In fact there's
so many wunderfool things to be seen

not nothink to pay, and so many bewtifool plaices to wisit, on the same
werry libberal terms, that a week dewoted to 'em flies away like one
a clock, which, as we all knows, don't take so werry long to do;
besides, if one's bound to be wet thru for a hole week, it's far better
to have it at ome than a broad. Fust and foremo?t, then. I wished
High Park, and with the xceptiou as there wasn't not nobody there
xcept me and three other gennelmen and one man ou a horse, it was
jest, as bewtif ool as ever, and the flower-gardens was that splendid and
tidy as did great oredit to Feeld Marshall '" Gkorge" as has the care
on 'em, and sines his onered name on all the boards as is stuck up at
all the gates.
It was a bewtifool morning when I started, after a rayther late Brek-
fest, and 1 had jest got to aoout the werry middle of the Park, when,
without the werry least notice or warning, down came sitch a storm
of rain as I has werry seldom bin drenshed by. I stood up under a
littel tree as was near me; but tho' I bleeve as it tried its werry best
to keep me a dry place under its bows, it was all in wane, and by
the time as the storm was over, and the sun cum out agane, I was
wet through to my werry skin, and the heat of the sun shining on
my wet close had the sin^ler affect of making 'em all smoke,
and a rayther imperent-looking boy acshally arsked me weather I
knowed as all my steam was a blowing off, and weather I was afeard
of busting my Biler! Oh, them London Boys! What little respeo
they has ewen for an Hed Waiter! In coorse I allers treats 'em
with the most horty contemt.
Well, my fust day's holliday being rayther a failure, I spent the
nex one, which was one long down pore, in the buzzum of my
famly; and though I bort no less than three halfpenny Papers, and
red 'em all rite through, yet I must confess that it was about the
werry 1 ingest day as I amost ewer remembers. Praps the two
singler suckemstances that my fare Partner had a bad tooth uke, and
gave me nothink but the oold sholder for lunch, and dinner, and
supper, may have had sumthink to do with it. But so it was, and I
sort my downy couch at a most unnateral hurly our.

'Ave a New Chaplain.—We knew Mr. Arthur Robeets had
not been in London for some time, having, as we believed, marched
with the Avenue Old Guard to take
the provinces by storm; but certainly we
were not prepared for an announcement, in
a daily paper, occurring in the course of a
short paragraph, to the effect that "the
Rev. Arthur Roberts, M.A.," did some-
thing or other as " Chaplain to the Prince
of Wales." "A loss to the Stage," we
said to ourselves, resignedly, "but a gain
to the Church. And then what an enter-
taining Chaplain he will be for H.R.H.,
if he is only anything like as amusing as
he was as The Vicar of Wideaxcaktfieid."
But our train of thought on this line was
rudely run off the rails by the almost
immediate discovery, on comparing this
paragraph with similar ones in other con-
temporaries, that the "Rev. Arthur s ■,.
Roberts" was a misprint for "the Rev.
Arthur Robins." Really printers should Ch.urch Stage. - " The
not trifle with our tenderest feelings in Vicarof ftidwwakeb-ld. •
this flippant manner; but, on reconsideration, we congratulate H R H..

New Illustration of an Old Msop's Fable.—On the first night
of the successful Opera Carina at the Opera Comique, the audience
cried "Woolf!" so often, that when a young lady appeared in
aniwer to this summons for the Composer, they wouldn't belitve that
she was really the Woolf in question.

I said once I thought this would be "slow." That must have

Thank goodness, that awful fraud, Primaeval Man, has disappeared

Halloa! Surely that must be the sound of a pick. And they

"seem to see." Perhaps not. I should like to know what his eyes
would feel like, or, for the matter of that, his legs either, after being

I shall soon pull together again. Meanwhile, all I ask is, that he

FINIS!
(THE END OF TUE SEASON.)
THE LAST (JURY) MAN.
{A Long way after Campbell.)
The British Constitution's doom
Is Chaos and Old Nox,
When you can't get twelve honest men
Into the Jury Box!
I had a vision in my sleep,
My fanoy took a tidy sweep
Adown the gulf of Time!
I saw Old England, and behold,
Owing to idleness and gold,
'Twas given up to Crime!
The Judge's eyes did wildly glare
Where, white with age and wan,
There stood within the Box, else bare,
A lonely Jury Man.
Some were exempt by " tips"—the brand
Of bribery stained the Briton's hand,—
From urgent business" some;
Some swore they couldn't leave their bed,
Some that their Mothers-in-law were dead,
And so they could not come.
Yet, martyr-like, that lone one stood
Before the Beak's dread eye.
He said, "My Lud, it ain't no good;
There's only you and I.
Men don't find Jurying good fun;
They 're all ' exempt;' I'm the last one
To turn up, dontoher know.
A thousand cases' wait us here—
'Twill take us all our time, I fear.
I'm game—so on we go!
"What though the officer go forth?
Britons have now such skill
In ' getting off,' that 'tisn't worth
His while to hunt 'em still;
We '11 have to do it; tire away!
A dozen cases in a day
Will be enough for us.
It's no use getting in a fury!
At least, you 're certain that the Jury
Will be unanimous.
"You will not fill this Box—'tis small —
With the old dozen men.
No; those who've once escaped its thrall
Will not return again.
Lor', do you fancy they '11 come back
To these hard seats, that cramp and rack,
In these chill draughts to writhe 'i
You made the Jury-Box abhorred
By dull discomfort, good, my Lord,
/once was brisk and lithe;
"Now you perceive my erst bright eyes
Have lost their ancient fire,
I've suffered untold agonies.
To shiver or perspire,
To faint with heat, to gasp for breath,
Are not nice things, but till my death
It shall be my one boast,
That I ne'er slunk at Duty's call.
I've but one fear, 'tis that I shall
Return here—as a ghost!
"Oh, should my spirit, by fate's whim,
Or destiny's last lark,
Come back unto this Court so dim
Into this Box so dark!
No! I should then evade the summons
By such excuses—they are rum 'uns—
As " City Magnates" U6e,
And brothers of the brush or pen,
And lots of selfish idle men,
Who Duty's task refuse.
"Go on! Whilst pluck can hold me up
In this void Box's waste,
I '11 sit, although the bitter cup
Is little to my taste;
When to the wall I turn my face,
The last of the old Jury race,
Our Senators, who nod
Over our laws, and fog, and twi*t 'em,
May modify the Jury system:
Or, if they don't, it's odd."
THE CORRECT CARDIFF.
At the Autumn Meeting of the Associated
Chamber of Commerce at Cardiff, Sir Jacob
Behees spoke in favour of the formation of
a Commercial Party, independent of patty
politics, in the House of Commons. The
President opposed the proposal, the Resolu-
tion was negatived, and subsequently Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach, in expressing his
agreement with the dissentient majority,
declared that there was already a superabund-
ance of such parties. We should think so,
indeed! The multiplication of "parties,"
ostensibly " independent of party," will make
the House as parti-coloured (or, which is
much the same thing, party-coloured), as
Joseph's coat itself. Why, every interest,
opinion, or fad, might organise its own knot
ot supporters into an "independent party,"
and Parliament become, indeed, a fortui-
tous concourse of atoms," without cohesion,
which means Chaos come again. The Cardiff
assembly was quite right in refusing to be a
party to this party-proposal.
The world's a stage, -where each man playa hit part,
But " companies" must combine in union hearty.
'Twill be, as old dames fay, " a pretty start,"
When "person " (as in Cockneyeae) means "party."

[October 6, 1888.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SUMMONED FOR RATES.
(Notes from a Diary in the Recess.)
Tuesday.— Spent a pleasant morning in Sessions House, Broad
Sanotuary, Westminster. Outside, summer suddenly returned;
Raining in torrents. Inside, a collection of men and women—chietly
women—all steaming wet. Behind a desk, two Magistrates and a
clerk; in front, the Rate Collector. The rest, ratepayers—or to be
more precise, people who hadn't paid their rates. Summoned to show
cause why. Cause varied; result the same; can't pay. Out of
work some; sick others; sad all. A pitiful story, and a purposeless
gathering. Magistrates apparently can do nothing.
"We are machines!" said the" Chairman, smiling genially upon
depressed elderly gentleman, whose rates are horribly in arrear.
"You must pay by the 8th of October. Next case I" _
Depressed elderly gentleman falls into the rear without word of
protest. Always been falling into the rear since he was born.
Movement quite natural to him.
Middle-aged lady in an apron and seething mental condition comes
up next. Has prepared for Magistrate some autobiographical data.
Her story graphic, rather than succinct. Magistrate tries to get in his
formula about '' Adjourncd-tiR-9th-of-October-must-pay-on-the-
8th." Middle-aged lady brandies out into statement of her troubles
prior to last year but one, when Mary Ann was run over by a 'bus.
"Adjourned-till-9th-of-October," says the Magistrate, as if it
were an incantation warranted to shut any woman up.
Twelve years she's lived in the house; always paid rates up to two
years ago. (Watching opportunity, machine grinds out refrain,
"Must - pay - on - the-
8th - of - October.")
Mart Ann was in
hospital for six weeks;
hardly been of any use
since; Mrs. Moggins
would bear testimony
to extraordinary ex-
penses consequent upon
calamity.
"Adjourned-till-
9th-of-October," the
maohine wearily
warbles. "Call - the -
next-case."
Next oase is that of
Arthur William
Cluff. "Arthur
William Cluff!"
loudly called. No
response. Old gentle-
man with wonderful
waste of woollen com-
forter round his neck
stares steadily into
space. He is the party
who came in just now;
tried to get point of
his dripping umbrella
into my boot; only
partially succeeded.
"This is him," said
a faded woman in a shawl, thrusting him forward by the shoulder;
"he lives in our street and is stone-deaf."
This said with smile of pride. Arthur William Cluff, by his
supernatural deafness, evidently sheds lustre on his immediate
neighbourhood. In pride of association faded woman in shawl
momentarily forgets the unpaid rates. Arthur William with
difficulty brought up to the Bench, making dashes with his dripping
umbrella at other people's boots. Magistrate, lifting up his voice,
asks hisname. Arthur William makes no responsive sign. Rate
Collector, standing by, bellows in his right ear,
"Are you Arthur William Cluff?" That seems to be wrong
ear. Old gentleman obligingly turns round the other. Rate Collector
shouts down it. Arthur William, catching the whisper, nods assent.
"Have you paid your rates F" Collector, prompted by Magistrate,
halloas. Arthur William frankly admits he hasn't.
"Adjourned-till-9th-of-0ctober,'" savs the Magistrate.
"Adjourned till the 9th of October," reiterates Collector, stand-
ing on tip-toe. the better to command Arthur William's accessory
ear. Arthur William raises no objection to that, but does not
seem to see relevanoy of remark.
"Tell him he must pay on the 8th of October," says tho Magis-
rate,bellowing at the Rate Collector as if ho, too, were deaf.
"You must pay on the 8th," the Collector, goaded to desperation,
roars with all his might.
"Well, I will, if I can," says Arthtr William, with a cheer-

fulness that suffused itself all over the damp Court. His umbrella
having now dripped itself dry over Rate Collector's boots, Arthur
William goes out to get it wet again. Cases by the score, and the
dozen. Doesn't seem money anywhere to pay the rates. But it
does seem that the rates must be paid, and by the 8th of October, too.
The forlorn, damp, and penniless crowd having cleared out, each
comforted with the inevitable prospect of the "9th of October,'1 our
turn comes. Half-a-dozen of us. Not here on account of rates, but in
connection with jury lists. A blow struck at British Constitution by
attempt to include name of Tory, M.P., upon jury list. Peers and
Members of Parliament always exempted. Why should Barkshire
suffer in its privileges? Not if its senior Member can, at whatever
personal inconvenience, assert them. Proceedings not unduly
extended. Considerable list of exemptions settled by Act of
Parliament. List worth considering bv anxious parents about to
select avocations for promising Bons. You can't, for example, be
summoned on a jury if you 're a coroner, or an apothecary, or a
Member of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, or a pilot, or a
bailiff. Also exempted if you happen to be a gaoler, or if you keep
a public lunatic asylum. Moreover, if you've been attainted of any
treason or felony, or are an outlaw, you can snap your fingers at
"Church Wardens and overseers of the parish, when preparing the
jury lists." That's how it came to pass that Friar Tuck was never
on a jury, and how Robin Hood always avoided this peremptory
interruption of his avocations. Members of Parliament bracketted
for jury-list purposes with outlaws and keepers of lunatic asylums.
Toby, M.P. for Barks, was, of course, exempted, and left the
Sessions Court without a stain on his character.

'You Thothy Perthon I"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
It is certain that Thoth, A Romance (W. Blackwood and Son),
would never have been written if Mr. Rider Haggard had not
published his most famous book. Thoth is a sort of male She, and
might as well have been called He. Unlike
She, who lived continuously through a
couple of thousand years, Thoth1 s forefathers
come to life only occasionally. But that is
quite enough when there are a good many of
them. Thoth himself is a remarkable per-
sonage, with a touch of Professor Baldwin
in his character. He improves on the Pro-
fessor's machinery, since he dispenses with
the parachute, and, when he goes up in a
balloon fashioned in the shape of a bird, is
able to bring the whole boiling down where-
ever he pleases. The kingdom Thoth rules
is an island in some unnamed sea, where the
residents are brought up deeply rooted in
the heresy of woman-hatred. This being carried to extremes, the
consequences are natural and inevitable. Part of the population is
drowned in the sea, and the remainder are buried in the sands of
the desert. The book makes encouraging reading for members of
the Women's Rights Association, only I hope it won't be dramatised.
Number 4 of Our Celebrities (Swan, Sonnenschkin & Co.) is just
out. Excellent portrait of Sir Philip Cunliffe Owen, and Louis
Engel's list of the numerous orders Sir Philip has received from
the Crowned Heads of Europe, is astonishing. Theatrical Orders
are not included in the collection. Sir Philip's appearance at a
foreign Court seems to have been the signal for decorating him at
once; the cue was, "Give your orders—Sir Philip's in the room."
The second portrait represents Sir Charles Russell, apparently
trying on a new Q. C.'s wig, and trying to look as unlike himself as
possible. The striped trousers quite out of character with the
dignity of the upper portion of the forensic costume, and must have
offended the artistic eye of Count Waleey, the eminent Photo-
grapher, who should have induced him to -put on knee breeches and
buckles for the occasion. But it is difficult to induce anv man of Sir
Charles's determination of character to change his habits at a
moment's notice; still, as "Standing Counsel to the Jockey Club,"
he might, at least, have worn breeches and boots, and have a whip
in his hand. But where is his most characteristic snuff-box?
Capital monograph about him by L. E.
Lastly there is the living presentment of Mr. Edmund Yates,
"Edmundus Ed. Mundi," whom "L. E." naturally treats with
respectful admiration. The likeness is excellent. But what could
Walery have been about to pose Edmundus thus? He has a book
in one hand with his finger marking a place for reference, and having
decided what he is going to sav in his criticism on it, ho is
evidently thinking what on earth has become of his own writing-
table,, his editorial seat, his pens, ink, and paper, and why these
obtrusively^ theatrical "stage properties," including the chair in
which he is seated, have been substituted for tho real articles P
He should have been up-standing, self-supporting, for ho surely has
no need of "props." It is a spealring likeness, not a writing one.

A SHOW OF "SAVOY FARE."
If Shakspeare as librettist, and Mozart as composer, had both
come to life again and written the most marvellous opera ever heard
by mortal ears, the Press generally, with
the solitary exception of the musical critic
of the Timet, could not have gushed more
rapturously, in larger type, and at greater
length over such a work, than they did over
the latest comic opera by Geldest and
Sullivan at ths Savoy. Judging by the
crisp and epigrammatio title, The Yeomen
of the Guard: or, The Merryman and hit
Mdid (rott pay tour money, and you take
„ your Choice of alternative titles) the
- librettist seems, up to the last moment, to
)have been undecided as to what he should
call his new and original infant. In "the
book of the words'' he does not describe
U as either serious or comic, simply as an
opera, which Is wise. I have always
tContended that "new and original" need
not mean new to everybody, and quite
original, and 1 am pleased to see that at
last the critics, In dealing with this libretto,
are inclined to fa»our my opinion. But had
the opera been at the Saveloy Theatre instead
of the Savoy Theatre, and written by two
unknown collaborateurt, say Sulbert and
Glllivan, instead of Gilbert and Sulli-
van, wouldn't the virtuously-indignant
critics have been down on the librettist for
not informing the public that the plot was
founded on that of Maritana 1 The timid no-
tice Sulbert might, perhaps, have attempted
to disarm criticism by calling his new and
"I have a song to sing 0!^(tinal opera The Beefeater't Bride! or, The
Merryman dnd his Maritana, and would
have humbly admitted his indebtedness to Mr. W. 8, Gilbert for the
use he had made of the latter's genuinely humorous Bab Ballad Jester
Jama, The Btern critics would promptly have pointed out that in
good old FmuALL-and-Wallace's Maritana, Don Cesar is in prison
arid condemned to dic; and so is Colonel Fairfax in The Beefeater's
Bfitte; that the Don is married in prison to a veiled gipsy dancer,
MdrUand, and, the Colonel is married in prison to a veiled gipsy
dancer, Llsie Maynard. '' Maynard" the critics would have bitterly
exclaimed, "is but a poor English rendering of Maritana!" With
scathing irony they would have shown how, in the old opera, Don
Cesar escapes being shot, and returns " all alive 0 ; " while m the new
and original work Colonel Fairfax escapes being decapitated, and
also reappears on the scene. Don Ce"sar enters disguised as a monk;
Colonel Fairfax comes in as a Beefeater. Don Cesar and Maritana
subwquently fall in love with each other: so do Colonel Fairfax and
Elsie Maynard. Don Cesar is pardoned by the King for a very
good reason: the Colonel is reprieved for no reason at all, except to
finish the opera, "a reason," the satirical critio would have added,
"sufficiently satisfactory to the audience."
Then some erudite critio would have pointed out to the unfortunate
Sulbert that an unknown librettist must not rashly tamper with his-
tory in a work intended to be serious, and would have lectured him on
the utter improbability of a gipsy girl in all the bravery of an Esmeralda
costume (whether accompanied by Point as Gringmre or not) daring
to'come rattling her tambourine and singing, within the precincts of
the terrible Tower in the reign of Bluff hang Hal, when Gipsies were
harassed, persecuted, hunted out of the kingdom, or strung up on the
readiest made gibbet; and directly it was known that the gallant officer
who, as a sorcerer, had been languishing in gaol, on being liberated,
had married a heathen gipsy (supposing a priest had been found rash
enough to commit such a sacrilege), the pair of them would have had
short shrift and been burnt as witches; and as Colonel Fairfax, had
already escaped decapitation, the professional Merryman might then
have observed. "Mark yon, the Colonel did but exchange his chop
for a stake. A pretty conceit."
Beyond the above points, there is absolutely no resemblance between
the two plots and thoughpoor Sulbert (without Gillivan) would thus
have suffered at the hands of the Critical Faculty for daring to claim
novelty and originality for his story, yet for Mr. Gilbert, of the
firm of Gilbert and Sullivan, the critics have nothing but obse-
quious compliments and good-natured excuses. As to the music, even
the sharpest and most hostile ear could not detect a trace of Wallace
in the latest composition of Sir Arthur Sullivan. He, at all
events, is guiltless of any intrigue with Maritana. It is genuine
Sullivan, and charming throughout, though not, at first hearing,
very catching,—which must always be the public test,—with the
exception of^the duet, repeated with chorus as finale, "/ have a
song to ting, O," the first phrase of which I did manage to carry
away with me, but while humming it on my road home, I found
myself imperceptibly wandering into the "Lullaby" in Cox and
Bog, where I very nearly lost it altogether.
Dame Carruthert' first song, " When our gallant Norman Foet
is most effective, and might be in serious opera, were it not for the
chorus of Beefeaters. Mr. Courticb Pounds is a simpering effeminate
Fairfax, but sings prettily a ballad about "Moon" and "June,"
after the Yeomen in a previous "number" have already chorussed
about "Noon" and "June." But of course the subject of the
weather is inexhaustible, and there are plenty of rhymes still left to
"Joon." The part of the Jetter is a capital skit upon Touchstone
and the Shakspearian clowns generally, and, with subtle cynicism,
Mr.W. S. Gilbert shows how wearisome is the most excellent
fooling of these mediaeval drolls to the playgoer of to-day. The
notion of the Jetter in search of a place, and being examined by an
intending employer as to his capabilities (" My caper-bilities- he
would say, and might have executed a short danoe as a specimen),
struck me as exquisitely humorous when I first read it some years
ago (Was it among a second series of Bab Ballads in a magazine,
or was it a short Christmas story by the same author f), but the idea
seems to lose something of its humour on the Stage.
In a week or two, no doubt, Jester George will introduce some of
his gaggery-waggery, and when, d propot of Colonel Fairfax making
love to Elite, he has to say something about "lying close as a maggot
in a nut," he will add, "But, ifakins, what careth she for a 'nut,'
now that she hath the ' Kernel'? A pretty wit!"
Mr. Denny, as the Gaoler, is very much Mr. Denny as the rural
Policeman in Dandy Dick, only with music, and without the
dialect. When Phoebe (Miss Jessie Bond, who is, before all, the life
and soul of the opera) introduces to him first her lover as her brother,
and then afterwards her real brother, and Mr. Denny exclaims,
"Another brother! Are there any more of themP" one really
expects him to add, "It's a nice lot of ac-quain-tances you're
inter-doosing me to," or something much to that effect, which
he used, in similar circumstances, to say to his wife in Pinero's
Comedy.
In the book, Mr. Gilbert has carefully pointed out, using capital
letters for the purpose, that the first stanza of his finale is written
in "Elegiacs." This is very considerate, as it directs the critics'
attention to a fact that might otherwise nave escaped their notice.
In old days, the jokes in the books of every Burlesque used to be
printed in italics. There was no possibility of anybody passing over
a pun. The motive in both cases is much the same.
The fault in the representation is that, with the occasional excep-
tion of Miss Jessie Bond and Miss Brandram—none of the actors
play with conviction. They seem uncertain as to the character of
the piece,—is it serious, or isn't it? And if it isn't, are they to
keep the joke to themselves, or to let the audience into the secret?
Mr. Grossxith, with an occasional sly wink at the house, seems to
incline to the latter view, and no doubt when he has exaggerated
his dances, developed his comio business, and made the part quite
his own, it will (jo with roars, especially his contradictory duet with
Mr. Denny, which is clearly founded on the model of the well-
known comic song, where the wife pertinaciously insists that
something can only be cut with scissors, when the husband obsti-
nately sticks to it that a knife must be used:—
"Cut it with a knife,
Said he.
Cut it with the scissors,
Said she.
(He) Knife, (She) scissors, (He) knife, (She) scissors, &o., 4c."
Only that, in this duet, the quarrel is between Mr. Denny and
Mr. Grossmith . first as to whether somebody was creeping or
crawling.
"He was creeping,
He was crawling,
(D.) Creeping, (G.) crawling, &o., &c, &c."
And then they differ as to how the man sank in the moat,—Mr.
Denny says, like a stone:" Mr. Grossmith says, "like a heavy
lump of lead;" and then they alternate " lead," stone," and so
forth, which will work up. with comic business, into something very
funny, and probably be the hit of the piece. The best serio-comio
song, as far as words go, is, to my thinking, the first one sung by
the Jester. The scenery and the costumes are excellent.
My summary is this:—Cut at least twenty minutes out of the
First Act; take a quarter of an hour out of the Second Act, so as
to finish by eleven; never let the Beefeaters go off without a dance;
induce Mr. Temple to abandon all attempt at playing his part
seriously; in fact give every one of them carte blanche (" a very
D'Oyly-Carte task," as the Jester would say) to go in for the old
larks of Mikado £ Co., and the Savoyards will feel themselves once
more at home, and their kind friends in front will be satisfied
with everybody generally at the House of Savoy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HORRIBLE LONDON: OR. THE PANDEMONIUM OF POSTERS.

The Demon set forth in a novel disguise
(All methods of mischief the master-fiend tries)
Quoth he, "There's much ill to be wrought through
the eyes.
I think, without being a boaster,
I can give their most 'cute Advertisers a start,
And beat them all round at the Bill-sticker's art.
I will set up in business in Babylon's mart,
As the new Pandemonium Poster!"
So he roved the huge city with wallet at waist,
With a brush, and a stick, and a pot full of paste,
And there wasn't a wall or a hoarding,
A space in a slum, or a blank
on a fence,
A spare square of brick in a
neighbourhood dense,
Or a bit of unoccupied
boarding,
But there the new poster, who
didn't muoh care
For the menacing legend,
"Bill-stickers beware!"
Right soon was tremen-
dously busy
With placards portentous in
purple and blue, [hue,
Of horrible subject and hideous
Enough to bemuddle an aero-
naut's view,
And turn the best steeple-
Jack dizzy.
Oh, the flamboyant flare of
those fiendish designs,
With their sanguine paint-
splashes and sinisterlinea!
Gehenna seemed visibly
glaring
In paint from those villanous
daubs. There were men
At murderous work in mal-
odorous den,
And ghoul-woman grue-
somely staring.
The whole sordid drama of
murder and guilt,
The steel that strikes home, and
the blood that is spilt,
Was pictured in realist
colours,
With emphasis strong on the
black and the red.
The fear of the stricken, the
glare of the dead;
All dreads and disasters and
dolours
That haunt poor Humanity's
dismallest state,
The horrors of crime'and the
terrors of fate,
As conceived by the crudest
of fancies,
Were limned on these posters
in terrible tints,
In the style of the vilest sen-
sational prints
Or the vulgarest penny
romances.
That Bill-sticker paused in his
work with a look
Which betrayed the black de-
mon; and gleesomely shook
His sides in a spasm of
laughter.
Quoth he, with a sinister wag
of his head,
"By my horns, the good artist
has lavished the red!
This home of coarse horror—
this house of the dead
Looks crimson from base-
ment to rafter.
How strange that a civilised
City—ho! ho!
Tis their fatuous dream to
consider it so !—
Which is nothing too lovely at
best, should bestow
Such a liberal licence on
spoilers!
These mural monstrosities,
reeking of crime,
Flaring horridly forth amidst
squalor and grime,
Must have an effect which will
tell in food time
Upon legions of dull-witted
toilers.

Last Friday the Times Correspondent at Bucharest,
writing about the entertainments given in honour of the
Prince of Wales, said—
"In the evening there will be a series of tableaux vivants
representing scenes from Shakspeare's works. These have
been carefully rehearsed under the superintendence of Queen
Elizabeth."
What better person could they have had as an authority
except Shakspeare himself? But how did they get

then it is not unlikely that Dburiolanus is already
shaking in his shoes lest Her Majesty, more ruffled than
ever, should pay him an unexpected visit at Drury Lane,
and insist on superintending a night revival of tiie Armada,
with ghostly scenery, costumes, and appointments, and a
phantom cast. Only thus would her manes be satisfied, and
then she herself might be re-hearsed, and conveyed in state
to Westminster Abbey, Druriolanus superintending.

GOOD-BYE TO THE (CRICKETING) SEASON.
(A Fond Farewell, something in the style of
Praed, composed at the Oval in October by
our Own Old Enthusiast.)
Good-bte to the Season!—'Tis over!
Pavilions no longer are gay:
Bat, bowler, and leal Cricket-lover,
Arc scattered like M.P.'s away.

The Last Ball of the Season.
Walter Read bobs no longer his brown end
At point, watching Bannerman's "shape;"
Gilbert Grace has gone home to dear
Downend,
Bob Abel is bound for the Cape.
For want of a fuller enjoyment,
Till Bat, Ball, and Stumps, can come out,
At Football a few find employment,
But Cricket is done, beyond doubt.
Good-bye to the Season!—The weather
Has bowed at the shrine of St. Gamp;
Wet wickets have sodden the leather,
And stumps have been pitched in a Bwamp.
Chill deluges, varied with thunders,
The Crioket-craok's "average" queer.
Bad hits and bad misses are blunders
Scarce blamed in so beastly a year.
There are all sorts of excellent reasons
All round for the prevalent " duck ;"
So, Good-bye to this wettest of Seasons!
Its memories are mainly of muck.
Good-bye to the Season'—The chances
That filled even champions with glojm;
The rascally tricks and rare dances
Devised by the demon of doom.
The "bad hits" that should have been
"beauties,"
The good ones so palpably " flukes";
The fielders so slack in their duties,
The Captains so tart in rebukes;
The cocksures who dropped bobs and tanners
On matches like Surrey v. Notts;
The consequent breaches of manners;
The subsequent downfall of " pots."
Good-bye to the Season!—the rages
When second-rate teams come out strong;
When Abel—for one—stayed in ages,
Or Read missed his tip and went wrong;
When clever and " champion " Surrey
The Cornstalks thrice tackled in vain—
Lost twice by bad fortune and flurry,
And missed winning once through the rain;
Whilst Gloucester, whom Surrey could
swallow,
And Leicester whom Gloucester could eat,
Both Licked the Australians hollow.
"Good old Surrey " wound up with defeat.
Good-bye to the Season!—the " Terror"
Who put such a break on the ball;
Yes, Turner can bowl, "and no error,"
And Ferris makes many sing small.
But England has no need to fluster;
She is not deficient in " stars";
Still, when her best men she can muster.
She wins in these willowy wars, [killing!
There's Lohmann, how straight and how
He '11 "hold up our end," please the pigs;
And slashing McDonnell's scarce willing
To stand many overs of Brigos!
Good-bye to the Season!—A wetter 'un
Seldom spoiled "place," "pitch." and
But hero's to our evergreen veteran [pace";
Still to the front—Gilbert Grace!
"The Doctor" stands nominal second,
But who plays so often as he P
Still W. G. must be reckoned
As virtual top of the tree.
The theme of all Cricket-feed speeches,
The pet of pavilion and field,
His pre-eminence no one impeaches,
To none need our " Champion " yield.
Good-bye to the Season!—Another
Will come with the coming of May;
Though the new county boundaries bother,
The cry of the boys will be " Play!"
Will it come like this terrible " tryer?"
Or come very much the reverse?
Will its scorings be lower or higher?
Will its weather be better or worse?
Will it favour the bowler or batter?
Will it come with dry turf and clear sky,
Or washy and squashy ?—No matter:—
Good-bye to the Season—good-bye!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
And so he will give the trout a holiday, and go out shooting this |
afternoon.
It has been pouring with rain. It is pouring now, "And,"
says the Laird, we shall have showers all the afternoon."
Showers " here are, I find, pelting storms which wet you through
in a couple of minutes.
"In this rain," says the Baron, walking to the window, "we're
sure to put up something on that hill yonder."
Happy Thought.—If I go with them, I'm sure to "put up some-
thing,—my umbrella.
"You can have the pony, if you like to ride up to where we 're
driving," says the Laird to me. On consideration, being fond of air
and exercise, I accept. The pony is ordered, and I anticipate a
good gallop over the hills and far away, two or three hours' exercise,
nappy return home, rub down, bath, change, and splendid appetite
for dinner.
They start, all the party, exce_pt the ladies, and disappear. The
ladies melt away and become invisible. I am to join the sportsmen
as soon as I like. Of course mounted, I shall easily catch up the
infantry, so I tell the youthful gillie, Duncan, who comes to inform
me "the pony's ready saddled," that I'll start in a quarter of an
hour.
I follow the boy to where the pony is. Pony! it is a rough-
looking sort of cart-horse, over fifteen hands, with an old saddle,
loose girths, and a single snaffle rein that looks as if it would
break with the slightest strain. However, I said I would go: and
perhaps the "pony " is better than he looks.
In less than five minutes I find he isn't. His pace is a quick slouching
walk with rather a nautical roll in it. His head droops heavily, as
if he were sadly weary of this sort of life. He is led by the lad
Duncan, who carries a Bwitch, as if he were a donkey-boy and I
was having sixpennorth on the sands: and we are ignominiously
following another "pony," whioh is being personally conducted by
an elder gillie. This other pony is also over fifteen hands, and across
its back are swung panniers for game, baskets holding five o'clock tea
and other provisions, and such a lot of wraps and waterproofs as to
suggest the idea of the baggage pony being a "clothes horse." I
have no one to say this to, so keep it to myself and appreciate it
dismally. It is just as if the sportsmen were the army on active
service, and I had been classed among the impedimenta. Per-
hajjs^I think to myself, things will be better presently as we go
Happy Thought.—" Speculate for the rise."
Nothing of the sort. The ground gets worse and worse. Each
fresh bog is boggier than the last, and the higher we get, the steeper
is the climbing, and the more perilous my situation. The elder
gillie plods on his way, morose and taciturn. The younger, my
Donkey-boy, blithe, but silent. It is a melancholy party; quite
funereal. The coats and wraps, slung across first horse, are sugges-
tive of the lifeless body of some one whom we have shot, and whom
we are going to bury up in the hills, and I, mounted, am either a
prisoner or chief mourner, it doesn't much matter which. The boy
gives up leading the cart-horse-pony, and strolls on with the taciturn
gillie. I try to engage the elder gillie, from a distance, in conversation,
but he won't be engaged. I want to interest him in my own per-
sonal safety, so that if anything happened, by which I mean if my
horse fell head-foremost into a bog or tumbled down sideways over a
narrow ledge,—my knees shudder at the thought,—he, heing on
friendly terms with me, and living in dim hopes of half-a-crown,
would rush to my assistance.
Happy Thought {of the gillie). "Speculating for the fall." [My
fall.) But gillie senior refuses to be interested; he won't talk, not even
of the weather. The youthful gillie, Duncan, follows his example
so closely that he won't be communicative even to the extent of
informing me what sort of day it was yesterday, and what amount
of sport they had had the day before that. Wilson Barrett, with
his favourite "How long!" flashes across my mind at several
oritical moments. "How long" will this saddle remain on the
horsePand "How long" shall I remain on the saddle? Till accident
us do part.
Elder and younger gillie silent, as if overcome by some great
grief, or groaning in spirit against their Saxon oppressors, trudge on,
i'umping without effort from rock to rock, the elder one jerking the
torse's leading-rein, encouraging it to land on sharp projections, and
to founder desperately through morasses. I watch the proceedings with
fearful interest, knowing that whatever happens to the horse in front
of me must, it is ten to one, happen to mine. But the horse in front
carries only waterproofs, empty Dags, and materials for five o'clock
tea, while mine carries me. As we cross a torrent, my horse balancing
itself on the pointed tops of rooks which just peep out of the damp
moss, and where a slip from any given point must precipitate us
into the depths below, I am inclined to whisper nervously in the
horse's ear, with a view to inspiring him with confidence, "Remember
you carry Cesar and his fortunes!" and I heartily wish C-esak
were anywhere else at this moment.
It is no sort of use attempting to guide the beast. I try to

Shakspearian—Household—Luncheon—Family Party —Mysterious
—Pony—Another—Perilous—Down again—Rest—Thankful.
From what I hear of the names »f the servants inside and outside
the house, such as Duncan, Donald, Ross, Donaldblain, it appears
that, with the exception of Macduff, Banquo, and
the Three Witches, we have pretty nearly the
entire cast of Macbeth. The part of Macbeth is
filled by the chief housemaid and housekeeper,
whose name is Macbeth. Whether she is Mart,
or Jennee, or Efite, I do riot know,—and, by the
way, what was Lady Macbeth's Christian name?
Her husband never mentions it, and the only
term of endearment by which he addresses
her is, "dearest chuck." Why " chuok "?
Our Macbeth at the shooting-lodge — a
tall, good-looking lass, about thirty or so,
a strapping wench with an elegant figure,—would
foroibly resent being called a "chuok by anyone,
even if there were a male Macbeth on the premises
who had acquired a right to do so. She can walk with
the swinjj of a man, pull stroke or bow in a boat, or
scull it single-handed across the lake, if need be; is
a good shot with a rifle, can do tailoring or cobblering
to perfection,—"odd jobs executed at the shortest
possible notice,"—and has a ready eye to the wants
and comforts of all the visitors in both departments—
the House and the Annexe—of the establishment
over which she presides. She is invaluable: and
though in the Annexe we do not see much of her,
yet it is to her that we have to make known our
wants, which, once mentioned, are immediately supplied. In the
House itself, on a busy evening, when the sportsmen have come in
late, and everybody is, more or less, hurrying up in their dressing
for dinner, and everybody has mislaid something, and no one can
find anything, then down the passages, from the bachelors' quarters,
and from the rooms where the young ladies are, come the reiterated
cries, as if they were uttered by the Apparitions that rise out of the
Witches' cauldron, of " Macbeth! Macbeth!! Macbeth!!!" And
instead of losing her presence of mind, and exclaiming, flurriedly,
"Had I three ears, Id hear thee!" she pleasantly replies, in her
strong Scotch brogue, "All right, Sir, I'm coming directly!"—and
come she does to everybody in turn, and everybody in turn is more
than satisfied. A wonderful woman.
There are three young ladies under the care, apparently, of the
Good Aunt. I am not introduced, but they all say, as the Wicked
Uncle did, "How dee do" to me, at lunch time, and address one
another by their Christian names, Millie, Evelyn, and the youngest
and smallest is Madoe. Who they are, what their surnames may be,
whether they are sisters, wives, or cousins belonging to the other
jruests, I haven't the slightest idea. It seems to be taken for granted
in this present company, which is, to all intents and purposes, a
family party, that there is no such being as a stranger in existence
within these four walls.
"You should nave gone "out fishing this morning, Millie," says
the Baron to the young lady.
"She couldn't," replies Evelyn, "asI wanted her to walk out
with me."
"Good Aunt," says D. B., "how are you? Madge, you'll have
to march out with the five o'clock tea, if we drive."
"If you 're going to drive, I'd rather walk, if I may," says Miss
Madge, appealing to the Laird, "the trap shakes so!"
Whereat there's a laugh all round, and the very young lady
colours up and looks frightened. The Laird hastens to the rescue.
"It's not 'driving' in a trap," he explains, smilingly, "the grouse
are driven by beaters, while we stand behind butts. I '11 show you
the butts; you can see them from the window with a good glass."
"How on earth should Madge know vour sporting terms?" says
the Good Aunt interposing. "It's her first day up here!"
On careful and separate inquiry, I find that none of the party have
ever met one another before last week, and the young ladies only
arrived yesterday. The people who brought them went away at
once. They are " left here till called for."
The talk is all sport: either shooting or fishing. Everyone explains
to everyone else why some particularly easy shot " didn't come off,"
and some one is always Baying,'1 Ah, I oughtn't to have missed that!"
Grannie, the fisherman, who. out-of-doors walks about with flies
and hooks stuck all over his head, has seen fish rising in every
direction. But it appears that, unfortunately, the fish have seen
him, and so, though he kept on changing his flies every half hour,
and waded up to his middle, yet,
"He did not catch that trout,
Brave Boys!
He did not catch that trout!"

myself with the reflection that the horse knows the country, and
must have been up here any number of times. The circumstances
on former occasions may have been totally different, and one
circumstance certainly is quite different now, and that is, that
this is the first time he has ever travelled across these hilis with me
on his back,—and, I add to myself most fervently,—it will be
the last!
I rode up here for exercise, anticipating an increase of tempera-
ture, skin-acting, and everything beneficial for a person with certain
gouty tendencies. But here we are, creeping up the mountain's side
(" We wandered up the mountain's side "), and I am feeling colder
and colder. I would get off and walk if my boots were not too thin
for the slosh, and I foresee catching a severe cold. After an hour
and a half of this amusement, and catching sight of the shooters only
for a moment when they were all too occupied to talk—especially
the Wicked Uncle, who is craftily lying in wait for a grouse behind
a butt built of peat, like a brigand looking out for the solitary
traveller,—I come to the determination that, directly I see anything
resembling a road, I will descend and run down it as hard as I
can, at the risk of dislocating my ankles, in order to circulate my
blood, which must have gone down nearly to zero.
Hoorah! "Thalatta! Thalatta!" I mean The Road! The
Road! "Let us take to the Road, Boys!" Highwayman's song
in The Beggar's Opera. It is not exactly a road, but, when the
winter is over, and it is no longer a water-course, it is evidently used
as a road by the natives, who must be very easily satisfied. Small
rates ought to have been charged for mending this road, and the
biggest rate ever known on it is the pace at which I am going down
when once fairly started.
To the astonisnment of the taciturn gillie and the dismay of Duncan
the Donkey-boy who had charge of me, 1 slide off the horse on to the
ground, and run. They halloa to me. No—not back again—I wave
my hand. They are dumfounded. I feel like a prisoner escaping;
and they, as I glance back at them, look as the guardians must have
looked, to whose care the historical Royal Personage was entrusted,
when he said, "Good-day, Gentlemen! "and their horses being blown,
galloped away in the direction of England, Home, and Beauty!
Free! Free! Free! Never again on the fifteen-hand cart-horse-
pony for me. Free! Free I Free! Splash
—dash—slash—dash—into the ruck, into
the muck, into the water, over the stones,
whack, crack, not "down on my back,"
but going as if I were wearing the seven-
leagued boots, until the grand
Serspiration effect, is pro-
uced. I hear the Donkey-
boy pursuing. He has been
sent after me by the Laird,
who, he shouts to me, breathlessly, is
very angry with him for leaving me to
find my way alone. But, for all his
holloaing, I won't stop, and he catches
me up by a short cut, and on we go
together, panting, until I come to a
dead stop in the valley, and am
anxious to know the shortest cut to
the Lodge, as the rain, which has been
threatening proceedings for some time
past, is beginning to fall, and, if I get
wet in this fever-heat, I tremble
for the consequences. The youthful
gillie points out the road,—over the
meadow, round by the swing-bridge.
and a snorter route. Allez! On we goes again! He his way, I
mine. The big rain-drops become bigger. '' Speed thee on, my
bonnie Shanks s mare, I have trusted thee many a time before,
and will again!"
The last mile is always the longest. Then the swing-bridge—
a narrow plank hung on wires—a miniature suspension Hammer-
smith, swaying like a slack rope as I cross it cautiously. Blonde?
for ever! The opposite bank of the river is gained! Saved! saved!
The rain! "Let it come down." And, as I quote Macbeth,
Macbeth herself, the ever-vigilant housekeeper, sees me flying
past the front-door ("You should see my coat-tails flying!"),
and calls out, "Ye'11 just be soaked through. I'll send you your
hot water,"—and so she does; and in another half-hour I am com-
fortably seated in an arm-chair before the fire in the smoking-room,
with a pipe and the first book I can lay my hand on, just to enjoy
a quiet read and rest in the two hours that remain to me before
dinner. The library here is not a large one. There are two
shilling novels, Jorrockis Jaunts, Bradshaw's latest publication,
and The New Newgate Calendar, illustrated, in two volumes. It is
one of these last-mentioned that is now in my hand: and it is this
that, an hour afterwards, drops with a bang on the floor, as I wake
up and see D. B.'s face at the window, as he cries out,
"Here we are again! How are you f"

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
I have just finished Mapleson's Memoirs. Poor dear Colonel!
An " old soldier " of course and yet how ill-used he must have been
by everyone. His stories are told with
touching simplicity, and many would
be highly amusing if the reader could
only get rid of the feeling that he is
listening to the lamb bleating out how
he was shorn, and how the wind, always
so difficult to raise, was rarely if ever
tempered to his poor back.
Pity the sorrows of a poor old Man-
-ager, whom Opera brought down to the
floor,
Who means to como up smiling when he can,
And is but looking for just one chance more.
It's a wicked and ungrateful world
with which the guileless Colonel has had
to deal. He cherishes the tenderest
memories of his collaborator and whilom
principal, the late E. T. Smith, who was
not Policeman X., but an ex-policeman,
afterwards Operatic Manager, and
perfectly adores the generous and sym-
pathetic Diva, formerly La Marquise De Caux, now Mme. Nicolini,
and known to all the world as Patti. If her agreements with other
Managers are similar to the one published in Vol. II. of the shorn
Impresario's Memoirs, then I pity the Operatic Managers. Of course
a Diva has a natural and inalienable right to do the best for herself
she can. There will always be somebody to take up a Diva like
Patti, as long as the public, generally but not always, as has been
recently proved, will pay high prices to hear a brilliant singer
unsupported, in preference to giving a reasonable amount for a good
all-round performance. It would be worth while to compare with the
Maplesonian Memoirs Willert Beale's recollections, published, I
think, some years ago, which told of a time when Operatic artists
wore a trifle more Bohemian, but infinitely more genial and obliging
to their employers.

a mere pittance monthly, and, if anything happens to the little one,
why you has him huried respectable, with a regular first-class
funeral, as should be a comfort to the feelings of a decent couple of
parents like you, and quite reconcile you, so to speak, to the loss of
him.
Second Rival Tout. And if you put into our concern, mind you,
the money you gets more than covers the expenses. When all's paid,
you'll find you've got a tidy bit over for yourselves. You might
make about two pound out of it, and that ought to console you. It
does most of 'em.
First Rival Tout. But we don't ask no nasty questions, you know,
if so happens you have to put in your claim.
Second Rival Tout. No. If you pays your first premium to-day,
and comes next week for the burial-money, we stumps up like men,
we do, and don't make no fuss.
First Rival Tout. I tell you what: our concern has been a real
blessin' to thousands, that it has.
Provident Male Parent (convinced). Well, there's sumrant in what
you chaps say, and I don't mind tryin' it on Little Jek here. (Address-
ing Provident Female Parent.) What do you say,,Missus? Jem has
been a ailin' lately, and if he means goin', I'd like to see him shoved

ACT II.—A Coroner's Court. An Inquest has just been held on
the body of Little Jem, who has recently died under somewhat
suspicious circumstances. The fact that he has for some lime
past been gradually sinking in an ill-ventilated back room, pur-
posely neglected by his Provident Parents, has not come out in
evidence; nor has it transpired that they have familiarised
themselves with the idea of his decease, and, seeing it will not
only relieve them of the cost of his maintenance, but also put
some ready-money into their pockets, have come to regard it as a
consummation devoutly to be desired. So it has come about that
though Little Jem has been deliberately done to death by his
businesslike natural protectors, the verdict has not been one of
Murder, or even of Manslaughter, but of " Death from Natural
causes." The Coroner, however, assuring the Jury that he will
see that their recommendation, that the Government should take
some steps to legislate for the protection of infant life from the
baneful influence of such Societies as the General Cosmopolitan
Infants' Coffin Supply Association," shall be forwarded to the
proper quarter, the Scene closes.
Provident Male Parent (who has received the burial-money, and is
returning from the funeral, addressing his "Missus.") Well, that's
done, though we ain't made quite two pound by it. Still one pound

ROBERT'S LONG WACATION.
Larst weak I told you I'd kontinuew in my nex. This is my nex
and I rekummense. The nei day, it looking rayther inclined to be
fine, as if the rain was beginning to get rayther ashamed of itself for
doing its werry best to spile all the crops, and all surten peepel's
tempers, and other peepel's best close, I perswaded my wife to go with
me tor a wark on the bewtifool Terns Embankment, and there we
strolled about in the lovely gardins for a ntrar or two, and I wentured
to say, as the tooth ake was much better, that the nice looking
surroundins, with the River a flowing by, reminded me of that appy
day in Orinnidge Park, when I arsked her to share my umbel fortunes
for wheel or for wo. She was ewidently pleased, and a smile lited
up her ample f eeters, when, as ill-luck woud have it, jest at that werry
moment, down came one of them orful downpores as seems to have
bin trying all this summer to beat the record, and allers succeeding.
Well, after that day's xpericnce, I must confess that, bewtifool as is
the well kep Gardens, and the floing River, and the nice cumferal
seats, the Tems Embankment is not a conwenient plaice to seleck to
be cort with your best Beloved, with jest the remanes of a bad tooth-
ake, in a drenching storm of rain and thunder and litening, and with
her best dress on. So wo have not repeated that xperiment. The
nex day we spent at the Great British Mewseum, and. we both agreed
that it seemed a great pitty that the Country was so werry pore that
they coudn't afford to have the Stattys mended. There was several
of the most bewtifoollcst of 'em all as had either a harm, or a leg, or
an and or two, broke rite off, and one of 'em had his nose nocked rite
off, and, aperiently, no attemp beiag maid to mend any on 'em.
Them as is without heds of coarse represents peeple as was beheded
afore their warious deaths, so the same fault cannot farely be found
with them. We coudn't, neether on us, at all hunderstand why so
many on 'em was not allowed to dress theirselves propperly afore
they had their stattys taken. Mrs. Robert ewen going so far as to
uav as she thort as sum on 'em, speshally the ladies, ort to have bin
ashamed of thereselves, let alone the chance of catching werry bad colds.
Of course it rained pretty hard before we got home; but we had
not werrv far to go, so we did not git so werry wet this time, fort-
nitly. The day after was much like the day afore, so, as I coudn't
go out, I purtended to be a reading, and slep a good deal of the
time; but, when night came, we went to the Theater, so as to have
a nice evening's emusement, to cheer us both hup. Ah, that was a
nice evening's emusement that was!
I went carefully through the warious statements in the Noose-
papers, and picked out a Play that as the Times said "thrilled the
House!" and, as the Adwertiser said, "would attract all play-
goers;" and, as the Daily Noose said, held the audience breath-
less." So off we went to the "Liesee' em," and there we sat for a
hole howcr a seeing sitch a xhibishun of disgusting orrers as we
neether of us never seed afore and fondly opes as we shall never see
no more. We coudn't stand no more of it, but went out in the middel
of the werry wust part, feeling quite hill, and warked home a
frumbling and a growling all the way at being so shamefoolly
eseaved by the jockular papers, and wundring how any man coud
have taken sitch a lot of trubbel to both look and hact more like a
wild beest than a man.
However, a nice little bankwet that my partner had prepaird as a
surprise, and a particklcr nice glass of ot Rum and water, enabled
us to sup full of hoysters insted of " full of orrore," as sumbody says,
and we was abel to bannish 'em from our thorte and to sleep the
sleep of the hiunercent. Robert.

TWO VIEWS OY BOULOGNE.
(A Page from a Diary kept at Monte Carlo Minor.)
Monday.—Arrived by the Mary Beatrice, one of the best boats of the
South-Eastern Railway Company. Really delightful. Breakfast in
London at 8"30, catch the 9'40 Express, and be in Boulogne in time for
luncheon! Everything so fresh and foreign. Glad to see the red trousers
of the soldiers; and the place itself so cheery. The Casino admirable.
Capital Band. Theatre, too, very amusing. Light Opera, nicely sung.
Remarkably good. Seen worse things in Paris. And then the Chemin de
fer! Of course object to gambling, on principle; but what possible harm
ean there be in risking a few francs? I did, and won ten by embarking
my fortunes on the blanc.
Tuesday.—Greatly disappointed. Boulogne is not at all like what it
used to be. "So English, you know." Too English, in fact, and not
good English either. More like bad Bayswater. The French soldiers,
too, are all undersized, and the place itself desolation in its most desolate
form. Hotels closed, and houses to be let or sold everywhere. The
Casino has certainly deteriorated. Band small, and not particularly
skilful. Theatre pitiful. Saw some dreadful piece, in live Acts, that
apparently was being played by amateurs. Most feeble performance I
have ever witnessed. And then the Chemin de fer! I repeat, I object
to gambling on principle: but granted that it is not wrong, what possible
good can there De in risking a few francs? I did, and lost twenty by
embarking my fortunes on the rouge.
Wednesday.—Really Boulogne improves on acquaintance. I am not
surprised that some people call it " Beautiful Boulogne," the air is cer-
tainly delightful—I thiiik finer than Brighton or Folkestone. I know
others say that the place has fallen off terribly since the establishment of
the so-called gambling at the Casino. This is absolute rubbish. I oan
recall no prettier sight than the toy engine, with its model carriages,
running round the track, with its piece of spring wire striking against
the brass bars, and stopping now at Brussels, now at Vienna
—at one moment near the red, at the next close to the white.
It is so simple, that even a child might play at it. So different
from Monte Carlo. Everyone knows what that is like. There
fortunes are really lost, and suicides are of common occurrence.
But at Boulogne it is merely an amusing distraction. I don't
pretend to play myself, but I certainly won five francs by
showing a partiality to Londres."
Thursday.—I am not at all surprised that some people call
this place "Beastly Boulogne." It certainly deserves the
name. The port at low tide is absolutely awful. No; if you
want bracing air, go to Brighton or Folkestone. I am told
that interested persons declare that Boulogne is growing, and
owes much of ite prosperity to the establishment of gambling
at the Casino. This is absolute rubbish. I know of no more
painful sight than to watch the eager faces of the players as
the monotonous model train clicks with its wire against the
brass rails. The time has arrived for writing plainly. The
gambling is the curse of the place. Stories are heard on all sides
of money squandered and lost. The mode of playing is so
simple that even a poor innocent child can risk and lose as high
a stake as five francs. It is so different from Monte Carlo.
Everyone knows what that is like. There you can avoid
playing if vou wish, and may enjoy life at one of the loveliest
watering-places in the world. But Boulogne is vastly different.
A two-penny-halfpenny place, that only a few years ago was
the refuge of the fraudulent bankrupt! Boulogne, indeed!
And the gambling too is a hard business. It is no idle distrac-
tion. You see, day after day, men, women and children
standing round the baize table losing all they have! It is a
dreadful sight! A really dreadful sight! I "don't pretend to
play myself, but I certainly lost five-and-twenty francs by
plunging blindly on " Bruxelles."
Friday.—Most amusing. Spent a day in looking about.
Went up to the Mairie to see a civil marriage. Very tine affair.
Carriages and carpets. The bride a good-looking young lady,
and the bridegroom decidedly distingue. Evidently persons ol
Sood position. People lunchuig at the hotel also interesting,
ne gentleman's face I recognised. Sure I have seen him
somewhere before and under pleasant circumstances. I do not
think he can be a parson, and yet he would adorn a pulpit; and
that reminds me,—I wonder why the clergy fight shy of the
Casino. They might do much good, I think, if they visited it
more frequently. Now, for instance, they might dance occa-
sionally at a Bal de Famille. Quite a nice set, some people in
evening dress, and one or two wearing gloves. Had heard that
the riff-raff from the fast hotels congregated at these gather-
ings. Not at all. I don't think so. And the games of chance.
Really nothing at all. Merely a pretence at baccarat. Could
not hurt anyone. As for the Chemin de fer, well, I can only
say that I have cleared thirty francs from first to last. I am
thinking of taking a deck-cabin on the Louise Dagmar (excel-
lent boat, always punctual) for my passage back.
Saturday.—Well, really it is too much 1 Just discovered that
the bride at whose civil marriage I assisted yesterday was a
scullery-maid from a local restaurant! And the gentleman of
prepossessing appearance who lunched at the same table with
me, and who I at a first glance took for a parson, turns out to
be a croupier.' I should not have been in the least surprised to
have seen him dancing at the Bal de Famille, if his duties had
not required his attendance elsewhere. Such a Bal de Famille.'
Fishermen dancing with fisherwomen; and on my word they
seemed the " best set." The rest of the company reminded me
of a dull evening at the Hall-by-the-Sea. And the gambling!
People writing to the papers about Monte Carlo when Boulogne
is ten times as bad! Baccarat played every night and ruining
scores, hundreds! As for the Chemin de fer, well—I can only
say that I lost three hundred francs at a single sitting! I am
going home at once by that nightmare of my childhood, the all-
the-way-by-sea-and-river London Boat!
French Rosycrucians.
Under the exalted patronage of the Comtesse De Paris, the
"Rose of France" has been adopted by the Royalists as their I
distinctive flower, and they have instituted among themselves
a new Society, entitled, the "League of the Rose." An apt
addition of the rose to the fleur-de-lys—a new alliance of lilies
and roses. The " League of the Rose" may be considered the
French counterpart of the British Primrose League. Revolu-
tions, we know, are not made with rose-water; but the rose
appears to have been appropriated to serve the purpose of a
Legitimist reaction. By wearing it in their button-holes and
displaying it on their banners, the confederates of the Rose
League appear to have persuaded themselves that their prospects
are couleur-de-rose.

ON THE STUMP.
CnrRcn and Stage.—Strictly speaking, the word "Mummer"
cannot be applied to an Actor, and both in the title Mummer's Wife
and in the recent artiole " Mummer "Worship," with which Mr. Irvtng
"did well," though perhaps not wisely, to be angry," the word
"Mummer" is used contemptuously of the regular professional Actor.
But such application shows ignorance. "Momerie " is denned in the
best French theatrical dictionary as, "Mascarade, bouffonnerie,
deguuement de gens masque's pour alter danser, jouer, se rejouir."
And the first Mummer was Momus, the professional jester, the Merry
Andrew, the Tom Fool of the Court of King Jove " in the air, Of the
skies Lord Mavor." Let those whom the Mummer's cap fits, wear it,
but most certainly neither Mr. Irving nor Mr. "Wyndham need be
hurt by anything written against Mummers and mumming. Can
it be true that Henry Irving refused to speak at the Church
Congress simply because he would have been brought in contact
with Momerie in any shape? If so, it is a pity, as Momerie in his
own shape at the Congress was in excellent form; and though
with Momerie "Mum s the word," yet on this occasion he
spoke out strongly, and did his best with "Pessimism." The
Church Congress, owing to the abstention of the leading Tra-
gedian (his health in a glass of "Pommery," which rhymes to
Momerie!"), felt some delicacy in dealing with the subject of
Irving and the Irvingites, and so let it alone. But—aha!—a time
will come!

-A long dinner-table, garnished with spiky plants languishing
their native pots. Visitors discovered consulting Wine-list,
which they do with knitted brows for some minutes, and then
order whiskey and soda. German Wniters get in one another's
way, and quarrel in whispers. Late comers enter, either
sneakingly, as if inclined to apologise to the Head-waiter, or

PICTURE-GALLERIES FOR THE PEOPLE.
Picture idiotarum libri sunt; but there are idiots and idiots—the
simply illiterate and the imbecile. The latter have been provided
with an abundance of pictures, which, adapted to their capacities,
serve them instead of books; namely, the numberless pictorial adver-
tisements on the walls and hoardings which they can run and read.
Most of these posters are calculated merely to catch the idiots' penoe,
but many appeal to their propensities, particularly oartoons repre-
senting scenes from revolting stories and exeorable dramas. Go
where they will, creatures of vile impulses and weak intellect are
gratified by figures, ohiefly female, falling stabbed or shot, or the
victims of savage and brutal assaults and outrages, sprawling on the
ground.
Is it really true that the works of High Art coUeoted in National
Galleries, and other piotorial Exhibitions of the better class, exercise
an elevating influenoe on the minds of the people who contemplate
them? Because, then it may reasonably be supposed to follow that
a degrading influence is exerted by illustrations of robbery with
violence, and ferocious homicide, upon beholders of the baser sort.
Idiots of that description need give themselves no trouble whatever to
go and see those hideous productions of the pot-boiler's paint-brush,
the puffs of abominable novels and atrocious plays. The peculiar
picture-galleries established to attract the multitude, stare them
everywhere in the faco—exhibitions on view from morning to night
every day of the week, and all of them open on Sundays, when the
others credited with improving the minds and cultivating the taste
of the masses, are mostly closed. Supplied as the idiots are with a
profusion of pictures which cannot fail to afford them diabolical
suggestions, what wonder when some of them are occasioned to
reduce those horriblo imaginings to practice?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Brought to book.
THROUGH THIS PACES.
Small Talk from Scotland Yard.
Chief Commissioner (blandly). So you want to enter the Detective
Department. Well, what are your qualifications. (Briskly, as if
springing a mine on him.) What can
you do? [Eyes him attentively.
\-t ij E/Sj i I.'iJ ft»l) i'. Candidate (taken aback). Well, I can
—! i- £^m K^/firPr,V do almost anything. (Considering.)
Leastways—anything that ain't much
out of the common. (Tentatively.) I
can ventriloquise a hit.
Chief Commissioner (impressed). Ha!
What can you imitate?
Candidate. Well, I can do a man's
voice up a chimbley, and cocks and
hens, and a cove a-sawing of a beam—
(with increasing confidence) and I can
do Joe in the Copper.
Chief Commissioner (encouragingly). I see—a character part; and
I suppose you have had some experience at Private Theatricals P
Candidate (feeling he is getting on). Bless you, yes, Sir, I should
rather think I had. I 've played Box, the Armed Head in Macbeth,
and the Third Officer in the Lady of Lyons, and (generalising
vaguely) a lot more of that kind. I'm a splendid hand at "making
up," I am.
Chief Commissioner. And could no doubt undertake a Variety
Entertainment. You know what I mean, don't you? You bob down
behind a table every minute, change your costume, and come up as
somebody else. You think you could embody various characters r
Canditate (reflectively). Well, Sir, I think I could,—most of 'em.
Anyhow I'd try.
Chief Commissioner. Just so. (Pauses a minute—then suddenly,
as tf just struck with the idea.) By the way, are you accustomed to
the management of bloodhounds?
Candidate (hesitating). Well, I can't say as how I've ever had
much to do with them. But (with confidence), I knows all about
beagles. But, bless you, Sir (smiling as if at the Commissioner's
fears), I ain't afraid of the 'ounds. I'm very fond of dogs, and should
soon get into their ways.
Chief Commissioner. Quite so. (Summing up.) Well, I don't think
there's anything else. (Struck by an afterthought.) Wait a moment,
though, I forgot. You are able to march? Know your drill, eh?
Candidate. Yes, Sir.
Chief Commissioner. Have served in the Force P
Candidate. Yes, Sir.
Chief Commissioner. Are well known to all the Constables?
Candidate. Yes, Sir.
Chief Commissioner. And (coming anxiously to the point) to all
the thieves, pickpockets, and burglars f
Candidate (with alacrity). To every man Jack of 'em, Sir.
Chief Commissioner (eagerly). Are you sure?
Candidate (triutnphantly). Cook sure, Sir.
Chief Commissioner (with enthusiasm). Then that settles it.
You'if do. [Passes him, rejoicing, into Detective Department, as
scene closes.
VOCES POPULI.
AT SOME HIGHLAND SPORTS.
Scese—A Glen in the North. On a rock above, the non-paying
Public are perched, as a Poet present remarks, "like sea-birds."
Below, an enclosure surrounded by rough seats, Local Magnates
in waggonettes and dog-carts, fyc. On a platform a Piper is
seen strutting round, performing, with infinite satisfaction to
himself, upon his instrument, while a Jury of three take notes
solemnly tn a tent. In an adjoining field a small party are
playing football, with an ostentatious unconsciousness of any
rival attraction, that is possibly due to some private pique. The
Piper ceases with the weird suddenness with which he began,
and marches off; a Rival Piper, in the dead silence that ensues,
calls out, "Very well played, Lacklan Mackinnon!" At
which Mr. MacKinnon seems to be inwardly confounding his
friend's impudence. Another Piper mounts the platform, and
performs apparently the same air. Other Pipers criticise, and
compare notes.
First Piper. John Macphairson played that " Shaoil a Bhiodh"
ferry well, but he was mekking one or two slips. He went wrong
here and there—he did that.
Second Piper. Aye, he didna bring out the drone eno', to my
thinking. Hoo d'ye play the " Masther o' Mar o' Shean," Kenneth
Macrae P
First P. Oo, ah, I must be thinking. (After a silence.) 7 begin
it this way (hums in Second Piper's ear, confidentially): "Dum-
dee-ee-eee-ah-ee; ah-oo,'di-doo, di-de-ee." That is how J play
"The Masther," Angus.
Second P. I do not tek it the same way—this is mine. (Buzzes
in First Piper's ear.) "Dee-ee, eeee, ee-ah, a-a-ah, di-doo."
First P. (after giving the buzz careful consideration). Yes, that iss
a good way, out I wass thinking there will be more of the music
in mine.
Third P. At Tobbermorry I gained first prize—I do not care who
hears me—though it was only the seoond medal I wass getting
whateffer!
Fourth P. It iss true—I was quite ashamed of the chudging
myself.
Third P. Mirover, they told me I was to play anything but
"Gnaillibh a chHle," my favourite tune.
Fourth P. It is ill chudging when the Pipers will no be playing
all the sem tune.
A Chronic Cockney (patronising one of the Pipers). Sovou'aven't
got your great man down 'ere this time—the Champion Piper, you
know!
Piper (who considers himself second to none on his instrument).
And who wass he?
The C. C. Why, Shasttjs McRannoch—they tell me he got all
the medals at Inverness last year.
Piper (loftily). Did Shamus play the pipes? I wass not hearing
of it; he puts the stone, yes, a little—and the caber, he can toss the
caber, too; but I wass not effer hearing that he played the pipes.
The C. C. D'yer know 'oo's winnin' now among you pipers, eh P I
suppose they give the medal to the feller who kills the most old cows.
Shouldn't care about being on the Jury myself, yer know. I'd rather
be set down to class the tom-cats in my back-garden at 'ome.
Piper (politely). You will be understanding more about the tom-
cats and such things.
The C. C. I've eard, though, that the sound of the bag-pipes will
call a dead 'Ighlander back to fife—either that or the smell of whiskey
—whusky, you call it, you know. But, between you and me now,
you don t call that beastly row you make music, do yer—honour
bright now P (Finds the Piper has turned away; the C. C. tells a
friend that he has " Just 'ad a very pleasant conversation with one
of these fellows—very intelligent chap—I like going among the
natives yer know, and gettin' to understand them and that.")
The Sports proceed; the Hammer is hurled, and on one occasion
causes infinite amusement to the " Sea-birds," by just missing
one of the Judges. The Spectators nearest the Enclosure show a
less keen sense of humour. The Cabet—a rough fir-trunk,
21 feet long—is tossed, that is, is lifted by six men, set on end, ana
placed in the hands of the Athlete, who, after looking at it doubt-
fully for a time, poises it, raises it afoot or two, ana runs several
yards with it, after which he jerks it forward by a mighty effort
so as to pitch on the thicker end, and fall over in the direction
furthest from him.
A Lady Spectator (disappointedly, after a Competitor has at length
succeeded in accomplishing this difficult feat). Don't they toss it any
further than that t
A Native. Oh, aye, Mem. I hef tossed it three hundred feet and
more myself.
The Lady. Have you, indeed—and where was that?
Native (modestly). Over a cliff—from the top right down to the
bottom.
The " Egg and Spoon race "—a contest peculiarly characteristic of
the Hardy North—is about to be run; the Competitors assemble
in line, each dauntless youth holding a spoon in which an egg
reposes.
Simple Little Wife. But tell me, Alfred, what happens if one of
them drops the egg?
Afred (readily). Oh, he has to sit down and eat it instantly with
the spoon.
Simple Little W. How curious these old Highland customs are!
The Athletic part of the Sports are over by about 4'30 p.m., and the
reels and sword-dances begin. Four reels have been danced, and
six sword-dances.
Mrs. Campbell, of Loch Gorrie (to Mr. Senterbord, who, finding
that it is nearly six, and there are eight more people waiting to dance
the sword-dance in turn—is retreating quietly). You really ought not
to miss the Highland Fling—it comes next on the programme.
Mr. Senterbord (departing). Oh, I won't—I '11 drop in to-morrow,
after the Regatta.
Dancing continues; fourteen separate sword-dances and fifteen
entries for the Fling. Local Magnates, who are not compelled
by their position to remain, drive off yawning, and commending
the quality of the bag-pipe playing. Magnates whose Pipers
have won a medal receive congratulations suspiciously^ from
London friends. Outside the grounds, other fine old Highland
Sports r' Putting the Cocoa-Nut," " Glass bottle and Steamed
Eg// stalking," and " Tryingthe Weight," are now in full swing.

IS DETECTION A FAILURE?
In the interests of the Gutter Gazelle and of Hie Criminal Classes, the Sensational Interviewer dogs Oie Detective's jootsleps, and throws the strong
light of publicity on his work. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that Detection should prove a failure.

Seemed not a bit fagged when the business was done.
I'm sure Butter-making looks capital fun.

Songs without Words.—From The Musical World (whose critio
by the way politely observes that it would bo " ungracious to quarrel"
with the Savoy librettist for calling his plot " new and original" after
taking its essence from Maritana,—but would it have Deen "un-
gracious to quarrel" with Sulbebt had the Opera been by two writers
called Sulbebt and Gillivak ?) we learn that Sullivan's Mikado is
now being performed daily at a Danish Cirous at Stockholm. "No
words are given," but it is " acted and danced." Of course it is un-
precedentedly successful. Why not try this plan on alternate
nights with the Beefeater's Bride; or W. S. Merryman and hit
Merrytana f The arrangement would draw enormous houses, con-
sisting of those who, having once heard the words and music
ether, would like to hear again and again Sir Abthur's charming
the pretty dresses and the mise en scene.
PLAY-TIME IN THREE PLACES.
Before this appears, M. Mayer will have commenced bis season
of French plays at the Royalty Theatre. Those who know Halevy's
delightful oook L'Abbf Constantin, will be curious to see what kind
of a play it makes. Certainly, if closely adapted, and if the actors
enter into the spirit of the original work, it should be an exception to
the majority of French pieces, which are forbidden fruit to the
"young person," and can only be thoroughly enjoyed by those who
can honestly adopt Charles Lamb's view of the Comic dramatists
and the actors or the Restoration. M. Halevy has done much to
atone for the brutal materialism of Zola-esque literature with his
perfectly pure and thoroughly natural characters in the Btory of
L''Abbe Constantin. The best specimen of M. Halevy's cynical
humour is bis M. et Mme. Cardinal. In his tenderness, his human
sympathies, his searching analysis of character, his sarcasm, and
his cynicism, M. Halevy seems to me to approach nearer to
Thackeray than any other French author I can call to mind. He
has the advantage over Thackeray in being also a dramatic author,
though I think his most successful pieces have been in collaboration
with M. Metlhac and others, as it usually takes from two to five
French authors to make a play of any sort, even an ordinary farce.
In this instance, M. Ludovic Halevy's story has been dramatised by
MM. Cremleux et P. Decourcelles.
"The Jodrell (late Novelty) Theatre" was announced to open this
evening. The Jodrell (late Novelty) is not a good title for a Theatre.
When a Novelty is late, it is no longer a novelty. This theatre ought
soon to be in vogue as curiosity may at first be aroused by some one
at a dinner-party inquiring of a friend across the table, "Are you
going to The Jodrell to-night?" or "Come to The Jodrell!" or
"Shall we Jodrell together this ovening?" Jodrell is a good word,
and may be used as a verb, as the Germans use "jodel."
Fancy a theatre called after the excellent Earl of Shaftesbury! A
new meeting-house, a novel Exeter Hall, yes;—but a theatre! I should
as readily have imagined a French Theatre called after Bossuet, or
an English one after Jeremy Collier. But as some one has some-
where said [before, and more than'once, I believe, "What'j in a
name?" Jack in the'
e'Box.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
At a time when more or less nonsense is talked and written about
the status of the Actor,—recently rather Moore than less,—Mr. Fitz-
gerald Mollot's Life and Adventures
of Edmund Kean will interest a large
number of readers on and off the stage.
I should be inclined to say that Edmund
Kean was the greatest histrionic genius
the English Stage ever saw, not except-
ing David Garrick. There seems to
have been no single department of his
art in which he did not excel. He had
a strong sense of humour (in which
the Kembi.es were deficient), he could
execute acrobatic feats, was an excellent
mimic, could play pantomime, could
burlesque tragedy, could sing, play,
dance, fence, excite laughter, inspire
terror, draw tears, and extort enthusi-
astic applause from most unsympathetic
and occasionally antagonistic audiences.
He conquered all along the line. As for
"social status," he could have been
whatever he liked to be, a peer among
peers, had that been his desire; but he
was what he chose to be, and what at last he despised himself for
being.
"Social Status," forsooth! What is "Status"? The answer
will be found in Whitaker's Almanack, where you will learn the
status of everybody,1 from the highest rank down to a cab-rank.
"'Tis in ourselves that we are thus and thus." Conventionality is
the sworn foe of genius. Real Genius cannot rest satisfied with
humdrum middle-class respectability. Poor Kean! A staunch
loyal friend, a wilful man of generous impulses, lavish with boon
companions, but mean where love and. duty demanded generosity,
the self-indulgent victim of a designing woman and her highly
respectable husband, pelted, hooted, broken by disease and intem-
perance,—what a finish to a brilliant career!
Mr. 1 itzoerald Mollot is an impartial biographer, neither use-
lessly blaming, nor needlessly moralising, but writing with oharit-
able sympathy for the human errors of the man, and with honest
scorn for the Pecksniffian Pharisee, who cannot understand genius,
and is quite as unable to imagine, as he is unwilling to make allow-
ances for, the dangers which beset the path of any public favourite,
especially that of an extraordinary histrionic genius. "Alas, poor
King of shreds and patches!" Baron de Book Worms.

DUE NORTH.
Excursion to a Waterfall—The Wicked Uncle's Strange Story.
Next Morning.—Rain, and occasionally half-hours with the best
sunshine. Good Aunt and young ladies have driven off to pay a few
neighbourly calls within a radius of fifteen miles or so, do a little
shopping,—no matter how bare the village, where there are ladies
there is always shopping—and lunch out. Wicked Uncle feeling a
bit rheumatic, says that as I am not accompanying the shooters, he
will show me a beautiful Waterfall, not a very great distance off. It
is so damp and cold that I propose taking the least drop possible of
whiskey before we start. Wicked Unole negatives the proposal with
prompt decision. I agree with him, and totally abstain. We start,
carrying macintoshes and umbrellas. From talking about sport we
get to scenery: from scenery to the extent of the Laird's property:
from this to a comparison with other big properties: and finally, by
a very easy and natural transition, we arrive at the vast estates of
which the Wicked Uncle would now be the proud possessor, as I
understand him, but for the machinations of the Machiavelli in
petticoats, whom I have heard "D. B." irreverently term "Mary
Queen of Squats." For this unfortunate sovereign the Wicked
Uncle cannot find epithets sufficiently insulting. Hitherto I have
imagined myself pretty well posted up in the history of this ill-used
lady, whom I have always championed as a victim, if not a martyr.
But the Wioked Unole tnrows an entirely new side-light on Mart's
character. He speaks with the conviction of a contemporary who
had known her personally, and who had suffered a great wrong at her
hands, which he is in a position to prove up to the nilt. Itisourious
too, that in his narrative he brings in scarcely one well-known his-
torical name. I listen with momentarily increasing interest to the
commencement of his story when the Wicked Uncle suddenly stops
near a small inn, and observes that he is not quite sure if there isr?t
a shorter cut to the Waterfall than the road we are taking. He will
'1 inquire within." We enter.
"Mornin'," he says, addressing a very youthful bar-maiden, who
smilingly returns, "Good morning, Mr. Fraser," and immediately
pours out a small measure of whiskey, empties it into a tumbler, and
pushes the water towards the Wicked Uncle. "Will youV he
asks, hesitatingly. It is my turn to decline with thanks. He drinks
it off, observes that this will make him feel a little less chilly, and
adds that he was wrong to have refused it at starting. Then as he
is leaving I remind him that he hasn't asked the shortest way to the
Waterfall.
"Oh," he replies, "I think I remember it."
And as we resume our walk, I ask him to go on with his narrative,
in which I am already deeply interested, not so much on bis behalf,
as for the sake of the good name and reputation of Mart Queen ot
Squats.
My ancestor," the Wicked Uncle recommences in a gloomily-con-
fidential manner, his countenance flushing slightly with the air and
exercise; "my ancestor was Sir Weedie Fraser, of Kantork, the
Master of the Sentences in the Scotch Chancellene, you know—he
was the Fraser, you may remember, who threw himself across the
doormat, and declared that if they wanted to get at the Queen, it
must be over his body—you recollect, of course"
I have a vague recollection of some incident of this sort, and so
•f " Yes, yes," and he continues, "Well, he was the descendant
erdie of the Whirlpool."
"Why Whirlpool ?" I ask.
"Because," answers the Wicked Uncle, somewhat testily, as if
annoyed at my ignorance, "he lived in a castle where no one could
get at him without crossing a whirlpool"—(I am satisfied)—" and he
refused to pay the Queen a road couop."
I do not like to irritate him by inquiring what a '' road collop " may
be, and so nod my head as a sign of intelligent assent which seems to
relieve his mind of some considerable load as he quickens his step,
and proceeds with his narrative in a more cheerful tone.
"A road collop, to which she was no more entitled than yon are.
So from that minute she hated him. Mart never forgave, you
know "—(I was not aware of this, but I think it safer not to dispute
the assertion)—" and she was determined to take it out of him some-
how; and, by Jove, she did. And," he adds, bitterly, "our family
lost about a hundred thousand pounds by it."
"How?" I ask, stopping to put on my macintosh, as the rain is
beginning again.
How!" returns the Wicked Uncle, sarcastically; and then,
suddenly changing his tone, he says, "It ■ such a nuisance walking
in macintoshes. We'd better take shelter in here." And I follow
him up a narrow path to a small oottage, over which there is a
board with the intimation that Mrs. M Clean is licensed to sell
spirits. "Mornin', Ma'am," says the Uncle, politely.
"It's a wee bit moist, observes the dame, returning his saluta-
tion, and forthwith produces a whiskey-bottle, two glasses, and a
jug of water. I sip mine. The Uncle, complaining of rheumatism
in the left arm, which he can scarcely lift, he says, and which is
evidently quite different to the other, which he can lift easily, dis-
poses of his "wee drappit" at a draught; and, as I walk to the
window to watch the weather, I fancy he repeats the dose. The
rain ceases, and once more we are on our road.
"Are we near the Waterfall?" I ask him.
'' The Waterfowl ?" he asks; auditor the moment he appears quite
oblivious of the main object of our walk. Then, as if suddenly
recalling it, ;he answers somewhat indistinctly, "Oh, yes,—we're
quite near now,—there's a short out somewhere off this road."
"Good/' I return, not feeling such perfect confidence in the
Wicked Uncle's topographical knowledge as I did at starting.
"And now, what had Mart Queen of Scots to do with your losing
theproperty?"
He walks a little slower, and regards me fixedly, as if failing to
comprehend the exact bearing of my question. I repeat it, and
remind him at the same time at what point of his story he had
arrived.
"Ah!" he says, " Yes! "—as if the whole narrative were once more
coming' back to "him more vividly than ever. Then he mutters vin-
dictively. "Mart was a bad 'un,—a regular right down bad 'un."
"But, I ask, being unwilling to contradiot him until I have
heard what ground he has for the assertion, "what did she do to
Weirdie of the Whirlpool?"
'' What!" he exclaims, hotly. '' She fascinated him. He fell in love
with her, deserted his wife and ohildren, made over all his estates
to her. She gammoned him into a marriage. They were privately
married in Scoop Castle"
"Oh, my dear fellow!" I cannot help protesting, "what proof I
can there be of this?" |
"Proof!" he exclaims, stopping still. "Proofs! We have the
documents in our family. There are whole roomfuls of old papers.
When the wretched creature had got all she wanted out of .him, she
was afraid of bis betraying her, and so she had the poor devil stabbed
in several places at onoe, and when he was on his death-bed some old
abbot or monk wrote down the story as it came from the dying man's
lips, when the whole truth came out"
"What became of the document?" I ask,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
""We've got it somewhere. I remember my father and grand-
father talking about it. It's in an old house belonging to our
family "Here he stops and stretches out his stick as if making
a point. "The Waterfall's up there," and he indicates a path
through the garden of a pretty littlehostelrie which calls itself "The
Falls Hotel.'*
A tidy landlady appears at the door.
"Mornin', Mrs. Bhaithwaite!" says the Wicked Uncle.
"We 've still got some of that old whiskey you used to be so fond
of, Sir," says the tidy landlady, by way of reply.
Have you?" he returns. "Ah—well," he says, looking at me,
"we must taste that. It's no use trying to get to the Waterfall to-
day," he says, looking at his watch: "Must back t' Lunch,"
and he takes down the nip with real relish. We bid the tidy land-
lady good-bye. When we are about a hundred yards down the road
the Uncle discovers that he has left his umbrella behind. He won't
be a minute; only just back to Mrs. BBArrHWArrE's. In something
under a quarter of an hour he returns. He seems to walk with some
difficulty. This he attributes to rheumatism.
On our way home he is less communicative than he was. He seems
to regret having confided to me his family grievance. I ask him
why he doesn't publish the family documents P I remind him of the
existence of the Old Manuscripts Commission, and point out how
valuable these documents in the possession of his family would be.
"Think," I say to him, "of the new light these papers would throw
on the controversy as to the truth about Mary Queen of Scots."
But the Wicked Uncle preserves a dogged silence. Once he mutters,
bitterly, "What's—doose— use— nowr" After a time he uses
strong language about Mary Queen of Scots, then he relapses into
silence, and, with his head bent, he either seems to be carefully
watching his feet, or to be walking in his sleep.
We walk on, but our pace is delayed by the Wicked Uncle,
who insists on carefully picking his way so as to avoid the slosh and
mud, in which, however, he is not signally successful, as any effort
to keep clear of a puddle on his right sends hi™ into another on his
left. On every occasion he exclaims, in the most good-natured tone
possible, "Bless the Queen!" a formula which he uses as a substi-
tute for more forcible language. Whether he is blessing Mary
Queen of Scots, or our own Gracious Sovereign, I haven't an idea,
but he is no longer stern and vindictive: and when I try to intro-
duce afresh the subject of "road collops, Werdie'slast dying speech
and confession, the Old Manuscript Commission, and the search into
his historical papers, he only stares at me with a blank expression,
shuts his eyes, opens them, and says in a tone of helpless resignation,
"What's—doose—use P"
We reach the house. Long after luncheon time. The Wicked
Uncle begs me to " 'sense him a minute as must write a port'nt ler."
Neither ladies nor shooters have returned. The attentive butler has
kept luncheon hot for anyone who may come in. No sign of Wicked
Uncle. I finish lunch. In the library (not the bookshelves in the
smoking-room where the literature is limited to the New Newgate
Calendar, Illustrated, and one or two other books already
specified), I find Robertson's Scotland in ten volumes. I examine
the index, and retire to our bachelors' quarters in the Annexe
with several of them. Now I will read up the subject, and
refute the story I've heard this morning. I sit down with note-book,
pens, ink, and paper. Light pipe. Storm. Afternoon becoming
darker. Candles necessary: I am still at work on the subject (not
having yet come across any mention, even in the earliest history, of
Werdte of the Whirlpool), when I hear a loud shout, muoh laughter,
then the watch-cry of the Lochglennie Clan, "How are you r™ and
my door is opened by D. B., who exclaims:
How are you? What have you been doing with the Wicked
Uncle?"
"Nothing," I protest. "Why P"
"Because," says the Laird, with a quiet chuckle, "when the
housemaid went to light the fire in the smoking-room, she found him
fast asleep in the waste-paper basket."
"I know," says D. B. to me, "he's been telling you all about
Werdik and Mary Queen of Squats, and he always finishes like that.
He '■ all right now. How are you?" and on they go to their
dressing-rooms.
I read no more of Robertson's Scotland, and shall not write to the

"Oh, my Dear Mummy!"—In last September's Number of The
Universal Review there was an article on Mummer Worship," and
in the Ootober issue there is a graceful and witty poem by Sir
Edwin Arnold, which might be called Mummery Worship, as it is
addressed to a pair of old slippers in the Egyptian Exhibition.
Perhaps they were Cleopatra's. Certes,_ Sir Edwin, that female
sarpint was a slippery sort of person. The pictures, signed "J. B. P.,"
possess more than artistic merit, as they exactly illustrate the poem
without departing one iota—or rather one " Delta "—from this dream
of Old Nile.
IMMORTALITY INDEED!
Lord Ronald Go web, it is said, "has been at work for twelve
years" on a Btatue of Shakspeare, which has now been presented to
the town of Strat-
ford - on - Avon.
Shakspeare,
says the descrip-
tion of it in the
Times, "is here
represented as
seated, with a
quill in his right
h a n d." How
original! how
clever! in his
right hand! not
behind his ear,
or in his mouth,
but absolutely
in his right
hand, as he must
have actually
used it, unless
he were left-
handed. And to
think that the
renowned sculp-
tor was only
twelve years
over this great
design!! Well,
well!! Wonders
of genius will
never cease.
The descrip-
tion goes on —
"his left care-
lessly thrown
over the back of
a chair" — how
graceful! how
natural! "Care-
lessly," you '11 observe—" and holding a roll of manuscript." Now
who but a born genius would ever have dreamt of representing
Shakspeare in such an attitude, and with these properties, "apen
in his right hand," and a "roll of manuscript in his left. _ What
perfect symbolism! "Beneath him,"continues the description
but there, what matters what is "beneath him?" Suffice it that
there are figures of Lady Macbeth, Falstaff, Hamlet, and Prince Hat.
Then there are '' comic and tragic masks' — here's original symbolism
foryou!—and there are "pilaster angles," and "astragal entablature."
We wouldn't have had it without these last not for worlds. Then
there are "emblematical plants, fruit, and flowers cast in bronze."
"The monument," says the reporter, proudly, "has been pre-
sented to the Shakspeare Memorial Association by Lord Ronald
Gower, and its value is estimated at several thousand pounds."
Crafty reporter! "Estimated," indeed! By whom? By Lord
Ronald? At how much? "Several thousand pounds." Nonsense!
—much under the mark—say "millions." But then, why millions?
"A thing of Beauty is a joy for ever"—and is priceless. After
the luncheon, that Past Master of post-prandial oratory, and himself
no mean sculptor, Mr. George Augustus Sala, in his happiest vein,
proposed "The Immortal Memory of Shakspeare," but not (at least
according to the report), "coupled with the name of the eminent
Sculptor, Lord Ronald Gower.' As Parisians now possess a statue
of the " Divine Williams," can anything more be done to prevent
Englishmen forgetting Shakspeare r No. The Bard has been chiselled
by Lord Ronald Gower, and his Immortality is at last assured.

METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS.

CALLING TO MIND AN OMISSION.
An evening paper, last week, filled several columns of
its pages with a list of the robberies that have taken
place of late in various parts of London. One entry was
to the effect that twelve months back, a bottle of lozenges
was stolen from the .shop of a chemist, and there were
other announcements of equally startling importance.
Strange to say there was no reference to the disappear-
ance of brains some years ago from the office of the paper
in question—from the Editor's room—brains that seem -
inirly have not since been recovered.
Conundrums.
No. 1.—Of what use was Vincent Howard in the
Detective Department?
No. 2.—Of what use is he anywhere?
*.* A prize icill be given for a moderately satisfactory
solution of eitfier of the above conundrums.
A Suort Act of Parliament is pawed, providing that no Man shall be
ALLOWED TO OCCUPY THE INSIDE OF AN OMNIBUS UNTIL EVERY LADY IS SEATED.
Sir Morell Mackenzie, in bis "Reply," has performed an eminently
successful operation on the German "Doctor Wasps." He has taken the
sting out of their tales.
Heioho, Bacche!—In the Timet, last Friday, its
Correspondent at Vienna, wrote, under the heading,
"AUSTRIA-HUNOARY : "—
"The vintage baa begun all over the Empire, hut the wine
will be everywhere poor in quality, and not much in quality.
There never was within living memory such a bad year for
vines."
This is bad for Austria-Hung'ry, but it's worse for
Austria-Thirsty.
"What is Worn " is the title of an article on Fashion
in the Daily News. "I can answer the question, 'What

ANTICIPATIONS OF NEXT LORD MAYOR'S SHOW.

[" The Lord Mayor Elect wishes the Procession to be worthy of the occasion, and the Corporation of London. He is opposed to the introduction ol
the Circus element and allegorical display, which accord neither with his own taste, nor, in his opinion, with the dignity of the City."— Vide the Fapert.]
The Fathers of the City were seated in the Council Chamber,
engaged in a deep consultation. It was within measurable distance
of the Ninth of November, and consequently the Lord Mayor shortly
was to proceed in state from London to Westminster.
"This is a more than usually interesting occasion,"observed one of
the Fathers, gravely. "It is possible that we may never have another
Lord Mayor,—leastways, not the likes of them as we have had."
"'Ear, 'ear!" murmured an Alderman of the old school, who had
passed the chair.
"And this being so," continued the other, "I hope, I do hope,
that the Show will be worthy of the event. For instance, I trust, I
do trust, that the City Marshal will be seen a-riding in front of it all,
a-mounted on horseback?"
"My objection to the Cirous element has become historical,"
returned the Lord Mayor Elect, with considerable dignity.
"And I do beg," continued the Alderman, ignoring the interrup-
tion, "that we shall have the mcn-in-armour. I may say that with-
out the men-in-armour the day would go for nothing. The Missus
—I should say my Lady wife—and the young 'uns like to see the
ancient knights, and without them the day would go for nothing."
"Don't say that," remonstrated an Alderman, thin and smart,
with a pince-nez, of the]new school. "You are forgetting the
banquet. You can't say a day which gives you a fair menu goes for
nothing. C'est blaaue, mon cher; or, as we used to say at the dear
old 'Varsity, garruia lingua nocet.'"
Then came a chorus of the discontented. They followed one
another like a chime of bells.
"Yes, but how about the ancient knights—are we to have any
men-in-armour?"
"And surely we are not to be cut out of our banners?"
"And the fire-engines—ain't we to have any of them t"
"And I do like to see a Life-boat. It gives such a benevolent air
to it all, you know."
"And the Rangers—them with the guns—what about them?"
"The procession will worthily represent the dignity of the City of
London," replied the Lord Mayor Elect, evasively.
"Yes, we know all that," observed another Alderman, rather
coarsely, "and that the surplus saved out of the Show is to be given
to a charity. But what is the Show to be like? Ain't we going to
have any gals in tights seated on globes as Britannia., and all that
sort of thing?"
"I am not very fond of the allegorical."
"Oh, gammon!" continued the critical Corporationist. "Let
the young 'uns have a chance. If it ain't too late, why not have a
giraffe or a couple of elephants from the Zoological Gardens?"
"Gentlemen, returned the Lord Mayor Elect, with dignity,
"believe me, I am not unmindful of the importance of the Metropolis
of the World. I believe you will find that the Procession will uphold
by its magnificence the best traditions of this great centre of
civilisation."
And amidst some sounds of dissatisfaction, the meeting dissolved.
When he was alone, the future Chief Magistrate of the City of
London knitted his brow in the profoundest thought.
"What shall I do?" he murmured. "They are never satisfied!
Have I not selected a West-End Coachmaker? Have I not contrived
a card of invitation that should provoke the admiration of the whole
of the civilised world? What more would they have? May I not
S" ve up the cumbersome Beadles, the useless Commissionnaires? And
rsooth, the Procession—the real Procession—with myself in a
brougham, and the City Marshal on the box—is not sufficiently
ornate for them! Well, I must contrive something better—some-
thing that by its splendour shall catch the fancy of the ground-
lings."
And so late into the night and far into the early morning the Lord
Mayor Elect pondered. Day was breaking when, with a shout of
triumphant joy, he jumped to his feet.
"I have it!" he exclaimed, "I have it! Splendour without
vulgarity! Comfort and dignity! I have found the happy mean."
A fortnight later all London was anxiously waiting the approach
of the annual Procession. It came. But to describe it the pen fails.
And that being the cose (as will be seen by the sketch above) resort
has been had to the Artist's pencil.

CAVE CANEM!
(A Page from, a Diary kept in the Neighbourliood of Whitehall.)
8 a.m.—Upearlyto visit Hyde Park, where I want to test the value
of .some bloodhounds as applied to the discovery of crime. Make the
acquaintance of two full-grown brutes, who examine my boots with
suspicion. I am glad on the whole that they are under restraint. It
is suggested that they should hunt me. Cannot very well refuse,
but would far rather have left that sort of thing to an Assistant-
Commissioner. However, not to be done. Half of them recently
resigned, remainder (lazy people!) no doubt still comfortable in bed.
Never can teach my subordinates the value of early rising!
9 a.m.—Just reached the Powder Magazine. Had to run for my
life. For the moment have distanced the bloodhounds. Inspected
the sentry, and got him to give me over bis orders. Quite right; no
smoking to be allowed within ten yards of the gunpowder—very
proper precaution. Afcareless smoker, throwing away a lighted
Inciter, might set the place on fire. Bricks and stones ignite so very
easily. Obliged to be off again at the double, as I can hear the
snarls of the bloodhounds, who are once more on my track. Hope
they will spend a few minutes with the sentry before they follow
me.
10. a.m.—Brutes still pursuing me. Concealed myself in the Park-
keeper's Lodge, and was nearly arrested on suspicion of being a
distant relative of " Leather Apron." That's the worst of offering
a reward! It causes so many innocent people to be taken up for
nothing. No time for more. Just squared Park-keeper, and am off
again. Trust the brutes will have a bad quarter of an hour with the
custodian of the gardens before they resume their pursuit of me.
11 a.m.—Just escaped. Not a moment too soon. Hadn't reached
the Marble Arch a minute before the hounds sighted me, and made
for my boots. Only time to jump into a Hansom, and drive to
my Club.
12. NCOS'.—Finished my lunch, and enjoying a few minutes' rest
in the smoking-room. Early edition (2nd) of the evening news-
papers, just arrived. Why won't they leave me alone P Several
suggestions that I should resign. Half a mind to—would if those
horrid beasts, who I can hear barking outside, would only under-
stand that I had given up the Police. Committee just sent polite
note, presenting their compliments, and calling my attention to the
rule forbidding the admission of dogs into the Club-house. Appears
that the bloodhounds have rushed into the hall and eaten my hat
and umbrella. Committee are under the impression that the hounds
belong to me!
1 p.m.—Occupying my room in Whitehall Place. Got away from
the Club, without my hat and umbrella, by a back entrance. Will
give strict orders that I am not to be disturbed. Have called down
the tube, and can get no answer. Have just remembered that I have
sent the entire Staff (disguised as washerwomen) to Whitechapel, to
look about them. Don't much like to be alone with those brutes on
my track.
2 p.m.—Just as I expected! They have traced me, and I can hear
them on the staircase. Wish I had a revolver. Great nuisance that
the lock of my door is out of repair. They are sure to come in! As
I am a man of ready resource, have hidden myself on a shelf over a
water-bottle. Have always heard that water destroys "the scent. I
can hear the bloodhounds sniffing outside! Most annoying to be all
alone. Wish I was back at the Soudan!
3 A.M.—Have been for the last hour on the shelf. The dogs have
made my room their own. Have watched them from under a pile of
newspapers. Fortunately, they have preferred devouring my des-
patches to searching for me. Boy just Drought in my tea. Before I
could speak to him they had begun to hunt nim! For a moment I
am alone.
4 p.m.—Back again on my shelf. The intelligent beasts (far too
intelligent!) after disposing of the tea and muffin-boy, have returned
to hunt me. I am safe for the moment, as they are devouring my
cocked hat, sword, and top-boots. A great nuisance as they (the
cocked hat, &c), form an effective portion of my favourite costume.
Cat's meat man outside. Can hear his cry. The bloodhounds have
heard it too, and have disappeared to hunt him. Saved for the
present!
5 p.m.—Brutes back again. They have discovered me! I am
keeping them off with a poker and a bag of biscuits. My shouts
should be heard. Really, these people obey my orders too literally.

A STRAIGHT TIP.
"Can't say I huite like the Cut of that Suit of yours, Governor!"
"What! Why, confound it, Sir, my Tailor's tub Best in London!"
"Ah, dessay; but you should try our Chap down at Eton—hx'h the
man! And you might just mention my Name, you know!"
When I said that everybody was to be off to Whitechapel, I did not mean, of
course, that Whitehall Place was to be deserted. Wish I could induce the blood-
hounds to go opposite to pay a visit to the Commissioners in Lunacy. Not that
they woula tina them (as they are always 'from town inspecting outlying asy-
lums), but they might have a little fun with the Secretary, who is a fixture.
6 p.m.—Still on my shelf. The bloodhounds are engaged at this moment in
eating some dog-muzzles and my box of decorations. And now they are ready
for a spring! Well, I will make a good fight of it!
7 p.m.—Saved! Six perfect strangers have rushed into the room. The brutes
are seized and handed over to the proprietor. The bloodhounds in handcuffs
(applied to their legs) are now being carried off in triumph. Very grateful to
my rescuers. It appears that the six perfect strangers are prisoners who have
been arrested on suspicion. As they have done me such a signal service, I
can but release them. I have less compunction in giving them their freedom, as
I find that they have all been staying for the last three months in a boarding-
house at Margate. From this I fancy it is improbable that they could have been
concerned in the sad affair at Whitechapel.
8 p.m.—The staff of the office have just come back. They have returned,
having arrested, by mistake, one another. This is most satisfactory, as it is
proof that they must have been admirably disguised. Am on the eve of leaving
the office for home, having^ just issued an order that the use of bloodhounds by
the Police will be suspended, until further orders.
TRANSYLVANIAN SPORT.
(From Our Special Sportsman with their H.R.H.'s.)
Last week the Prince of Waxes and the Crown Peince went outto shoot
bears. The bears behaved in their usual bearish manner—they are regular
beasts—and refused to meet their Royal Highnesses. Beaters—in their beau-
tiful old gold-beater-skin costume, still worn here (and by the bye, the Court
Plasterers also stiok to their ancient dress in this Conservative State)—went
into the woods and forests with the Gold Sticks in Waiting, and made noise
enough to wake the sleepiest grizzly. But Bruin wouldn't show himself, and
though we waited in the plains below for hours, yet we saw nothing. The
scouts came up, and in broken English, which they've learnt out of compliment
to our Prince, reported, "All bear!" so, thinking they meant that "All the
bears were coming," or that "the bears were every-
where," we got ready, presented, but didn't fire.
L' Ours—voild Vennemi! But there was no Ours.
One of the Half-Crown Princes out with us (any num-
ber of them about—plenty of change), tried to make an
international joke about waiting hours for an ours"
but he was hushed down by both the Princes, and I had
to tell him afterwards, that as he really couldn't pro-
nounce either Frenoh or English properly, he had better
keep his jokes in those languages to himself. Poor dear
Half-Crown! he was so sorry, but he soon laughed it off
when I called him "Young Two-and-Sixpence,"which
set the whole party in a roar just when the only bear
that has been seen all day showed its nose round a corner.
If we hadn't been convulsed, that bear would never have
lived to tell the tale, but as it was, bang went all our
barrels, and when the smoke cleared off, all I saw was
the Half-Crown Prince going head over heels backwards
down the rocks, owing to the violent recoil of the gun
when he was laughing, and three of the chasseurs
jumping about, chucking their plumed hats in the air,
and shrieking with pain, though, being courtiers, they
had to pretend it was their way of expressing excessive
annoyance at the disappointment their Roval Master and
his distinguished guest had suffered. "Mark, Bear!"
shouted a Styrian Count in pink tights, green and gold coat,
and leather Ijoots with spurs. But it was a false alarm.
No more at present, as the Royal Currier is just leav-
ing, and ho 'U have nothing to curry if I don't send this
despatch. We 're all well. Don't talk of making a place
"a regular Bear-garden." This is one, and as quiet as
the Great Desert on a Sunday night.
• • • • •
P.S.—I re-open this to say that I'vo bit on a plan
which has met with the approbation of everyone. I
kept it dark till now! My fortune's made!! I brought
out a buy of buns from England, the very same sort that
they \give to the bears at the Zoological. I am now
going out baiting traps and tops of trees • • • •
Sure of sport!!! I expect nothing less than a Mar-
quisate for this, with a chateau, and any number of
thousands a year, to keep up the Bears in this district.

TALKING IT OVER Ux\DER DIFFICULTIES.
"On the occasion of the Emperor William's visit to tlio Vatican, his
Majesty evaded the repeated attempts of the 1'opk to discuss the nuestion of
the temporal power of the Papacy."—Daily Paper.
In the absence of any more direct information on tho subject, the
following brief dramatio version may be confidently regarded as an
authentic account of the termination of the rather embarrassing
interview to which the above paragraph refers:—
Scene—An Audience Chamber in the Vatican. The Pope dis-
covered according a private interview to the Emperor of
Germany, in the course of which he has made several attempts
to introduce the question of the "Temporal Power," but has
been successfully foiled by his Imperial visitor, who, by keeping
up a rattling fire of conversation on any and every subject, from
the weather downwards, has managed, daring the fifteen minutes
the interview has already lasted, as yet completely to evade the
introduction of the, to him, unwelcome topic. The PorE, feeling
that the time is slipping away, and that it is no good beating
about the bush any longer, at length determines, at all hazards,
to take the bull by the horns, and bring matters to an issue.
Tlte rope {cutting the Emperor short in a humorous account of the
failure of the Prince of Wales, in his recent expedition, to get a shot
at a single bear). Ah! very droll, your Majesty; very droll. But I
wish to speak to you about a very different matter {coming to the
point)—the Temporal Power, you know
The Emperor {quickly). Ah! The Temporal Power. Just so. Of
course {airily changing the subject as he approaches the window).
Dear me! {looking out) I had no idea, your Holiness.' was so well off
here. What a capital garden!
The Pope {continuing). You know, it is necessary
The Emperor {brightly, misunderstanding him). Of course, it is
necessary. Pegged up, as you are, here, it must be quite a resource
to you {flgain looking out), and there seems a good lot of it.
The Pope {ignoring his misinterpretation). I mean it is necessary
to the exercise
The Emperor {cutting in briskly). Of course it is necessary for
exercise; and, I'm sure, I'm very glad your Holiness is able to get
it. 1 doubt it you would be able to get on without it.
The Pope {still holding on). To the exercise of my spiritual
functions, and so its restoration
The Emperor {catching at the word glibly). Restoration! To be
sure. That's going on everywhere. All over the place, in fact.
Quite a rage for it. Such lots of new Boulevards. I fm sure I don't
know what they won't restore next.
The Pope {determined to get it out). And its restoration is the
only sure guarantee for the security of European Peace.
The Emperor {flying off at a tangent gaily). Peace! Ha! Of
course—The League of Peace. Just been cementing that over the
way at the Quirinal. Fancy, too, it looks like certain success.
The Pope {still slicking to his guns). Your Majesty, there is only one
thing certain, and that is that Rome must come back.
The Emperor {merrily). Come back P From what I have seen,
I should say it was more inclined to go forward. (lfrith a good-
humoured wink.) But, of course, your Holiness knows best.
The Pope {nothing daunted). It must become Papal Rome once more.
The Emperor. Ha! hum! exactly. Quite so. {Feeling things
are getting hot and changing front, with sudden effusion.) But, by
the way, what a delightful afternoon it seems to be turning out.
Quite pleasant, I declare. And that reminds me. {Jumping at
Happy Thought.) I really must be going.
The Pope. What, going without settling anything?
The Emperor. Settling anything? Why, yes, everything is
rather unsettled, isn't it? {Beating a retreat.) Hum! Yes!
Precisely. Just so. Of course! {Taking his leave respectfully.)
Anyhow, it is so kind of your Holiness to have received me. Enjoyed
our talk so much, you know. 'Pon my word, I have.
[Bows himself out, and joining his suite with " evident signs of
deep emotion" depicted on his countenance, leaves the Pope
shaking his head, conscious that he has had a not very satis-
factory interview with a remarkably unmanageable and
troublesome young man.
ROYAL YISIT TO HIS OWN CAPITAL.
On Wednesday last London was brilliantly lighted to honour the
arrival of King Foo, who paid his first state visit of the season to his
own capital. He entered the City on the East, and proceeded in
triumphal procession towards the West. On reaching Kensington
he returned. His Majesty also visited the suburbs. The royal
progress was celebrated by grand fantasias on A Thousand Respira-
tory Organs, Baron Bronchitis was out with his Bandannas borne
by four hoarse-men. The Actors of London, with bad colds, were
represented by Mr. Hermann Wheezin, and in the train of King
Foo followed the celebrated General De Pression, with deputations
from the various states of Ill-health and Indi-gestion. The rear was
brought up by bands of Roughs, Burglars, and Policemen at a
respectful distance. His Majesty has been taking a slight rest
during the last few days but he has no intention of quitting the
Metropolis for some time to come.

OUll BOOKING-OFFICE.
For those whose musical memories are
well stored, Dr. Spark's Musical Memories
have not much novelty to offer. All the
professional people of his acquaintance seem
to have been as nearly morally and socially
perfect as may be. He is quite a "good
Griffith," (not the safe man with an s,"
but the oral biographer of Cardinal Wolsey)
in his reminiscences, and thereon is much to
be commended. De mortuis nil nisi bonum.
But how interpret "bonum?" I should
say in a biography let us translate it as "a
good thing" about so-and-so. Well, he
has some "good things" in this sense,
and he tells them in a sufficiently lively
manner to warrant me in alluding to
him as "The Vital Spark." He tells very
naively of dinner-parties at Path's on
"off nights"—which seem to have been
rather ,p'On' nights"—when "at the in-
vitation of Sthakosch he had an opportunity
of dining with the family party" — he
means the family Patti — ("sometimes
strengthened," he goes on, whispering in
brackets, "by two or three influential
critics) at their charming house, Rossini
Villa, Clapham Park. These indeed, were
delightful times." &c, <Src. Clapham rather
discount* the Rossini" of the Villa. On
the whole, very nearly, Vital Spark's book is
chatty and amusing for any half-hour un-
occupied.
The Autobiography of Sims Reeves is a
thrilling Romance. It opens with a sensa-

► 'ANDICAPPED!"
Qaol-Mrd (having just picked "Landlord's" pocket). "Amerikin Watch! Shabby Old
'umbuq !—and 'im a man o' property too! ugh! wliat 'ith downright fraud like

tional murder, and the book, like Prospero's Island, is "full of strange noises." There is
not enough about Sims Reeves himself, details of his studies, and so forth.
People are going about laughing—all business is suspended—chuckling and nudging is the
order of the day. No more coughs and colds. Try Toole's Reminiscences. The Booksellers
are all making jokes over the sale of Boswell Hatton's Toole's Reminiscences. A person
went to one in Hatton Garden, and asked if he had one of Toole's reminiscences. "No, he
Hatton't," was the reply. And then the office-boys danced and cheered, and one who had
previously rushed out with five-and-twenty copies under his arm, returned with, "Sold
again!" I read bits of it here and there in the Sunday Times, but must sit down to
it quietly, and be strapped into my arm-chair. A Physician will be at hand, to prevent

One Moore book, called Spring Days. Even the Pall Mall Gazette describes it as "a
nasty dish," and can scarcely find a chapter without some "flagrantly bad taste." This being
so, perhaps its author will change its title to Spring Onions. This is a matter of taste for
perfumery. Spring! Spring! beautiful Spring! Loveliest Onion of the Year! sings the
Lady of Shalot (at a distance) to her own Bahon Df. Book Worms.

The Very Rev. Rutland liar-
CHURCH AND STACE; OR, ST. JAMES'S THEATRE.
The Dean's Daughter is an unwholesome, unpleasant, poorly-
constructed play, with here and there some sharp, flashy writing-,
which is more acrimonious than amusing.

the author of
Ariane and As
in a Looking
Glass, which
last was the
novel that
made Mr.
Philips's re-
putation.
Ariane dra-

erful drama.

shown to be thoroughly miserable. But in this play at the St. James's
the Divorce Court, lite "the Waveriey Pen," comes "like a boon
and a blessing to men," and women, too, and such small virtue as
there is in the piece, or what the authors would have us accept as a
substitute for virtue, is rewarded by Messrs. Grundy and Philips
by giving the divorced woman in marriage to the nominal co-respon-
dent (after he has shot another would-be co-respondent, his rival),
who clasps her to his manly breast in the presence of.her former
husband (whom the divorce "has freed in order to continue a liaison
with somebody else), and of a third lover—a mere boy who might as
well have been in Eton jacket and turn-down collars, with apples
and sweets in his pocket,—whose hand and fortune this injured
innocent, introduced into Society under an assumed name, has just
accepted. On this " heroine of the Divorce Court," before or after
her marriage, an audience cannot waste its sympathy, as before
marriage she is not in love with anybody,—though she foresees the
probability of her being so with somebody after marrying the wrong
person,—and, with her eyes open very wide indeed, she allows herself
to be induced by her reprobate father, whom she despises, and her
odious companion, Mrs. Fortescue, to marry a fortune and a title.
Miriam St. Aubyn[h an ungrateful part, prettily and cleverly, if
not brilliantly, played by Miss Olqa Nethersole, who is possessed of
considerable emotional power, can rise to dignity of action, and has
the true touch of pathos in her voice. She comes from the Adelphi
to play the daughter of the Dean, and her place in The Union Jack
is token by another of the Dean family,—Dorothy Dene. Another
coincidence is, that the Christian name of Lady Ashtcell in the piece
is Dorothea, and as she is to marry the Iter. Augustus St. Aubyn,
she also will be a Dorothy Dean.
I suppose the somewhat scrappy dialogue is mainly taken from the
novel, and of this Miss Hill has all the telling lines, which, intended
to be the comic relief of the piece, she delivers as though she were
once more Cynisca, in modern costume, impersonating a sort of
vixenish chorus, making a running commentary on the action. Does
Miss Hill correctly interpret the Authors?
Sir Henry Craven is one of the line of old diplomatists that com-
menced, I fancy, with Baron Stein. Here, he is a dummy Sir Peter
Teazle, who marries a young girl in the country, and then reminds
her of what she was before she became his wife. This Sir Peter
should have been stuffed full of good things, and killed in the entr'acte
after Act III., when he would have died deeply regretted by a
numerous Dress Circle. As it is, he has little to do, nothing worth
hearing to say, and reappears inopportunely as Lord Anticlimax in
Act IV., just in time to spoil a fairly effective dramatic situation.
Miss Adrif.nne Dairolles, as the French Maid, is uncommonly
ood. How she would suit that wicked French part in Bleak House!
'rince Balanikoff, the would-be co-respondent of foreign extraction,
looks like a melancholy Polish Jew, and his walk reminded me of the
little mechanical tin-toy man drawing the cart, of whom we've seen
so much recently, taking his exercise in the streets. Miss Hill says
"Ta, Ta, Prince." to him. This exactly desoribes him. When the
Russian is scratched, you find the Tar-Tar Prince underneath, and
his violent scene is his best, melodramatic though it must necessarily
be. Last, but certainly not least, comes the Very Revd. Rutland
Barrlngton, Dean of St. James's. He looks the Dean as well as
did the late John Clayton, but he is so intimately associated with
Mr. Gilbert's Vicar, who wore much the same costume in The
Sorcerer, that any audience would never be surprised were he to
step forward and, to Mr. Armbruster's excellent accompaniment,
sing, "Ah me, I was a pale young Curate Men." Perhaps Jester
George will provide him with lyrics describing his regret at having
quitted that company with the refrain, "An me, I was a stout
young Actor then!" But, pooh, bah! He is Manager now and
Comedy actor. He has to play a part in which there is little wit and
no finesse; it is the Reverend Mr. Pecksniff and Lady AshwM
is his Mrs. Todgers. But Pecksniff, sober or inebriated, was amusing,
and then in the end, he failed in his villany, and was only let oft
with a sound thrashing. The Dean is unpunished, for the possible
loss of Lady Todgers' hand and fortune wouldn't affect him very
much. The best-played scene, which does not owe much to the
writing, is the one between Mr. Lewis Waller and Miss Nether-
sole, wnen the heavy haberdashery-young-man kind of lover tells
Miriam that her wishes are his commands, and says farewell for
ever—only to reappear in the same place five minutes afterwards. •
The play is preceded by a One-Act Comedy called A Patron Saint.
At present the St. James s Management must be contented with one
Saint as a Patron for the evil Dean's doings. 1 fancy the patro-
nage will not be considerable, either of saints or sinners.
To come from such exceptionally unwholesome " home produce ™ as
The Dean's Daughter to so exceptionally wholesome a French piece
as L'Abbe Constantin, is as refreshing as escaping from an infected
atmosphere into the pure air. M. Lefontaine is perfect as the Abbe,
a genuine French type. The delicacy of his art is a study, but there
is no call upon him for any strongly emotional acting. The two young
men's parts are fairly acted. Miss Jane May, "My Pretty Jaite,"
is not seen to advantage, and the piece, though pretty and simple
enough, is deficient in any real dramatic interest. On Thursday,
M. Lefontaine is to appear in Le Fits de Famille, and M. L'Abbf
should be reserved for occasional Matinees. Jack-in-the-Box.
DUE NORTH.
Evenings at Lochglennie— Wtather Notes—Finale.
Our evenings are lively. Miss Millie plays the piano, Miss
Evelyn is a violonist, and Miss Madge a banjoist. They all know
each other's music, and can play from memory almost any song or
air that may be " inquired for."
D. B. is a proficient on the penny whistle, and Dolly White is a
master of a small, peculiar-snaped instrument, of Italian nation-
ality, called, I think, the occarina, which, when placed close to the
performer's lips, makes him look as if he were doing a conjuring trick,
and pretending to swallow a baby's shoe. Grannie plays a mirloton,
which he has brought from Paris. The Baron's instrument is the
cornet-a-pistons, but, as the Good Aunt, who is our sole audience,
declares she cannot possibly stay in the room with that noise, we
insist on the Baron performing with a pocket-handkerchief stuffed
into the cornet, the effect of which is very much as if he were
playing it under the bedclothes. The Laira has made a life-long
study of the side-drum. From his earliest years he was always
attached to it, and it was attached to him,—by a string. Now his
performance on it is that of a Professor. He is a Master of the Rolls.
"Very few people," he says, when he finds you are inclined to
talk seriously on the subject, "very few people know what there is
to be got out of a drum. It is not all noise. How effective it is at
military funerals, muffled!"
This seems rather a gloomy view to take of it. When an invi-
tation is sent to the Lau-d to attend a funeral, do they add on his
particular card, "and bring your drum, muffled"? I don't like to
ask this, and he continues, it is the Juniversal instrument. All
nations have the drum."
"And chickens have drumsticks," puts in D. B. And by way of
showing us that his remark was not meant seriously, he nods at me
and savs, "How are you P"
The Laird insists on my being provided with an instrument. The
Wicked Uncle refuses to resign the triangle, which, he protests
pathetically, he has played since the second night he came here, and
wants to know why I shouldn't have the fire-irons, as he had when
he first arrived P This proposition seems to be considered as fair and
iust, and so Grannie hands me the poker and shovel, with which I
nave to serve my apprenticeship as it were, with the reversion of the
triangle, on the departure of the Wicked Uncle. We are aU in our
places, with Miss Millie at the piano. The orchestra is wonderf ully
successful. Perhaps the most effective of the morceaux is a song
sung by D. B., entitled "The Man that struck O'Hara," which
offers peculiarly fine opportunities for the side-drum and the fire-
irons. There is one part—a pause—where the chorus leaves off, and
only the side-drum and the fire-irons come in with one tremendous ■
crash, illustrating the force with which "the man that struck I

197
O'Haha" was floored by the latter's friends, who, to avenge his
injuries, dragged his asssailant—
"Down the passage, down the stairs,
Over tables, over chairs—
Scarcely time to say his prayers"
Then, I think, in the awful pause that follows, oomes the whack of
the drum, together with the crash of the fire-irons—a most dramatic
effect—as the chorus immediately bursts forth with savage exultation,
"Rags and bones were all they left
Of the man that struck O'Hara."
This so delights us all, that we play it over several times, on each
repetition finding some new beauty in it, and finally finishing it with
almost barbaric intensity.
The Good Aunt looks at her watch. "Half-past ten. 1 God Save
the Queen,' if you please, Gentlemen," she says, and, in compliance
with the request of our audience, we give the National Anthem with
full orchestration.
Then comes the last ceremony of the evening. Every lady who
retires at ten is entitled to "Musical Honours"—that is, "By Order of
the Laird," each lady is escorted down the passages to her room by the
male contingent of the orchestra, in full marching order. So Grannie,
as drum-major, walks first; then come the ladies with bed-
chamber candles; then the band, at quick march, playing "Bou-
langer's March" alternated with the "British Grenadiers," as
we call at the different rooms, and, having seen all the ladies to their
apartments, we right-about-face, and march briskly back to the
appropriate and inspiriting air of "The Girl I Left Behind Me,"
until we reach the Smoking-room, where we are disbanded, and go
from labour to refreshment.
Next Day, and Day after, and several Days after that.—Rain
persistently. Waterproofs and umbrellas required, if only to walk
about the garden. It sounds paradoxical, but it's true, or ought
to be, that, when it's wet. it is fine for fishing. Plenty of fish in the
river, but they remain there. I go on the moors, when they're
driving, and catch a severe cold.
Next day stay in, and see the sport from window, as the shooters
are visible to the naked eye as they p-o up the hill.
Happy Thought (as I see them m the distance).—"How happy
could 1 be witn heather"—if it were only dry, and not such a
trouble to walk through.
At my Window.—They 're having good sport, judging from the
reports I hear. Reports becoming more and more distant, and only
miniature mechanical toy-men and puffs of smoke can be seen through
glasses. "Lookers on see most of the game." Quite untrue at this
distance, as I see most of the men and nothing whatever of the game.
Grannie, the fisherman, returns, despondently. He has lost his
best fly, which has been taken by a prodigious fish. "So," says he,
"I was spoofd over that." Ho thinks it rather hard to be
"spoofd." But he has had no luck. "Are the flies," I ask,
—meaning a whole pocket-book full of them such as he has got—
"expensive?" "Yes," he replies, "they cost a goodish bit; but,"
he adds, in the tone of a disappointed man, "so does all sport.
What's the use of climbing over moors, or wading up to your neck
in water, merely to be spoofd in the end?" I admit that this does
sound hard. We talk sport generally, and I obtain some valuable
information. Has he been lucky in horse-racing ?" No," he replies
—"lost." Then he adds, with playful irony, "It's 'osses makes
the 'oof to fly." This, I presume, is a new sporting proverb. Play
on the words. "'osses" and " 'oof," by dropping the "h." "No,'
he explains, "oof means coin." Lnde dericatur "Oof"?
I keepprivate Meteorological Notes. We begin with,—
Any Day. —10 a.m. — Rain. Everything wet — turf, garden-
seats, &c, &c.
10'30.—-Sun. Everything dry.
11.—Scorching. Must change things to summer'suit.
11'30.—Am in summer suit. Deluge of rain. Change again.
Gaiters, goloshes, thickest boots, umbrella, sou'wester.

vapour-bath. Birds singing. Open all windows. In-doors unbear-
able. Gnats, flies, wasps, Dees. Hang up waterproof, get rid of
gaiters, goloshes, &c. Return to summer clothing. Go in to lunch.
Doors and windows open. Iced drinks. At lunch arrange for walk,
going out in canoe, under shady trees, on river's bank. Lawn tennis,
if not too sultry, or sit under trees, in American chairs, reading.
2"30.—Transformation scene! Quick change! Torrent of rain.
Driving wind from S.E. Rush for waterproofs. Chilly. Arctic cold.
3.—In-doors, putting on winter things. Lighting fires. Shutting
all windows. Sit down to be comfortable.
4"15.—Suddenly, sun, tropical heat again—let fires go out—go out
ourselves—going to be fine r No—weather suddenly (every change
in Scotland is sudden,—the people are cautious, but the weather is
impulsive) becomes mixed, and, to express it musically, we have no
longer a solo of sun, or of rain, or of wind, nor do we nave a duet of
rain and wind; but we have a wonderful trio of sun, rain and wind,
in unison!!
It is a Grand Meteorological Opera. A magnificent symphony, or
cantata,—water-cantata,—might be written entitled The Weather,
which idea I hereby offer to Sir Arthur Sullivan or Mr. Gortnq
Thomas or Dr. Mackenzie, with my compliments, and "no fees."
All that is required to-day, as the shades of evening gather round
us, is that the _ First Aot of the New Meteorological Scotch Opera
should end with a magnificent ensemble of rain, hail, thunder,
lightning, snow, all this to the "sun's setting, and with fine
"passages for the wind." These last can be found in the house and
outbuildings. As somebody sings, " So the Story goes," and so it
goes on for ten days,—and then, on the first fine day, I go off.'
No help for it; I've made all my arrangements. Must depart.
There's no doubt about it. This is the first fine day, and bid fare-
well I must to Lochglennie, and the last words that salute my ear as
the train moves off come from D. B., who rushes to the corner of the
platform, and just as the train is getting up its speed shouts, "How
are you?" To which, the remembrance of Grannie's ill luck flashing
across my mind at the moment, I have only time to reply "Spoofd!
And " spoofd" I am by the weather. And now " Bock agen!"
And so ends my ten days' holiday Due North.
DIVINE SHAKSPEARE AND THE GREAT SCOTT.
Immortal Dramatist and Novelist! Spell Scot with a single " t,"
and it will stand for Lord Ronald of the Sculptor's chisel. This
coincidence has
struck a student
of Scott's Bor-
der Minstrelsy,
and, though too
late for last
week's issue,
some verses
have arrived
from " An Old
Parlour-
Border Min-
strel," which
he says he has
adapted from a
familiar old
Scotch ballad to
the occasion of

Why not Moliere for London, Lord Ronald, my son?
'Twould be but politeness, my handsome young man.—
Oh, I'm weary of Paris, mither,—mak my bed soon;

The "Old Parlour-Border Minstrel" adds that "this, with
the drone of the pipes, will enchant all hearers." For the sake of
metre, he wishes Paris" in the penultimate line to be pronounced
"Parrs," as one syllable; that is, if we see no objection—and we don't.
Important Portent !—Mr. Irving, who is always making good
speeches, made a telling one at Bolton, which, as reported, seems to
have consisted principally of one lengthy but most appropriate
quotation. But what was really remarkable was that, from begin-
ning to end, he never once mentioned "Friend Toole." How's
this?_ Where was Joseph Bos well Hatton to note the portentous
omission? John Lawrence will address " Friend Irving with the
words of the song that Miss Grace Damien sings so charmingly,

And I am scarcely " mild," to friend or foe.

Then Lachesis! Yes—that's the style of head
For her who, under guidance, spins the thread
Of Policy—which is a kingdom s life.
Lachesis knows the woe of inner strife,
For all her haughty Hapsburg lip. Spin out
The long thread lightly; veil that look of

Which on the face of Clotho dwells and lingers.

As what e'en they obey may order it.
And that, the higher overmastering source
At once of web and shears, of fate and

Well, the wise ancients left that agent vague;
And so will I. It is the petty plague
Of little minds to pry.
My picture! So!
It does not follow Michael Angelo
With any servile closeness, I admit. He
Painted those pitiless hags that in the Pitti
Freeze all men's marrow with their stony

The gazer who can front those orbs might dare
To meet Medusa's petrifying glance.
But times must change, creeds shift, and Art
advance.

For the Three Modern Fates; much less
malign
Than massive Michael's, yet prepared to act
With iron promptness. A political pact
Like this should? bid all war and tumult cease,
Since the Three Fates form now a League of

OUR NEW M.F.H.
Mr. Topple, our new M.F.H., has decided to hunt the Hoitxds himself; but finding it impossible to remember tiieib
Names, he has adopted the above capital Plan.
ROBEKT'S ESTONISHMENT.
I have lived to see the day wen a Cheerman of a Copperashun
Cummittee has publickly dared,—without a blush, as far as I coud
see, and I fixt my eglegaze upon him as he spoke,—to xclaim to an
estonished crowd, Water, brite Water for me! and give your
wine to the trembling Debbawshe!" How the three or four
ancient Deputys as herd him liked the strange words of course I don't
know, but this I do know, that when a few ours arterwards the
Cummittee was all seated cumferally together at their faverite
Gildhall Tavern and me a waiting on 'em, as ushal, they all drunk
the plucky Cheerman's good helth together, and chaffed him most
tremenjusly about his watery speech. But he bore it all chearfully,
like a man and a brother, and tossed off a bumper of fine old Port
after thanking them for their kyind wishes.
So I needn't have bin so werry grately alarmed at the Cheerman's
xtrornary speech, but he ewen did wuss then that on another simmy-
ler ocashun, as I will now perceed to relate.
It seams as the Copperashun, not kontent with setting up the best
Skools, and the best Libery, and the best Markets, and the best
Bridges in all the hole City, has lately gorn into the Parks and Open
Spaces line, and after spendin about a quarter of a millvun of money
in buying Epping Forrest, as I herd the Cheerman of the Cummittee
say ony a few weeks ago, has quite lately took charge of Highget
Woods, and wen sumbody arsked leave to put up a Fountane there,
so that the pore littel boys and gals as goes there coud wash there
hands, and setterer, the Copperashun not ony allowd it, but sent down
a Cummittee to see as it was all rite, and to take charge of it, and it
was on this ocashun that the Cheerman made the owdacious speech I
have menshuned. I was there, and,I herd what was a going on, and I
scarcely xpects to be beleeved when I says that sum of the pore littel
children, dreckly as the Cheerman's back was turned, acshally went
up and drunk sum of the werry cold water, pore littel things: The
Cummittee might y have let it run ginger beer just for wunce. But
wuss remanes behind. For ony larst week the same Cheerman took
down the werry same Cummittee to take over another Fountane, as
another liberal minded Gent—tho' he is a blooming Conserwativ—
had offered to give for the Queen's Park at Killburn, which is another
of their good won.
It was a bitter cold day, so the bteziness was got thro' rayther more
quicker than afore, and wen the liberal conserwatif Gent had made
his nice little speech and anded over his nice littel Fountane, the
Cheerman stood forrard, and I coud see a wisibel shudder run through
the elderly members of the Cummittee for fear as he shood commit
hisself as afore. But no, he awoided the dellicate subjick alltogether,
and made one of them bewtifool littel speeches as only Cheermen can
make, and the Cummittee was ewidently much releeved in their
minds speshally the old uns. But, wunderfool to relate, insted of
dessending from his stony pedestal of glory and retiring gracefoolly
amid tho peeple's cheers, he acshally filled a pewter cup to the brim
and quaffed it off without a shudder, and called upon his Committee
to boldly stand forward and do likewise! Oh, the grim smiles upon
their oountynancys was a sight to see! One ancient Deputy endevourd
in wane to conceal his disgust, while another had the pluck to boldly
annownce what all the others dowtless thort, namely, that he shood
prefer it with jest a leetle drop of old Skotch whiskey in it!
And now jest one word of frendly warnin to my kynd Patrons.
It's trew, as I'm told, that the Board of Warks, having failed to
give sattisf action by living on nothink but Work and Water, is about
to give place to another Board with a different name, but with the
same hutterly himpossibel condishuns, and you may be thinkin of
haltering your old successful, becoz libberal, plan of hopperashuns,
to catch a little fleating poppylarity. But it will be a orful mistake,
for while it will chill and disappint your frends it will ony excite
the contemt of your fos. . 11 (Robert.
WHAT 'S-HIS-NAME AND THE SATURDAY REVIEW.
In answer to numerous Correspondents, we beg to state, on more
than undoubted authority, that,—
1. The " Saturday Review" will not in future appear every Tues-
day. 2. That it will be edited by its Editor in London, and not in a
Cottage near the " Merrie Green Wood." 3. That its Editor is
sot going to undertake the chief direction of the Detective and
Private Inquiry Department of the Police under the sobriquet of
"Pollocky." 4. That neither Mr. What's-his-natne nor Mr.
What-you-may-call-um is engaged on the paper. 5. That every
report put about by Thingummy Bob when he was rather Thingummy
Tight is hereby emphatically contradicted.

HISTORY AND MYSTERY.

of the deposed King Ja-Ja, wu highly charmed
with the railways and the electric light, but
imputed both to the inventive genius of the
"debble," "as man have no sabbey do dem
tings."—Evening Paper.']
Old English worthies never saw
The Railway or Electric Light,
Which, seen but unexplained, with awe
And wonder would have dazed their sight;
Such marvels, certis, they'd have thought,
Could be by warlocks only wrought.
Witchcraft, not very long ago,
Stood on the code of actual crimes;
Most things whose causes none could know
Were magic in the good times.
Whate'er they didn't understand,
To solve the debble" was at hand.
Grave doctors, lawyers, and divines,
Regarded, from their point of view,
As portents, prodigies, and signs,
And cantrips, to his action due,
Each new discovery science made.
Invented by the "debble's" aid.
In her philosophy, to-day,
Oueen Patience, not above a child,
Is just about as wise as they,
When faggots were for witches piled.
The learned need not boast, a pebble
They care no longer for the "debble."
A Last Flare-up !—The flickering Lord
Mayor, who will be extinguished on the
Ninth of November, has been writing to
the papers, indignantly denying that when
in Belgium he ever made the "ridiculous
statements" or expressed the "contemptible
opinions" about London {e.g., its being
the cesspool of Europe") that have been
attributed to him. Neither Mr. Punch,
nor any other sensible citizen, ever for one
moment believed that the now flickering
and sputtering Civic Light could have
"said such a tings." The idea of a Lord
Mayor of London fouling his own Mayor's
nest! Why, it would be enough to make
Whittington "turn again" in his grave.
Farewell, brave Polydore! Here comes
the Ninth of November, with the Extin-
guisher, and the next Lord Mayor's banquet
will be your " blow out!"
SEEN YOUR CRISPI?
Signor Crispi, the Italian Premier, having recently been inter-
viewed by an English Journalist, a representative from 85, Fleet
Street, was despatched to Rome to sec nim. The following is the
report that has been received from our Correspondent, which is pub-
lished with all rights reserved, but not neoessarily as a guarantee of
good faith.
I must say I was a little surprised to find that instead of being
"a short compaotly-built Italian," as I expected to see him, from
the description furnished by my journalistic colleague, Signor Crispi
was decidedly podgy, not to say stout. He received me with great
courtesy, seating himself gracefully on the only chair there was in
the room, and apologising profusely for not being able to offer me one
too.
"You have seen, no doubt," he said, with a smile, "that your
predecessor, in interviewing me; 'had not exchanged half-a-dozen
sentences with me ere he recognised in me a man to whom waste of
time and verbal banalities were assuredly little less than intolerable.'
He was right. And now what can I do for you?"
"Lend me half-a-crown," I replied, from force of habit.
To my surprise he produced the coin, and, for a moment, I thought
he was about to present it to me. However, the shrewd common
sense of the man conquered, and he replaced it in his waistcoat
pocket.
"You will pardon me, but, to please a dear little niece of mine,
aged five, I promised never to put my name on a bill of exchange,
and never to lend a sixpence to any one. I am unwilling to deceive
her."
"Well, if you will not do me this trifling favour," I replied, a
little vexed, "perhaps you will reveal the secret of your future
policy."
"With pleasure," returned Signor Crispi, promptly; "but I
must rely on your discretion to tell no one save the readers of your
paper. If you cannot give me that assurance, I must be, as we say
in Italy, as dumb as a plum-pudding, and as reticent as a mince
pie."
I gave the required assuranoe.
"Now I can tell you what I propose to do. As you are aware, we
have a secret treaty with Russia (the Emperor William brought it
from St. Petersburg, as a present for me, in his portmanteau) and
relying upon this we shall insult France next month so grossly that
we are sure to be nicely at war with her by Christmas. Consequently
I would advise you to sell for the fall."
"Most interesting," I murmured, " and now toll me about England.
I think you were in London?"
"Only for a short time—six months. But I admired your city.
Your Vauxhall Bridge Road was magnificent!"
"Did you see any of the buildings,—monuments P"
"Why, certainly, yes. Your Victoria Station was not then built,
but your Lambeth Suspension Bridge was splendid!"
"Where did you lunch?"
"At a baker's. I used to buy a crumpet, soak it well in water,
and eat it. It was really excellent!"
"Yes—and could you speak the language?"
"Only a few words. 'Cabman, you are a thief—I will not pay
you your fare!' This sentence was electric, and, thanks to the
teaching of the Cabmen, I soon learned good, strong, forcible

THE GORDON MONUMENT AND ITS MESSAGE
[On October 16, at 11-30, the Gordon Monument in Trafalgar Square was
unveiled by Mr. Plunket, the First Commissioner of Works, without speech
or formality of any kind.]
In silence! Somewhere in the wild Soudan
Lies, silent too, the calm heroic man,
Whom none of English blood henceforth may name
"Without a thrill of pride shot through with shame.
And here's his statue! Slain afar, alone!
Memory needs no memorial of stone
To speak of Gordon, or awake a thought
Of the pure paladin who toiled and fought
For England, and Humanity, and Heaven;
The record of whose life should be a leaven
Of quickening greatness in a factious age
Of petty jealousies and Party rage.
Fortitude, Faith, and Justice; noble three,
Linked by the gentle bond of Charity,
These deck his statue as they graced his life.
England, with pride and shame so much at strife
In every proud and patriotic breast,
What speech avails r Silence perchance is best.
But there's a work of his, memorial high
At once of Gordon- and of Charity,
Which we, without o'ermuch of empty speech,
May carry on. To save, to help, to teach
The young of England was our hero's aim.
To let his death destroy his work were shame.
Gordon's Boys' Home! There speaks a strong appeal,
Which every heart of British make should feel.
It cries for aid; response should not be slow;
For hearty help thereto, right well we know,
Would fill the h ero's heart with more content
Than glowing praise or glorious monument.
AN APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC.
Last Thursday Sir Arthur Sullivan gave an amusing and
instructive lecture at the Birmingham and Midland Institute on
Music. Why on Music? How perverse! Why there are a number
of subjects of which he is utterly ignorant and on which, therefore,
he could have lectured with far more benefit to himself at all events.
But Sir Arthur is unselfish, and so he told them how, in the
course of his cramming at the British Museum, he had come across
a picture dated 866 a.d. of "a concert consisting of a six-string
harp, a four-string fiddle, a trumpet, and a crooked horn.
Curiously enough," continued Sir Arthur, triumphantly, "this is,
with the exception of the horn, exactly the same combination of
instruments that we see nearly every Saturday night playing out-
side a London public-house." Ahem! "We see." "Who are
"we"f The three Savoyards, Witty S. G., D'Oyly Cartey of
Killaloe, and the eminent lecturer? Not "every Saturday night,"
but "nearly every Saturday night." "Playing out-side;" then
"we" see them on coming out, eh? This is the consequence of
an admission, a free admission. A hearty vote of thanks was
accorded to Sir Arthur for his address, in which he gave sound
advice to his hearers, and had a kind and generous word for every-
bodytof note in the musical profession.
RECKLESS WRECKERS.
On the first night of the re-opening of the St. James's Theatre,
under the management of the Rev. Mr. Rutland Barrtngton,
there seems to have been a row. Some
unprofessional critics in the gallery
objected to something that Mr. Clement
Scott, the able critic, attached, deeply
to the Daily Telegraph, had written
about "Wreckersonalirst Night," and
to prove how unprejudiced they were,
and how quietly they could behave, the
Wreckers in the gallery, who resented
the Critic's accusation, determined to
give the In-CLEMENT Scott D. T. fits;
and so the Gods yelled at him from
above, and though guarded by a chival-
rous Knight, Sir Joseph the Erudite of the "order"of .Minerva, these
rowdies followed him, threatening personal violence.! lit wasTmore
than ten to one against Mr. Scott coming off scot-free.'1 But he
did. Only—where were the police? or where was a policeman to act
as a Coast-guardsman, and rout or arrest the reckless "Wreckers "?
If they begin this with Critics what will they do with Editors!!
Guilty Cinnas will tremble if violent mob-lawlessness is to supersede
comfortable criticism. So, down with premieres altogether! Let's
have a solemn critic's night with the critics arranged on their
benohes, "a terrible show, no disturbing "wreokers" present, and
smoking allowed in every part of the house.

THE PASTELLIST OF THE PAVEMENT.
Mr. Sala—it could have been no one else—in a lively and instruc-
tive article on " Pastels" in last Saturday's
Daily Tehgraph, desoribes the art and artist
thus:—
"It holds a middle rank between drawing and
painting. The draughtsman, strictly so called,
executes his designs with the lead pencil, the pen,
or the chalk crayon. With the last he may work
on a tinted ground, he may even use brown
chalks, also he may employ red." . . . . "The
worker in pastel is essentially a worker 'in the
dry.' MoiBture is the greatest foe he has to fear."
. . . . "Instead of palette and brushes, the pas-
tellist needs only a long box, the compartments of
which are filled with coloured crayons," &c, &c.
After reading this, put a penny in your
pocket, and go and watch the method of the Pastellist of the Pave-
ment, who. brings his chalks in the morning, and walks his chalks
off in the evening. He is indeed a "worker in the dry" and
"moisture is the greatest foe he has to fear," for a shower of rain
causes him and his colours to run together. The only brush he is
likely to have is one with the police, but this is very rare, as the
Pastellist of the Pavement is inoffensive and industrious. The Art
is, from the nature of the case, low, but when the Pastellist of the
Pavement has arrived at a certain pitch—a good one in a respectably
frequented thoroughfare—there he sticks, and never gets beyond it.

"Cool as a Cucumder."—In the Times of last Thursday, Mr. John
Finucane wrote a letter indignantly denying that in a speechl at
"Windygap"—(number of blusterous speeches made at manv Windy-
gaps all over the country and by men of all sorts and conditions of
parties) — he had told the blacksmiths to shoe the landgrabbers'
horses and "drive the nails into the quick." He wrote at a white
heat from "Coole House, Caherelly, County Limerick." But if
anyone's residence should be styled "Coole House," it should be
that of the Irish Secretary, who is " cool as a cucumber." How some
of the Nationalist " Coolies" would like to give Cueumber^BALFOUB

tion, isn t it rather petty to wish to astonish an Hotel Boots? And
why on earth should I get up myself, when I 've tipped another
fellow to get me up? But suppose he forgets to call me. I've no
right, as yet, to assume that he will. To ^et up now would argue
want of confidence in him—might hurt his feelings. I will give
him another five minutes, poor fellow . . .
Getting Up.—No actual necessity to 'get up yet, but, to make
assurance doubly—something or other, forget what—I will ... I
do. Portmanteau rather refractory; retreats under bed—quite ten
minutes before I can ooax it out . . . When I have, it won't let
me pack it. That's the worst of this breed of brown portmanteaus
—they 're always nasty-tempered. However, I am getting a few
things into it now, by degrees. Very annoying—as fast as I put
them in, this confounded portmanteau shoots them out again! If
I've put in that pair of red and white striped pyjamas once, I've
done it twenty times—and they always come twisting and rolling
out at the back, somehow. Fortunate I left myself ample time.
Man next door to me is running it rather fine. He has to catch
the boat, too, and he's not up yet! Hear the Boots hammering
away at his door. How can a fellow, just for the sake of a few more
minutes in bed—which ho won't even know he's had!—go and risk
losing his steamer in that way? I '11 do him a good turn—knock at

the wall myself. "Hi! get up, you lazy beggar. Look sharp—
you'll be late!" He thanks me, in a muffled tone, through the
wall. He is a remarkably quick dresser, he tells me—it won t take
him thirty-five seconds to pack, dress, pay his bill, and get on board,
If that's the case. I don't see why I should hurry. I've got much
more than that already.
At the Quay.—People in Oban stare a good deal. Can't quite
make out reason, unless they 're surprised to find me up so early.
Explain that I got up without having even been called. Oban popu-
lace mildly surprised, and offer me neckties— Why t
Fine steamer this; has a paddle-wheel at both ends—"because,"
the Captain explains, "she has not only to go to Gairloch—but come
back as well."
First-rate navigator, the Captain; he has written my weight, the
date of my last birthday, and the number of the house I live in, down
in a sort of ledger he keeps. He does this with all his passengers,
he tells me, reduces the figures to logarithms, and works out the
ship's course in decimals. No idea there was so much science in
modern seamanship.
On Board.—Great advantage oi being so early is that you can
breakfast quietly on deck before starting. Have mine on bridge of
steamer, under awning; everything very good—ham-meringues
excellent. No coffee, but, instead, a capital brand of dry sparkling
marmalade, served, sailor-fashion, in small pomatum-pots.
What a small world we live in! Of all people in the world, who
should be sitting next to me but my Aunt Maria! I was always
under the impression that she had died in my infancy. Don't like
to mention this, because if I am wrong, she might be offended. But
if she did die when I was a child, she ought to be a much older
woman than she looks. I do tell her this—because it is really a
compliment.
My Aunt evidently an experienced traveller, never travels, she
informs me, without a pair of globes and a lawn-mower. She offers,
very kindly, to lend me the Celestial globe, if the weather is at all
windy. This is behaving like an Aunt!
We are taking in live-stock; curious-looking creatures, like spotted
pug-dog's (only bigger and woollier, of course) and without horns.
Somebody leaning over the rail, next to me (I think he is the Public
Proseoutor, but am not quite sure), tells me they are " Sootoh Short-
breads." Agreeable man, but rather given to staring.
Didn't observe it before, but my Aunt is really amazingly like
Gladstone. Ask her to explain this. She is muoh distressed that I
have noticed it; says she has felt it coming on for some time; it is
not, as she justly complains, as if she took any interest in politics
either. She has consulted every doctor in London, and they all tell
her it is simply weakness, and she will outgrow it with care. Singu-
lar case—must find out (delicately) whether it's catching.
We ought to be starting soon; feel quite fresh and lively, in spite
of having got up so early. Mention this to Captain. Wish he and
the Public Prosecutor wouldn't stare at me so. Just as if there was
something singular in my appearance!
They 're embarking my portmanteau now. Knew they would have
a lively time of it! It takes, at least, four sailors, in kilts, to manage
it. Ought I to step ashore and quiet it down P Stay where I am.
Don't know why, but feel a little afraid of it when it's like this.
Shall exchange it for a quiet hand-bag when I get home.
Captain busy hammering at a hole in the funnel—dangerous place
to spring a leak in—hope he is making it watertight. The hammering
reminds me of that poor devil in the bedroom next to mine at the
Hotel. He won't catch the boat now—he can't! My Aunt (who has
left off looking like Mr. Gladstone) asks me why I am laughing. I
tell her about that unfortunate man and his " thirty-live seconds."
She screams with laughter. Very humorous woman, my Aunt.
Deck crowded with passengers now: all pointing and staring . . .
at whom? Ask Aunt Maria. She declines to tell me: says, severely,
that, "If I don't know, I ought to."
Great Heavens! it's at we they're staring! And no wonder—in
the hurry I was in, I must have packed everything up! . . . I've
come away just as I was! Now I understand why someone offered
me a necktie. Where shall I go and hide myself P Shall I ever
persuade that beast of a portmanteau to give me out one or two
things to put on—because I really can't go about like this t Captain
still 'hammering at funnel—but he can't wake that sleepy-headed
idiot in the next room. "Louder—knock louder, or the boat will fo
without him I Tell him there isn't another for two days. He's said
good-bye to everybody he knows at Oban—he will look such an asg
if he doesn't go, after all 1" . . . Not the least use! Wonder what
his name is. My Aunt says she knows, only she won't tell mc—she'll
whisper it, as a great secret. She is just about to disclose the name,
which, somehow, I am extremely curious to know—when ....
Where am I? Haven't they got that unhappy fellow up yet?
Why the dickens are they knocking at my door? I ve been on board
the steamer for hours, I tell you! Eh? what? Five minutes to
eight! And the Gairloch boat? "Sailed at usual time—seven.
Tried to make you hear—but couldn't." .... Confound it all!
Good mind not to get up all day—now J

These two formidable and ferocious teams were both powerfully
represented yesterday in the first match of the season that came off
at the Subscription Grounds under the Thugby Association Kules,
when, owing to their well-known deadly tactics, the afternoon's play
was expeoted to be more than usually prolific in the fatalities and
accidents now commonly considered inseparable from any well con-
tested r itch, and the takings for gate-money were enormous. The
Strangers had the kick off, and upon Smith, for the Home team,
securing the ball, and making a very pretty run with it down tb*

spring, mounted on his neck, when by an adroit twist, cracking his
spine, he obliged him to relinquish it. The ball was then dribbled
rapidly towards the Strangers' goal, where a spirited scrimmage ensu-
ing. Brown and Robinson, the half-backs, speedily had their thighs
dislocated amidst a general breaking of arms and crackling of ribs.
Some brilliant combinations now followed on the part of the Home
team. Parkinson, who had already had his jaw broken, and a
blood-vessel ruptured, being, however, obliged to use his hands, a
proceeding which instantly brought Jones into his neighbourhood,

who, once more successfully repeating his famous leap, again cracked
the spine, and left his second man dead upon the field. It being
now only'within a few minutes of the ealling of time, and thirteen
of the Home team being, more or less, seriously disabled, while
only ifour of the Strangers were left to limp to their places, the
Umpire decided that the game was over for the day, and the majority
of the injured men were forthwith removed to the local Hospital from
the ground on stretchers. A riot among the betting fraternity, who
were attending the match in great numbers, that at one moment
seriously threatened to imperil the peace of the locality, was
eventually quelled by the Police.
THROUGH AN IMPERIAL HORSE-COLLAR.
It appears that during the German Emperor's visit to Naples a
Newspaper Correspondent, disguised as a waiter (what would our own
"Robert" say to such a freak?), was present at an Imperial
luncheon. It seems that King Humbert was kept on the broad grin
by the Kaiser's witticisms and practical jokes. Amongst the latter
was the admirable jest of preventing Prince Henry of Prussia from
seeing a passing torpedo-boat by pushing him back into his seat.
This mirth-provoking plaisanterie, according to the journalistic
farjon, caused His Majesty of Italy to explode with laughter,
'ortunately for the world, a record of some of the other quaint con-
ceits of William the Second has been preserved, from which the
following short paragraphs are extracted:—
A Rather Fishy Remark.—Prince Henby having cut his finger
in attempting to eat peas with a carving-knife (after the German
fashion) his Illustrious Brother thrust a couple of inches of sea-snake
over the wounded part. "What have you done that for? "asked
His Royal Highness. "I want to make it 'eel!'" was the witty
reply. Count Herbert Von Bismarck (who was in attendance)
yelled with merriment for more than an hour.
Consommi-ate Wit.—The King of Italy was taking some soup,
when by suddenly jogging His Majesty's arm the German Emperor
caused some of the savoury liquid to trace a pattern upon the Royal
shirt front. "What did you do that for? Do you know what you
have done?" inquired the Italian Monarch, rather hotly. "I owes
the soup," replied the German Emperor, in excellent English.
"I soup owes!" Count Von Bismarck (who was in attendance)
had to swallow a table-cloth to suppress smiling.
Butter and Butter.—Before leaving Naples the Emperor got up
early, and, running to the apartments reserved for his Royal host,
?lastered the passage in their immediate neighbourhood with butter,
'he Crown Prince, slipping down, sprained his ankle, and smilingly
declared that he did not like butter-slides so early in the morning. I
see," responded William the Second, "butter late than never!"
Count Von Bismarck (who was in attendance) commenced danoing
a saraband to conceal his merriment.
Orimaldi Outdone.—At the Review at Rome the German Emperor
rode rather a restive charger. His Majesty, being an indifferent
horseman, was soon thrown into the midst of the Italian Royal
Family, occupying a barouche. Immediately recovering his com-
posure, he made a grimace, and exclaimed, using the Imperial
Plural, "Here We are again!" Count Von Bismarck (who was in
attendance) stood upon his head, as a token of silent sympathy.
From the above it will be seen that, should it be considered advis-
able to produce a Pantomime in Berlin next Christmas, at the Im-
perial Court, there will be no difficulty in procuring a thoroughly
efficient amateur Clown.
"Solvitur Steamendo."—Ten days ago Sir Edw-rd W-TK-n
sailed for India in the P. & 0. Arcadia. In Arcadia there is much
to be learnt, and the Great Railway Arcadian is anxious, we hear, to
ascertain by personal inspection how it happens that the Mails are
carried distances up to 12,000 miles, and, such is the excessive
punctuality, always delivered before, not after, time by_ the
P. & 0., Weather or no" (as one of their own P. and Oets sings),
with a view of applying the same system on the S. E. R. Yes,
S. E. R. No more late trains!
A Protest.—Our " Robert" wishes it to be publioly known that
his surname is not Elsmere. "This Helsmeer," he writes, "is, as
I ear, a clergyman, and I may ave bin mistook for im, on account of
simmerlarrity of kostoom, wich is a kumplerment to the rewrunt
gent in henny case."

A PLAYGOER'S PROTEST.
Dear Mr. Punch,
I am nobody,—not even a Critic. Still less am I a dramatist
or a librettist. I am simply a playgoer, and a reader of criticisms
upon plays. And there are some matters concerning both the plays
and the criticisms which puzzle me exceedingly.
So far as I can gather, certain Critics seem to have two ways of
dealing with a man who has made a shining, and especially a sudden,
success. The one is to " slate" him with unmeasured maliciousness,
the other to beslaver him with indiscriminate praise. It is rather
difficult to decide which is the more offensive, the splenetic
slaughtering, or the fulsome gush.
I am a lover of all sorts and conditions of music, "from gay to
grave, from lively to severe," I may almost say from the sublime to
the ridiculous. I am also a great admirer of Mr. Gilbert's peculiar
humour, especially when it is wedded to Sir Arthur Sullivan's
music You may imagine, therefore, that I anticipate with immense
pleasure the production of a new piece at the Savoy. I do not $o to
First Nights, but I eagerly scan the Press notices of the new piece,
with a view of tasting, as it were, in advance the Quintessential
flavour of the treat in store for me. And if I can ootain a copy
of the Opera before seeing the performance itself, I do bo, and read
it carefully.
Of course, therefore, I promptly perused the Press Criticisms of
the Yeomen of the Guard. What a promising consensus of praise!
Gilbert at his best, Sullivan better than ever! The music was
almost bound to be good; in the libretto I should have expected a
choice literary banquet,—if the admiring Critics had not made the
mistake of quoting. Then—well, then, I began to have my
doubts.
One Critic in a Sunday paper, for instance, was
tory. Coming to particulars, ne quoted with a]
"The rose's sigh
Were an a carrion '| cry
'To lullaby
Such as I'd sing to thee, , ,
Were I thy bride!"
not nonsense.'I am a Dutchman. But I am not a
It may be that Mr. Gilbert here is the victim of a
printer's error. Bat the Critic praised the lines as they are printed.'
Another Critic, in a weekly review, quoted in braokets the words
"she be," as though they constituted a marvellously original and
humorous rhyme to " Pho3be." Hemight almost as well have praised
the novel coupling of "love'* and "dove," or the selection (by a
post-Ingoldsby poet) of "Greenwich " as perfectly antiphonetic to
spinach." A third congratulates Sir Arthur on his jood fortune
in having such lyrics as these to set to music. Such lynos as these f
Here be specimens:—
"Here's a man of jollity, "River none can mollify ;—
Gibe, joke, jollify 1 ; Into it we throw
Give U9 of your quality Fool who doesn't follify,
Come fool, follify! Cock who doesn't -crow!"
If this be not the merest doggerel with rhymes as forced as they
are feeble, what in the name of metre gone mad is it?
erally lauda-
i the lines:—
But, after all, it is not Mr. Gilbebt whom I, as a playgoer, have
to pick a bone with, but his fulsome "Critics." Mr. Gilbert must,
long ago, have cynioally laughed in his jester's sleeve at these adu-
latory inotices of his work. One can imagine what a brilliantly
bitter Bab Ballad he could make of it all.
The work, we were told in advance, with a considerable flourish of
critical trumpets, was to be "a new departure." It is certainly a
departure from the land of Topsy-turvy wherein Gilbert and
Sullivan have so long disported themselvest and wherein they
worked so harmoniously, and with so much success. But what is
itP Serio-comic romantic Opera? Possibly. But if so, the "de-
parture" oannot appropriately be called "new." I agree with
your "Jack in the Box" that, had any other writer announced
the libretto as "new and original," the Critics to a man would
have been down upon him for filching the essence of Maritana. As
it was, they very mildly accused, profusely excused, and extra-
vagantly " enthused." However, we are transferred from imaginary
Topsy-turvydom to the historical Tudor period. There u not
very much of the Tudor style about the -dialogue; there is even less,
about the lyrics :—
'Tower warders .
Under orders .
Gallaut pikemeu, valiant swordors
Brave in bearing
Foemen scaring
In their bygone deed* of daring,
... Na'er a stranger . • ....
, • There to danger —' ''
Each was o'er the world a ranger:
, To the story
Of our glory
Each a bold contributory!"
Somehow this does not smaek rery strongly of the days of bluff
King Hal, does it? That, perhaps,' would not much matter, were
it flowing or funny; but it isn't.
Enough. I have not yet seen the piece. I have no doubt that
when I do, I shall enjoy the music and be pleased with the ensemble.
But dealing with the libretto as a production for which the Critics
have claimed considerable literary merit, what it one to think—of
the Critics? \ ours, &c. Pi.ayooer.
If this is
Dutchman.
Magic and Mystery.—The following extraordinary circumstance
is vouched for by several eye-witnesses of unimpeachable veracity.
A tall man of respectable exterior, with a pale face, dark moustache,
and a peculiarly saturnine cast of countenance, was observed walking
down a street leading out of the Strand. For obvious reasons we
suppress the name of the street pending further inquiry. Stopping
for a minute in close proximity to a lamp-post, he plunged both hands
into his trousers' pockets. A sudden gleam was seen to illuminate
his countenancene was heard to mutter some words, which were
probably cabalistic, and then suddenly turned into a public-house.'
The Psychological Society has been communicated with, and M._B.
de Kolta, the inventor of the Vanishing Lady and the Pavilion
Cocoon, has undertaken to find out how this marvellously rapid and
complete transformation was effected. Augustus Dbubiolajtcs
hopes to purchase the patent for his Christmas Pantomime.
Up and Down.—The Times calls public attention to the fact that
Land which is "going down" in England is "going up" in
Australia. Well, there art places in the world where Land seems to
be continually "going up, such as Japan and other volcanic
districts; but whether'many speculators would be eager to invest in
the consequent " ground rents1' is another question.

Captain $I*akII, of % "fflp Star" fine.
IN MEMORIAM.
"Many an old voyager across the herring-pond will be sorry to hear of the
awfully sudden death of that staunch veteran shipmaster, Captain Gleadall,
of the 'White Star' Line, who for ten years had the Celtic, and later commanded
that favourite Bhip the Germanic. Captain Gleadall died at the post of
duty: he was found seated in the Germanic't chart-room when the ship was
running through a fog, his face prone on the open chart he had been studying
when the life had suddenly gone out of him. During his long and worthy
sailor life he had rescued a great number of lives, and had received recogni-
tions of his courage and humanity from almost every maritime nation of
Europe and America."— The World, Oct. 23, 1888. •
Sudden, yet splendid too! What titter end
Can fancy fashion for the brave old tar,
All his long life with wind and wave at war,
The Ocean-orosser's trusty guide and friend,
Keen-eyed to mark, stout-hearted to contend,
With every danger of the treacherous deep?
So might we all, who life's long watch must keep,
Fronting its perils our last moments spend:
Like gallant Gleadall, playing well our part
To the last pulse within, not of our fate
But of the great ship's course considerate;
Humanity's loyal servants, high of heart,
Content the great dismissal to await,
And fall at last—face forward on the chart!

PLAY-TIME WITH FRENCH ROYALTY.
On Thursday last I went to see Le Fih de Famille, in order to
compare M. Lafontatne as the Abbi Constantin with Mr. Lapon-
taine as Alphonse Deshayes JColonel
of a regiment of Lancers. He does
not appear till the Second Act, and
then he comes en bourgeois to a hall.
Not a trace of the kindly genial
simple old Abbe about this stiff-
backed elderly martinet, who is every
inch a soldier, and whose bearing is
that of a man who has risen from the
ranks, and who is nothing if not a
soldier. I may be wrong in supposing
that he has risen from the ranks, but
certainly his comparatively uneasy
bearing in "Society," his awkward
compromise between a gracious bow
and a short, sharp, military nod, and
his hearty grasp of the hand when
he wishes to express his cordial
agreement with M. Francois, the
Artist, gave me this impression; and
the sentiments the authors have put
into his mouth concerning the well-
born prodigals, "ces enfants mal,
Move's?' who put on a uniform as a
disguise, and then wish to take it off again as though it were un
costume de Carnaval, confirm me in my view of the character.
In this Second Act M. Lafontatne is perfect; with the exception
of exaggerating and repeating the business of his characteristic bow,
merely for the sake of obtaining a laugh from the feather-headed.
In the Third Act M. Lafontatne, with great judgment, shows the
old soldier quite at home in undress and in fail uniform. The
awkwardness has entirely disappeared, not a trace of his forced
"society manner" exists, and here and there we get a hint of that
natural kindliness common to the good hearts of the Colonel and the
Curt. Occasionally a mannerism of utterance reminded me of the
Abbe, but it was only a momentary family resemblance, which I
was on the look-out to detect. I hope, before his departure, that on
one night he will give us an Act of L'Abbf Constantin, followed by
the Second Act of Le Fils de Famille.
Mile. Jane Mat is lacking in the quality of earnestness that alone
could make the girl's part interesting. She seems to consider Emme-
line as a heroine of Opera-Comiaue, and that the authors themselves
have not got muoh beyond this 1 am not prepared to deny, but it is
just one of those parts that the pathetic power of an actress should
lift above itself. M. Schey gives a broadly humorous sketch of a
French marichal de hois. He is rather inclined to exaggerate, as if
he were playing Valentine in Le Petit Faust, but there is true
low comedy in his impersonation of the type.
In M. Lafontaine s impersonations of the Abb£ and the Colonel is
to be seen a very near approach to the perfection of the comedian's
art: and on the same stage may be also seen glaring examples of the
worst fault of the French school of acting, viz., the actor insisting on
points by addressing his speeches point-blank at the audience.
Now that M. Schey has arrived, couldn't we have Tricoche et
Cacolet again? Chaumont and Noblet are coming with Divorcons.
En attendant, M. Lafontatne is announced to appear in Le GeniiU
homme Pauvre. It ought to be a very fine performance.

Published by Whtttaker & Co., with two "t's,"—not that
benefactor of society, Whttaker, the Almanack Maker and universal
intelligence provider,—is a small volume, well got up and clearly
printed, of the selected poems and songs
of Charles Mackay, "the British
Beranger," as Douglas Jeebold styled
him. It was only lately that some one
i was recalling to the public mind, in
I aid of a Mackay Fund, that Jekbold's
"B. B." is the author of " Cheer, Boys,
Cheer.'" "There '« a' Good Tune

"Far, far upon the Sea!" which were
all associated with the name of Henry
Russell, whose music gave them an
immense popularity. Unfortunately,
Mr. Words goes for very little where Mr. MuBic steps in, and
Mr. Music gets all the credit which should be divided between
Messrs. Words and Music. Certainly this class of songs would not
have obtained their success without suoh music as Henry Russell
composed for them. And then the Composer, who was a capital
entertainer and pianist, sang them himself, with no voice to speak
of, but, all the same, most heartily, and with great dramatic skill.
But Charles Mackay has written songs that require no singing
to recommend them, and ballads that suggest their own music - as

A CIGAR CASE.
"Miss Maooie Lockhead Watson brought an action for £500 against
Mr. William Kikklakd, because he failed to marry her. Kikkland, who
was a smoker, received a letter from his sweetheart, the plaintiff, in which
she stated,' You must choose between me and a cigar.' He selected a cigar
instead of Miss Watson, and hence the action. The Sheriff Substitute
decided in Kirkland's favour, and yesterday the Sheriff Principal upheld
that judgment."—Daily Xetc:

THE MENACING MONSTER.
A Dream of the Day After To-morrow.
"The formation of the great Association for a monopoly in salt is likely to
have imitators, and it is now said that the formation of a gigantic monopoly
in coal, with a capital of eighty millions, is under consideration. This will
probably be followed by similar combinations to control iron, cotton, woollen,
and other manufactures. Hitherto it has been fondly believed that the growth
and progress of English trade was chiefly due to a wholesome competition. . . .
All this, it seems, is to come to an end, and the American system of monopolies
is to take the place of the English system of competition."—Standard.
The Day of Big Things was approaching its noon;—
(Its dawn had first glimmered across the Atlantic)—
Each trade had swelled out like a Monster Balloon,
And nothing was noticed that was not Gigantic,
Things seemed to hark back to the morning of time,
When Monsters and Mud were Creation's chief features.
When sixty-foot saurians revelled in slime,
With Mastodons, Mammoths, and other huge creatures.
The Mammoth, indeed, seemed the type of the age,
Which was ruled by the love of the simply colossal.
To have a Big Boom was the general rage,
And every man's dream was to " run or to "boss" all.
There were some who were silly enough to inquire
The probable goal of this curious tendency;
But most were contented to share—or admire—
The Day of Big Things in its blazing resplendency.
And as for the Small Things—they went to the wall,
For people or plans not extremely Titanic
Were calmly considered " not in it at all,"
And snubbed with a scorn which was ultra-Germanic.
Ah me, the Big Booms! That got bigger each day,
The monopolist " Rings," like the cycles in water,
Grew wider, and swallowed up all in their way,
Of shops and small firms there was general slaughter.
The millions of Naboths had never a chance,
Against the few Ahabs, whose numbers still dwindled;
The "Trusts" piped the tune, and the victims must dance;
They had nothing to do but to stare and be swindled.
That was not the word that was used, to be sure,
To prig on bo spanking a scale is not prigging,
But—well, say financing" with motives quite pure,
Or controlling the market by ringing or rigging.
Conspiracy? Nay, that is not quite the word
That only applies to malign combinations
Against—well, say Rent,—which are wrong and absurd;
But to keep up nigh prices by smart " operations"
In salt or in iron, in coal or in wool,
Is plainly legitimate pulling together.
For who would protest, save a poor well-plucked fool,
Against the snug flocking of Birds of a featherV
"Strikes? Well, they were rascally ruinous things,
For they kept down fortunes by keeping up wages.
'Twixt Labour's Trade Unions and Capital's Rings
The fight was prolonged, but no longer it rages."
So chuckled Monopoly, cock of the walk
Onoe more on the death of that plague, Competition.
The new Mammoth, Mammon, with saurian stalk,
The Colossus of Cash in plethoric condition,
Like dragons primeval, were lords of the time;
They battened and browsed on the best: as to others,
For them 'twas enough to be trampled to slime,
In poverty equal, in death only Drothers.
0 glorious epoch! 0 outcome divine
Of that Spirit of Trade which sublimes our humanity!
Its heaven the Market; the Loom and the Mine
Its ladders to opulence; all else is vanity.
To paddle one's own poor canoe might seem fun
In Trade's earlier days of competitive rivalry.
But oh! when the Many give place to the One,
Competition must go, like good-feeling and chivalry.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Monopoly was not content very long
With sharing its millions in narrow community
Between the mere few who were clever and strong,
Its natural issue was Absolute Unity.
The One at the top, and the Many below!—
That must be the Monster's ideal, the goal of it.
To get the "World's trade in one " Ring "at a blow,
With one bloated Moloch of cash in control of it,
That, that was the notion, and that was the aim;
But just as that "Trust" comprehensive, colossal,
"Was reared, Mammon's victims grew tired of his game,
And Demos with Dives played mad pitch-and-toss all.
A dream! Ah, perhaps; but some visions unveil
A meaning from wide-awake vigilance hidden.
The Day of Big Things means a scourge and a flail
For the myriad small ones to Life's banquet bidden.
The Epoch of Monsters once more to revive,
In Creation or Commerce, is sheer retrogression.
The Thunderer would rule, and the Titans would strive,
But freedom and peace are poor man's best possession.
"These Little Ones'' also have places and claims.
The many-armed Monster, Monopoly, subtle
Of motion as greedy of maw, has the aims
Of the crueL all-grabbing, all-palsying Cuttle.
Beware of it, Trade! 'Tis a creature to dread.
To fight to the death, as St. George did the dragon.
Call Law to your aid—let her strike at its head—
And the menacing Monster will drop dead as Dagon!
GOOD DAY'S WORK.
Dear Mr. Punch.—It is stated that "in view of the
serious dangers that attend upon even a temporary stop-
page of a great artery of traffic in London, the Corporation
are considering the expediency of carrying on the forth-
coming repairs of Blackfriars Bridge, not only night and
day, but on Sunday, as well as week day." As yet, how-
ever, they have not therefore been charged, by agitators
for the enforcement of the observance of Sunday as a
Judaic Sabbath, with proposing to employ me as an
instrument wherewithal to deprive the working classes
of their day of rest. Now then, I suppose, it will no
longer be pretended that I am designed to serve that
purpose in the hands of good people allied to promote the
opening of Museums and Picture Galleries on Sundays,
and consequently, in time past, accused of tryingto insert
the thin end of your ancient friend The Wedoe.

AN ARM FROM THE ARMADA.
(Fragment from a Romance of 15 + 18 + 88.)
It matters not how I came to be living three hundred years after
the great fight off Plymouth Hoe. That is my affair, and no one
else's. Suffice it to say that I came up by a train, and took an
omnibus to Catherine Street, and entered the National Theatre,
where I found Mr. Augustus Harris, surrounded by a number of
articles I immediately recognised as relics of the battle in which I
had taken part in 1588. I remember the day perfectly. Sir Francis
Drake, Sir Martin Fbobisher, Lord Howard of Effingham, a few
others, and myself, were aboard the Capitana—no, we took that
during the action, so I think it must have been the Lively Polly.
Yes, now I call it to mind, it teas the Lively Polly. And yet, on
referring to a Catalogue furnished by the courteous Lessee of Drury
Lane, I am not at all sure but it was the Ark Raleigh, or the Ark
Royal. I have ail the greater confidence in the latter suggestion, as
I see that that capital vessel was the flag-ship of the British Fleet.
"Have a pinch of snuff, Tommy?" said Drake (he always called
me Tommy, although my real name was Marmaduke)—"have a
pinch of snuff P"
And then good old Franco — (I always called Sir Francis
"Franco," because wc had been at school together)—produced a
Horn Tobacco Box.
I mentioned this to'one of the erudite assistants of the joint-author
of The Armada.
".We have the very identical box here," replied the assistant. "It
is No. 247 in the Catalogue, and bears the name and arms of Sir
Francis Drake."
And to be sure there it was! Then I came upon a chair which I
immediately recognised as one that used to stand in the study of
Sir Walter Raleigh. He used to invite me to occupy-it while
reading his History of the World to me.
"What is No. 318'?" I asked, with some curiosity.
"That," returned my courteous informant, "is a Spanish torture
chair. You will observe here is a steel waistband for fixing the
octagonal stake with various screws. Here is a double manacle with
triangular padlock. Yonder a gag with rack action for opening
mouth, grasping and drawing out tongue. There a steel dilator for
lower part of body. Here"
"Oh! yes," I interrupted; "I know the whole bag of tricks.
Dear old Wally used to say that he was obliged to apply them all to
keep me from falling asleep."
"It is, we fancy, nearly a hundred years later than the date of
the Armada," continued my guide; but it .shows, to quote the
Catalogue, 'what would have occurred in nearly every English town
if the Armada had been successful.'"
"There," I replied, "I think you are wrong. My friend, Sir
Walter Raleigh, told me that it was given to him by a Spaniard—
he was called Don Quay—in return for a pouch of tobacco. But still
it is a most interesting relic."
Then 1 saw a large number of helmets, swords, pictures, seals, and
engravings that I quite remember noticing during the pauses of the
Slorious combat. ■ I was particularly struok with an etching repro-
uotion of " the Armada in sight," by Seymour Lucas, R.A.
"Most lifelike," I observed. "I recognise Fenton, and St. Leqer,
Southwell and Mannington, George Jenner, Cook, and, of course,
dear old Dick Hawkins."
'' Were you there?" asked a bystander.
"Was I there!" I exclaimed, indignantly. "Of course I was,
and got a seat for Mr. Seymour Lucas, who was painting it. The
original was sent, shortly afterwards, to Australia.
At this moment a theatre-loving descendant of my dear old friend.
Sir Martin Frobishee, seized me Dy the arm. and with him I hurried
off to see the admirable spectacular Drama that through the kindness
of Messrs. Hamilton and Harris, had been provided for our
delectation. And thus, seated in the Stalls, I fought my battle over
again. (Signed) A Survivor of the Spanish Armada.

A NEW "SPEAKER'S COMMENTARY."
(Intended as a few hints to budding Orators, in
addition to the very excellent advice which
Mr. Sright lias recently given them.)
Don't let your audience know what is
coming next. Cultivate the art of oratorical
surprises. Should your hearers also cultivate
surprises, and welcome you with an outburst
of 1 aisses, allude playfully to the geese that
once saved the Capitol. This may disarm
hostility. It may also do the reverse.
If any member of your audience should be
so ill-mannered or so destitute of apprecia-
tion as to go away in the middle of your
oration, remember that this invariably
happens to the best speakers in the House
of Commons. Try and wither the offender
with a glance. This requires practice.
Should this fail, you might put your
audience in a good temper by inquiring,
"Why is our friend who is leaving like a
barn-door fowl? Because he is looking for
an egg-sit." This will direct amused at-
tention to the out-goer, and make others
less willing to follow nis example.
N. B.—At the end of the meeting, leave, if
possible, by a side-door. People nave been
known to resent humour of the above
description.
If you cannot comfortably accommodate all
the leading points of your speech on your
shirt-cuff, pin them (on a piece of paper) to
your handkerchief, which you oan occasion-
ally dangle before yourfaoe in a graceful and
unpremeditated manner.
Make friends with the Reporters. An
amiable Reporter explains away a multitude
of brickbats.
When interrupted, never lose your own
temper—or you may find somebody else's!
When working up to a joke, it will be
advisable to wreathe your face beforehand
with a seductive smile. Practise well before
a looking-glass.
Though argument is popularly supposed to
have something to do with proof, recollect that
certain people are quite proof against argu-
ment. Humour them. Appeal to their
feelings, not their heads. Try the "Three
B's"—blarney, blather, and bunkum.
People who don't see a joke always think
there is something profane in it. Don't be
too witty. This is a fault which you will
probably find no difficulty in avoiding.
Perhaps the very best way to " bring down
the house," is to bring down a lot of parti-
cular friends who will'' makeahouse " for you.
"Slatin Bey."—The Times Correspondent,
writing from Vienna, reported last week that
"Slatin Bey asks his friends to send him a
few newspapers." We are glad to be able to
announce, in the interests of the higher criti-
cism in Art, Literature, and the Drama, that
Slatin Bey is coming over to England, and
has been engaged as Literary and Dramatic
Critic on Mr. Punch's Staff. All those who
have anything to fear from Slatin,—look out!

PARNELL COMMISSION.
(Special Report.)
[Yesterday the Commission of Judges resumed their sittings in the Parnell
Case. The Judges were Sir James Hansen, Mr. Justice Hay, and Mr. Justice
Smith. For the Times there appeared the Attorney-General, Sir Henry
James, Mr. W. Murphy, Mr. W. Graham, of the English Bar, and Mr.
J. Atkinson and Mr. Ronan of the Irish Bar. For Mr. Parnell and
other Members Sir Charles Russell appeared, and with him Mr. Asquith,
Mr. Rkid, Mr. Lockwood, Mr. Lionel Hart, Mr. Arthur Russell, of
the English Bar, Mr. Arthur O'Connor and Mr. Harrington of the Irish
Bar. Toby, M.P., Q.C., instructed by Mr. Gxorob Lewis (of Ely Place,
Holborn,W.C), again held a watching brief for the Public.—Morning Paper.]
Monday, October 22.—Cut this out of morning paper. Plenty
more where it come from. If the Editor liked to have it all, and
leave out pictures, would make quite interesting series of numbers.
Suppose there would be objections on part of artists. Some people
are so narrow-minded. So have boiled down account of proceedings.
Observed considerable addition to strength of Bar. On opening day
only Charles Russell and Asquith on one side, Graham on the
other. Now two benches full of wig and gown. Room for us of the
Inner Bar, but terrible crush behind.
"All on account of you," George Lewis whispers. "Very well
to begin with. But when they saw you were engaged, found it
necessary to muster in larger force."

TMr J\ fyjjf. Bar rises and bows. Three
^ figures bob, advance a
laAd step, and take seats. (Evi-
dently going to be either
wet or shine.) Attorney-
General opens case for
proseoution. Goes back to
prodigious speech deli-
vered by him in case of
O'Donnell v. Walter.
Quotes whole batches of
it. Remember how Cole-
ridqe, L.C.J., softly
slumbered through it.
Our President wide awake.
Smith quietly observant.
Day beginning to get over
novelty of situation; gives
up staring stonily round;
makes occasional note.
President begins with old
protest about knowing
nothing. Fancy he's heard the name of Parnell and Davitt—or
is it Dayvit? Something in the City, aren't they? Attorney-
General, therefore, bound to go into full detail. Grinds along till
one o'clock, when President capitulates: falteringly admits that be
has not only read the whole of Parnellism and Crime, but has a
minute index.
"Why didn't he say so at first?" growled familiar voice from
back of Court. It was Joseph Gillis, and in female society! Stout
lady, in black, with large hat and plumage borrowed from a hearse,
seated in Press Gallery; said to he representative of Wandering
Woman, weekly illustrated. Joseph's eagle eye, surveying Court,
perceived her. Sidled up, appropriating next seat. Happened to
be that of representative of Potsdam Press, temporarily absent.
Potsdam Press returning, protests. Joseph Gillis ignores him.
Comfortable seat; female society; good view of Judges; will stop.
Does.
"Remember Mitchelstown?" says Joseph, winking at me.
"Remember Paris!" I say, sternly, not relishing this familiarity.
Joey B. smiles. But the shot goes home. Observe that, after
lunoheon, he finds quarters remote from the charmer.
Tuesday.—Joseph Gillis arrives, brisk, and early. Proposes to
take his seat on benches reserved for us. Usher interposes. Warns
him off. Usher not such a bad fellow, after all. Joey 15. then drops
into bench reserved for Solicitors in charge of cases. Something
evidently up. Turns out to be Joey B. himself. Thrusts thumb in
arm-hole of waistcoat. Holds out left hand, peremptorily signalling
President. Catches his eye. Calls him "Sir," and announoes that
he is going to conduct his own case. President stares inquisitively
at him. Smith regards him with bland smile. Day, withdrawing
gaze from ceiling, where he was almost certain he'd seen a fly, turns
animated visage full upon Joseph Gillis. Never saw anything
like this before. Eyes widely open; lips slowly part; regards him
as if fascinated. Joey B. takes no notice of sensation created;
makes his application as if moving for unopposed return, and sits
down to listen to Attorney-General.
Mr. Attorney pace3 along by the hour. Monotonous; uninterest-
ing; stale stories of ancient outrage; "thrice-boiled colewort," as
Carlylk said. Flounders hopelessly amongst. Irish names. Calls
Davitt, Dayvit, and Parnell, Par.vjh,l. Charles Russell
diligently follows, taking notes.
"what date is it?" he casually asks. The Attorney-General
turns round and glares upon the benevolent downcast visage.
"I was careful at the commencement to mention the date," he
hisses through clenched teeth, "if my learned friend would only
listen. Tenth of March!"
"Ah!" says Charles Russell, going on writing. Attorney-
General disoovers fresh outrage.
"What date?" Russell asks, in a low voice, going on writing,
and not looking up. Mr. Attorney turns upon him like baited bull;
glares and fume3 and gives date.
"Ah!" says Charles Russell, writing it down. These the only
flashes of thunder and lightning to vary the monotonous peppering
on the window-panes of the Attorney-General's incessant small
talk.
Wednesday.—Not sure I would have taken silk if I had known
how dull it is to sit here day by day and listen to Mr. Attorney.
Muoh livelier in the House of Commons. Always something turning
up there. Nothing here but Attorney-General, humdrumming
round familiar facts, reciting Parnellism and Crime by the pago, and,
when thing* getting too exciting, dropping back into momories of his
speech in Walter v. O'Donnell. Wonderful how Judges on Bench
keep awake. Perhaps they wouldn't if President would only give
way. Pretty to see Brother Smith furtively turning to see if Brother
Hannen has dropped off. If he had, might be chance for another
honest person. But Brother Hannen positively enjoying himself.
Leans over desk so as not to miss single phrase of Mr. Attorney's
honeyed eloquence. Mr. Attorney, what with difficulties about
pronunciation of Irish names, and what with constant occasion for
snapping at Charles Russell, sometimes gets wrong in date or other
detail of intricate statement. Hannen down on him in a minute.
"He may have known nothing about the case when he took his
seat on the Bench," says Lock wood, just finishing another sketch of
Brother Day, "but he knows more now than us all put together.
Probably the only man in Court who could stand examination on
Webster's narrative."
As the days wear on, our Day- takes on added stolidity. Only time
when he displays momentary animation is when he, too, turns to see
if Brother Hannen has not dropped off, and meets his particularly
wide-awake gaze. Torhuemada s guilty start when he finds he's
observed is delightful. Stares straight up at the ceiling, slowly gazes
round the Court, deliberately makes a note, and says nothing. Never
does say anything.
"What do they call him Talkee-meeda for?" Joseph Gillis
whispered to Michael Davitt.
"Don't know," said DAVnT, "unless it's because he never says
anything."
Thursday.—"Box A!" said Brother Hannen, entering Court this
morning, and plumping down on desk before him large tin box.
"Box B!" chimed in Brother Smith, plumping down another box
on his desk.
"I C," said Brother Day, gloomily—and when we have a gloomy
Day, it's dark indeed.
"Poor Day!" said Attorney-General, who, in spite of this
fearful long speech inflicted upon us, is a kind-hearted man. "Must
try and make up a box for him!"
"You could easily do that," said Charles Russell, dryly.
One of these two boxes contains the documents whose history is
told in Soames's affidavit. Appears some person from America wrote
to Times offering important documents incriminating Parnell:
negotiations for purchase entered into; documents delivered; found

ney-General more than hints that that great and good man, George
Lewis, knows all about the plant. George LEwia.ever childlike
and bland, looks straight before him as if he had not even heard the
insinuation.
Judges never let boxes out of sight. Sleep with them under their
pillows at night. Bring them into Court in the morning, take them
away in afternoon. Nobody knows whether forgeries are in Box A
or Box B, which deepens the mystery.
"What is in the Box? "Charles Russell thundered yesterday

LE SPORTMAN."
"Hi!! Hi! I Stop ze Chasse I I tomble—I faloff I Stop zs Fox I!!"
AN EXPLANATION OF THE COCOON TEICK.
(By One who has passed a Night toith the Spirits.)
I had determined to find out " how it was done." I had seen the
placards showing me a lady with wings emerging from what seemed
to me to be the skeleton of an egg cup, and 1 knew that this mar-
vellous performance was repeated every night at a Music Hall. But
how was it done? That was the point—how was it done? I was
pondering over the matter in my study with a glass of whiskey and
water beside me. For a while my mind, like Sullivan's organ-man,
was " ill at ease," when all of a sudden a trance-like calm fell upon
me. I was glad of this, for I knew that I was about to learn the
secret. I learn most things after a trance-like calm has fallen upon
me. For a while I could not exaotly follow what I was doing. Then
my brain became as clear as a bell—as crystal. I was standing with
Hr. Augustus Harris among the Armada relics at Drury Lane,
talking to the descendants of the Elizabethan heroes who had saved
England from invasion three hundred years ago. They were loud
in their praise of the Lessee of the National Theatre.
"Yes, returned the part-author of The Armada, "I certainly get
as near truth and nature as possible. For instance, the scene of the
Holy Inquisition was real. I got it at some reduction, as it is
obsolete in Spain. You see before you real tormentors, real tortures,
and real victims. The gentleman that is dropped through the trap-
door at the commencement of the Act in a condition of some exhaus-
tion I had to take as a fixture. He said he was accustomed to his
rack, and could ill do without it. Yes, we do not only use real tor-
tures, but sometimes discover real secrets."
"You do! " I exclaimed, "then do you think you could find out
for me how the Cocoon trick is done at the Pavilion?"
The Lessee of the National Theatre nodded an assent, and led the
way to the stage. When we arrived there we found the gentleman
to whom reference has already been made, stretching himself at full
length on the rack.
Well, Sir," said the Lessee, "and how are you enjoying your-
self?"
"Thoroughly," was the immediate reply, "they have been giving
me an extra twist this morning, and I feel all the better for it. But
now I think I am done to a turn."
He was taken from his apparently unconventionally-fashioned
couch, and dropped through his usual trap, in bis customary con-
dition of exhaustion.
"And now, perhaps, we had better see the talented inventor of
this marvellous trick," said the courteous Lessee, and a gentleman of
evidently foreign extraction was introduced.
"Do you require my assistance?" asked the Chief Inquisitor, in
a voice that reminded me of the palmy days of the Legitimate Drama,
suddenly appearing at the wing.
"Thank you, No," returned the courteous Lessee. "I think we
can get on without you."
The Chief Inquisitor bowed in a stately manner, and, with muoh
dignity, withdrew. The gentleman of evidently foreign extraction
was then invited to seat himself on a torture-chair that had been
specially brought for him from the collection of Armada relics.
After a few minutes passed in cheerful preparation, the talented
inventor said that he was then in a position to explain his secret, on
the oondition, however, "that it went no further.
"It is as simple as possible," he observed, smilingly, as he rose
from the torture-chair. "It is done by swallowing a potion, similar
in character but different in effect to that consumed Dy Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde. But perhaps you would like to see it done."
I said I would, and, by a dexterous twist of the wrist (very neatly
performed) both the Inventor and myself were "passed'' into the
Pavilion in an instant. The Hall was crowded, and I found myself
behind the scenes. A beautiful young lady was standing beside me
with a glass in her hand. I heard the Inventor speaking to the
audience. I saw him hold up a sort of frame, covered with tissue-
paper. I watched him as he drew, with admirable skill, a worm,
and then a cocoon. Then I noticed that the frame and tissue
paper had disappeared, and a sort of large walnut, made of silk, had
taken their place.
"Now," said the Inventor, "I will place this Cocoon into this
receptaole, and in a moment you will see what happens."
As he spoke, the young lady raised her glass to her lips. I
immediately seized it and swallowed its contents myself. Then a
strange thing happened. I found myself suddenly emerging from
the Cocoon, to the surprise of both the Inventor and the audience.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 10, 1888.


Patron of the Drama (to
"FAUST GAIETY."
On the third night of its existence I saw the new burlesque of
Faust at the Gaiety. Faust up to Date is not Faust up to Mitch.
Such as it is, it has taken two distinguished Adelphi melodramatists,
Messrs. Pettitt and Sims, to do it. Clearly the melodramatists are
dissembling. The Extravagant Travesty plays two hours and three-
quarters, and is therefore about
two hours too long. Here and c&QFr/rr
there the two dissembling melo- ~ ^
dramatists have made a oonsoi-'
entious attempt at burlesquing
some of the principal situations
in the Opera and drama. Occa-
sionally there are some good lines,
as there ought to be in the course
of two hours and three-quarters,
though, whether in dialogue or
in song, it seemed to me that
the utterance of only Miss St.
John, Mr. Lonnen, and Mr.
Stone was distinct.
There is nothing remarkably amusing in
the First Act, which, however, is the better
of the two ; but in the Second Act, there is
a dance of four girls, all alive and kicking,
which is more effective from its eccentricity
than its grace; and in the last scene there
is the now inevitable Irish song for Lonnen,
of which a Mr. Martin is announced as the
writer and composer, the talented authors
of the burlesque having, as I suppose,
drawn the line at "a rival'' and "ar-rival,"
or at " flying being a matter of a-pinion,"
and Meter Ltjtz, composer of the music of Sox - office - keeper concealed
the extravaganza, being unwilling to enter «*<*•»)• "Isay, is the second
for an Irish jig competition. Be this as it 3?*** , tn° fir?4?
may, the Martm-Ixmnen song, which is not T?ere 81,° dancmg
brought in till just before lie finish, as a m ll' don-cher-no-
bonne bouche, is not a patch upon " Killaloe;" but to see the chorus-
men seriously marking the tune on each other's heads with their
shillelaghs, after the fashion of "The Two Macs," is very funny,
and a hit, "or several hits," as the Dissemblers would say. The
musio is poor, and affords little opportunity for Flobence St, John
or for anybody else. Mr. Stone, who appears as Valentine, may
probably be—as the dissembling melodramatists nightly jointly
observe—a precious Stone, only requiring a better setting to display
his real brilliancy; but those who remember M. Mu.hkr as the
burlesque Valentine in Le Petit Faust,—an opera bouffe full of fun
and sparkling melody,—will be inclined to regret either that the
English low comedian has never seen that performance, or, if he
has, that he has not sufficiently profited by it.
By the time this notice appears, improvements may have been made
in the piece. After the First Act. I overheard a Masher plaintively
inquiring at the pigeon-hole of the Box-offioe, "Is the Second Act
any better than the first?" What the invisible official's answer to
this was I could not catch, but the complainant, in a deeply injured
tone, went on, "Look here, there's no dancing in the First Act,
don-cher-no." I suppose he received some comforting assurance on
the subject from the nidden oracle, the veritable Jack-in-the-Box-
Office, as further observation made he none, but with his hand on
his swelling shirt-front, returned, struggling with suppressed
emotion, to his stall. Gaiety Management ought to' know how to cater
for Gaiety Masherdom: "plenty of' caper' sauce," as the dissembling
Adelphian melodramatists would say, both together, of course.
Yet when that bright particular star of burlesque, the inimitable
Nellie Fabben, is absent from the Gaiety, the gaiety of its patrons
seems to be eclipsed. What a "little Dr.
Faust" she was, when Tebbt was the Me-
phistopheles, and Kate Vauqhan the
elegant Marguerite! I hope, for the sake
of Mashers and Management, it may not
turn out that
There 'a nae luck about the house,
There 'a nae luck at 'a;
There 's nae luck about the house
When our own Nell's awa'.
Yes, in her absence the Gaiety Faust seems
but forced gaiety, after all, judging at least
by the present effort, says, with incorrect
pronunciation, Jack-in-the Box.
P.S.—In my criticism on the Dean's Daughter, a fortnight ago, I
referred to Mr. F. C. Philips as the Author of Ariane. Mrs. Camp-
bell Pbaed wrote Ariane. But there is a strong similarity of cha-
racter in the two heroines, with neither of whom should we feel

any sympathy. As Chabxbb Jakes Fox wrote,—" It has been
thought dangerous to the morals of mankind, even in fiction and
romance, to make us sympathise with characters whose general
conduct is blameable." Hear! hear! And as I could not imagine
anyone sympathising with Ariane, or with any of the dramatisper-
sona, so I did not consider that play as dangerous to morals. Thus,
"the point of this here remark lays in the application of it," aal
was comparing the moral effect of the two plays, and not their
literary or dramatic merits.—J. I. T. B.
VOCES POPULI.
AT A NORTH BRITISH HYDROPATHIC.
Scene—An immense Drawing-room, lighted by numerous gas-
burners, and furnished on a scale of imposing splendour. It it
after dinner; tea and coffee have just been served in the corridor
outside, and persons of more luxurious habits hate brought in
their cups to sip at leisure. On settees in the centre sit middle-
aged Ladies in grey, red, and white woollen shawls, each politely
admiring the other's work. Very young Ladies whisper and laugh
in the window-seats, all about nothing, and exhibit the liveliest
affection for one another. Others converse, not unconscious of
the distinction, with the exceptional Young Men who have donned
evening dress, and who glide about with an agreeable air of feeling
perfectly at home. People who don't know anybody sit apart tn
chairs, perusing " The Hotels of Europe," or anything else they
can get hold of, and wondering why other people are so unsociable.
A stout old Lady in a corner is discoursing to a meek little old
Maid,in a strong Yorkshire accent, which from time to time
compels the unwilling attention of everybody in the room. The
old Lady's husband endeavours in vain to catch her eye from the
background, as her confidences threaten to become of _ an
alarmingly intimate nature. In the foreground, two Visitors
have just discovered a bond of sympathy in the fact that neither
of them has found Scotch scenery quite what he expected.

"The Sonnets present evidence for Shakspbare's authorship

tific demonstration that have been applied to not h in the present

history in the Sonnets is in agreement with the public history of
the time, and both are in antipodal antagonism to the Great

ROBERT ON THE NEW LORD MAYOR'S SHO.
Well, I suttenly did think that, ewen in these times of universal mokery and
irrewerence, there was jest a few things as might reesonahly he xpected to
remane sacred from the profain touch of the rihald gester, and fust and
foremast among 'em was the hancient, the time-honnerd, the truly gorgeus
festival of Lord Mare's Sho!
But no, I was rong for wunce, and I confesses it in sackcloth and hashes;
that is to say, I am sure as I wood, if so be as I knowd how to get through that
werry gritty an skrunching seremony. But then, of coarse, I did not make
proper elowance for the ordassity of a Gent who combines in his own sollem
person such a strange wariety of karacters as a Hem Pea, a Barrow Night, a
Pollytishun, a Joker, and a Tea Totcller!
And what a hordience Sir William Lawson selecks to adress on so him'
portant and hinterestin a subjeck! What can a lot of mere Wesmorland
Woters kno or care about Lord Mare's Sho? Why, less than even he does—
and how much is that? Why he acshally tells his pore hignorant lisseners,
and specs them to bleeve him, that it is the custom to have in the sacred Sho
camels, and bufferlows, and ellefants, and jackasses, and men in armer, and
torn-fools, a marching about! What a minglin of the subblime and the ridicklus!
Elefants and Men in Armer on the one hand, and Jackasses and Tom Fools
on the other! My curiossity is naterally xcited to kno who he could have
meant by the jackasses and torn fools; but I naterally refranes from persuing
the dellicate inquiry too fur.
Leaving his discripshun of the Sho, I passes on to his ludickrus acount of
the werry grandest bankwet as takes place in the old City, as is so notorious for
em. Woud it be bleeved that so wunderfool is his hutter hignorance on these
himportant matters, that he acshally describes the Ero of the nite as being
serrounded with Torys and Turtels! Torys and Turtels! What a singlar com-
binashun! Torys, the bo hideal of humane wisdom and wirtue, and Turtels,
the bo hideal of skrumpshus and happytising food!
.- But only to think ot the witty water-drinker's hutter hignorance of igh-elass
wittels, as well as of igh-class drinks. Why he acshally seams to fansy as that
Turtels is brort on table at dinner, all hole, like Turbots, and such small dear!
Ah, what a rewelashun it will be to him sum day when
he fust tastes Reel Turtel Soup! I halmost henveys
him his grand sensashun.
I admires his awdassity much more than his good
taste as to the halterations he boldly wentures to suggest
in the grand percesshun, and from what I ears, here and
there, I don't think as there ain't werry much chance of
there being adopted. What mere rubbish to have a
picter of Mr. Goschen hoff ering Lord Sorlsberry a blank
check! Wot's the use of a blank check, I shood like
to know, to Lord Sorlsberry or to anyboddy helse? If
the Chanceseller of the Xchecker had a bin shown
a-hoffering of him a five pun note for hisself, there
woud be sum sense in it, and in spite of his estonish-
ment at a pressent from siteh a quarter, his Lordship
woud probberly have accepted it with rapshure.
And then only fansy a doing away with the thrillin
and awe-enspirin site of no less than six reel Men in
Armer, all brort from the Tower of Lundun, by the
speshal permission of H.R.H. the Dook of Camehuiduk,
to keep the mob in order, and substitootin for 'em
Mr. Wilkie Collins a milkin a Cow in a werry large
feeld! Why the thing's too ridickulus to ewen dream
about, tho I confesses as I do have sum rayther rum
uns sometimes, 'speshally after a werry scrumpshus
bankwet. Howewer, seeing, I spose, in what Amlet
calls his mind-your-eyes, that, in a Persesshun in the
werry richest City in the hole World, sumthink like
splender woud be looked for, he proposes to have, next
to the Cow-milking seen, a Gilded Carrage; all werry
right and werry propper, says ewerybody of taste; but
he must have a nice idear of the size of a Gilded Carrage,
for it is to oontane not ony Mr. Joe Chamberling—
as he werry irreverently calls the fashnahle Member for
Brummagem—but he is to have with him a lot of Dooks,
and Dutohesses, and Publicans, and Archbishups, and
Brewers!
Why, wot nonsense! Why, ewen a large penny
Homnibus woodn't hold 'em! And wot a way in which
to speak of the werry hiest horders of the Nobility,
Dooks and Dutohesses, and Archbishups, and the most
usefullest of all our Mannyfacterers, Brewers and Pub-
licans; wiz., to tork about a lot of 'em, as if they was to
be put up and nocked down at a Hoction!
But a truce to all this ribaldry and werry watery wit,
at witch I confesses as I ceased to be surprized when
wunce I learnt that its Orthur had never tasted reel
Turtel Soup, on the one hand, and never nowknowed wot
it wos to drink a glass of generous old Port, or ewen
jest a wee drop of reel Scotch Whiskey, on the other.

goody-goodiness. Nor is it deficient in
material for good low comedy or eccentric
character, without which it is difficult for
the best intentioned play to be anything but
a burden to the most sympathetic and patient
audience. The dramatic possibilities in The
Pillart of Society are great, but the play
as it stands certainly would not do for the
stage, and the bald translation makes it a
tedious study taken as literature.
As to OhosU, the second play, the trans-
lation here given may be close, but the
dialogue is even more diffuse than in The
Pillars, and it is pointless, and irrita-
tingly wearisome to read. Here and there
a situation in the painfully repulsive
story is undoubtedly dramatic, yet, as a
play, whether for an English audience or
any other, I sincerely hope its production
is impossible. The subject could be power-
fully treated in a Charles-Reade-ian novel;
but it requires the touch of a master hand
to adorn the pitiful tale, and point the moral.
So, on consideration, I shall not inscribe my
name on the fly-leaf, but shall return the

not shown misplaced confidence in his friend,

the dialogue being diffuse, oommonplace, and the stage-directions ridiculous. But when the
interest really commences, and the reader is on speaking terms with the various characters,
then, as the story is gradually worked out, the plot proves to be as strong as the characters
are original. Properly condensed and well acted, it ought to be a powerful play, for which
able exponents should be found on the English stage. The translation is evidently truthful
and very close, but the hand of a practical playwright is needed to put it into proper form.
It is a pure-minded, manly-spirited, noble play, pointing a moral without any cant of

Or moaned like the Moning Congou
At a foggy Five o'Clock Tea.
They play'd at the little horses,
But little of them reck'd he,
As he yearn'd for the stars in their courses
And the moon in her crescentrie,

THE PAIINELL COMMISSION.
(Special Report.)
Tuetday.— Joseph Gillis has taken somebody else's seat this
morning. It's mine. Has "called" himself to the Inner Bar, and
now sits with us. Suppose he '11 be donning wig and gown presently.
Here he sits all day. Pretty to see him, as the shadows lengthen, lay
his head on Lock wood 's broad shoulder and sweetly sleep. Some-
thing weighing on his mind. Moments of abstraction when he sits
gazing afar. Once heard something like a sigh.
'' Anything gone wrong?" I ask.
"Not yet," he says. 11 But I'm afeard. Do you think, when I
get into the witness-box and they examine me about my visit to Pans
in the spring of 1882—' in the spring, a young man's fancy,' don't you
know—do you think anything will come out about private affairs?"
"Do you mean," I said, "will they want to know anything about
that little affair with the widow, that let you in for the breach of
promise case?"
"Well, you needn't put it quite that way, Toby; but that's
somewhere about it. You know all about legal procedure. Will
the Judges let the Attorney-Gehebal go into that matter?"
"I fanoy they will," I said. "But I '11 look up the authorities.
Haven't got your Coke upon Littleton in your waistcoat pocket, have
you?"

The Star.
No, Joseph hadn't; and him to he sitting with us of the Inner
Bar! Tim Healy turned up, but not in wig and gown.
'' No," said Tim, '' not going to stand in the way of Joseph Gillis.
Since he's taken to the law, I take a back seat. He needs no assist-
ance." So Tim sits on modest bench with the Solicitors, and pre-
sently taokles the Judges.
"I'm Mr. Healy," he says, when making an application on order
of business.
Brother Hansen gravely nods, as if that didn't matter very much.
Joseph Gillis, who tried a fall with Brother Hannen earlier in
the proceedings, has
been quiet for day
ortwo. Encouraged
by contiguity of
Tim, he returns to
attack. Joseph,
pulling up his coat
by back or collar, as
he has seen Henry
James do with his
gown, argues that
the whole of
speeches should be
read. Blandlyhints
that Henry James,
in picking out par-
ticular paragraphs,
was chiefly con-
cerned to mislead
the public who read
the newspaper re-
ports. Pretty to
see Hannen looking
under his glasses
at the future Ers-
kine. A glance of
mingled curiosity,
impatience and
- growing anger. Jo-
seph, wagging his
forefinger as^helhas"1 heard Mr. Jaggers used to do, lays down the
law, and is himself promptly laid by the heels.
"No, no, no!" says Brother Hannen, testily turning away.
That's all; only a monosyllable reiterated. But, now eloquent
with impatient disgust of Joseph's slightly incoherent and somewhat
malignant suggestion! Joey B. doesn't try to catch the President's
eye again. Sits and ruminates.
"Tell you what, Toby," he said, "when wo reach Civil Service
Estimates, shall move to reduce vote for law expenses by £5,000,
salary of President of Probate Court. What does he mean with his
'No, no, no'? On the whole, I'd rather have dealings with the
Speaker."
Wednesday.—Appearance of Court distinctly changed this morn-
ing. Chamber crowded. Bar in full attendance and plainly on
the alert. Parnell, who is methodically as late as Hartington, is
actually in his place. Joseph Gillis, descended from high estate on
Q..C. Bench, humbly seated in Solicitors' quarter.
"Not nearly such a homely place as the House"of Commons,
Toby," he whispered, enviously eyeing my wig and gown. "Can
do anything I like there; say what I please, at what length I like,
and sit where I think proper. Remember the time when House was
in Committee, and I sat in Speaker's Chair, behind Coubtney? Be
a pretty row here, I suppose,\if, after luncheon, Judges came in and
found me sitting in President's chair! But I will do it some day.
Joey B. is tough, deVlish tough, as they '11 find to their cost."
Curtain drawn baok. Judges enter; stand for a second in the
doorway; Bar and audience rise with swift rustling noise; Judges
bow, take their seats. Play about to begin; subdued buzz of excite-
ment. "What is it?" I asked Sage of Queen Anne's Gate, who is
looking on.
"Cherchez la femme."' he says.
Instinctively turn to look in direction of newspaper lady in black
hat and hearse-plumes, forsaken by Joseph. On the way eye falls
on familiar figure. It is he—I mean it's Shea. (See Sage's
joke now. Will laugh as soon as Court adjourns for luncheon.
Daren't do it before. Brother Hannen says he won't have anyoue
laughing in Court.)
0 Shea in box all morning and far into afternoon. Doesn't seem
to like it; shaved off whiskers in order the better to face ordeal.
But no use. In unbroken line below him sit old familiar friends.
Pabnell, pale-faced, haggard-looking, staring with reproachful
eyes-^ Davitt, taking notes; Tim Healy, speechless with anger;
and finally, Joseph Gillis, smiling a ghashly smile, and thinking of
the days that are no more, when he went down to Galway, and, in
defiance of Parnell, pulled O'Shea's hair and scratched his face.
A trying ordeal for the once debonnaire but now decidedly damaged
Captain. Some signs of quailing at first. Strong disinclination to
meet the four pair of gleaming eyes on Solicitors' Bench. Bnt,
growing steadier under fire, the Captain fairly faces Sir Charles
Russell. Answers his searching, subtle questions, fully and frankly.
Thursday— In the hands of the Police all day. Taken up by
P. C. Irwin as soon as O'Shea had left the box. Subsequently
handed over to custody of P. C. O'Maxley. O'Shea just looked in
to bring document signed by some eminent politicians meeting in
convenient public in Wardour Street, protesting against his exclusion
from politics. O'Shea told me all about it.
"Mulqueeny took me there," he said, "in four-wheeled oab,
blindfolded. Engaged cab by the hour. Drove round by Clapham
Common, I believe, and so reached Wardour Street. Took bandage
off my eyes when I entered the room. Rum lot, seen through tobaoeo-
smoke. Smell of lemon in whiskey. Somebody hit me on small of
back with flat side of sword. Then I signed my name in red ink
(they said it was blood). They all swore at Pabnell; said I ought
to be Chief-Secretary. I paid for drinks, put protest in my pocket,
and came away. Nothing particular ever came of it; still we—I
mean they—had very pleasant evening. But I advise you to keep
out of politics, Toby. You never know what you '11 be let in for."
Police Witnesses charming

nered, shrewd, smiling, slyly
humorous, with delicious
brogue. His conversation with
Chables Russell worth sit-
ting a week in Court to hear.
There was a wide world of
eloquence in his way of saying
"Sir Charles." Entreaty,
expostulation, hesitation, alac-
rity, doubt, assent, certainty, contra-
diction, and above all, wheedlin?, each
expressed in turn in rich mellifluous
breathing of commonplace name. Rus-
sell fretted and fumed under iteration.
Snappishly protested.
"Oh, don't call me Sir Chables," he
said.
"Very well, Sir Chables," said
Ibwin, in softest cooing notes, as a
nurse might soothe a restless infant.
Policeman to Policeman succeeded,
as Amurath to Amurath. Interesting
in its way, but finally soporific. Brother
Day began to take on a glassier stare
as the afternoon shadows lengthened.
Presently his chin sank on his breast,
and he became profoundly engrossed in meditation on evidence.

STUDIES IN EVOLUTION.
Alderman Brownjones Senior explains to his son, Alderman
Brownjones Junior, that there is a lamentable falling-off
since his day, in the breed of Aldermen-Sheriffs—not only
in style and bearing, but even in "Happetite"!
OUR BOOKING-OITICE.
Let no one say that in the absence of Lika Joko from his own
native village, there is no artistic talent left in Japan. Just look at
the Japanese draughtsman's picture of Mase. one of the forty Ronins,
drawing a bow as he points an arrow at the spectator, in No. 6 of
Artistic Japan for last October.
I should like to have seen Mr. Toole's Recollections told by Himself,
chronicled by Joseph Hatton, and published by Messrs. Hurst and
Blacbtett, illustrated by a Japanese artist , though Messrs. Bryan and
Margetson have done their work very well. It is a very amusing
book without an unkind or ungenerous word in it about anyone in
or connected with the theatrical profession, and this is saying a good
deal for Mr. Toole's forbearance, seeing how easily and success fully
he might have retaliated on those who of late years, under the flimsy
pretence of criticism, have rarely missed an opportunity of venting
their petty personal spite on the comedian whose well deserved
popularity, and his numerous acts of generosity, must necessarily
have made for him many enemies. Mr. Hatton in Boswelling
Johnnie Toole has cleverly contrived to give the necessary "go
to most of the stories, which otherwise, owing to Mr. Toolk's in-
imitable and original manner of oral narration would certainly have
lost considerably when told in print.
There is one story about H. J. Byron which Mr. Toole records as
occurring a week or so before his death. The story is this: Byron's
coachman wrote to him to say that a mare in his stable in London
was ill, and he wanted to know if he should give her a ball. To
which Byron replied, "Yes—only don't ask too many people."
Now I, moi qui pari*, myself heard Byron say this, as he said it to
me one morning atRamsgate, where he wasstaying three or four years
before his death. He was holding the coachman's letter in his hand as
I entered the room, and was roaring with laughter. "My coachman
writes," he said, chuckling, and pulling at his moustache, "to say
that a mare of mine is ill, and asks me if he may give her a ball, as
he wouldn't dp it without permission. I was just saying to my wife
vol. lev.
that I think I shall write and say, 'Yes—give her a ball, only don't
ask too many people'"—and then he laughed till he almost cried over
it, so immensely was he tickled with the absurdity of the idea. There
was a comparative stranger to him present, who did not see the joke
immediately, and this made Byron and myself laugh all the more.
I've no doubt that so good a thing he repeated; but the fact of the
coachman's letter having arrived that morning, is pretty clear proof
that I was among the three first—the others were his wife and the
unimpressionable stranger—who heard him say it.
In No. 4, Vol. I. of The Salon I find the name of the French actor,
Gil Perez spelt " Gllpre." Was this his real name, or is it a mis-
print or an error in spelling, like " chawtle in his joy," instead of
chortle in his joy, which occurs in the same number? There
should be no mistake about "chortle," which belongs to the classic
English of the Victorian Era.
Christmas Books are well ahead of the time when they are due. I
suppose all much the same as usual, but I shall make a dip in the
lucky bag, and select. To anyone in want of indoor exercise, on a
wet day, I strongly recommend the perusal of Mr. Walter Besant's
The Inner House (Arrowsmith's Christmas Annual), as affording
plenty of opportunity for skipping. It may please Mr. Besant's
admirers, but it struck me as an uninteresting namby-pamby romance.
The best Christmas Book I've seen as yet, that is to say, really a
book for Christmas time and the children, is The Marvellous History
of Jack the Giant-Killer, by Richard Doyle. It is a book for boys
by a boy, for it was drawn by him in 1842, when he was in jackets
and turn-down collars. It was before he signed his initials to his
drawings, with or without the eccentric dicky-bird; but no signa-
ture is necessary to inform us who the'artist was that "inventidit
druit, et didit," when we see these quaint figures of dwarfs and
giants, and funny little creatures climbing up or hanging on to the
border of every page. To have kept the letter-press in fac-simile
manuscript is the publisher's mistake, as some folks will find it diffi-
cult to decipher: but this is of less consequence, as each picture tells
its own story, and is delightfully grotesque.
I gave Joseph Hatton's Captured by Cannibals to a big boy to
read. He polished it off—I am not aware that Mr. Hatton's style
requires this treatment—and returned it with thanks, informing me
that he thought it would suit younger boys than himself admirably.
I read the volatile Mr. G.'s article on Elizabeth and the Establish-
ment in the Nineteenth Century. Mr. G. must have his own private
History of England and defies State Calendars. He should write an
Elizabethan drama for Augustus Druriolanus, who might put him
right in some of his historical facts.
Reporters differ. Looking through My Autobiography and Re-
miniscences, by W. P. Frith, R. A., with Notes (my own), I find that
the modern Hogarth gives an account of the banquet held in honour
of Macready, on the occasion of that eminent tragedian's retirement
from the Stage. Says he (after declaring that Charles Dickens
made an admirable speech), "and Thackeray also spoke well and very
humorously," to which I have added (in pencil in the margin), " This
is news, indeed!!" Now, it happens, that Mr. Joh>t Coleman was
also present at this remarkable dinner, and according to him (he has
it down in his book upon Actors he has Known, just published), the
author of Vanity Fair made a mess of his speechification. To quote
Mr. Coleman's own words, "Thackeray, who had to propose the
health of ' the Ladies,' would, I thought, have broken down every
moment, not from the cause assigned by some 'd—d good-natured
friend,' but from sheer nervousness." He moreover notes that Bulwer
Lytton (who was in the chair), "seemed to him," to regard his rival
novelist's " discomfiture with an amused and languid disdain which
overlaid a somewhat deeper-rooted feeling." Again, the two his-
torians adopt a distinctly different tone in referring to the speech of
Charles Kemble. I give their impressions of the oration side by
side :—
Charles Kemble's speech, according . Charles Kcmble's speech, according
to Mr. Frith. to Mr. Coleman.
I was close to Charles Kemble, Charles Kemble, whom I saw
who spoke right well. * * * When for the first and last time on that
the old man rose, feeble and bent, occasion, made a somewhat irre-
but with the old stately bearing, | levant speech, in the midst of
and in the sounding and digni- i which he "dried up," and sat
fied, though somewhat shrill voice ' down,
peculiar to the Kembles, responded
most happily to the toast, the row
was deafening.
Really, when the two autobiographers have nothing better to do,
they might read one another's "Recollections." I am sure that one
or the other of them will find something that he must have forgotten!
A propos of the stage, Mr. W. Davenport Adams (the well-known
dramatic critic) has published a very readable little volume of essays,
called Byewayt in Bookland. It is pleasant to take a stroll throusrh

colour. The Babox De Boot-Worms & Co.

'A SAW ILL SET.
Ma. Punch,—The writer of a recent review of Dr. Maeston's work
on Actors, adduces the celebrated definition of "Genius " as " an infi-
nite capacity of taking pains," and ascribes it to Lord Beaconsfield.
As you know, it passes for Cakltle's. The house of the late 8eer of
Chelsea being tenanted by Spirit-rappers, who are said to have been
invoking him—and Beaconsfield, too—at seances, the Mediums
could easily set then to settle their respective claims to the above
saying, if necromancers are not impostors, and if both the
and the philosopher would either of them care to be credited with a
stupid observation. But it is unlikely that any ghost walks in
CheyneWalk.
Why, Mr. Punch, you, yourself, the greatest Genius living, must
of course, well know that, so far from being a capacity for taking any
pains at all, Genius is an endowment whion enables anybody to do
without effort marvels and prodigies which nobody else could achieve
whatever pains they ooula possibly take. Only think of Handel
and Mozart performing and composing music almost before they
were out of their frocks and trousers! Of Pops, who "lisped in

numbers, for the numbers came." Of Bidder, and other
calculating boys who similarly, when mere babies, could
solve the most intricate arithmetical problems by a
merely instinctive faculty. Don't you think, Sir, Genius
had much better be defined a capacity of doing wonders,
without taking any pains at all t
Wouldn't you say that you, in your own person, find
an infinite capacity of taking pains a great auxiliary to
genius indeed, and quite essential to success in its highest
flights, but something as totally distinct from it as a
watchmaker from a Tennyson, or a Browning, or even
from you'(
As to Lord Beaconsfield's authorship of the account
of Genius imputed to Carlyle, don't you think that it
might just as well have been set down to Mr. Glad-
stone; and that, if it had been, that right honourable
gentleman would be as much annoyed as you would be in
case you were charged with having originated it yourself f
Do help to withdraw from circulation a current misdescrip-
tion of Genius altogether at variance with
Common Sense.
THE HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHILDREN.
"Mrs. Keeley in a new piece!" sounds startling
as a bit of theatrical intelligence—nevertheless, it was a
fact last Friday. This lively and accomplished young
lady of eighty-three played to a crowded and enthusiastic
house for the benefit oi the Hospital for Sick Children
in Great Ormond Street. Happy Charity to have such an
advocate!— happy Ashby-Sterry to have his lines so
delightfully given! Not a point was lost, not a chance
given away; the clever and experienced actress showed
she had not forgotten a partiole of her art—she had the
same wondrous power over her audience that she possessed
years ago.
At the conclusion of her address she said, with won-
drous earnestness, in speaking of the children:—
"I crave for them your sympathy untold,
Your love, your help, your pity—and your gold!
The last I'm bound to have, for, you must know,
I played Jack Sheppard many years afro!
I re not forgot his impudence, his dash—
His rare persuasive power when seeking cash!
Stand and deliver—sovereigns, fifties, fives—
We want your money, for we want their lives!"
It is to be hoped that the eloquence and persuasive
power of Mrs. Keeley will have the effect of " sovereigns,
fifties, and fives," being speedily delivered to the treasury
of this excellent Institution, which is only waiting for
money in order that its new wing may be built, and its
sphere of usefulness substantially enlarged.

ROBERT ON LORD MARE'S DAY.
The revells was all over on the hallowd Ninth. The three most
himportantest persuns of the hole himportant City; wiz., the parst
Lord Mare, the present Lord, fiare, and the future Lord Mare,
was all comferally
sleepin in their
downy beds of
lucksery; theappy
Gests was all fled;
the careful Com-
mittee Men had
carefully locked
up all the cubbord
fulls of broken
wittels, includin
hole quartz of reel
Turtel Soop, and
seweral hole ams
and fouls, as was
all to be give to
the Poor nex mornin, and the tired and sleepy Waiters had taken
care that none of the tine old Wine shood be wasted, and then sort
their umbel omes: and the ony sound to be herd was the silent tread
of the evtr wakeful Watchman, who was, for some hours to come,
the great City Surweyor. But why does he cum to a sudden paws
in his silent rownd? why, after a close examination of it with his
lighted dark lantern, does he xclaim, " Why, Robert, my toolip,
what on airth are you dooin there?"
I was a sleepin the sleep of the onest but tired-out Waiter, under
a Sofy in the Committee's priwet refreshment room, havin laid
down jest for about 40 winks; and havin, in the dark, rapt a table-
cloth around my manly ligger, to keep out the cold, I must suttenly
have cut rayther a strange apairance to my frend the Watchman
wen I stood up to my full night before his estonished eyes!
It was all the frutes of hover work. It is, I bleeves, about the
werry fust time in all my long life as I have hever been gilty of sitch
a hact of dense stoopidity, and I shall take preshus good care as it's
the last. But my xcuse must be that it was all dun from a good
cause and with a nobel hobjeck. I had herd sitch alarmin roomers
of what was to be done, and what was not to be done, as respecks the
Sacred Sho, that I was deturmind to see for myself with my hone
eyes, and hear for myself with my hone hears, and be reddy to ersist
the pore Life Gards and the pore Huzzas if they shoud be atacked
by the angry mob who was of coarse naterally disappinted at being
deprived of their speshal darlings,the Men in Aimer from the reel
Tower of Lundon, and Robbing Hood's Merry Men from Hepping
Forest, and Burnthem Beeches.
But I need not have bin alarmed. Why, the brave fellers played
away on their drums and trumpits and orns and rumbones, all tnru
the shouting Mob, jest the same as if they'd a bin in High Park.
As I stood gazin at 'em with all the admirashun aa I coud muster
considerin how werry cruelly I was a being shoved about by the
thortless and hignorant Mob, 1 begun for to wunder how on hearth
they ewer manages to do all they've got to do when they gos into
Battel. The geuelman as has 2 drums to play on, in case I spose
as one shoud brake, woud always have his too drumsticks with witch
to defend hisstlf from the hinsolwent fo, as Othello wery propperly
calls him, but how about the gent with the orn? Supposing as he's
ordered to " up Gards and at 'em! " jest think what he's got for to
do. He has to play his orn, to guide his galliant steed, and to flte
the Fo, and all with ony 2 hands! It's quite bad enuff for me wen
I has to carry a Tooreen of hot bilin Soup, and a cupple of wine-
glasses, and a carving nife in my mowth, but I reelly thinks as his
case must be wuss than ewen mine.
However, a trewse to these refleckshuns, and let me purseed to state
that; tho the " Royal George," the Commander-in-Cheef, did most
unkindly refuse to let us have jest about ten or twenty thousend
Wolunteers to perfect us all. in the habsence of the six Men in
Harmer, I can conseenshusly declair, and wen I says that, I means
it, that neether the Lord Mare's State Cocheman, nor his State
Postilyun, nor ewen his three State Footmen, showd by their pail
faces any fear of the shoutin mob as was a fcrowgin around 'em.
What they felt in their hinnermost buzzums, them alone can tell.
The scoffin and grinnin Sin nick dowtless grinned and scoffed
more than ewer when he seed the rain a poring down in the hurly
morning; but if he had had my xperience ne woud have known that,
on all sitch himportant occashuns as Lord Mare's Sho, "The clouds
will pass if we've pashens to Wait; " and so it was on Friday.
I got back to Gildhall weary and worn, and rumpled to that xtent,
that not nobody but them as know'd me well coud ever have took
me for a hed Waiter; but a good wash and brush up, and a clean
white coller and choker, and two glasses of old brown Sherry—the
werry best rewiver as kindly natur ewer perwided for xhausted
Uinanity— set me to rites, at eny rate for a time. Robebt.
HOE DEAR!
Read Giadstone's advice about fruit-farming, jam, cherries,
apples, and all the rest of it, with great interest. Why do the poor
congregate in big towns, instead of doing this sort of thin* in the
country? So improvident! Believe there's a fortune to be made
out of growing fruit and vegetables for London market, and mean
to try.
Have bought a small farm. Nice light soil. Owner (who Beems
very anxious to get away), describes it as a "pebbly loam." More
pebbles than loam, apparently. "Soratch your loam, and you rind
pebbles." Owner shows me orchard, paddock, cart-shed, &e., and
induces me to take over his live and dead stock at valuation.
Settle at farm. Twenty miles out of town. Nearest rail two and
a half miles; cartage to railway costs more than I expected. Have
to pay Gardener, too; pay Mm more (I fancy) than either of us ex-
pected. Buy some books on fruit-farming, and feel rather proud of
my position. Shall talk (to friends who don't know much about me),
of my place in the country." Hope they won't come down and
find me hoeing mangel-wurzels.
Rather disappointed with perusal of the books. Find apples don't
like a " pebbly loam." Also only a few kinds of apples nave any
sale nowadays. Call in a horticultural expert, and ask him to
inspect my orchard.
Lxpert comes. Condemns orchard root and branch. Says, "only
thing to be done is to grub up these 'ere trees, and plant noo ones.
Well, then, what advantage do I get out of the old trees ?" None
whatever," he replies; "might just as well have bought a bit of
meadow." Depressed. I think of riddle—"What's the good of
Acres when you can't get a Bob out of them?" Riddle depresses
me still further.
Give up apples. Plant no end of cherries and gooseberries. Gar-
dener says, "important for fruit to go off directly it's ripe." Mine
goes off before it's ripe. Goes off altogether; boys steal it. Also
plant cabbages and mushrooms. Gardener says, " a fine opening for
mushrooms. Spend a month or two buying Epawn, making beds,
■ &c. What a lot of attention mushrooms do want! Call this small
culture," indeed! Find that the opening for mushrooms has closed
when I come to sell them. Buyers offer a price which just about
covers cost of carriage to town. I ask why? They explain that
"public fancy has changed; mushrooms not in vogue—tomatoes
are."
Try tomatoes. Try 'em out of doors, and get 'em nipped by frost.
Try again under glass. Putting up glass very expensive. Gardener
suggests grapes. After buying one or two choice varieties, find
Gardener doesn't understand planting them! Buy book on Grape-
culture. While book coming, put grape-plants in ceBar. Cellar
doesn't suit them, it seems. F inally, when Dook arrives, plants have
to be thrown away. Result of first year's fruit-growing—loss of
£300. Not making fortune yet.
"Can small farms be made to answer?" somebody wants to know.
Yes, if you don't mind the answer being "No!"
This year try asparagus, in corner of large field. Very successful.
Think of making a "corner" in asparagus in London vegetable
market. Gardener falls in with idea, and we keep crop back for a
time. Consequence is, when we offer it, nobody wants to buy! Have
to eat most of it myself. Get perfectly sick of asparagus in a week.
Sick of Gardener, too. Dismiss him. He tells me, just as he's
going, that "them pertaters has the disease awful bad, and there
ain't a cherry on the trees because of caterpillars." Winds up by
saying, there's a bill coming in for " them sparrergrass beds."
There is indeed. Such a bill! Seems that nothing will grow on
the " pebbly loam," but that first one has to "make the soil, and
afterwards grow things. Always thought farms had good soil to
begin with. What's the good of the Creation, if the ground has
to be made all over again?
Losses increasing. As last desperate resource try jam. Erect
small jam-factory. Have one or two fields of strawberries. Find a
man who says ho understands all about jam-making. "Get equal
quantities of jam and sugar, and boil 'em up together," he says. It
sounds very simple. Sugar bill enormous. When jam made, it
really does look and taste very nice indeed. Send it to London.
Letter in a few days from agent to say he can't sell my jam at any
price. Too pure. Public like it with more " flavour " in it. And
this comes of making real home-made jam. What a fool the publio
must be! Sell my farm at fearful sacrifice, and live in a "flat "—
rather a suitable residence. Turn Tory. Understand now why poor
congregate in large towns. Wonder if they've all been fruit-farmers
like me, and made as much out of it?
Summer in Winter.—Don't forget Mrs. Jeotte this winter. She
makes her usual benevolent appeal on behalf of the starving children.
"One pound," says the Standard, "provides an ample dinner for
one hundred and thirty-seven hungry little ones." There's a
Sovereign remedy for starvation!

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
October 30.—I should very much like to know who has wilfully
torn the last five or six weeks out of my diary. It is perfectly
monstrous! Mine is a large scribbling diary with plenty of space
for the record of my everyday events, and in keeping up that record
I take (with much pride) a great deal of pains. I asked Carrie if
she knew anything about it? She replied it was my own fault for
leaving the diary about with a charwoman, cleaning, and the sweeps
in the nouse. I said that was not an answer to my question. This
retort of mine, which I thought extremely smart, would have been
more effective had I not jogged my elbow against a vase on a table
temporarily placed in the passage, "knocked it over and smashed it.
Cabbie was dreadfully upset at this disaster, for it was one of a pair
of vases which cannot be matched, given to us on our wedding-day
by Mrs. Bubtsett, an old friend of Cabrie's cousins, the Pommeb-
tons, late of Dalston. I called to Sabah and asked her about the
diary. She said she had not been in the sitting-room at all; after
the sweep had left, Mrs. Bibbell (the charwoman) had cleaned the
room and lighted the fire herself. Finding a burnt piece of paper
in the grate, I examined it, and found it was a piece of my diary.
So it was evident someone had torn my diary to light the fire. I
requested Mrs. Birrell to be sent to me to-morrow.
October 31.—Received a letter from our principal, Mr. Pebkupp,
saying that he thinks he knows of a place at last for our dear boy
Lupin. This, in a measure, consoles me for the loss of a portion of
my diary, for I am bound to confess the last few weeks have been
devoted to the record of disappointing answers received from people
to whom I had applied for appointments, for Lupin. Mrs. Birrell
called, and in reply to me said, "She never see no book, much less
take suoh a liberty as touch it." I said I was determined to find out
who did it, whereupon she said she would do her best to help me, but
she remembered the sweep lighting the fire with a bit of the Echo.
1 requested the sweep to De sent to me to-morrow. I wish Carrie
had not given Lupin a latch-key. We never seem to see anything
of him. I sat up till past one for him, and then retired tired.
November 1.—My entry yesterday about " retired tired," which I
did not notice at the time, is rather funny. If I were not so worried
i" ust now, I might have had a little joke about it. The sweep called, but
tad the audacity to come up to the hall-door, and lean his dirty bag of
soot on the door-step. He, however, was so polite, I could not rebuke
him. He said Sabah lighted the fire. Unfortunately Sabah heard
this, for she was dusting the bannisters, and she ran down, and flew
into a temper with the sweep, causing a row on the front door-steps,
which I would not have had happen for anything. I ordered her
about her business, and told the sweep I was Borry to have troubled
him—and so I was, for the door-steps were covered with soot, in
consequence of his visit. I would willingly give ten shillings to find
out who tore my diary.
November 2.—I spent the evening quietly with Cabbie, of whose
company I never tire. We had a most pleasant chat about the
letters on "Is Marriage a Failure?" It has been no failure in our
case. In talking over our own happy experiences, we never noticed
that it was past midnight. We were startled by hearing the door
slam violently. Lupin had come in.S He made no attempt to turn
down the gas in the passage, or even to look into the room where we
were, but went straight up to bed, making a terrible noise. I asked
him to come down for a moment, and he begged to be excused, as he
was "dead beat," an observation that was scarcely consistent with
the fact that, for a quarter of an hour afterwards, he was positively
dancing in his room, and shouting out, "See me dance the Polka!"
or some such nonsense.
November 3.—Good news at last. Mr. Pebkupp has got an
appointment for Lupin, and he is to go and see about it on Monday.
On, how my mind is relieved! I went to Lupin'8 room to take the
good news to him, but he was in bed, very seedy, so I resolved to
keep it over till the evening. He said he had last night been elected
a member of an Amateur Dramatic Club, called the "Holloway
Comedians ;" and, though it was a pleasant evening, he had sat in
a draught, and got neuralgia in the head. He declined to have any
breakfast, so I left him. In the evening I had up a special bottle
of port, and, Lupin being in, for a wonder, we filled our glasses,
and I said,—"Lupin, my boy, I have some good and unexpected
news for you. Mr. Pebkupp has Jprocured you an appointment."
Lupin said, "Good biz !" and we drained our glasses. Lupin then
said, "Fill up the glasses again, for I have some good and unex-
pected news for you." I had some slight misgivings, and so
evidently had Cabbie, for she said, " I hope we shall think it good
news." Lupin said, "Oh, it's all right. I'm engaged to be
married."
THE VADE-MECUM OF A CHIEF MAGISTRATE.
Question. When is reference first made to you by the Press P
Answer. In the early autumn of the year, when paragraphs appear
in the City papers briefly alluding to my antecedents, and noting my
probable election.
Q. Have you then an opportunity of further advertising yourself P
A. Certainly. If I am energetic, lean let it be known that I object
to something or other favoured by my predecessor.
Q. Can you do more than this in the same direction?
A. Well, there is no reason why I should not, in advance of the
time fixed for my appearance in my official residence, notify the
funds I purpose founding there.
Q. Is this not encroaching on the prerogative of your predecessor?
A. Not seriously; as when I do tnis he, from an official point of
view, will be moribund.
Q. Then I presume yon consider yourself well advertised by the
banquet itself?
A. I consider it practically my entrance into public life; for in the
papers next day my speeches, which hitherto have received little
attention, will be reported at a length only second to that reserved for
the utterances of the Prime Minister.
Q. Before attaining your exalted rank are your opinions considered
of any value?
A. No, of very little value, and probably on my retirement the
store set upon them will sink to the original standard.
Q. Do you not during your tenure of power obtain many advan-
ces P . 1
A. Certainly. Ex officio I am a member of the Privy Council, and
in certain emergencies, this may confer upon me the performance
of duties of the highest dignity. I have the precedence of an Earl
outside the City, and when I dine in state can call upon the Sheriffs
(or as in the future it wiU be—the Sheriff), to attend upon me.
Q. Have you not omitted something which adds to your pomp?
A. I presume you refer to my custom of marching about in the
company of two persons, carrying respectively, a gigantic sword and
a huge mace.
Q. Do not these persons, with their comic weapons, introduce what
may be termed, the " pantomimic element" into your progresses?
A. Possibly, but their existence is sanctioned by long usage.
Q. You have too, have you not, a wardrobe full of official costumes P
A. Certainly. Some of the robes are extremely gorgeous, both in
colouring and material.
Q. And generally, during your term of office, do you not receive
very marked attention?
A. 1 do. My letters to the papers are printed in the leader page,
in leaded type, my movements are reported with regularity and
accuracy, and my presence in even the highest quarters is regarded
with satisfaction rather than astonishment.
Q. And this deference is paid to you for a year P
A. Or rather, for eleven months, as my doings during the last
twenty or thirty days of my tenure of power are considered of less
moment than the proceedings of my successor during the same period.
Q. And at the end of your year of office what will happen to you P
A. If I am lucky I shall retire with a Knighthood into the dense
obscurity of City private life.
Q. Will you, after your retirement ever re-attract public attention P
A. To judge from precedents, I do not think I ever shall.

Almost alone indeed and single-handed;
For, though the other brutes he'd fain have
banded
Against these common curses of their kind,
He somehow seldom found them in the mind.
Greed, fear, and faction,
With brutes as men, are foes to common
action.
There came into that region, rather later,
A certain Fox. No beast had shrewdness
greater; [ning,
And, adding lupine strength to vulpine cun-
He rather fancied he was in the running
For the reversion
Of Leo's sovereignty; indeed some said,
To share the Lion's skin ere he was dead,
Was an idea running in his head;
Perhaps 'twas an aspersion;
But anyhow Reynard, with all his tricks,
Found himself shortly in a sort of fix.
He hardly prospered as he deemed ho ought to,
And sedulously sought to.
He was not trusted somehow, which seemed
funny.
When deeds of iron follow words of honey,
Faith fails. That queerest seems of para-
To Foxes. [doxes—
So ruse Reynard thought that he would try on
A sort of Confidence Irick with the old Lion.
He rigged himself in proper pilgrim guise,
With palmer-hat that Hopped o'er his sly eyes,
With staff, and scrip, and scallop all complete,
And a long gaberdine that reached his feet,
Properly girdled; one in fact might term it
The costume for a new Peter the Hermit.
Togged in this manner,
He bore in hand a big emblazoned banner,
Whereon was written in much broidered
bravery,
"Down, down with Slavery! 11"
Thus robed, our Reynard Leo thus addressed:
"Leo, my friend, I'm really quite distressed
At the black deeds that shame this region
torrid;
They're truly horrid!
As for one cruel and kidnapping band,
They ought to be put down with a strong
hand.
You who 're so noble, generous, and strong,
Must feel, I'm sure, that it is really wrong
To give free licence to this bad black trade.
Shall we not join, then, in a New Crusade?
You always were a bit of a knight-errant,
I've quite a tit of missionary zeal;
United, I am sure that you will feel
Our influence on this sin will be deterrent.
And—though that is, of course, the merest
trifle-
Help any doubts of our good faith to stifle
(I've found such doubts a little in my way).
Come, Leo, what d'ye say?"
Leo said little, but he looked a deal,
For, hanging at the back of Mr. Fox,
Girt to his body by a chain of steel,
He spied a certain box,
Savouring to Leo, who could spot a trader,
More of the bagman than of the Crusader.
"Reynard," he mused, "whence is this new-
born passion
For the knight-errantry not much your
fashion?
Can it, oh! can it be a mere pretence
To gain prestige—and trade—at my expense?
True, it might task all [rascal,
Our banded strength to crush the desert
The battener on blood, whom I, 'tis true,
Have hunted long, with little aid from you.
If—if indeed
You meant it in good faith, his cursed breed
We'd quickly banish from this tropic shore.
But—is there nothing

STOPPING THE STRAND.
(A Church Catechism.)
Question. Is the church (of St. Mary-le-
Strand) worth preserving?
Answer. The Rector naturally replies,
"Yes;" so do the verger, the pew-opener,
the clerk, the bell-ringers, and the lay-
helperess who brushes the dust from the floor
on to the prayer-books, and from the prayer-
books back again on to the floor, once a week.
Q. How much money is required in order
to'prevent the whole place tumbling on to the
heads of wayfarers along the Strand?
A. Ihree thousand pounds.
Q. What is the feeling of Londoners as to
the request for this sum lately published by
the Rector in the newspapers.
A. They wish he may get it.
Q. What is the chief complaint against
the edifice?
A. That, besides being u$ly and unsafe'
it is an intolerable obstruction. That, just
where the Strand ought to widen into a really
noble thoroughfare, it is cramped up into the
dimensions of a narrow lane by this building,
leaving barely space for two vehicles abreast,
the foot pavement being reduced in like ratio.
Q. What is the remedy suggested for this
ecclesiastical obstructionist?
A. The Cloture—shutting it up, and then
pulling it down.
Q. Is not the church one of striking archi-
tectural beauty, so as to warrant its preser-
vation on that score?
A. Not at all. On the contrary, it is a bad
specimen of debased " Queen Anne."
Q. Would not its demolition deprive a large
and important congregation of a place of
worship P
A. It would distribute a congregation
averaging about twenty or thirty among the
multitude of other half-empty churches
existing in the immediate neighbourhood.
Q. Would not the widening of the Strand
sweep away some old and venerable speci-
mens of London Street architecture?
A. Yes, it would mean the removal of the
venerable thoroughfare known as Holywell
Street, with its nigh-class shops and noble
literary associations.
Q. What then is wanted P
A. That the new London County Council
should take the matter up, and knock the
church down, with what speed it may.

FRUITS FROM THE TREE OF
KNOWLEDGE.
Board Schools are not all paid for out of rates;
Nor gratis, quite, crammed Board School chil-
dren's pates.
Parents have still the cost in part to bear—
Not much, yet more than most of them eon

Their tributary pence required to send
For children forced instruction to attend:
But, what with rates and fees for mental
"feed,"
Those youngsters get, however, taught to
read.
That knowledge they are mostly apt to use;
Fictitious literature in general choose:
Tales of adventure, villany, and crime,
Horrors and vices, which their minds begrime.
'Twas hoped that education would avail
To elevate them in the social scale.
What profit may accrue from learning, see;
The Penny Dreadful for the Penny Fee!

HAND AND FOOT AT HANDOUB;
Or, What the Latest Intelligence is coming to.
Suakim, Nov. 12.—The enemy again continued last night their shelling
operations against the Water Forts, making excellent practice, and succeeding
in sending six shots in succession through the top of the General's tent, the final
one being specially well-aimed, and going clean through his moderator, which it
effectually extinguished. On lights being fetched, and an examination made of
the ammunition used, much enthusiastic satisfaction was expressed by all the
officers present on its being ascertained as a fact that it had been suppfied by a
well-known British firm. Its destructive capabilities having just been conclu-
sively demonstrated, a high and flattering opinion was expressed on all hands
at the circumstance.
This morning the long-expected reinforcements, consisting of five mounted
infantry, one gun. and two artillerymen, having arrived from Egypt, the General
determined to make a reconnoitring movement in the direction of Handoub, for
the purpose, if possible, of ascertaining the strength of the enemy. This they
were not long in disclosing, for they instantly threw out a thoroughly disciplined
and well-equipped force of cavalry, about five hundred strong, which, sweeping
at a charge down on the little contingent, capturing the gun, and sabring its
defenders, much to his surprise, obliged the General to take to flight, and pursued
him up to the fortifications, which he barely reached in safety, followed by a
perfect hail of bullets.
It is understood that after this experience he will probably endeavour to
impress on the authorities at Cairo the necessity of their taking vigorous
measures, and despatching further reinforcements to enable him to cope with the
situation, which he describes as " threatening."
This evening there is a rumour of telegraphic communication from head-
quarters, acknowledging the receipt of the General's application and promising
tne despatch of "five more mounted infantry, another gun, and two more
artillerymen, in the course of a month or so," which they think will "meet the
requirements of the situation."
As the mail is leaving, the Dervishes, who have just mounted twelve Arm-
strong guns in a position thoroughly commanding the Citadel and the Water
Forts, appear to be massing in large numbers close up to the fortifications, as
if meditating a determined night-attack. Her Majesty's cruiser, Bouncer, which
is our only defensive resource in any emergency, seems, unfortunately, somehow
to have disappeared on the horizon. The General, who
has apparently noted thiB incident with regret, seems
uneasy, and is inquiring about cellar accommodation in
the suburbs. Altogether the outlook is gloomy.
THE ALMIGHTY HALF-DOLLAR.
A Sono by A Sufferer.
"Faeit indignalio rertum,"
Florins are a nuisance—curse 'em!
Confounded coin, whose prevalence confounds
Finance domestic more than any other,
Why thus beset me on my daily rounds
With constant bother!
The Mint was mad the day it fashioned you,
And sowed you broadcast on enslaved society.
What man knows not the mischiefs that you brew
In vile variety P
You were not wanted; you are awkward, odd,
A coin which trade's arrangements do not follow;
And yet, beshrew you! you, like Aaron's rod,
All others swallow.
A shilling is the price for heaps of things,
A sixpence purchases at least as many;
And every moment from the pocket brings,
The useful penny.
Even the odd Half-crown may have its use,
But why bring you, you poor superfluous bore in?
What mortal ever wants, save to abuse,
The fruitless Florin P
And yet you crowd my pocket, fill my purse,
To the exclusion of brave "bobs" and "tenners."
I lose my cash through you, and—what is more
Perhaps—my manners!
Say, that a cab I call, the distance, say,
Is half a mile, the fare—of course, a shilling.
The tariff-rate, arranged, the which to pay
I'm not unwilling.
My hand in all my pockets wild may range,
But not one sixpence or one shilling collars.
(For if you change a sovereign now, your change
Is all^' Half-dollars").
Cabby has none—cabbies are far too "wide "—
So, after lots of hunting, and much " bobbery,"
I pay two shillings for a half-mile ride!
/ call it robbery!
Two shillings or four sixpences fulfil
The Florin's every duty, and their own too.
Why then the Florin, which of purse and till
A plague has grown to?
Silver I scarce can get, save in its form;
I've seven in my pocket at this moment!
Can such a curse—excuse my language warm!—
Need further comment P
Why flood the circulation with these coins,
Whioh rile the testy, and which rob the thrifty,
And only serve the servant who purloins—
The Cabman shifty?
I'm sure they rob me of ten pounds a year,
(I gravely doubt if 'tis not nearer twenty),
Which I might save were "bobs" less scarce, and dear
Old "tanners" plenty.
I've suffered long: at last my plaint's in print.
My plan—most men, I'm certain, will agree to it—
Is, call the Florin in! I hope the Mint
Will kindly see to it!

"Grand Cross stared
selling the fishing rights on an Invernesshire loch, and turning banks
and braes into deer-forests. Not a new thing; didn't happen during
the recess; why wasn't it brought up before? Simply because the
burly Lord-Advocate was at hand, and Scots-wha-hae shrewdly
thought they'd suffered enough in times past without wantonly
incurring fresh danger. The Macdonald's place scarcely filled up
when Fraser Mackintosh, in his animated and picturesque style,
clamours about fishing rights and talks treason about deer-forests.
Old Morality turns uneasily on the bench, and looks wistfully
towards the corner-post against which the departed Lord-Advocate's
back was wont to rest with temporary impunity. Sorry for 0. M.
Tell him a little secret. Amongst messengers on duty at Lobby-
door, is one who bears singularly close resemblance to the departed
chief. About the same height, perhaps a trifle less burly, but with
the same capability of extended shirt-front, the same pose of head,
the same striking profile, and the same expanse of beardless coun-
tenance.
"If, old friend," I say to First Lord, " you could double his wages,
Sractise him in the cultivation of infinite scorn of Scotch Members,
ress him in a suit of the Chieftain's clothes, and prop him up with
his back against the post at the end of Treasury Bench, you'd hear
no more of Fraser Mackintosh."
"Thank you, Toby," said 0. M., pressing my paw. "That's a
very valuable suggestion. I '11 see it something can't be done in the
matter before Scotch Votes come on next week. 'To be Forearmed
is to be Forewarned,' as we used to write in fair round hand."
In the meanwhile Robertson goes a step higher, and fills a section
of the Lord-Advocate's plaoe, whilst Stormouth Darlixg comes
in as Solicitor-General for Scotland.
"Charlie used to be my Darling," said Old Morality, turning
round to gaze at the venerable figure of the Member for Deptford;
"now it's Stormouth, Life is full of change. Here to-day, we're

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Domestic Pets. — If the Lawn-Tennis Net, spread, as you
describe, over the top of your Area, is not considered by your
neighbours a sufficient restraint for your two full-grown Bengal
Tigers, why not keep them in the coal-cellar? You could then feed
them conveniently with the tinned salmon you mention, through the
aperture in the pavement in front of your premises. There being a
Board School opposite, you cannot, of course, very well give them an
airing in the day-time, but between two and three o'clock, a.m., in
the small hours of the morning, when the streets are more or less
deserted, you could, with the aid of nine or ten policemen, armed
with red-hot pincers and crowbars, easily manage it. Anyhow you
could do no harm in trying the experiment. With regard to the
Kangaroo, having succeeded in getting it there, by all means keep it
in the linen cupboard. If it show signs of growing obstreperous,
give it chloral with its dog-biscuit.
Cards, — There is an infallible method of securing all tie four
honours in your own hand at whist; but, by playing with pre-
prepared packs, providing yourself with advantage" cuffs and
"expansion" sleeves, and dealing with a New York "luckmani-
pulator," you may be tolerably sure of holding good cards. It would
be as well, however, to be cautious in having recourse to these arti-
ficial aids, as your frequent detection in their use at any well-known
West End Club might possibly lead to some slight unpleasantness
with the Committee. "igiVjj a'-wjtt"
Country House.—If your servants are all givinjr you warning,
because, as you say, the mansion you are renting for the summer

"The University of Giessen has made Bismarck

MR. BULL AND MYNHEER.
"On the 17th November Dutchmen are prepar-
ing to celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of
the liberation of the Netherlands from French
domination, and the re-establishment of national
independence."—Times.
"It is just two centuries to-day (November 6)
since modern English political history began with
the landing of William of Orango at Brixhain
Harbour, Torbay."—Mrs. Lynn Linton, in "tit.
James's Gazette."
Mr. Bull. Your health, Mynheer, in a
genuine Dutchman's draught! You know,
perhaps, what the rousing chorus of the
popular glee says:—
"It's oh! that a Dutchman's draught Bhould be
As deep as the rolling Zuyder Zee!"
Mynheer. Verily, Mr. Bull, Van Dunk's
powers of potation were less typical than
some shouters of that roystering chorus seem
to suppose:—
"Mynheer Van Dunk,
Though he never got drunk.
Sipped braudy-and-water gaily;
And he quenched his thirst
With two quarts of the first
To a pint of the latter daily."
'Tisn't a legion of hihulous Van Dunks, my
friend, who would have snatched Holland
from the ocean sand-flats, or fought Philip
of Spain. But for once, and, in response to
your hearty challenge, I'll not shirk even
what you call a Dutchman's draught. This
schnapps is no had stingo, as mellow as old
Irish, nnd ns toothsome as " right Nantz."
Mr. Bull. Well, Mynheer, we have heen
linked in many ways in history. We have
fought yard-arm to yard-arm, with no great
discredit to either. If we have given you a
licking, occasionally, in return you have
given us a king. That trims the balance, I
reckon,—not to name Van Tbomp and his
broom! But the toast I now propose is,
"Liberty, and our Lasting Friendship!"
In connection wherewith accept my hearty
congratulations on your glorious anniversary.
Mynheer. Thanks, my friend! In return
accept mine upon yours. Seventy-five years or
two centuries, they both represent the same
thing, the thing we have botn fought for and
laboured for, the very breath of the nostrils
of both Hollander and Anglo-Saxon—Liberty!
[ They drink deeply.
Mr. Bull. By ;the way; Mynheer, there is
likely to be yet another link between us. If
I may trust the Cambridge Bevietc, you are
adopting, under whatever difficulties, our
national game. I understand there are more
than a hundred cricket-clubs in Holland!
[ hope we shall see you and your Batavian
batsmen and bowlers at Lords and the Oval
yet. You ought to be handy at "the wil-
low," Mynheer.
Mynheer. Why, yes, willows we have in
plenty, but in circumscribed, sandy, dyke-
divided Holland, good cricket-grounds are
scarce, and good wickets not so easv to get
as in your own grassy Isle. But difficulties
notwithstanding, my boys have heen going
it at the Malibaan, and many "een zeer
leelijken bal"—what you call a "shooter"
—has flown from a Dutch fist during the
last few seasons.
Mr. Bull. Hooray! If we once light on
the cricket-field we shall hardly want to fight
elsewhere, Mynheer—even in Africa, I hope.
"In matters of Commerce, the fault of the Dutch,
Is giving too little and asking too much."
You know the old metrical sneer. Suppose
we alter it to:—
"In matters of bowling the fault of the Dutch,
Is changing too little, ' long-hopping' too much."
That takes all the sting out of it, Mynheer.
And you'll soon alter all that, with a few
wrinkles from our Graces, Lohmanns, and
Steels. Already, I'm tola you are rattling
wicket-keepers, and no muffs at a catch.
Mynheer. You do me proud, Mr. Bull.
And if I also may venture upon doggerel in a
languago which is not mine own, I would
add:—
And when we 're a little bit more of " dry bobs,"
We shall not be such "passive victims of lobs."
as your Daily News says we are at present.
Perhaps with mole-hills in the out field, and
a public right-of-way between the wickets,
even your own champion would find his scores
dwindling, and his average suffering.
Mr. Bull. Probably. But pretty soon I ex-
pect we shall hear of a "Batavian Grace,"
in a sense quite other than that of Disraeli's
celebrated back-hander to poor Beresford
Hope.
Mynheer. I hope so," I'm sure. But, of
course, in—
A land that rides at anchor and is moored,
In which they do not live, but go aboard,
as another of your satirical rhymesters has it,
our willow-wielders are at a disadvantage.
Still this sounds business-like, Mr. Bull :—
"F. Lelyveld en Suermondt top scorers
icaren. Am rolg de een batting performance,
zooah maar zelden hier in Holland gezien
icordt. Terwijl Kolet heel kalm blockt, sloeg
v. Haeften er lustig op los."
Mr. Bull. Business-like? It sounds quite
international and Volapiik-ish, Mynheer. By
Jove, I seem to see my wav to a rattling song
for a Cricket Supper,—" The Hit to Leg," to
the tune of "The Cork Leg," you know.
(Sings.) I '11 tell you a tale without any flam,
Of a Slogger named Mynheer Von Clam.
Who every morning said, " I am
The hardest hitter in Rotterdam."
Ri-tooral-looral, &c.
One day ho'd been having a turn at the keg,
And he stood at the wickets as stiff as a peg.
He feared he should hardly " break his egg,"
But he fluked a most wonderful hit to leg.
The fine hit gave Mynheer delight,
He had timed it well, and he caught it right.
It soared and soared to an awful height,
And in less than a moment was out of sight.
The batsmen ran a regular race,
Till each was perspiring and purple of face;
Still that ball went on at a pelting pace,
And the fieldsmen still kept up the chase.
They added a hundred and one to the score,
Then they stopped, perspiring at every pore;
They had won the match, midst a general roar,
But they never got sight of that ball any more!
My tale I've told, both plain and free,
Of the hardest slogger that could be,
He never was out at all, d'ye see
From that wonderful hit to L. E. G.,
Ri-tooral-looral-looral-looral,
Ri-to-loorallay!
Mynheer. Ha! ha ! ha! Another bumjwr,
Mr. Bull! Here's a health to Britons, Bata-
vians, and Batsmen!!! [Left drinking.

THAT EVENING PIPE.
[The Recreative Evening School Association has

RUBY.
(Nbw Version.) A Soxo op a Syndicate.
(Sung by Captain P-U-n.)
I spotted the chance of a "boom" last year,
But now I perceive that we 're all done brown;
Oar Syndicate's out in the cold, I fear,
Ana the India Office has let us down.-
'Twas a Burmah Spec, that seemed bound to succeed,
For the Chief Commissioner did not decline,
Lord Dufferin smiled, and they all agreed
That tee were to boss the big Ruby Mine.
'Tis a memory sad, and our hopes fast fleet,
For lost seems the chance of that fat five years;
The Concession is cancelled; what use to treat,
If Gobst steps in, and our bargain " queers"?
Once more to the market it open lies,
That grand Concession. Y ou must agree
That there is cause for immense surprise,
And the passionate pleadings that break from me,
Oh, Ruby Mine, darling, that opening grand
We greeted with joy may be never our own,
Perchance, it may pass to another hand,
Though the Streeter Syndicate loudly groan.
The Concession I settled seems mere dead leaves;
May Parliament list to our earnest prayer!
Oh, Gorsty, whose conduct our bosom grieves,
We pine for the hour of our meeting there!
MUSIC OF THE FUTURE.
The Novello Series of Oratorios will commence early in
Dec., under the conductorship of Dr. A. C. Mackenzie. As
the name Novello implies, there are plenty of Novelloties
in the programme. We hear that someone has re-written
"JubaVt Lyre" and that Dr. Mackenzie has re-set
it. Not having as yet received the score from Our Own
Special Musical Critic, we can only give the public a speci-
men of the librettist's adaptation. Here is a verse:—
"0 had I Jubal's Lyre, I And teach him (by derire)
I'd punch his wicked head, | To tell the truth instead."
The musical setting to this is, we are informed, well
worthy of the inspiration to which we owe these magnifi-
cent words. Dr. Mackenzie—not Sir Morkll, but the
still more Musical Doctor—is, of course, the composer, and
the Morell of the lines lies in the application of them.

ROBERT ON THE TURTEL FAMINE!
Praps one of the worry wust sines of the low wulgarity and hutter
habsense of respek for other peeple's feelings, as marks the present
low levelling times, is to be seen in the miss-
placed and crewel jokes with which the sad
intelligense has been reseaved of the probbabel
"famine of Turtel" with which the werry
hiest horders of the dining-out world is now
threttened!
That the pore hungry can-oil, as the
French werry propperly calls the mere mob,
who of coarse never has tasted, and is never
likely to taste, the most xquizzet dellycasy
of the werry grandest of menus, shood rejoice
at the hawiul prospek of a hutter failure of
this werry grandest of crops, is but nateral
and ony conformabel to their gelous natur.
But that hedhitters of respectabel noose-
papers, who are themselvs sumtimes alloud
to partake of this expensiv lucksury, shood
jine in the ribbold jeer, is, I confess a stag-
gerer, and has, I also confesses, touched me deeply.
Can any one of these ginerally respectabel Gents have ellowed his-
Belf to renekt, carmly and seryously, upon the degree of sumthink
werry near aproaching to hagony with which the great Firm of
Bring and Rimer must have seed aproaching the possybillity of a
Lord Mare's Banqwet on the sacred 9th without no Turtel Soup! 1
am appy to say as the dredf ul secret of the possibel camming Famine
was not rewealed to me until the nex day, or I werry much dowt
weather I cood have gorn thro my heavy dooties with my oustomery
sucksess.
There's jest one little suckemstance, of so nobel and ginerous a
charackter, that I feels it my dooty to reweal it for the hadmirashun
of posteryty. In spite of the tremenjus wallue of Turtel Soop at
that time, and its posserbly fabbylus wally when the dredded famine
has reeched our shoars, no differens, I am hinfonned, was made in

the ousstouiary derangements, but the hole of the left Soop on the
Friday's Bankwet was given to the Pore, as ushal, on the folk-ring
morning 1
Whether it woodn't have been more keanly apreeshiated had it
have been distribooted among the noble Army of Waiters, as made
the Bankwet so great a sucksess, it is not for me to say, and I
dismisses the ongeneruss thort with a si.
I hundestand as sewers! of the great Liwery Cumpanys have
patriotically rcsolwed to adjurn sum of theyr mostskrumpshus Bank-
wets for the presint, in hopes the Famine may blow over, and
however much me and my olass may lament our terry bel losses, I am
obliged to confess as they are rite, for how could they posserbly hask
a Royal Prince, or ewen a Royal Dook, to theyr Alls of Ospitalerty
without the customery lushus lucksery to which they has so long bin
acustomed.
Why the West Ingy Plainters, who cultiwates Turtels the same as
our Farmers cultiwates Bullocks, shood suddenly be so werry short
of 'em, of coarse I am quite hunabel to say, but it suttenly does look
rather suspishus that it shood have append atjist the werry busy
time when the demand for 'em is so werry owerpowering.
The base ellusions to Conger Eels and Wales, I treat with the
utter contemp they deserve. Sumbody says in the play sumwhere,
that sumthink or other is " werry like a Wale," but he would be a
bold man indead as wood say as a Wale was "werry like a Turtel!"
No thank ye, that woodn't do for a hexpert with the werry

What Will They Do to Them P—Murphy and Brannaoan have
obtained the Queen's pardon—for what? For having been in penal
servitude for nine years? Surely the Queen's pardon in such a case
should mean something more than'' I beg your pardon, and I grant you
grace," and should be accompanied by a provision for life, subscribed
by witnesses, judge, and jury. We hope it has already taken this
form, and that those who are now convinced of the great wrong done
to these two men may have " The courage of their conviction," and
speak up boldly in behalf of Murphy and Buannagan.

Bow-wowing him out.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A deltghtfuxly told romance is The Countess Eve, by J. H.
Short house. An additional charm is, that it is in one volume.
No wanderings, as in John Inglesant. One of the heroes is an
Actor. I should like to hear what
Mr. Irving would have to say about
the truth of this character to nature.
Mr. Shorthouse's Stage is an ideal
one; but then the story is as fanci-
fully conceived and nearly as weird as
that of Le Juif Polonais. The triumph
of good over evil is strikingly worked
out. The scene is laid in Franoe, and
the characters are all French. This
being so, why introduce little bits of
Frenoh? For example, why suddenly
style the Superioress of a Convent,
whom he has hitherto spoken of as The Abbess, as La Mere Abbcsse t
Why make an old servant ask the two Gentlemen, "Would les
Messieurs partake of dejeuner before returning to the City?" Are
les Messieurs and "dejeuner" untranslatable? By what authority
does Mr. Shorthousb use&circonflexe in dejeuner f One of the most
subtly conceived and oleverly drawn characters in the book is the little
chattering Vicomte. But no more, or as Mr. Shorthouse would say,
not a word de plus. Those qui like les romans, I fortement recommend
d lire this livre. C'est published par Les Messieurs Macmillan.
I've carried a Walker's pocket-book wherever I've walked during
this year, and am quite sorry to part with it. Still I must in favour
of another Walker—No. 7—a size larger, but slimmer and more
pocketable. Walker's No. 4, I recommend for ladies who have
pockets. The varieties might suit Wagnerites who could speak of
the Walker pocket-books as "the Walkerie."
What a magnificent Christmas present would be the Harry
Furniss's collection of his Artistic Jokes, splendidly bound in one
volume, containing photographs of everv picture in his Bond Street
show, which made such a nit last year, and drew crowds to see his
rare burlesque treatment of the works of the Royal Academicians.
This book, of which he is compiler, printer, and publisher, and part
author with " E. J. M.," would be, indeed, a rare gift, as the issue
is limited to about a hundred and fifty copies, and it is becoming rarer
everyday. "Get it," says The Baron de Book-Worms.
VOCES POPULI.
AT EDINBURGH CASTLE.
Scene—Entrance to the Castle. A small Party of Sightseers have
just retained the services of an Official Guide.
Guide {in a mellifluous tone and without any stops whatever, fixing
his eyes on vacancy, having apparently committed his discourse to
memory). Before commencing our round of the Castle Lady and
Gentlemen I will ask your attention to a few remarks upon the
trench below the drawbridge where we now stand most parties are
apt to .run away with the erronous impression of its being the
ancient moat which a moment's reflection will show us how absurd
this is being more than one 'undred feet above the base of the solid
rock before us is the exercise ground formerly the scene of countless
burnings 'angings and other revolting spectacles common to that
barbarious age now appily for ever past from us!
First Sightseer {desirous to gratify the Guide, and display his
Military knowledge). You could hold this place against any odds,
eh? Practically impregnable, I suppose t
Guide (blandly). Well. Sir, as a fortress, it is quite obslete,
being commanded by Arthur's Seat.
A "Stoopid" S. Who did you say commands the Castle?
[Discovers that he is cut off from Guide by a body of soldiers
marching down to drill. By time he comes up with him
again, Guide is already explaining something else, and
question allowed to drop.
Guide. Above the same-eye Gothic arch under which we are now
about to pass you will observe the Scots arms carved above with the
motto Nemo me impugn lacessit no one provokes me with impunity.
The Stoopid S. (m a whisper). What did he say provoked him?
Guide {continuing). In the chamber above the last and innermost
gate making seven in all and lighted by a single grating it formed
the place or confinement for the luckless Argyll previous to his
execution there the original study was made by Ward for his
picture the " Last Sleep of Argyll" now in the 'Ouses of Parliament.
Sightseers {who have never seen the Westminster frescoes). Really?
painted there, was it! [They regard the grating with dawning interest.
The S. S. Singular thing to do—sending an artist to paint him

days! [Moralises on the past.

recent times in the latest baronial style on your left as you go

the only means of access from the condemned cells to the place of

two sides misery and splendour the 'ighest and the lowest. (Halts
in an impressive manner. Sightseers prepare, in limp attitudes, to
receive information.) You follow the direotion of my staff to the
furthest corner of the ramparts where the turret projects it was

our historical records a curious coincident took place the manner in
which the Castle was taken by surprise by Randolph with only thirty
picked men ascending the well-nigh precipitous rock the checkwateh

stones with which in those days for purposes of defence the rampart

stratagems known to 'istry!
The S. S. {admiringly). And were you there?
Guide. No, Sir: it took place in thirteen 'undred and twelve, Sir—

ordnance we are now passing is the famous Mons Meg. Ladies and
Gentlemen it is unnecessary for me to explain the cannon the

The S. S. Is that the gun they fire every day by electricity?
Guide. It was last fired in 1682, Sir, being burst by the discharge

for a few minutes, and keep your eye fixed on me? [ Walks slowly to
a doorway, and touches a stone above it with his stick, sightseers look
on, apparently in expectation of some startling conjuring trick.

never yet cleared up was made some years ago in the exact spot which
you saw me touch with my stick some workmen making alterations

for the skeleton to be replaced and the aperture sealed up which
accordingly was done though what or 'oo the infant was it is a

is where the infant was found and where it now is.
The S. S. Did you say that James the First was born in there?
Guide. Yes, Sir, we have 'istorical record of that being so.

theory does not seem to be generally understood, and realises for

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
Sunday, November 4.—Cabbie and I troubled about that mere boy
Lupin getting engaged to be married without consulting us or any-
thing. After dinner he told us all about it. He said the lady's name
was Daisy Hutlae, and she was the nicest,
prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever
met. He loved her the moment he saw her,
and if he had to wait fifty years he would
wait, and he knew she would wait for him.
Lupin further said, with muoh warmth,
that the world was a different world to him
now,—it was a world worth living in. He
lived with an object now, and that was to
make Daisy Mutlae—Daisy Pootee, and he
would guarantee she would not disgrace the
family of the Pootebs. Cabbie here burst
out crying, and threw her arms round his
neck, and in doing so, upset the glass of
port he held in his hands all over his new
light trousers. I said I nad no doubt we should like Miss Mutlab
when we saw her, but Cabbie said she loved her already. I thought
this rather premature, but held my tongue. Daisy Mutlab was the
sole topic of conversation for the remainder of the day. I asked
Lupin who her people were, and he replied, " Oh, you know Mutlae,
Williams and Watts." I did not know, but refrained from
asking further questions, at present, for fear of irritating Lupin.
November 5.—Lupin went with me to the office, and had a long
conversation with Mr. Pebkupp, our principal, the result of which
was that he accepted a clerkship in the firm of Job Cleanands and
Co., Stock and Sharebrokers. Lupin told me, privately, it was an
advertising firm, and he did not think muoh of it. I replied,
"Beggars should not be choosers ;" and I will do Lupin the justice
to say, he looked rather ashamed of himself. In the evening we
went round to the Cummings', to have a few fireworks. It began to
rain, and I thought it rather dull. One of my squibs would not go
off, and Gowtng said, " Hit it on your boot, boy; it will go off then."
I gave it a few knocks on the end of my boot, and it went off with
one loud explosion, and burnt my fingers rather badly. I gave the
rest of my squibs to the little Cummings' boy, to let oft. Another un-
fortunate thing happened, which brought a heap of abuse on my head.
Cummings fastened a large wheel set-piece on a stake in the
ground by way of a grand finale. He made a great fuss about it;
said it cost seven shillings. There was a little difficulty in getting
it alight. At last it went off, but, after a couple of slow revolutions,
it stopped. I had my stick with me, so I gave it a tap to send it
round, and, unfortunately, it fell off the stake on to the grass.
Anybody would have thought I had set the house on fire from the
way in which they stormed at me. I will never join in any more
firework parties. It is a ridiculous waste of time and money.
November 6.—LuriN asked Cabbie to call on Mrs. Mutlab, but
Cabbie said she thought Mrs. Mutlab ought to call on her first. I
agreed with Cabbie, and this led to an argument. However, the
matter was settled by Cabbie saying she could not find any visiting-
cards, and we must get some more printed, and when they were
finished would be quite time enough to discuss the etiquette of calling.
November 7.—I ordered some of aur cards at Black's, the Stationers.
I ordered twenty-five of each, which will last us for a good long time.
In the evening, Lupin brought in Haeby Mutlab, Miss Mutlae's
brother. He was rather a gawky youth, and Lupin said he was the
most popular and best amateur in the Club, referring to the
"Holfoway Comedians." Lutin whispered to us that if we could
only " draw out" Habby a bit, he would make us roar with laughter.
At supper, young Mutlab did several amusing things. He took up
a knife, and with the flat part of it, played a tune on his cheek in a
wonderful manner. He also gave an imitation of an old man with
no teeth, smoking a big cigar. The way he kept dropping the cigar
sent Cabbie into fits. In the course of conversation, Daisy's name
cropped up, and young Mutlae said he would bring his sister round
to us one evening—his parents being rather old-fashioned, and not
going out much. Cabbie said we would get up a little special party.
As young Mutlab showed no inclination to go, and it was approaching
eleven o clock, as a hint I reminded Lupin that he had to be up early
to-morrow. Instead of taking the hint, Mutlab began a series of
comic imitations. He went on for an hour without cessation, Poor
Cabbie could scarcely keep her eyes open. At last she made an
excuse, and said " Good-night.'' Mutlab then left, and I heard him
and Lupin whispering in the hall something about the "Holloway
Comedians,'' ana to my disgust, although it was past midnight,
I Lupin put on his hat and coat, and went out with his new companion.
GUIDES, PHILOSOPHERS, AND PBIENDS-LN-NEED.
The ladies and gentlemen interested in floating the " Lady Guide
Association," appear not only to have discovered a new social want,
but to be, moreover, confident that they
"~" ft have hit on an excellent method of meeting it.
'■ x The following extract, however, from a little
pamphlet they have recently published fur-
nishes the best explanation of the objects
they have in view, which are:—
"1st.—To supply efficient Guides, who shall be
ladies by birth and education, for the services of
strangers, foreigners, and visitors of their own sex,
to the Metropolis and its Environs.
"2nd.—To provide remunerative employment for
intelligent gentlewomen, who from the present
overcrowded labour markets, are now debarred
from earning a livelihood.
"3rd.—To assist all new comers, by giving in-
formation upon every subject connected with their
visit, aiding them in every way, in a manner wliich
shall relieve them of all trouble, spare them imposi-
tion, and ensure their comfort.
"4th.—To advise Visitors as to the several ways
of seeing and enjoying this Country, at given prices,
and to save the time and money of such visitors."
And to the above, by way of a sort of happy
after-thought, they subjoin the following
foot-note:—
"N.B.—The Guides will be prepared to attend
mixed parties of ladies and gentlemen, families and
children, and those other than gentlemen travelling
en gar<;on."
It appears from the foregoing brief schedule
of some of her proposed requirements that the finished " Lady Guide"
will have to be a very formidably accomplished person, possessing all
the highest moral, social, and intellectual attributes, imbued with a
spirit of the profoundest philosophy, and combining all this with the
advantages of the most perfect walking encyclopaedia. It is not sur-
prising, therefore, to find the Association hinting at the necessity of
candidates wishing to offer their services as " Lady Guides," having
to pass some slight " preliminary examination." Unfortunately, they
do not furnish a specimen test-paper, but that deficiency has been met
by the publication of the following list of questions:—
1. A four-wheeled cab, containing five inside passengers, two
children on the box, and seven trunks on the roof, is taken from
Liverpool Street Station to the extreme end of Hammersmith, and
the Lady who has secured your services as guide, after having made
the cabman carry the seven trunks up to third storey offers him, as
his fare, two-and-ninepence, which he indignantly refuses. On his
subsequently claiming thirteen and sixpence, and taking off his coat
and offering to fight the gentleman of the party for that amount on
the steps of the house in the presence of a sympathising crowd, what

THE CHILD OF THE PERIOD.
Aunt Betsy. "I REALLY WONDER AT TOUR HAVING SO MANY FRENCH BOOKS IN YOUR LIBRARY, JAMES, WITH ALL YOUR DAUGHTERS
GROWING UP!"
Em (who litis overheard). "French Books, indeed! The idea! Why, we should nsver think of revdino a French Book,
IF WK COULD HELP IT—SOT EVBX IP PAPA WSltS TO FORBID US TO!"
EXTREMES MEET.
(An Ancient Story wWi a Modern Moral.)
There was (of course it must have been long
since—
The present would regard with lofty pity
Men who such civic folly could evince)—
But, whensoe'er it was, there was a City;
A populous City, of colossal size,
Over some hundreds of square miles ex-
tending-,
Its palaces the marvel of all eyes,
Its serpentining maze of streets unending.
And it was wealthy, was that City wide,
The opulence of Ophir were a trifle
To what was stored in it on every side.
Its banks to sack, its palaces to ride.
Might tempt suoh stoics as Lycurgus taught,
Much more mere ruffianly back-street ban-
ditti:
So that if Wealth's position e'er was fraught
With desperate danger, it was in that City.
And Tower there had fashioned a Police
To safeguard Wealth, and keep poor rascals
quiet;
To bid the worrying wail of misery cease,
And check all impulse to rapine and riot.
Most wise, most provident in Power, of
course;
Where Lazarus and Dives are close neigh-
bours,
It needs the presence of well-ordered force
To keep Wealth safe, and Work-thralls at
their labours.
"Force is no remedy." This doctrine mad
Was held by some of Liberty's loud zealots.
"How save by force is Order to be had
'Midst a mixed horde of millionnaires and
helots?"
So Power very pertinently asked;
And Law, in Power's hands, supplied the
answer,
And held that to have bettered it had tasked
The skill of an Utopian necromancer.
There came a time—(of course, 'twas long
ago) —
When Power and its Police began to
wrangle.
Now, Music won't maintain its magic flow
When even the performers jar and jangle.
If the Big Drum belabours the Trombone,
And the Bass Viol pummels the First Fiddle,
Good-bye to harmony! Time, tune, and tone
Wrill be chaotic as a madman's riddle.
Well, the Police appeared to lose its head,
And Power its heart: a serious disaster!
They seemed demented by some strange new
dread, [master.
And doubtings as to which of them was
A Democratic Spectre startled some
As a new avatar of Demogorgon.
Others opined that this was all a hum,
That the loud mouth was merely Freedom's
organ,
Not Anarchy's red maw, or Robbery's gorge,
Gaping for prey, and avid after plunder;
'Twas merely an excuse for Power to forge
F'resh chains for Freedom and keep Labour
under.
Hence chiding and cross purposes, and hence
Much heated fuss that needed sense refri-
gerant.
You cannot quite depend on the Defence
When the Defenders are themselves belli-
gerent.
One Chief was sacked because he let the
clutch
Of Anarchy come close, and did too little.
Another one because he did too much,
Or so some said. "Nay, not a jot or tittle!"
Others retorted. That he /aid a lot
Was very certain, and, uo doubt, a pity.
Meanwhile, with wills at war and tempers
hot,
The prospect was not pleasant for that City.
The bearings of this ancient legend be
In their contemporary application.
If such be visible to Wisdom's eye,
Wisdom should promptly change the situa-
tion.
Power may at the implication chafe;
Police may fume at the implied comparison;
But is the Citadel entirely safe
Whilst there is angry strife amidst the
garrison?
A Distinction.
A Correspondent wants to know if an
Editor of a satirical and humorous Magazine
ought not himself to be an exceptionally bril-
liant wit? Our reply is, "Not necessarily:
but it is absolutely essential that he should
have all his wits about him,—on the staff."

THE DRAMA-MAJOR AND MINOR.
Dr. Birch's Academy for Young Gentlemen.
Mr Dear Mb. Punch,
You know, when I grow up to be a big man, like my
father, I want to be a great writer
of plays—a Dramatist, don't you call
it? I have already a stage, which
cost seven-and-sixpenoe, inclusive of a
very interesting piece, called The Miller
and his Men, which is in Five Acts,
and is printed in about eight pages.
Now, as a very great treat, my father
took me, the other night—when I came
up to Town to visit the dentist—to see
Hands Across the Sea, at the Princess's
Theatre; and, from the papers, I learn
that all the critics think it is a model
drama. If Hands Across the Sea is a
model Melodrama, I think The Miller
and his Men must have been one too,
: as Hands Across the Sea can be played
just as easily in my toy Theatre. Here
is my version, and I don't think I have

Telegram from Prime Minister of South- West Cariboo to

Hear you've appointed Sir Michael Ticmirsh as Governor.
Don't send him out. Won't do at any price. Try another.
From Colonial Secretary to Prime Minister of South- West Cariboo.
Anything to oblige. Just told Sir Michael he would not do. He
seemed surprised, and asked why. Would you mind kindly saying
why. Don t doubt your judgment, but it would look better to give
a reason. Reply prepaid.
From Cariboo Primi Minister to Colo nial Secretary.
We don't want him. Isn't that enough? I may, however, inform
you confidentially, that somebody out here onoe saw a man like
Sir M. riding on outside of a City Omnibus, reading a halfpenny
newspaper. Mind and let us know whom you think of for his
substitute.

Don't think of anybody. Leave you to suggest.
From Cariboo Premier to Colonial Secretary.
Glad you've adopted so sensible a course. Will wire names of
acceptable persons for you to choose from in day or two.
Colonial Secretary to Cariboo Premier.
Received your names. Lord S. says he would be delighted, but
thinks it would be difficult to find tenant for Hatfield House during
his absence. Have sounded Mr. G. also, who is much flattered, but
thinks he's hardly good enough for the post. Home Secretary here
will probably be quitting the position soon: what do you say to him f
Or, perhaps, Sir W. Harcourt might think of place, and we could
spare him.
Cariboo Prime Minister to Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Your last most insulting. We consider ourselves a cut above
Home Secretaries, past or present. Surprised that S. and G. don't
care to oome. Have decided to fill up vacancy ourselves, and wiU.
let you know result in a month or two by letter. Meanwhile, try

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A SLAVE OF FASHION.
Lady (who has just paid a Month's subscription to the Circulating Library).
"What kind of Books are read this Season?"
THE VISIBLE PRINCE.-(A Story of Magic and Mystery.)
"How I should like to do all this '(" I murmured to myself. I had been
reading an account of the journey of an Illustrious Personage, and the passage
had deeply impressed me.
"If you mean what you say," replied someone by my side, "I think I can
manage it for you. All you have to do is to wear this, and express a wish to
follow H.R.H. But I warn you that, until you return it to me, you will be able
to follow no one else, and will remain a fixture until a new wish moves you
on," and I found myself receiving an old opera-hat in the Coffee-room of my
Club from a member I had not seen before.
"Do you mean to say that if I put this on it will carry me anywhere?" I
asked, in a tone of astonishment. The strange member nodded.
I put the old opera-hat on my head, and wishing myself near the Illustrious
Personage in question, suddenly found myself in Bulgaria. Immediately I
formed part of a group that would have given an excellent subject to the Travel-
ling Artist of the Graphic or the Illustrated London ATetcs. There was the
Illustrious Personage, sure enough; and, so far as I could see, he was taking a
hurried shot at a bird. He fired successfully, and then looked at his watch.
Then he shook hands with some one in attendance, and was gone. I had
mechanically removed my hat on finding myself in his presence, and at once found
that, uncovered, I was helpless—could move neither hand nor foot. The com-
panions of the Illustrious Personage retired, and I was left alone—in splendid
scenery, but still alone. I put on my hat, and uttered a wish. In a moment
I was in Hungary, inspecting a cavalry regiment. The Colonel of the regiment
was complimenting his men on their smart appearance. Wearing my hat (for
I had already found that my chapcau rendered me invisible), 1 approached
nearer, and discovered that the Commanding Officer who was so complimentary
was no less a person than the heir to an Illustrious Throne. I heard, him ask
for the time (his uniform fitted closely to his figure, and had no pocket), and,
on learning the hour, he bade his men a hurried adieu, and hastily departed.
Pressing my hat firmly on my brow, I uttered a wish, and immediately was in
Russia. I recognised the voice of the Illustrious Personage. He was bidding
the Czar farewell. In another second he was gone!
Again, I found myself alone; and, perforce, had to
resume my rapid travelling. It would be wearisome to
recount the story of my wanderings. Suffice it to say
that I visited in turn Athens, Berlin, Homburg, Monte
Carlo, and Copenhagen. Although I had the advantage
of my travelling opera-hat which conveyed me instantly
from place to place without effort, I felt that I was wear-
ing myself out, while the Illustrious Personage in whose
wake I was forced to follow, seemed to me never to expe-
rience fatigue. He was always courteous, always cheer-
ful, but always looking at his watch.
Now," I murmured to myself, when I found myself
in Paris, "I shall have a short pause before I recommence
my wanderings." I was mistaken. Before I knew where
I was, I found myself in Yorkshire, Wales, Glasgow, and
the Isle of Wight. I felt that my magic opera-hat was
less than a blessing—that it was nearer a curse!
"What shall I do ?" I said, piteously, as I found my-
self alone at the bottom of a coal-mine, which I, in Illus-
trious company, had recently been inspecting. "What
shall I do 'i" The echo offering no satisfactory reply, I
I onoe more wished my wish, and, hi presto .' was back in
London in my own Club. '' Have you had enough of it?"
I turned round sharply, and found my fellow member
of the morning seated beside me.
"Thank you," I replied, returning the gibus, "but
pleasant as travelling may be, I honestly believe there
is only one man in the world who is equal to the strain
that you put upon me." And I glanced at the Illustrious
Personage, who, I noticed, had just taken out his watch
and was looking at it.
THE MES. HAEEIS OF THE TREASURY.
"' Being me my boots,' taid the Baron." "Bring me
the Last of the Barons," quoth Mr. Punch. And he
was brought. "What saidst thou, my Lord, the other
day, about the Public Prosecutor?" asked Mr. P.
Sir," replied the Last of the Barons, "Je vous dirai
—I mean, I will tell you. I said, in making certain
observations on the case, I had been hearing"
"Which you were thoroughly justified, Sir Last One,
in making," interrupted Mr. Punch, approvingly.
"But proceed."
The Last of the Barons blushed, and bowed, and then
resumed—"I regretted that in this country there
should be no Public Prosecutor."
"What!" exclaimed Mr. P.
"To quote the learned precedent of a certain Prig."
said the Last One, " ' I don't believe there ain't no sich
person.' Mr. Punch clapped his hands. A thousand
of his own pages appeared on the instant.
"Bring me Whitaker's Almanack," he commanded.
At onoe it was handed to him. "Now, let us see," mut-
tered Mr. Punch, turning over the leaves—" Govern-
ment Offices—Treasury—Solicitor's Department—here
we are—read." And the Last of the Barons read out—
"Solicitor and Public Prosecutor, Sir Augustus K.Stiphbx-
son, K.C.B., £3000."
"Well!" said Mr. Punch, "explain!"
"I can't." replied the Last of the Barons, sinking
down in a chair, and pressing his hand to his brow, "I
can't. There ought to be a Public Prosecutor—there is
a Public Prosecutor—somewhere."
"And yet you regretted that, in this country, there
should be no Pubho Prosecutor. How's that t asked
Mr. Punch.
"He is an impalpable official . . . no—I don't under-
stand," murmured the Last of the Barons.
"Nor does any one else," returned Mr. Punch. "As
you have hinted the Public Prosecutor is a Mrs. Harris.
Only the £3000 per annum is real enough. Thank vou.
Last One, for again calling our nttention to the fact. Glad
to see the Last so well and so vigorous."
"Why not say Wig-orous?" whisi>ered the Last of
the Barons, as glancing timidly towards Mr. P., he made
hastily for the door.
"Good morning," said Mr. P. gravely, and the Last
One returned to the Count of Queen's Bench.
"Not there, not there, my Child!"—On Friday
night the intelligence that H.R.H. had preferred hearing
Nadgy to being present at the opening ceremony of the
Lyric Club, caused a Nadgytation from which the Com-
mittee are still suffering.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT. (EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.)

House of Commons, Monday NigJtt, November 12.—House looked
like old times at Question Hour. Benches full; great expectation;
volleyg of Questions. Particular inquiries about Wheel and Van
Tax. Goschen judiciously absent.
"No, Toby," he said, nervously brushing his hat the wrong way.
"If you don t mind, I'll just stop here in my own room till Ques-
tions are over. I know some one will ask whether it's true I have
abandoned the Wheel and Van Tax. I can't, at present, bring
myself to speak on the subject. 1 'm very much attached to the
measure, as they say parents often are to the least thriving of their
offspring. I have cherished it for months against assaults from all
sides, and I cannot face the thought of abandoning it. Life would
not be worth living without my Wheel and Van Tax. There's
something soothing in the very name."
"Come, come," I said, not liking to see man of mirth like Jokem
thus broken down. "You've done your best; you 'can't help
results. Besides, if you like the sound of name, and they won't let
you have the Wheel and Van Tax, why not try a Weal and 'An
Tax? Anything to turn an honest penny I"
"Toby," he said, springing up, and shaking me warmly by the
paw, "You've saved me. A Weal and 'Am Tax is surely unobjec-
tionable; repeated briskly, sounds much like the other; daresay, in
time, I '11 be able to transfer my affections. Excuse me, I must go
and get up a few statistics, and see how it will work out. 'Weal

Retting a little uppish since he's been Attorney-General and
Leading Counsel for Times in Probate Court. Rather inclined to
snub me. But you stop till Vote comes on for Salary of Law Officers
of Crown, and see what happens!"
"Waited accordingly. Sydney Buxton, having moved to reduce
Attorney-General's salary, Henry James got up;
cut Attorney-General dead. To great delight of
Opposition, argued with irresistible force against
Attorney-General taking private practice. Proved
to demonstration, that, supposing by chance Attorney-
Generai were engaged in great ease that demanded
his presence in Probate or other Court from day to
day; it would be impossible for him to discharge his
duties to nation. Attor-
ney-General could hardly
believe his eyes and ears.
Wasn't this the learned
gentleman who held a brief
with him in a great case,
who sat with him in Court
in the morning, and indioted
him at night in the House
of Commons?
As for Joseph Gillis, his
delight threatened to deepen
into uproar. His shrill
"Hear! hear!" resounded
through crowded and amused
House. His eyes gleamed
with delight as they watched
the Attorney - General.
Smile on his face extended
bevond all precedent.!
Must be down early to the Court in the morning," he said, "and
see what Webster says to James when they take their seats
together." Business done.—Supply.
Tuesday.—Grandolph and Jennings on the job. Sage of Queen
Anne's Gate, and others, speaking disrespectfully of Lord Chan-
cellor. House seems to have heard something before of Halsbury's
great merits as family man; but, never in such disrespectful detail.
Appears, according to witnesses testifying upon their Parliamentary
Oath, that Lord Chancellor sort of farms out offices of State, first
providing for those of his own family, and next for his family's
friends.
"There never was such a jobber," says the Sage, amid cheers and
laughter. Filled up a certain office of Official Referee declared by
Secretary to Treasury and
Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer to be unnecessary.
"Filled it up," cried
Grandolph, " in the teeth
of the opinion of the Trea-
sury."
"Quite a dental opera-
tion, you see," said Duff,
giving his moustache that
final twirl which Gran-
dolph affects to despise,
but secretly envies. No
one to say a good word for
the Lord High Jobber, his
far-reaching family, or his
family's friends.
At very moment, as it
happenedj Lord High Job-
ber on his feet in Lords,
perched on highest pede-
stal of loftiest morality,
protesting against the
Oaths Bill. Standing aside

svelt figure draped in
graceful folds of flowing
gown, his intellectual face
shadowed under framework
In the Heat of Argument. of maMiye ^ h(J spoke
more in sorrow than in anger. All very well for Markiss to stand
aside; for Bishop of Carlisle actually to support Bill; for Spencer,
GRANvrLLE, and Derby, to declare in its favour. The purer nature,
the more spotless integrity, of Lord High Jobber would nave neither
part nor lot with the accursed thing.
A beautiful sight! A touching spectacle! and all the while, at
this very moment, separated only by the length of the corridor and
breadth of the lobby, rude persons were prating about the good man's
jobbery, and denouncing his dealings with unprotected public purse.

"Suoh is Life!" as Old Morality profoundly remarked when he
heard the story. Business done.—Supply voted.
Thursday. Decks cleared for action to-night. Been plodding
along for ten days in Supply. [Occasional explosions, like fog-
signals on railway; but nothing serious. Now trumpet sounds:
forces marshal in battle array. Old Morality sounded
trumpet, though not his own. Too modest for that.
Anxious chiefly to get business through. Always ready to
efface himself with that object.
"Tell you what, ToBY,'r G. 0. M. said to me the other
day, "some of vou fellows laugh at Smtth, but he geta
through his work uncommonly well; makes no fuss; always
courteous; a thorough man of business; hasn't an enemy
in the House unless it be
Grandolph; on the whole,
in position of peculiar diffi-
culty, does better than any-
one else they could put
there."
G. 0. M. right as usual.
House getting to like Old
Morality, something in the
way it used to be attached
to Stafford Northcote.
Laughs at him now and
then, but always good-
humouredly. Really anx-
ious to make things as
smooth for him as possible.
But line must be drawn
somewhere. When to-night
he announces introduction
of new Land Purchase Act,
shout of defiance goes up from Opposition ranks. Grand Old Man
steps into front, waves the Grand Old Flag: next week there '11 be a
Grand Old Row.
Meanwhile Home Secretary having a bad time. Peppered on
all sides; adversaries in front of him, enemies to right of him.
.Johnston at back of him. Matth EW8 in heat of argument momen-
tarily turns back on Speaker, addressing Member below the Gang-
way. Johnston discovers in this indication of design to undermine
position of Queen as Head of Church. Hotly protests; Matthews
numbly apologises. Business done.—Supply.
Friday.—Met Pshaw-Lefevre in Library just now with hat tilted
further than ever from lofty brow. Oddly enough, that's his way of
indicating deeper depression.
;fWhat's the matterP" I asked. "Balfour
still refuse to put you on a plank bed t"
"No," he said, wearily, I'm used to that exer-
cise of tyranny. It's the Sage of Queen Anne's
Gate that weighs me down. You know all about
my scheme for adding Mortuarv Chapel to West-
minster Abbey? Splendid idea; quite prac-
ticable; illustrated with maps. Talking
about it to Saoe, told him how there were
two houses close by Abbey, to be bought on
easy terms, furnishing site for chapel. Sage
deeply interested. Much flattered by his
attention; enlarged upon theme; said he
thought it capital. Week after surprised to
hear one of the houses been sold. 'Who
bought it?' I asked agent. 'Mr. Labou-
chere,' said he. Looked up Sage. Ex-
pected to discover him deeply abased; found
him rather radiant than otherwise. 'Capital
investment for me,' says he. 'If site is
compulsorily taken, you must
pay me at least fifteen per cent.

HEIGHO 'BACCY!
(Ode on an Empty Pipe. By a Hard-up Smoker.)
Pleasant pipe, companionable clay!
Empty—like thy luckless master's pocket,
Fireless as Care's candle
burned away,
Long ere daybreak, to
the very socket!
When a cove is penni-
less and dry.
Having whiffed the
last of his small
whack, he
Can donoughtbut pouch
his pipe, and cry,
Heigho 'Baccy!
Heigho 'Baccy! I can
understand
How the "lag" in
lonely cell longs for
thee;
How the storm - tost
sailor, far from
land,
Yearns in night's long
watch to blow" or
"chor" thee.

Comfortable weed! Out on the churls,
Scientific prigs, and sawbones quaoky,
Who find mischief in thy fragrant whirls,
Heigho 'Baccy!
When the tinless toiler draws his belt
With a trembling hand a trifle tighter
To compress that vacuum each has felt
Who with poverty has been a fighter,
If his lips may but caress his clay,
Though cash will not run to glass or snack, he,
With recovered pluck can peg away.
Heigho 'Baccy!
When cold Care confronts one in life's road,
When bereavement chills the lonely ingle,
When sharp disappointment wields its goad,
When a chap is seedy, stumped, sad, single,
Then, however sage ones chide or croak,
Spite of doctor harsh, fanatio cracky,
There is comfort in a quiet smoke!
Heigho 'Baccy!
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Cricketing Venture.—By all means carry out your
plan of bringing over an Eleven of Caggerwce Cannibal
Islanders to play a series of Matches with the leading
County Clubs next season. Your idea of acoustoming
them to the game by letting them do their bowling, in the
first instance, with a human head, and their batting with
an adult thigh-bone, is excellent. Be careful, when you
fet them on to the field, that they do not eat the Wicket-
eeper's gloves, and Longstops' pads, or want to roast the
Umpire, as they invariably do in their own national game
of Balagoo, after the first innings. You could convey
them safely to the Oval in any Police omnibus. Spec-
tators, of course, would have to look out for themselves.
Dress Circxe.—It would have been better had you
not, on being removed from the theatre, offered to fight
the three Box-keepers with your left hand, and knocked
the Acting Manager's hat over his eyes. Still your
assailant had no right to obstruct your view of the stage
by sitting on his great-coat, and then throw you over
into the pit when you complained. Try a cross-summons.
Chess.—You cannot move your Queen like a Knight,
unless you get a safe opportunity, when your opponent
is not looking. If you are getting the worst of a game
when playing for a shilling, certainly knock the board
over. This is frequently done in International contests
and counts as a draw.
Sporting.—You will be certainly right in entering your
Four-wheeler cab-horse for the next Derby. Never mind
the condition of his knees, but stick to your determina-
tion to ride the horse yourself, and you may yet pull off
the race with him. 1 hero is a slight entrance fee; but
Sou can get any further particulars from any one of the
tewards of the Jockey Club.
tol. xcv.
Etiquette.—It is not exactly a breach of good manners at a fashionable dinner
party to ask five times for soup, but it would be more comme il fattt to be con-
tented with three helpings. A blue satin tie and a buff waistcoat arc not
generally accepted as correct evening dress in the best society, but carried off
with a little effrontery, they might pass muster. By all means try them at the
Race Ball to which you refer, for if the worst comes to the worst, you can
but be kicked out by the Stewards. Certainly, after the circumstances you
mention, buttonhole the Duke, and if he resent the familiarity, slap him sharply
on the back, and say, "I told you so, old fellow!" If this does not quiet
him, repeat it.
'ARRY ON COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION.
Dear Charlie,—I'm down on my luck, fairly chucked, and no error this go.
I was in for a slap-up new crib, and I thought I should come out top row;
And would you believe it, old pal, though I did do a bit of a cram,
I was bunnioked slap out of the 'unt all along of a bloomin' Exam!
Me, Charlie! and bested at last by a lantern-jaw'd son of a gun,
A ginger-'aired juggins in gig-lamps, who romped in before me like fun.
Mugged a lot about Parley Voo, histry, and grammar, and Latin, and stuff,
But no more in the know as a man, than a monkey—the tow-'eaded muff!
And this is wot Cramming |has brought us to, Charlie! Him give me the
Becos he can spell a bit better, and me sech a scorcher? Wot muck! [chuck,
Hedgercation's a fraud, my dear boy, as they shovel it into us now,
And I'm glad as some toffs as 'ave twigged it are raisin' a bit of a row.
Them there Nineteenth Century nobs knows their book, my dear boy, and no kid.
Wish they'd asked me to tip 'em my notions; I wouldn't ha' charged arf a quid,
I'm that fair on the bile, mate, about it. Competitive System? No doubt.
They may give it fine names like be blowcd, but J oall it a blooming Knock-Out.
It plays into the 'ands of the mugs and the miwies, the saps and the sneaks,
That's wot this dashed " System" does, Charlie. A goose may be stuffed in
six weeks,
Fit to eaokle slap through an Exam, but it's all blessed fiddlededee
To suppose that competitive cram ever turns out sech sparklers as Me.
We are on the wrong lay, that's a moral; the duffers are 'aving the pull.
Jest look at the Germans, dear boy, how they 're stealing a march on John Bull.
Your sandy-topped Sausage in specs is a copping our cribs and our tin,
Whilst becos tee oarn't creak in six languages—bust 'em!—we've not a look in.
It's like this, old pal. Hedgercation is all very well in its way,
But it isn't the lingo as does it. A party may 'ave lots of say,_
And yet when it comes to true smartness he simply mayn't be in the 'unt,
And it is jest these 'ere pattering prigs as is giving us snide 'uns the shunt.
Book-learning, dear boy, is like Ochre, you don't want to spread it too fur;
If we'd all hedgercation and oof there would soon be a pooty fine stir.
Teach all the poor kids 'ow to patter hitalian, and play upon flutes,
And who'd sweep our chimbleys and sewers, or polish our winders and boots?
It/s much too dashed levelling, Charlie. The few as has bullion or brains
Is meant for topsawjers as certain as mountains is higher than plains.
Yus; Life is a 'andicap, Charlie; it would be a blessed fine catch,
If yer trained all the duffers free gratis, and made all the pots start from scratch!
No privilege, Charlie, no patronage P Yah! that's all radical rot;
It's 'ad a long innings and wot's the result P Things is going to pot.
The swells 'as to sweat, and that spiles 'em, the commoners cram and go queer,
Whilst 'Aery's cut out by a mug with a head like a dashed pot o' beer.
Pooty nice state of thingB and no error! "Life's jest a long soramble," sez
Harrison,
"Of pot-hunting." Yus, and he's right, and 'as 'it on a 0. K. comparison.
Blarmed noosance, yer know, if a feller can't nobble a crib and a screw
Without being crammed with more kibosh than Cltve or Lord Wellington knew.
Walter Wren takes the tether side. Jest so! He lives up that street, dontchcr
He's the crammiest crammer of all; wish he'd taken a turn, mate, at me; [see,
He'd ha' shoved me through somehow, you bet; he's a long-headed, 'aid 'itting
But a gent as is really a gent doesn't want to be hep on the shove. [cove,
Sez Wren, "Would you bring old jobbery?" Walter, dear boy, that may do
For a slasher in Qullter's new monthly, the flaming " Flamingo Review."
Nepo—wot's it P—sounds nobby, no doubt, but remember that there Board o' Works!
Human Nature is still Human Nature, and all on us cottons to perks.
We wants it made easy for right 'uns, and nioe for the nobs—and wot 'arm?
There ain't enough nests to go round, let the few keep 'em cosy and warm.
That may not be nighpolite morals, or wirtue on stilts, but I '11 trouble you
To say if it isn't the way of the world, my dear W. W.?
To be worried 'arf out of our senses—us dashers—by dollops of cram;
And then spiked like a juggins at last by an eye-bunger called an Exam;
Great Scott, it's a jiggered fine joke. I'm with Freeman; Exams arc
And if wo don't bosh up that bizness Old England will go to the devil, [all evil,
Appointment by patronage! Ah! that's yer sort, mate, I freeze onto that.
Wot patron of sense would pluck me 'cos I 'adn't got grammar quite pat?
I'm fly, know each game on the board; yet becos facts and dates I carn't carry,
That tow-'eaded mug oops the crib, and I'm ohucked!
Yours disgustedly, 'Arry.

When that scare took place in Whitechapel last week, the supposed
criminal was pursued by Policemen and five Detectives. Everybody
knew them! Here they come, all at onoe, jumped up from dinner
perhaps; down with the knives and forks, and on with their hats, and
off they rush all together, these five Detectives. How mysterious!
How subtle! And the fugitive escaped, after all, without any diffi-
culty!! What nonsense about an Englishman's objection to detec-
tion as a " spy system." Doesn't the Englishman enjoy the Detective
in an exciting novel, and applaud JTawkshatc in the disguise of a
navvy in the Ticket of Leave Man t Why, of course. The Execu-
tive and the Detective Departments should, be as distinct as the left
hand from the right, ready to assist each other, and under the direc-
tion of one responsible Head. As Chief of the Detective Department,
we should select Mr. Wilkie Collins, assisted by Miss Braddox
and L. B. Farjeon. This would be the nucleus of an intelligent
staff, to begin with.

Porter. "E—h, Man ! yer Bagoaoe es xa sic a Fule as yersel. Ye 're i' the Wrano Train!"
HOW TO WRITE A CHRISTMAS STORY.
(By One xclw has Don* It.)
The room was full of shadows! Visions of his past life rose
before him! He saw his hoy hood, which, as he glanced at the MS.
on his desk, gave such an excellent scope for illustration. Could he
not picture to himself the arrival of the old-fashioned mail-coach in
the Midlands; and had not this heen actually done hy one of the
artistic staff attached to the periodical for which he was working?
Was not the proof actually hefore him? Did he not see the cheery
coachman, and the red-coated guard? And beside this picture was
there not lying a weird representation of some dark arches?
"What does it mean? he murmured for the third time as he
placed the drawing well under the lamp that was standing on his
writing-table—'' what does it mean?"
He was a desperate man, and he felt that something must be done
with it. It could not be wasted! No, it could not be wasted! It
had come to him from across the sea—from an artist who had sought
relief from pressing pecuniary embarrassment in the soft air of
Spain. But it had to be introduced—it had to be written in.
"Ah!" he exclaimed at length, "I have it. This is a drawing
of the Adelphi Arches. Mary must dream that therein she meets
the slimy villain of my simple tale, Dr. Uttereadson, he of the
too portly presence and the flowing moustache. The Adelphi Arches
will be just the spot to meet him face to face and denounce him."
And the plodding author continued his weary toil, sending away slip
after slip of paper upwards. And now and again would he glance
at a pile of engravings and smile sadly as one by one he knocked
them off.
"Come!" he said, speaking to himself—it was a favourite habit,
"I am doing famously. I have worked in 'the Wreck off Boulogne
Harbour,' and 'the Grand Stand at Sandown.' For a moment a
duel to the death between two gentlemen in the costume of
Charles the Second perplexed me—I confess it—perplexed me!
But I have surmounted the difficulty by bringing it in under the
title of 'the verdict is hotly discussed after the Sal Masque,'' and
writing up to it! But I must not pause! What have we here? A
Child playing with a White Vulture and the Emperor of Germany
opening in state the Reichstag. Well, I must introduce both subjects
into my weird tale—and what is this?—two men descending in a
balloon at midnight in a forest? Hem! What shall I do? Ah, I
have it! I can write up to that block, so that it may bear the appro-
priate label. 'The Lunacy Commissioners visit the grounds of
Oobaey Haten by Moonlight unexpectedly.' Still,? I must confess
that tne subjects of the pictures handed out to me, although varied,
are certainly confusing. I wish my task were done!"
And again he returned to his pen. ink. and paper. The room grew
darker and darker, and nought was heard save the constant scratching
of the pen and the occasional footsteps of the lad who carried away
the sheets of paper. It grew darker and darker, and gloomier and
gloomier. Suddenly there was the sound of a deep grave voice.
"Pause! Write no more!"
The Author looked up angrily, and then nearly swooned with
terror; his hair stood on end, and his white lips trembled. There
was a figure in white standing before him! A figure, a gruesome
figure, with bare arms and dishevelled locks.
But the Author was a man of business, and, although every nerve
in his body was quivering with emotion, he confronted the spectre,
and gasped out, 'Write no more'! Why not?"
Then came the answer. It sounded like the knell of doom! The
Author knew it was all over, and that his occupation was gone—if
not for ever, for a long, long year!
"Why must you write no more?" said the spectral figure, expla-
natorily; "because we are full up; and because the rest of the space
in the number will be required for advertisements!"
And trying to read over what he had already written, the Author
fell into a deep, deep slumber!
They're beginning to " manage these things better in France."
Edict of Prefect of Police banishing sandwichmen and advertising
vans from principal Boulevards, has just been issued. Fancy cos-
tumes for sandwichmen prohibited! We should like to see Mural
Decorative Art taxed heavily, and to put up murderous picture-
posters made an indictable offence.

This is an English Detective. You may know him anywhere
by his Regulation Boots.

Nobody Nose.
THE DIAEY OP A NOBODY.
November 8.—My endeavours to discover who tore the sheets out
of my Diary still fruitless. Lupin has Daisy Mutlab on the brain,
so we see little of him, except that he
invariably turns up at meal times.
Cumminos dropped in.
November 9.—Lupin seems to like his
new berth—that's a comfort. Daisy Mut-
las the sole topic of conversation during
tea. Carrie almost as full of it as Lupin.
Lupin informs me, to my disgust, that he
has been persuaded to take part in the
forthcoming performance of the "Hollo-
way Comedians." He says he is to play
Bob Britches in the farce, Gone to my
Uncle's; Fbank Mutlab is going to play
Old Musty. I told Lupin pretty plainly
I was not in the least degree interested in the matter, and totally
disapproved of amateur theatricals. Gowtng came in the evening.
November 10.—Returned home to find the house in a most dis-
graceful uproar. Cabbie, who appeared very frightened, was
standing outside her bed-room, while Sarah was excited and crying.
Mrs. Birrell (the charwoman), who had evidently been 'drinking,
was shouting at the top of her voice that " she was no thief, that she
was a respectable woman, who had to work hard for her living, and
she would smack anyone's face who put lies into her mouth." Lupin,
whose back was towards me, did not hear me come in. He was
standing between the two women, and, I regret to say, in his
endeavour to act as peacemaker, he made use of rather strong
language in the presence of his mother; and I was just in time to
hear him say, "And all this fuss about the loss of a few pages from
a rotten Diary that wouldn't fetch three half pence a pound." I said,
quietly,'' Pardon me, LuprN—that is a matter of opinion; and as I am
master of this house, perhaps you will allow me to take the reins."
I ascertained that the cause of the row was, that Sarah had
accused Mrs. Birrell of tearing the pages out of my Diary to wrap
up some kitchen fat and leavings which she had taken out of the
house last week. Mrs. Bibbell had slapped Sarah's face, and said
she had taken nothing out of the place, as there was "never no
leavings to take." I ordered Sarah back to her work, and requested
Mrs. Birrell to go home. When I entered the parlour Lupin was
kicking his legs in the air, and roaring with laughter.
November 11 (Sunday).—Coming home from church Carrie and
I met Lupnr, Daisy Mutlab, and her brother. Daisy_ was intro-
duced to us, and we walked home together, Carrie walking on with
Miss Mutlab. "We asked them in for a few minutes, ancT I had a
good look at my future daughter-in-law. My heart quite sank.
She is a big young woman, and I should think at least eight years
older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking. Carrie
asked her if she could come in on Wednesday next with her brother to
meet a few friends. She replied that she would only be too pleased.
November 12. — Carrie sent out invitations to Gowing, the
Cummings', to Mr. and Mrs. James (of Sutton), and Mr. Stillbbook,
I wrote a note to Mr. Franching, of Feckham. Cabbie said we
may as well make it a nice affair, and why not ask our principal,
Mr. Pebeupp. I said, I feared we were not quite grand enough for
him. Carrie said there was "no offence in asking him." I said,
"Certainly not," and I wrote him a letter. Cabrie confessed she
was a little disappointed with Daisy Mutlab's appearance, but
thought she seemed a nice girl.
November 13.—Everybody so far has accepted for our quite grand
little party for to-morrow. Mr. Perkupp, in a nice letter, which I
shall keep, wrote that he was dining in Kensington, but if he could
get away, he would come up to HoDoway for an hour. Carrie was
busy all day, making little cakes and open jam puffs and jellies.
She said she felt quite nervous about her responsibilities to-morrow
evening. We decided to have some light things on the table, such
as sandwiches, cold chicken and ham, and some sweets, and on the
sideboard a nice piece of cold beef, for the more hungry ones to peg
into if they liked. Gowing called to know if he was to put on
"swallow-tails" to-morrow. Cabbie said he had better dress,
especially as Mr. Franching was coming, and there was a possibility
of Mr. Pebkupp also putting in an appearance. Gowing said, "Oh,
I only wanted to know; for I have not worn my dress-coat for some
time, and I must send it to have the creases pressed out." After
Gowing left Lupin came in, and in his anxiety to please_ Daisy
Mutlab, carped at and criticised the arrangements, and, in fact,
disapproved of everything, including our having asked our old friend,
Cummings, who, he said, would look in evening-dress like a green-
Cier engaged to wait, and who must not be surprised if Daisy took
for one. I fairly lost'my temper, and I said, "Lupin, allow me
to tell you Miss Daisy Mutlab is not the Queen of England. I gave
you credit for more wisdom than to allow yourself to be inveigled
into an engagement with a woman considerably older than yourself.
I advise you to think of earning your living before entangling your-
self with a wife whom you will have to support, and, in all proba-
bility, her brother also, who appeared to be nothing but a loafer."
Instead of receiving this advice in a sensible manner, Lupin jumped
up and said, "If you insult the lady I am engaged to, you insult
me. I will leave the house and never darken your doors again."
He went out of the house, slamming the hall-door. But it was all
right. He came back to supper, and we played bezique till nearly
12 o'clock.
THE TREASURY MRS. HARRIS AGAIN.
Is there, or is there not, a Public Prosecutor? Last week we
recorded how the Last of the Barons regretted the non-existence of
such an official in this country, and 3Ir. Punch brought forward the
evidence of Whitaker and the Salary List to establish the fact of
the P. P.'s existence. This week, in the Central Criminal, we find
Mr. PuBCELL saying, that the case in which he was engaged was one
that the Public Prosecutor ought to have taken up. Whereupon
Mr. Poland requested Mr. Pubceix (what a lot of P.'s in this!) "not
to attack an absent official;" and Mr. Justice Hawkins observed
(this was Justice to Poland) that in his opinion " the Public Pro-
secutor was quite right." _ -ii'» a
Now, what have we got? First, that beyond possibility of doubt,
the Public Prosecutor exists. Secondly, that he is "an absent
official." Thirdly, that he was, at the time of speaking, "quite
right." The last piece of evidence is important, and the Last of
the Barons will now only have to regret that this official was
"absent," but will rejoice that on occasion he should be "quite
right." He is probably never absent on or about quarter-day, as
Whitaker gives the salary of Solicitor and Public Prosecutor, i.e.,
two single gentlemen rolled into one, in the person of Sir Augustus
K. Stephenson, K.C.B., at £3000 per annum—and very kind of
Whitaker to give it. Only—what's done with it P
English Cookeby.—We're always hoisting the British flag, and
we've done it again lately on Cook's Islands in the South Pacific.
Great rejoicings at Cook's Tourist's Offices all over the world.
Islands now added to the list of the Cookeries on which the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE "RIGHT TO KNOW."
It is an axiom with the Press—no argument it needs to show—
That, "Other people's husi-ness the Public has a right to know."
Each blemish in a Hero's life—of yesterday or lon$ ago—
His real relations with his wife, the Public has a right to know.
New works which all the world surprise are "stolen straight from
8o-and-so,"
That " all who please it plagiarise," the Public has a right to know.
Celebrities are interviewed, and all that, under torture slow,
From their reluctant lips is screwed, the Public has a right to know.
On deeds of ghastliness or gore a lurid light the Press must throw;
Details (as has been said before) the Public has a right to know.
To publish '' clues" may serve to prime the criminal that's lying low;
But—every step in tracking crime the Public has a right to know.
State secrets to disseminate may harm a friend and help a foe;
The Cabinet may feel irate—the Public has a right to know.
When scandals come before the Court that force a hardened cheek to
glow,
The whole unsavoury report the Public has a right to know.
And still the journalistic dredge seeks new impurities below,
Of which (ah, precious privilege!) the Public has the right to know.
Yet Punch at times is fain to doubt if it were folly to forego,
Or hard to learn to do without, some news we have the right to know!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Mr. F. C. Philips has scored again with his Little Mrs. Murray,
though he has not obtained the full marks entitling him to a special
prize. The reader
who takes wpLittle
Mrs. Murray will
be loth to part
with her, ashe will
be always curious
to learn what on
earth this erratic
person is going to
do next. As a
matter of fact, she
goes to a variety of
places, butdoes no-
thing—absolutely
nothing, and nothing is done to her. She's not bad, she's not good—
she's ordinary ; and 1 suppose in this fact lies the real interest. It is,
as it were, another version of Nobody's Diary, only that in this case
the Nobody is a young widow_ who, wishing without visible means of
subsistence, to make herself independent, takes to the stage, then to
lady-companionship,' then', to Millinery, then to some sort of East-
End Anglican Sisterhood, and then to the Matronship of a Private
Lunatic Asylum; and, last scene of all, to marriage. There is no
plot as there was (and a strong one, too) in As in a Looking Glass.
The sketches seem to be from real life, and I should like to know the
originals of the Manager of the Jollity Theatre, and of the Reverend
Simon Heady, Superior of Saint Cunegonda's Sisterhood. The little
woman is an excellent companion for an hour or so,—sprightly,
interesting, and amusing.
I am choosing some Christmas Books and Cards, as, what the
lawyers call, "these presents," and am puzzled between the charm-
ing "Photographic Opals," the original and tasteful designs of
Messrs. Hildeshetmeb and Faulkner, and the artistic reproduc-
tions of well-known pictures, and the delightful booklets of that
Sublisher who rejoices in the truly Italian artistic Christian name of
Raphael, coupled with the truly English surname of Tuck. Tuck
in again at Christmas-time.
To help me in running through these Christmas Books I'm com-
gslled to engage a "Co."—the Christmas reading firm is Baron
e Book-Worms & Co.—and as far as " Co." has gone I am informed
that Miss Rosa Mulholland has written Gianetta, a girl's story for
a girl—quite an upper story. That Mr. Henty, who has written
plenty, is up to his best form in Captain Bayley's Heir—
(young Bayley, we 're not interested in the old 'un)—which is all
about California, and published by Blackie. Then "Co." says
that Routlkdge's Pied Piper, illustrated by Kate Greenaway,
is exceptionally pretty. Now welcome Kate!"—which is not
quoted from Taming of the Shrew. Mr. Hogg, the publisher,
makes a hit with a collection of old fairy tales called Children's
Evergreens. Nico dish at Christmas, ask for Hogg and Evergreens.
Books marked Warne are brand new, yet are " Warne out! My
"Co." recommends Warne's Rosebud Annual for the little ones.
Here's one by Charles F. Rideal, illustrated by Harry Pakkes.

decided!
TENDEN,
Wain of original humour.
Feastj published by Cassell & Co., Limited, is a quaint Burne-
Jonesian kind of book by Walter Crane. It comes out with the
Christmas Books, and is about as Christmassy as the Sunflowerest
sesthete could possibly desire. If I could select one picture above
another, which would take the public, it would be the poppy-heads
which are likely to be poppylar. "Co." is exhausted.
I've just seen the Christmas number of the Penny Illustrated,
price fourpence, which means that this is equal to four ordinary
numbers. The cover is the pink of perfection. ftThe central picture
in colours, of a child in bed, asking a kitten to come under the
mistletoe, might have been termed Scratch Company. The child,
whose teeth are not as white as could be wished, ought to have
been in a "Cat's-oradle." The chief story, "Diamonds' led," by
J. Latey, Junior, shows that he was quite right to lead diamonds as
Mr. W. Mackay has followed suit with a melodrama on a similar
plot in verse. Diamonds Led, is a three-volume novel essenced into
live pages; and there is also a very funny notion for a new kind of
advertisement in the story about The Australian Parrot. Several
other good things in it; but that it is among the first to appear and
comes out early, its motto mig^ht be, "Better Latey than never."
"Co." comes up again smiliflg". For a first-class piece of harmless
nonsense commend me to A Publisher's Playground, a small (not

case they must not convict unless they were convinoed of his guilt.
The facts had been carefully laid before them, and he would not say
a word to bias them either one way or the other. He entreated them
to remember that the life of a fellow creature was at stake, and to let
that recollection make them desirous to record only what was proper

SWEETS TO THE SWEET.
Dear Master Punch,
Answering to the note of the Oof
bird, I planked down my ten toes in
the Stalls, and was placed in the
Strand Theatre last week as ever
was. I found them all there, and
was knocked by most of them. You
bet they hit them! Those Sports-
men who expected to have some fun
for their shiners must have made
the welkin ring with their cries of
anguish! There were some hoary-
headed old chesnuts in the dialogue,
and as for the music, it made me
rush away in search of a loosen and
a soda divided! You brown to what
I mean? The jokes were of ancient
date, and when some mummers ap-
peared as Johnnies of the Jockey
Club, the bet was declared O.U.G.H.
It was a near touch that those
who weighed in were not buried
'neath the pavement outside the
Roman!
Yours, who has laid an even thick
'un that it won't run,
A Critic in Pink Spectacles.
P.S.—Pardon the above. I have
seen Atalanta, the new piece at the
Strand Theatre, and witness the
result'. I have not the least notion
what I mean by the above slangy cri-
ticism, but then I could not make out
what on earth Mr. Hawtrey meant
by his equally slangy burlesque!
Summary.—In the "shooting-at-
Times- Witness case," the revolver and
the prisoner were both discharged.
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
As It is.—The Emperor of Germany yesterday distributed certifi-
cates of honour to the students in the Berlin Theological Seminary,
appearing in the full uniform of a Pomeranian Grenadier. His Majesty
expressed the pleasure it would have given him if ho had been
addressing soldiers instead of mere civilian nincompoops (tolpeh),
and rattled his sabre several times in a threatening manner. This
is considered decidedly ominous in well-informed circles.
From Vienna it is announced that the Russian Government has,
in the last few days, echeloned half a million of men along the Gali-
cian frontier. The official St. Petersburg Gazette explains the
occurrence by saying that, "at this convenient season of the year,
the troops are alwavs moved about for change of air and scenery."
This explanation has caused a serious fall in securities on the
Viennese and Berlin Bourses.
The latest "Frontier Incident" is reported from Belfort. It
appears that a French peasant proprietor, while pruning a hedge,
slipped into a ditch, which forms the dividing line at that point
between Germany and France. He was at once shot through the
body and scalped by a regiment of Uhlans concealed in the neigh-
bourhood. On the same day a German balloonist made an ascent
from Strasburg, and came down in his parachute on French territory.
He has been heavily manacled, and sent to Paris for shipment to
New Caledonia. Franco-German relations have become in conse-
quence somewhat strained.
As It Might Be.—All the European States having agreed to a
partial disarmament, every kind of security has gone iip at least 100
per cent., and national rejoicings are taking place in all the European
Capitals. Herr Krupp is reported to be suffering from deep depression.
Germany having now made up her quarrel with France by
"splitting the difference "—keeping Alsace and giving back Lorraine
—French and Germans are fraternising all along the frontier. The
favourite air in the Paris Music Halls is now "Die Wucht am
Rhein" while the Emperor William has given orders for the
"Marteillaise " to be played twice a day " Unter den Linden" by
the Band of the Imperial Guards' Regiment.
In accordance with the general spirit of international magnanimity
now prevailing, the Sultan op Turkey has consented to remove
himself into Asia Minor, and leave Constantinople to be dealt with
by a Conference of the European Powers.
There being no further use for most of the soldiers now enrolled in
the various European Armies, it is expected that an international
expedition of one hundred thousand men will shortly be landed in
Africa, which will take Khartoum, smash up the Mahdists, find
Stanley, abolish the Slave Trade, and open up the Continent to
civilisation and commerce.
CRAM DE LA CRAM.
Dear Mr. Punch,
There is a great deal of truth in the position taken up by the
opponents of the Competitive Examination system. No one who has
ever mixed up his answers and cribbed from a friendly neighbour
who was answering Paper B, while he, the cribber, was confronted
with the problems of Paper A, can entertain a doubt as to the
elemental folly of settling a young man's prospects by his statements
about subjects on which he is but superficially informed. I have
suffered myself, but thanks to a pleasing exterior, a diplomatic wife
who is very well connected, a large house, and exorbitant charges, I
am the proprietor of a crammerv which is viewed, and justly, as the
very cram de la cram of the profession.
Facts, Sir, are stubborn things, and if there be one quality less
desirable than another in the young, it is surely stubbornness; and
how a constant familiarity with stubborn things can fail to produce
depharable results on plastic minds, I contest lat I am quite unable
to understand. My plan is to temper facts with fancy. Even Greek
accidence lends itself to this humane and philosophical plan. Thus.
Among a number of the deadliest kind of Greek and Latin adjectives
I insert Panjandrum to be declined. The boy with imagination—
the future journalist or financier—at once drops to it, thus:—
Pas-jas-der: pasa-jasa-dra: pan-jan-drum, whereby we get Greek
and Latin at one fell swoop, and invest Mongolian metaphysics with
a halo of accidence. Again, in our last history paper, I lightened the
horrors of the feudal system and the genealogies of our early Sovereigns
by asking, Why was the Curfew Law like a Calendar? No less
than seven boys supplied the right answer: "Because it was a
Norman Ac'." This, Sir, speaks for itself. Yours faithfully,
Markham Primmer.
P.S.—I enclose a Prospectus. A reduction if you take a quantity.
"I advise you, my dear, to take up Music as a study," said
Mrs. Ram to her Niece, "and I am told that one of the best books
on the subject is Ranjce's Hintory of t/ie Pops."

Houte of Commons, Monday, Nov. 19.—Spectacle of Oeobge
Curzon, fresh home from Central Asia, accusing Gladstone of
"immorality," calculated to create emotion. But it passed off very
quietly. Gladstone not there to hear indictment. Harcourt, John
Morley, and one or two others among the faithful, on Front Bench;
hut, as Old Morality says, "It's surprising with what equanimity
we can hear others accused of iaiquity.
The flatness of this particular incident typical of night's pro-
ceedings. Seemed in advance that it would be quite otherwise.
Government brought in new Land Purchase Bill. Gladstone long
ago gave notice that, if they did, he'd make it hot for 'em. To-
night came down to move crushing Amendment. Urgent Whips
out; House filled; excitement growing. Just before business
reached, telegram passed along Front Opposition Bench evidently
created profound sensation. Gladstone read it; hurriedly consulted
Harcourt and Charles Russell. Plainly a legal point. Learned
all about it afterwards. Telegram from Tim Healy at Dublin.
Been engaged in Dublin Exchequer Division, before Lord Chief
Baron, Baron Dowse, and Chief Justice Andrews. Applied for
writ of Habeas Corpus in case of Jeremiah Sheehan, M.P., at
present confined in Tralee Gaol. Crime alleged against Hon. Member
was that he had shouted, " Boo for Balfour !" _ Court decided that
in such circumstances Sheehan very properly in gaol, and refused
to release him.
"What do you think of it?" said G. 0. M., nervously reading
over telegram for fifth time.
"Well." said Harcourt, stroking the place where his beard ought
to grow, the bearing of the observation lies in the application or it.
In the eyes of the law geographical boundaries do not exist. What
is one man's meat is not necessarily another man's poison. If you
boo for Balfour, and go to prison in Ireland, can you boo for
Balfour at Westminster, and go scot free? The Court thinks not.

Sir Robert.
Remove the prisoner—I mean—I beg your pardon; but you'd better
be careful."
Habcourt, so convincing, rather frightened G. 0. M. "Took all
the starch out of his collar," as Robert Jardine said, resting his chin
firmly on the buttress of his own. Quite mild
in his references to Chief Secretary; example
infectious ; no booing for Balfour on any Bench;
consequently a distinctly dull night.
Business done.—Land Purchase Bill brought in.
Tuesday.—In Upper House, Lord High
rises to explain. Brings down lengthy epistle,
which he reads very badly. Seems that he has
appointed only two blood relations to fat places.
One of them, he mentions (as if the result was
unusual and unexpected), had proved himself
fully qualified for the office. The second, already
possessed of a benefice, he had transferred to
another benefice, slightly better in point of
emolument, and with the advantage of more
genial climate.
"And how does the climate suit him?" asked
Clanricarde, gracefully bending his benevolent
head. Lord High took no notice; went
on reading; gave many interesting par-
ticulars about administration of Chancery
Division, Clerks in Central Offices, and
elsewhere. Noble Lords strained their
attention to hear when he was coming to
the point dealing with specific charges
leviett against himself in other House.
But had so much to say about reductions
of redundant Clerks and other matters,
couldn't find time to deal with these.
Triumphantly wound up with declaration
that though salaries amounted to pretty tidy sum, they did not come
out of pocket of tax-payer, but out of purse of unfortunate suitors.
Lortt High sat down, astonished at his own moderation. The
Markiss listenedt but said never a word. Granville, feeling
necessity of breaking awkward silence on Front Bench, observed that
as no notice of intention to deal with the subject had been given, it
was not necessary for him to say anything.
"Hewas awfully severe on you," I said to Grandolpii. "Positively
'declined to repeat the gross language used.'"
"That's very well; but he might have answered the specific
charge I brought against him."
The Commons flogging away at already dead horse of Land Pur-
chase Bill. Members brought up to vote, wouldn't
remain to listen. Edwakd Obey, chip of old block,
made capital speech at outset, and later on, at
eve of Division, when Morley followed Harting-
ton, benches filled up; cheers and counter-
cheers rung through the Chamber. But no
reality in fight; everyone grateful when it was
over.
"Might arrange these matters much more
cleverly," said Herbert Gardner, dropping in
after dinner. "Let us have the Division first,
and the Debate after. Great convenience to
fellows with importantengagements.
Wouldn't at aU interfere with
delights of those who hanker after
speech-making."
Business Done. — Gladstone's

negatived by 330 against 246.

An Irish Landlord. ance „f qld MolUL1TY( t fancy we

Moabites as he listened to the address of Balaam upon a memorable
occasion/*1- l
Old Morality certainly in sore plight. Second Reading of Land
Purchase Bill moved; Parnell delivered weighty speech against it;
Grandolph followed, and as he rose expression of pleased content dis-.
persed itself over Ministerial ranks. Only on Saturday Grandolph had
spoken most graciously of the Government. Speech then anxiously
looked for, as situation critical, and opportunity for smiting his old
friends tempting. But Grandolto had come nobly out of the fire.
Having so recently assumed attitude of friendliness, would now
surely go a step further, pulverise Parnell, and demolish Glad-


stone. Old Morality, sitting just under his young friend, folded
his arms, leaned back his head in listening attitude, prepared to
enjoy himself.
Grandolpii couldn't resist this final temptation. Had certainly
come down determined to vote for the Bill; was probably also pre-
pared to support it. But looking round on
expectant lines of Ministerialists, on the
Opposition already on guard against his
onslaught, and, above all, on the broad,
placid, pleased face below him, good resolu-
tions melted. Instead of supporting Bill,
and confounding Opposition, he riddled the
measure with Dolts of irony and scorn,
reserving his most highly poisoned shaft
to accompany declaration that still he would
vote for Second Reading.
"It's such a little Bill," he pleaded;
"cannot do much harm; and so very bad,
that no Government, not even this one, dare
venture to introduce another anything like it."
"Toby" said Old Mobality, in a husky
voice, as I helped Goschen to lead him out
into the fresh air, "an you love me, get
Gbandolph never to support us any more.
"Never mind," said Jokem, "it's Gran-
dolph's turn now. But ours will come.
He'll find his speech to-night an uncom-
monly difficult one to answer on some future
day.''
This was the tragedy; roaring farce to
foUow. Just before fall of curtain, Motion
made from Treasury Bench to withdraw BiU
establishing Minister of Agriculture. Chap-
Shocked at Grandolph. lin solemnly rose from corner seat below
Gangway, looking unutterably solemn. Rapturous cheers from
malicious Opposition. Chaplin, it was understood, was to be first
Minister under the Act. Grandolph—that " imp of Parliamentary
mischief," as Dalrymtle calls him—learning this, put down Motion
to move rejection of Bill. This made it
impossible to carry it this Session. Old
Morality privately promised to say
something soothing to Chaplin if he
gave him opening. Chaplin now up,
with his part in arranged conversation
ready. Old Morality waiting his cue.
But the House would do nothing but
laugh and ironically cheer. What
should have been dignified scene becomes
screaming farce.
Business done.—Land Purchase Bill
read Second Time.
Friday Night. — Sexton incidentaUy
mentions that Melancholy and Coercion
Bill have just marked seven Irish Mem-
bers as their own. Wants to know
whether blow may not be averted till
after Prorogation, so that we may have
the pleasure and advantage of their

always anxious to oblige, undertakes to
see what can be done. Members, has-
tening to Reading-room, eagerly scan
names of the seven. Several disap_-
pointments, hut at least Tanner is
among them.
""ies, that's all very well," said
Saxtnderson. "But you see how they
bungle it in Balfour s absence. Why
couldn't they wait till the beginning of

MRS. KEELEY INTERVIEWED.
The Babies were quite determined that the good fairy, Mrs.
Keeley, and the lazy Laureate, Mr. Ashby-Sterry, should not
have it all their own way, and when little
folk become determined at the Hospital for
Siok Children, in Great Ormond Street, their
determination is something wonderful! The
boys said they had no pretension to be poets,
but, at any rate, they felt equal to writing an
Address ; the girls declared they never expected
to be great Actresses, but they were quite'sure
on the present occasion, they knew how to act.
They had heard how the good fairy, Mrs.
Keeley, had recited for them at the recent
Festival—they had been told how eloquently
she had pleaded for them, and how she had
drawn tears from the eyes of her audience, and,
what was more, golden sovereigns from their
pockets. One or two of them had been charmed with the clear tones
of her voice, and had listened to the marvellous alternation of humour
and pathos in her speech, and had been almost frightened by
the applause with whioh the good fairy was greeted. Several
had seen her going round the wards, chatting pleasantly with
the Nurses, and having a kindly word for each of the little
invalids. They had all of them hoped Mrs. Keeley would get
the first prize at the Doll Show, for they, all of them, were quite
sure she deserved it. She had done so mnch for their benefit, that
they were anxious to do something for hers. And so they askea the
kind Lady-Superintendent, Miss K. Phillipa Hicks, who was
always so bright and merry—always so busy, but never so busy as
to be unable to bestow a kind word on her little charges, and to give
a willing ear to their smallest troubles. And she soon arranged the
whole thing for them. She told them the good fairy would shortly
attain the age of eighty-four, which is a mere trifle for a fairy, and
on her birthday they should have the opportunity of showing her
how she occupied so large a space in their grateful little hearts.
The day came, they set off on their pilgrimage to Brompton. Not
all of them. Oh, dear no! Supposing one hundred and forty-four
had started? Why, the Police would have interfered, and the Home
Secretary would have been sore troubled, thinking there was a
demonstration of Lilliputian Socialists. Besides many were too ill, some
were sadly orippled, and others too young. So a Committee of Seven
were selected, and these tiny mites, in charge of a kind Nurse, set
forth on the appointed day, in a beautiful carriage, drawn by real
horses, driven by a live coachman. In the middle of the carriage
was a lovely and gigantic bouquet, which everyone tried to hold, and
whioh once or twice fell down and nearly smothered two or three of
the deputation. But 0 it was a fine time! The Council of Seven
say they never will forget it as long as they live. Suddenly, as if
by magic, the carriage stopped, and thev were in the presence of the
good fairy in her elegant fairy bower. The deputation could not find
words to express its pleasure. So it was fortunate they had an
address already written, which was presented along with the
bouquet. The address was a model of terseness which it would be
well if provincial Mayors and others would endeavour to imitate.
It ran thus:—"To Mrs. Keeley. With every good wish on her
Birthday—from her grateful little friends in the 'Hospital for Sick
Children,' Great Ormond Street." Then followed the signatures,
touching in their childish'caligraphy, and the trembling innocence
of tiny fingers. Cheered by the sight of their good kind fairy, made
happy with the pleasant words which fell from her lips, delighted
with the sight of her magnificent Persian cat, with an Arabian Nights
tail, who purred the warmest of welcomes, the baby-interviewers
retired. And when the lights burned low that night in Great
Ormond Street, when there was nothing to be heard but the faint
wail of some tiny sufferer, the almost noiseless footfall and the
sweet-toned whisper of some gentle watchful Nurse, one cannot help
wondering what sunny dreams, what pleasant fancies, what a sense
of supreme repose and restful gratitude to the good fairy haunted
the slumbers of the Council of Seven!
"MADGY."
{A prupos of quite a new and original lever Ju ridcau, recently performed
at Edinburgh.)
Madgy Kendal quite forgot her ordinary prudence
In coming out so strong before the Edinboro' Students;
And afterwards she told the world the cause of her oration;
'Twas not, as some might think of Madge, all her imadgynation.
But 'twas as she in the D. T. explained the simple case,
"Some one had thrown a paper ball, and hurt the Douhle Bass."
Whoever did this thing was wrong, for, were he boy or l
'Tis evident he'd made a hit before the play began.
Whether he hitfthe instrument or player in the face,
The silence of the thrower made his conduct doubly base.
She should not publicly have shown—it argues want of i

THE REAL CRIEVANCE OFFICE.
{Before Lord Commissioner Punch.)
An Efficient Volunteer introduced.
Commissioner. Well, Sir, what
oan I do for you?
Efficient Volunteer (saluting).
Assist me to get a satisfactory sub-
stitute for Wimbledon.
Com. Surely you are in good hands.
I read in the papers this week there
is to be a meeting of representatives
of the National Rifle Association to
consider what is best to be done.
m
held with the same object
Com. Do you suggest that these
meetings are useless?
Eff. Vol. Certainly, as two parties
are pulling one against the other.
Com. How cornea it there should
be such an unfortunate situation?
Eff. Vol. I suppose, my Lord,
because one party thinks more of
soldiering than five-o'clock tea and
picnics.
Com. Would you suggest that
Wimbledon was used for either
purpose?
Eff. Vol. I would. The Cottage
was the rendezvous of the crime de
la crime of Society—very good people
in their way, but not bkely to pro-
duce a Queen's.Medallist.

THINGS ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE LEFT UNSAID.
Hiss Margaret. "Prat sit down. I'm so sorry Mamma and my Sisters are out!"
Shy Curate (who has called on Parish business). "Ob, PRAiw don't mention it. Oxb of the
Family is quite enough!
Com. And you think consideration for these distinguished persons keeps the question of a new
site an open one P
Eff. Vol. I do. The people who used to come to Wimbledon to lounge on the lawn and eat
ices are not likely to be satisfied if the new Shooting-ground is situated beyond striking distance
of town. No doubt some of them might come to us on the tops of coaches, but only at considerable
inconvenience.
Com. Then what would you suggest?
Eff. Vol. That the Volunteers, and the Volunteers only, should be considered, and Lady De
Verb and Lord Manikin should be told that their place is preferable to their company. What we
want is a place where business, and business only, must have a call upon our attention.
Com. How would Aldershot do?
Eff. Vol. Admirably; and here (producing a list) is a paper containing a number of equally
excellent sites. What we want is to have the matter settled at once, without further shillyshallying.
Com. I will see that your reasonable request meets with immediate compliance.
[The Witness thanked his Lordship, and retired.
A CLEAR STAGE AND NO FAVOUR.
Last Friday Mr. Bandmann appeared before Mr. Justioe Stirling in the Chancery Division, and
undertook to continue his previous undertaking not to perform Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in the
United Kingdom. If this example is followed, of what varied enjoyments the theatre-going public
might be deprived, as for example,—
Mr. Irving appeared before the Last of the Barons, and undertook not to make a speech about
the Drama in any part of the United Kingdom.
Mrs. Kendal undertook not to come before the Curtain'and address the audience in any part of
Great Britain and Ireland.
Mr. Toole appeared before the Lord Chief Justice, (who had never heard of the eminent Comedian,
and asked who he was), and undertook not to tell Joseph Hatton any more stories, and never
again to play in Ici on Parle Francois.
Mr. W. F. Hawtrby promised never to appear again as a King in a classical burlesque.
Mr. Terriss undertook not to perform tne character of a genuine British Sailor, in London or
the Provinces, after the termination of his present engagement.
Mr. Forbes Robertson submitted to a perpetual injunction preventing him from ever playing in
blank verse.
Mr. Charles Collette undertook not to perform in Comic Opera within the United Kingdom.
Miss Grace Hawthorne has undertaken to cease from appearing in Matinees within the juris-
diction of the Supreme Court.
Mr. Wilson Barrett appeared before everybody, and took a solemn pledge not to play again
in any part of the United Kingdom.
Old Style Modernised.—The Exchange Club, as a name, sounds well. Motto over the umbrella
stand, "Exchange—no Robbery!" Members will be bound to exchange salutations and compli-
ments every day. If the grill is to be a feature, the name " Exchange Club" is apparently only a
form of the old " Chop-House."

[December 8, 1888.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LIFE-BOAT STORY.—In Three Acts.
A dozen of hearts! and a dozen of hands! and the courage of death!—'tis a Yorkshire boast;
It was all they asked,'one November noon, when a hurricane blew on the Whitby coast!
For a cry came over the wailing sands, and spread to the village, and
swept through the street—
There '11 be widows to-morrow and fatherless bairns, for exposed to the
storm is the fishermen's fleet!
There was not a minute to dream or to think: it was "Who's for the
Life-boat?" and "Who's for the shore?"
Just a kissing of lips of the lasses they loved—just a sigh,
and a cheer, and a grasp of the oar—
For the men out at sea were exposed to the storm; but they
were not forgotten by "pals " on the land.
Whilst there's life there is hope—whilst there's strength
there's a rope—the heart of a friend and the grasp
of a hand.
Just picture the scene, 0 my brothers in town, with your
petty annoyance and impotent strife;
In the midst of our city it's Worship of Self! on the
fishermen's coast it is Rescue! and Life!
Who's for the Life-boat? Strain your eyes, and deaden
your ears from the shrieking wind;
The Answer's there! on the crested waves, in the hearts of
the women they've left behind;
See! the cobbles are riding in dire distress! Will they
reach the fleet? You may lay your life
There isn't a Yorkshire lad at the oar, who will bring dis-
credit to mother or wife;
For nobody knows who's at sea or on shore—just a wild
supplication that nobody dies,
When a blinding sleet sweeps the sea and the sand, and darkens the scene from the wondering eyes.
Then a silence falls on the women who wait, and a cry rings out as they bend the knee—
For the}' drag two bodies half-drowned to land,—and the rest ?—they are left in the raging sea!
Lost! when the moment of rescue came, lost! within sound of their loved and land.
So the night closed black on the Yorkshire coast, and a wail went over the lonely sand!
But the morning breaks, and the storm is past; and over the village, and into the street
The sun is shedding its wintry rays, on the scene where they fought for the fishermen's fleet;
And the sea is calm, and the sand is still, where they manned the boat and they went to death.
What's that ?—out there in the Steamer s wake! Here, give us your glass! Then they held their
breath,
And a beam of light shot out of the sky, and a cheer roared out of the Yorkshire throats
As they saw their Life-boat making Home with the rescued crews from the fishermen's boats!
"Never say die!" is the motto of men who fight to conquer and mean to win;
But it's well worth living to earn the tears that wept them out and that cheered them in!
So the tale is told! But there's something more, that can never be done by praise or pen,—
We must think of the sea when the tempests roar; and give of our gold to the Life-boat Men!
*»* The National Life-Boat Institution is to be found in John Street, Adelphi.

WALL-PAPER MONEY.
Not a bad idea, that of taxing
certain kinds of mural posters, which
was lately started in the House of
Commons. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer was advised to turn bis
attention to pictorial mural atrocities
—not being pictures by Murtllo—
—and so find a possible substitute
for the Weal and 'Am Tax (since
deceased). The name "Posters," it
was observed, naturally suggested
the idea of a Stamp being attached
to them. George Jokim didn't see
the exact force of the suggestion at
first; required posting up in the
details before approving; but ad-
mitted there might be something
in it.
Here is a sort of Poster (not Postal)
Tariff, which ought to find a place in
any new edition of the old Stamp
Act:—
For any Pictorial Advertisement
of extra large size—a sort of four-
poster — exhibited on any wall,
hoarding, scaffolding, or other public
place . . . .£500
Additional stamp required, if the
design and colouring fail to meet with
the enthusiastic approbation of the
Lord Chamberlain, Professor Rcs-
kin, and the President of the Royal
Academy . . . £10 0 0
For every Advertisement which,
after careful examination by_ a
Committee composed of leading
"realistic" Novelists and Play-
wrights, with the assistance of a
picked body of nervous invalids, is
pronounced to be " distinctly blood-
curdling." . . . 20 0 0
N.B.—Solitary confinement in a
cell, the walls of whioh are papered
with the posters, may, in the discre-
tion of the Magistrate or Judge,
be substituted for a pecuniary
penalty.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
_ For size, show, type, interesting matter, and admirable illustra-
tions, I haven't seen a better book this booky season than Mac-
mlllan's Coaching Days and Coaching
Ways, charmingly illustrated by Herbert
Railton and Hugh Thomson. The letter-
press by Outram Tristram is not up to the
excellence of the pictures. Nothing racy,
nothing Shandy-aa about this Tristram.
Pretty Christmas picture-card to send to a
bachelor is that of the " Prize Babies." It
can be purchased at Ackerman's. But of
all the piotures that take my fancy as appro-
priate to the coming Christmas time is
Raphael Tuck's wonderful reproduction
of Raphael's (without the Tuck) "The
MadonnalSixtina " in a frame closely copied from the one in which
is the original at Dresden. An instance of the wonderful perfection
attained by the chromo-lithographic process in reproducing a
Master's work may be seen in the large chromo-lithograph of Sir
John Millais' Bubbles, originally brought out by the Illustrated
London News, and purchased as a decorative advertisement by the
indefatigable Messrs. Pears—" sure such a Pears was never seen!"
—which is now on view in the window of The Soaperies, New Oxford
Street. This work of Young Chromo might deceive even Sir John
himself. Now back to books again. I tried hard to fall in love
with Lady Lindsay's Caroline, but couldn't manage it. I had to
get out my skipping-rope, and then I went on by "leaps and bounds"
to the finish. Perhaps if I were all alone on a wet day in a Scotch
Inn, with only an out-of-date Guide-book, an ancient Bradshaw,
and last week's local paper, I might find Caroline companionable.
My faithful " Co." utters a protest against A Croten of Shame,
which, he says, is not very pleasant reading. Written by the
daughter of Captain Marryat, it lacks the breezy wholesomenes
of the works of the author of Midshipman Easy. The scene is laid
in the tropics ,or thereabouts, and the sickly atmosphere of feeble
vice is rather overpowering. He has also read a very clever pam-
phlet called the Dawn of the Nineteenth Century, which conjures
up a vision of the British Empire on the 1st of January, 1901,
that must satisfy every one. In this glorious prospect the great
Colonial question is solved, and Ireland, without the assistance of a
House of Commons sitting in Dublin, is tranquil. "Co." insists
upon expressing his high appreciation of the Happy Thoughts Birth-
day Book, compiled by a young lady whose surname is very familiar
to him. "Co." has found the quotations most apposite to the
anniversaries of his friends and relations. He says that the lines
selected for ladies' birthdays are (as they should be) invariably com-
plimentary, so that he has had the satisfaction of soliciting the
autographs of two Maiden Aunts (from whom he has expectations),
without running the risk of forfeiting their favour. He adds that
it is quite the book for a Christmas present—a present, he
humorously continues, which will also record the past.

priate the proximity of the latter to the Composer, as if Sir Arthur
is ever hard up for a few notes, Sir Henry can give him one of his
delightful "octaves^ B. de B.-W.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TWO OF "THE WORLD'S CREATEST WOMEN."
(jVo< hitherto ineludfil in any Lift.)
OUR SPECIAL MUSICAL CRITIC (P).
The treat event of the week has, of course, heen the production
of Dr. Steeling's much talked of Cantata, " The Old Home Farm,"
at the Northborough Festival. It was a happy idea on the part of
Dr. Steeling to secure the combined choirs of Northumberland and
Cumberland, but con-
sidering that the gifted
Doctor has always
conducted Northum-
berland, it was rather
surprising that Cum-
berland led. The
general arrangements
were not altogether
satisfactory. In the
first place, the New
Town Hall, like most
public buildings, has
been erected with a
total disregard to
acoustic properties; the
combined chorus was
indistinct; the town
band entirely drowned
the soli; and I was not
supplied with a programme, nor could one be got for love or money.
I am, therefore, somewhat hampered in giving my analysis of
the work, especially as I; am unacquainted with the poem of
"The Old Home Farm:" in fact, I never heard of it. Fortu-
nately, I was seated next to a kind old gentleman who was well
up in the subject, and said he had heard all the music before. The
short overture, or rather prelude, to the
Cantata was very effective. Avoiding mf
the conventional crash "tutti," or the
double piano legato sti'
8teeling opens with the
second horns thus:—
At intervals this is repeated very effectively. We are then intro
duced to the leading motiro:—
Vivace.

This is repeated crescendo until a sudden burst into the dominant
with slight variation of the theme:—
Prestissimo.

There was a slight reminiscence of Czerny's celebrated Op. 101, but
the orchestral treatment was quite different. The opening chorus
which my next-door neighbour informed me was entitled, "Hail,
Melancholy Chanticleer, was simply remarkable for the occasional
Oboe obhligato:—

But the charms of the farmyard were more vividly before us in the
following passage:—
Violini Priko.

three small animals that had intruded ^themselves, without invita-
tion, upon the premises. The fact that the animals were totally
deprived of vision rendered the situation more poetic, and accordingly
more dramatic. In these soli and chorus the Doctor has surpassed
himself. It thus opens quietly on the strings:—
A duet, between Elsie, the milk-girl, and Squire Dunrobin, in
which, as far as I could tell, he was questioning her as to where she
was proceeding, and the amount of ner fortune before offering her
marriage, was one of the most original compositions in the work, and
Dr. Steeling is;much to be complimented. The great tmtr dt
force, however, was the grand chase by the farmer's dame after

And when all were played together, with the full strength of the
orchestra, the audience rose en masse, and, after expressing their
opinion, sat down again. The finale was also effective. There
were to be (so I understood) festivities by moonlight. The theme,
suggesting !the rising of the 'moon, was quite characteristic of the
gilted compos3r|:—
(The moon rises.) Grave.

In fact, the moon rose even higher, and nothing more suggestive
of the rise of the moon .nas been heard since the song of The Bed-
lamite (with counter subject on the volovong and shoe-horn) in
Dr. Straws's Water Cantata, first performed at the Hanwell Festi-
val. I thought the grand festival dance at the end slightly
suggested an old tune—but I may be wrong; however the con-
cluding bar were certainly original:—

Tax Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours.—In these

'Doesn't your Father qo this way? How does he get across?"—"Gener'y Joomps it!"
A CITY IDYL.
"There's a corner in pork, and a starling
Is building her nest in the corner;
And it's oh, (it is always oh) my darling.
There is hope in the heart of your City Jack
Horner,
Who sits in the corner to pull out a plum
Then hey, for the bonny bright day that will

"Money was hard and your father was hard—

And we were depress'd as cott'ee or lard
But firm as copper, my darling.
"And your mother was brisk as inquiries for

In my mooning hours of leisure,
"For tin is as quiet as eventide,
And ribs like the sun declining;

And love looks up like mining.
"And it's oh, my love, my love,

While the still morn went out in shirtings

With eager thought warbling his Mincing

He thought without alarm of settling day,
Nor jumped with panic fear when prices fell
Crashing, but every eve he took his way
To Tooting, all his tale of love to tell
While the stars rose, and wild swans left their

Waved their Grand Trunks aloft, and all

stage-management, and how unmercifully he
would have ridiculed the familiar melodra-
matic characters, with their old-fashioned
melodramatic staginess of action and dialogue.
"I would be alone!" exclaims the broken-
hearted old nobleman. "Let me pass!"
exclaims the heroine, addressing the villain,
who is not opposing her progress, and, if he
were, she has the door open immediately
behind her by which she has just entered.
The villain mutters curses as he gloomily
seats himself ;at a table. There is the good
old family solicitor, the lost heir turning up
again, the mortgage to be foreclosed by the
villain, who, of course, is ready to sell every-
body up, if the persecuted heroine will not
be his bride. There are a girl and boy, whose
fun would be in keeping with the topsy-turvy
eccentricities of a Savoy comic opera, but
who are absurdly unnatural in the real life
which the comedy is supposed to represent.
Miss Neilson is young and pretty. As yet
she cannot act, and the sooner she unlearns
what she has evidently been taught to con-
sider acting the better for her future histrionic
career. Mr. Barrlngtox is Mr. Barrinqton
with a palpably sham scalp. Poor Pooh-
Bah-rington! how he must regret having
quitted the gay Savoyards! At the finish of
the play Miss Neilson has to murmur, " Let
us pray," or only the word "pray," appa-
rently addressed to the audience, who, not
having come to laugh, were unwilling to
remain to pray, especially as at that moment
the curtain was descending, and the piece
was past praying for.
A Most Happy Thought.
An admirable suggestion has been offered
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
namely, the proposal of "substituting for
the Wheel-Tax a stamp duty on bills, posters,
placards, and other mural advertisements."
Avery high amount of duty might be charged
on those eyesores and nuisances without
abating them, but in order to render it an
alternative for the Wheel-Tax, the stamp
must not be so heavy as to stamp them out.

HOW TO SCORE AT FOOTBALL.
Considering the importation of sheer ruffianism into the Football Field of late, it is quite
clear that the method of scoring the points in that game should be modified to meet this new
state of things. "Goals" and Tries," indeed! Why count such merely adventitious trifles P
It is high time to recognise the fact that the aim of the players is (apart from the all-important
question of gate-money), not so much to win the game as to pound and pummel, mutilate and
maim, and, if necessary, kill each other. Let, therefore, the rules be adjusted to the faots.
Then we shall be candidly informed, that in a match between—say, the Mudford Mutilators
and the Thumpington Thugs, the former team, (or, what is the same thing, gang of roughs)
won the game by two deaths, three broken collar-bones, and four injured spines, as against one
death, seven smashed ribs, and fourteen minor maimings scored by the latter. Tnis literal
and honest way of scoring the game will frankly enlighten the public as to its real nature, and
doubtless induce all who are not trained brutes and natural bullies to keep out of that
scene of ignoble rowdyism known as the Football Field.

And 1 care not for the Rose;
But when the North winds whistle,
Or when June noonday glows.
Reds, blues, and pinks go friendless,
No gaudy tints are seen;
But I love with love that's endless
The Wearing of the Green!
0 sea-green silk; 0 sea-weed stuff!
0 verdant tintings all!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

House of Common*, Monday Night, November 26.—" Toby, M.P.,
Sir," said Jeremiah Sullivan, of the Irish Constabulary; "in my
time I've made a good many arrests, hut never hefore did I arrest
the attention of the House of Commons; and bedad! if I can help it,
I won't do it again."
A decent-looking man, Jeremiah; a fine specimen of Irish
Constabulary, hut just now in rather limp condition.
"Jeremiah," I said, "these Lamentations are natural enough on
your part. You've got into a mess; hut oheer up; Balfour will
never desert you. In the meantime let this he a lesson to you.
Beware of females: run not after them. She is bad, but Sheeht
you find is a syllable worse."
Jeremiah a little puzzled with this simple impressive harangue;
upset altogether with proceedings of evening. Told me all about it.
Had summons handed to him to serve upon Member for South Galway.
"Where '111 find him f" said Sullivan. "House of Commons only
known address in London," says Superintendent. So Jeremiah took
train for London, and 'bus to Westminster. Found way into Octagon
Hall; admired statues of Lord John Russell, and very big man
with colossal legs and stupendous marble coat-flaps labelled,
"Iddesleigh"; found two rows of people waiting at end of
corridor leading to Commons.
"Is this the House of Commons?" says Jeremiah, vainly looking
for door-plate.
"It is, said a Polite Policeman.
"Well, I've called upon Mr. Sheeht," say Jeremiah. "Is
there a knocker to the House-door, or d'ye ring a bell?"
"No," says the Policeman. "You send in your cyard."
Jeremiah produced "cyard" with a flourish; handed it to
Policeman between tips of thumb and finger, as he had seen the
gentry do on the stage.
"Maybe," says Jeremiah to himself, "if the master's not at
home, itey '11 ask me into the kitchen, and give me a drop of some-
thing."

Waited quarter of an hour; then Sheehy discovered sauntering
down corridor.
"AVho wants Mr. Sheehy?" Folite Policeman bawled.
"Troth an' I do," said JERE-
MIAH.
"Then step inside," said the
P.P.
Jebemiaiiadvanced. Sheehy,
thinking it was a constituent,
warmly shook hands with him.
.Tehemiaii much touched at this
friendliness;
Sheehy evi-
dently going to
make things
pleasant; so
Jeremiah
whispered in
his ear,—
"I've got a
little summons
for you, Sorr.
Would you step
outside, and ac-
cept service?"

roared Sheehy,
and bolted into
House.
"And wid
that," said Je-
remiah, mop-
Sending in his Cyard. Forehead, """I
heard nothing more till I was taken before a lot o' gintlemen in
a small room with nothing to drink and accused of undermining
the British Constitution. It was a sore day when I left Limerick,
and when I get back, begorrah, I '11 go no more a visiting the gentry."
Business done.—Land Purchase Bill in Committee. Very dull.
Sheehy suddenly bolts in; breathlessly declares he has had sum-
mons served on him in precincts of the House; uproar; confusion;
Select Committee appointed to consider affair; Sitting suspended till
Ten o'Clock; then Committee on Land Purchase Bill resumed. Con-
tinued at it till early morning, with pretty appearance of nothing
particular having happened in meanwhile.
Tuesday.—Donald Currie wants to know what's this about
Stuart-Rendell and the G. 0. M.? S. R. has placed his house at
his disposal during stay in London; now making holiday arrange-
ments for him in the winter; keeping open house at Naples with a
back garden and property trees to cut down before breakfast.
"A gross infringement of
my patent," says CURRIE. "I
invented that at least four
years ago. Who took him out
touring round the coast in the
GrantuUy Castle? Who gave
him a cheap trip all round
the Island P Who fetched his
medicine, and who warmed his
gruel P Who smoothed his pil-
low and looked after him gene-

"Why you did," I said,
entering warmly into his en-
thusiasm. "And when he got
well he made you a Baronet.
Now you've joined the other
gentlemen of England, and try
to thwart his policy."
"Just so; but "that sort of
thing ought to be protected by
law, like any other invention.
I don't mind being imitated.
Have often heard Old Mo-
rality say that the sincerest
imitation is flattery. But let
due acknowledgment be made.
Let Stuart Rendell unto
Currie the things that are
Donald's." And the old
gentleman, thrusting his hands
into trousers' pockets, angrily He strode away ln ■■«*•
strode off. Glad he went away just then. So angry that his conver-
sation was getting a little mixed, and he was beginning to look at
me as if I had been infringing his patent.


Letter-writer to the Timet.
"Let me at hini!"
Quiet night in House; much disappointment among Irish Members
who know summonses are out against them. Found them wandering
about the Corridor where valiant Sheehy met Jeremiah Sullivan;
perambulating outer lobby; knocking up against any man who looks
like member of Royal Irish Constabulary; draw a blank. Police
wary after last night's scene. Positively decline to serve sum-
monses, and Sheehy left in sole possession of pre-eminence.
Business dune.—Land Purohase Bill in Committee.
Thursday.—Howorth wants to know how about the Aged P.—not
Wemmick's father, who lived in a little wooden cottage at Walworth
surrounded by a moat, the object of
tenderest solicitude on the part of his
son. It was Aged Prelates Howorth
was anxious about. Seems there
are two in England and Wales over
seventy-seven, and three whose years
have reached foursoore. Howorth
thinks it's time they should retire. If
not, wiU Old Morality bring in a
Bill rendering retirement compulsory?
Before he could answer, Johnston, of
Ballykilbeg, on his feet, his aggressive
beard waving like blood-red nag.
"All very well," he shouted, "to
talk about the Aged P., but what
about the Aged Or. '< If some Bishops
are seventy-seven and others eighty,
how old is Gladstone P"
Johnston has 'em there; sits down
triumphantly. Old Morality declines
to do little sum. "Ha! ha!" says
Johnston, truculently waving his
blood-red beard.
As for Aged P.'s, Old Morality
makes interesting statement that,
"the more aged they get, the more
active are they in tne discharge of
their duties and the fuller their pos-
session of their mental faculties."
House laughs riotously. But this
nothing to its uproarious delight over
Old Morality's summary of the Plan
of Campaign at Suakim. British
troops ordered to Suakim; storm of anxious questions from all parts
of House as to what they are to do there, what will follow on new
expedition,[and who is to pay the cost?
I wish," said Old Morality, pulling out his stock of copy-book
headings, "to be perfectly frank and candid with the House. A few
battalions of troops are being moved from Cairo to Suakim, and they
will be moved back again from Suakim to Cairo."
House roared with laughter. Abraham (Glamorganshire, not
Arabia), inflating his bosom, softly sings:—
"The gallant Duke of York! lie had ten thousand men,
He marched them up to top of hill, and marched them down again."
Old Morality began to feel uncomfortable. Surely hadn't made
another joke like last week, when he dropped into declaration of
Home Rule principles P Hurriedly turned over copy-book headings.
No; there it was all right. Firmly repeated. Troops are being
moved from Cairo to Suakim, and would be moved back from Suakim
to Cairo." House goes into shrieks of laughter. Old Morality,
gazing round with dumbly inquiring look, concludes he had better
sit down, which he does.
"They're too much for me, sometimes, Toby," he said wearily.
"Suddenly break out laughing when I was never so serious in my
life."
Pretty lively night all through till Half-past Eleven, when news
comes from Holborn. Satisfaction impartially distributed. First it
was said Liberal had got in; Opposition rose like one man and madly
cheered; turned out that Conservative had kept the seat; Minis-
terialists up now, vociferously shouting. Each having had their
turn, both went home.
Business done.—Land Purchase Bill read Third Time.
Friday.—A good long grind at Committee of Supply. Got many
votes—one on behalf of distressed Spaniards, who rendered assist-
ance to Great Britain in time of Peninsular War. Only five of
these remarkably lusty persons living. Money cheerfully voted, in
spite of nasty remarks from Irish Members.
"Must be getting on in life now," said Howorth. "Aged
Prelates nothing to these Aged Peninsulars, who fought against
Bonaparte eighty-four years ago."
"There is nothing further from my intention than to hide any-
thing from the House," said Old Morality, who had recovered his
spirits; "but Age is always Venerable." That settled it. Vote
agreed to.
Business done.—In Committee of Supply.

Sir George Grave writing a long note.
A GROVE OF BLARNEY.
Sra G. G., Director of the Royal College of Music, wrote last week
to the Timet a letter, complaining that nobody knows anything
about the Scholarships of
his Institution the R. C. M.
The letter was evidently
intended for a musical set-
ting, and not having time
at our disposal for this, we
will just give one extract,
with our idea of what it
wants to make it half effec
tive, so as to reach the
masses.
He wrote thus: — "The
Prince of Wales" (ZVtWm
phal Hymn — " Bless the
Prince, A/c), "with great
wisdom" (Harps and trum-
pets; wind and string: obbli-
gato pomposo), "as it seems
to me" (so 'umble! bless
him! Violin squirmoso . . .
But it is well to remind Sir
G. G. that Sir A. S. has
already used this very
Jhrase in the great duet
ox, "Or as it seems to me,"
"precisely," "quite so," "then we both agree," &c), "ordained,"
(full orchestra, fortissimo crasho, mqjestosissimo grandissimo)
—and then follows what the superior wisdom had ordained;
namely, that throughout the length and breadth of the land the
municipal bodies should make known the existence of these scholar-
ships wnich are like the Waverley Pen "a boon and a blessing to men."
So mote it be! After Mr. Punch has suggested the proper musical
form of publicity, it ought not, at all events, to be Sir George
Grove of Blarney s fault, if his ships, his well-found soholar-ships,
are not duly manned.
ME. PUNCH'S "CHRISTMAS ANNUAL" ALPHABET.
A is the Christmas Annual (so called, you may remember,
Because it's set-up in July, and published in September).
B is the Baby stealing jam—with pinafore and fist messy!
(This style of "Coloured Subject" is considered very Christmassy.)
C is the Carol, sung in snow. If anybody bets on it, [on it.
"We '11 wager there's a window-blind somewhere, with silhouettes
D is the Dancing in the Hall, where you '11 a tiny flirt see
In rollicking "Sir Roger" make her Grandpapa a curtsey.
E is the Editorial, whioh explains each illustration.
(In many cases not a work of super-erogation!)
F is the Fun, which we should not—perhaps we 're hyper-oritical!—
At any other time of year particularly witty call.
0 is the Girl with tennis-bat, inside a hammock sleeping,
Charming, and with the Season, too, so thoroughly in keeping!
H stands for Holly. Formerly some pretty maid with joy cut it,
If Artiste brought in Holly now—the Editor would boycott it!
1 is the Ioe, of course, a orowd of merry sohool-boys skating on it—
But, as the subject's overdone, we need not be dilating on it.
J is the Jollity in which all hearts should join harmonic;
But Annuals in the movement" take a point of view sardonic.
X's Kissing 'neath the Mistletoe. Onoe ereryone was doing it:
All high-class Illustrators now are rigidly tabooing it.
L is the Log they burnt at Yule. 'Tis long ago since we did it!
These patent gas-stoves possibly have somewhat superseded it.
M stands for Mistletoe—and here we should require apology,
Did we omit some mention of " Druidical Theology."
N is the Novelist whose tale is portioned 'mongst the pictures.
(As no one ever reads it, h_- is safe from any strictures.)
O is Originality—why han!;er for a touch of it? [of it!
The Public's quite couteuted, though they mayn't be given much
P's Pathos; if your eye is moist, be not ashamed to dab it!
It is a touohing subject—" Child, with invalided rabbit."
ft is the Queen of Twelfth Night Feast, by drawing lots elected,
But that comes after Christmas, and may safely be neglected!
R stands for Robin. How upon his breast they used to dash on
Tha liberal crimson! now the bird ii fallen out of fashion.
S is the Satire, harmless chaff on Persons in Society.
(" Smart" Annuals supply it now in every variety.)
I's a good Title: "Selkirk hears the distant church-bells chime."
Or—"Prehistorio Christmas, in the Tertiary Time."
U is the Undecided Man, who tries to choose an Annual, [new allt
From the dozens on the bookstall, where they look so spick and span'
V is the Verse, which Editors o'er vacant spaces scatter,
It generally rhymes and scans—if not, it wouldn't matter!
W's the "Wrapper; as a work of Art, it is surprising,
And forms the best of mediums, too, for those who 're advertising.
X is the Xtra Supplement. Subscribers who are slatterns,
May find their taste corrected by the " Gratis Sheet of Patterns."
T stands for Yule—a term whioh makes some people rather restive,
But it means the same as "Christinas," and, in print, it looks more
festive!
Z is the Zest with which (although there's little new or funny in 'em),
We pounce upon the Annuals, and invest our surplus money in 'em.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
A Mistaken Prescription.—You have totally misread our recipe.
It was not three "pints" of Condy's Fluid that you were to have
added to the basin of water whioh was to have served as a refreshing
lotion for your face, but three drops. The result, of course, can only
have been what you have described. "We are not surprised to hear
that your face has become a deep rich orange-brown. This is, of
course, a little awkward, if you Happen to be dining out. But you
must not be impatient. It will possibly wear itself off in the course
of a few months.
A Strengthening Regimen.—"When you say that you feel at
times " as if a steam-roller were going over you," you describe your
symptoms, no doubt, accurately, but there is really nothing serious
the matter with you. You had, however, perhaps, better take a
tumbler of hot cod-liver oil, mixed with rum, before your meals, five
times a day, and every half-hour a good wine-glass of Bloxter's
Dyspeptio Elixir, alternating this, if you find the former pall a little
upon you, with a quart of real turtle, water-gruel, or Finoher's
Prepared Magnesia Paste. Keep to a generous diet, and eat as much
pork, pastry, pickles, cheese, cucumbers, anchovies, and walnuts, as
you can conveniently manage. Should the Blight giddiness you
mention continue, or even increase, after you have habituated your-
self to this diet, endeavour to run a mile immediately after every
meal, when no donbt it will pass off. A persistent effort in this
direction for six months will make another man of you. By the
bye, do not forget your hot mustard plunge-bath before going to bed
every night.
Hunting Problem.—It is a pity that before inviting your sporting
friends down to your new '' place, and promising them a mount, you
did not discover that not a paok of hounds met anywhere within
twenty-five miles of it. However, you are evidently doing your best
to remedy your mistake. Your sending off a cheque for ten pounds
to the Battersea Home for Lost Dogs, with a request that the
Manager would forward you "immediately by return" a miscella-
neous dozen of them, and your opening negotiations with the local
circus to which you refer, to get up something like a meet on your
lawn on the morrow of your friends' arrival, were both happy inspi-
rations. Perhaps the circus people might be able to supply you with
a tame fox, or, if nothing better could be found, even a performing
bear, which would almost complete your arrangements for your
anticipated " run." If your friends are not very " keen," we dare
say you will pull the thing through comfortably enough. Anyhow,
we shall be glad to hear from you how it has gone off..
Economical Wedding Pre
sent.—"We should certainly have
thought that the young couple
ou mention would have been
ighly delighted with the three-
and-sixpenny set of bedroom fire-
irons with which you presented
them, and would much have ap-
preciated your kind offer to change
them either for a black coal
scuttle, metal gravy spoon, roll-
ing-pin or kitchen umbrella if
they would rather have preferred
one of the above-named articles,
and we cannot understand your
having received no acknowledg-
ment of your gift. As, however,
the presents will probably be dis-
played at the wedding breakfast,
and ticketed with the donor's
names, perhaps you might find it
more agreeable to be out of the
way. We should advise you to ab-
sent jourself from the ceremony.

Where the vulgar and the vapid, like the gazers, crush and jostle?
Of course, Fred, if a fellow mean* to be an Art Apostle
And take his vows of poverty

He may, perchance, in time, assist in definitely moulding
That public taste which you have been so eloquently scolding.
But—who is going to begin f Mammon must be resisted,
If the best talent in the Cause of Beauty be enlisted.
Her cause is a most glorious one, we Artists should be leal to it;
But if we'd smash the Qolden Calf, 'tis clear we [must not

A CHOICE OF EVILS.
Doctor. "Well, there's only one thino for you to do—you must
oo Yachtixq for nine months!"
Patient. "Oh! that costs so much money—besides I'm a bad Sailor
—is there no alternative?"
Doctor. "Well—yes—by no means an expensive one—nor one that
will make you sick! Doitr bat so MUCH!" [Patient chooses the yacht.
OH (FOLK) LAW!
Mr. Andrew Lang, in his Presidential address to the members of the
Folk Lore Society, alluded to modern slang expressions as belonging to a
branch of popular etymology. He particularly alluded to the " Oof bird,"
which, he said, "he understood to refer in some way to the accumulation
of wealth." He suggested that it might be argued that " Oof was a cor-
ruption of the French ccuf, an egg, and that reference was made to the
Goose with the Golden Eggs." Always ready to assist historical research,
Mr. Punch gives a few ancient phrases, with their probable derivations: —
"All Round my Hat!" Evidently connected with the noble house
of Cecil, who resided at Hatfield. Queen Elizabeth once visited a
Salisbury at Hatfield, and, doubtless, asked to be taken " round."
"Pop Goes the Weasel!" Connected with the spending of money
='1 That's the way the money goes—Pop goes the Weasel!" To " pop
is a quaint expression for raising money on the security of personalty of
an insignificant description. "Pop goes the Weasel" may be read, the
weasel goes pop—or popping," i.e., visits a pawnbroker. Why a weasel
should have been selected is unknown, unless the animal was the crest of
some of the earlier Lombards. This is not impossible, as a weasel is
described as a creature that can never be caught slumbering; denoting,
therefore, a fund of extra intelligence.
"Or any other Man." This catch-phrase was very popular some ten
or twenty years (time passes so swiftly) ago. No doubt it should be
"author man." An " author" man is, nine times out of ten. superior to
any one else, and thus the saying, which was originated with a view to
create attention, is calculated to carry out that otjject. It is said that it
was invented^ in the time of Charles the Second, but this may be
because the first to use the phrase was a Christy Minstrel, who may nave
been a descendant of the guard that attended the dowry of Madras which
the swarthy Stewart took on his marriage to his wife.
It need be scarcely added that Mr. Punch will be glad to receive any
further information on the subject that any member of the Folk-Lore
Society may be pleased to send to him. He would receive it for the
sake of " Auld Lang Syne," as their President Merry Andrew would say.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [December 15, 1888.
PLAY-TIME ALL ROUND.
Arthur Roberts himself is as funny as ever in the new opera
bouffe, Nadgy. at the Avenue Theatre, though he has not been pro-
vided with suffioient material for his exuberant humour ; that is, up
to now. His lesson in deportment to the Ladies, especially when he
shows them how to behave at a Linen-draper's, is capital run. But
I expeot that, about Christmas-time, there will be something intro-
duced into the Third Act, where the fun somewhat flags. The
"Zim zim zig-a-zig" duet is amusing, and obtains as many encores
as Arthur Roberts and his very talented assistant Mile. Vanoni

The two Zig-a-Zigs showing u clean pair of heels to the Audience
feel inclined to take. When they are exhausted, they shake the
dust of the stage off their shoes at the wings, and, unfortunately,
have no other scene together.
Nadgy has a good plot and some smart dialogue, and the
Composer has hit upon some pretty melodies, of which the most
taking, if not the best, is the tenor song, admirably given by
the still "Jolly" party of the name of Tapt/ey. Mr. Marsh has
very little to sing or do, but he
does that little well; and Miss
Giulia Warwick looks every
inch a Princess, and a litth
over, and she makes the most of
the not very effective music
that falls to her share. Mr.
Dallas, as the gay old Mar-
grave—(I wonder Arthur Ro-
berts doesn't call him "Mar-
gate" by accident, and then
make a mistake, and address hit
as "Ramsgate," and then as
"Pegwell")—is just what I
should imagine a gay old Mar-
frave would be if ne were Mr.
Iallas. He has some funny
lines to deliver, and now and
then, like Cox, in Box and Cox,
he "joins in a chorus," and, as an
Irish witness from the Special
Commission would say,'' he occa-
sionally takes hispart in a solo."
Miss Sallee Turner is one
of the merriest sallies in the
piece. Arthur Roberts, to Prmcess Giuha Wairoclt. "Oh! he
whom I cannot help returning, my Marsh!
as, after all, or before all, he is the principal attraction, is irre-
sistibly comic in his sentimental speeches, whicn invariably terminate
with a request that he may be allowed to explain a little puzzle.
Nadgy is bright and lively; dresses and scenes brilliant. Mons.
M a hi us has put it on the stage in first-rate style. "A Mons a
Mons for a' that I" as anybody may exclaim who has an opera
bouffe to produce, and is looking out for a Stage Manager. I
suppose that, as the piece here owes all its success to Mr. Arthur
Roberts, the audience on a first night don't call for "Author!
Author!" but for "Arthur! Arthur!" Can anything of this
sort be a failure with him in it? and Roberts + Vanoni = Certain
Success. Q. E. D.
Plenty of stir in the Operatic World. Dorothy still running: has
run over to the Lyric. Paul Jones coming to the Prince of Wales's.
Perhaps before Pooh-Bah-rington & Co. decide on the withdrawal

of W. 8. Gilbert's Pooh-Bah-rington Hall at the St. James's, Sir
Arthur may be called in to introduce a duet between Miss Netlson,
who, I hear, has a nice voice, and Pooh-Bah-rington, with a dance
modelled on that of the Dancing Quakers or the P.-Bah and
Jessie Bond's eccentric pat de deux in Ruddigore. The introduc-
tion might be too late to save the piece, but it would make a fine
festive finish for the last night, and would draw one big house at
all events, to speed the parting guest. In answer to numerous
inquiries, the first initial in W. S. Gilbert's name does stand for
William, but the second—the " S "—does not stand for Shakspeare.
Druriolanub is busy with his Pantomime. He does the thing
thoroughly. Not a big head that he doesn't try on, not a trap on
which he doesn't go down, or be shot up. Not a wire that is to carry
a fairy that either ne, or his indefatigable private secretary and literary
adviser, does not fly across the stage upon, before allowing a fie or
a coryphie to essay it. The flying faines are so fond of their pro-
fession, that they soon become strongly .attached to the wires that
are to oarry them. Fact. The Babes in the Wood is, as every one
now knows, the subject. What are the odds against something being
said about a " whine in the wood " in the course of the Pantomime r

A GAME OF BILLIARDS.
a cue—you ought to give
How much'(
Scene—A Hotel Billiard-room—anywhere. Mr. Balk and Mr.
Footler discovered about to begin a game. Captain Hazard
and Mr. Spottesbab.de, who have come in just too late to secure
the table, seat themselves on bench, and look on, A Friend of
Mr. Footler's it smoking in the background.
Capt. Hazard {in an undertone to Mr. S.). They won't be long.
We shall get a game before they olose—it's only a quarter-past ten
now.
Mr. Footler (a weedy, limp man, with spectacles, and a mild
expression). It's ages since I ve touched
me something, really.
Mr. Balk (short, stout, and self-satisfied). All right!
—will seventy do r
Mr. F. (a liltle hurt). Oh, I'm not so bad as all that^—say twenty-
five. [ Chooses a cue with great circumspection.
Mr. Footler's Friend. I shall put a shilling on you, Freddy, my
boy—so play up!
Mr. Balk. I'll break. I always make it a rule to play for
safety. {Makes a miss in baulk, but manages somehow to leave his
ball near centre pocket). Ah! (with an air of reproaching somebody
else) too fine, too fine.'
Mr. F. (chalking his cue). You've left me a chance there. Let
me see—perhaps I'd better leave you where you are for the present,
hit the red first, and oome baok to you afterwards? I think that 'a
the better game.
Capt. H. (aside, to Mr. S.). Seems to think he's playing parlour
croquet!
Mr. F. (after shifting the position of his left hand several times,
and agitating the end of his cue, misses red ball, and lands himself
eventually in corner pocket). I've let you off, you see! Now how
the dickens did I do that, I wonder?
Mr. B. Can't say, I'm sure—that's three to me (after playing).
Ha! I've left 'em for you again.
Mr. F. I can't do anything. . . . There, didn't I tell you so?
But I've saved my miss, anyway!
Mr. B. (walking round table). I ought to do something here. Yes.
I shall hit the red very fine, and go in off him into the left-hand
top-pocket—that's the proper game (plays). Te-hee! Too much
side on!
Capt. H. (sotto voce). He's right there.'
Mr. Footler (flurried). My turn, is it?
ball-eh?
Mr. Balk (good-humouredly). Why, you see, you got into one of
the pockets, old fellow, out of my way.
Mr. F. Ha! ha! So I did. I—I thought it was the best thing
to do. What's the game, Marker?
Marker. Twenty-seven. Three.
Mr. F. I don't like potting my adversary's ball—but you leave
me no choice. [Plays.
Marker. Three. Twenty-seven.
Mr. Balk (encouragingly). Very near, very near, Sir. Well, you
haven't left me much.
Mr. F. (laughing feebly). No, I—I couldn't afford to. (Mr. Bal*
makes an easy cannon). On, good shot.'
Mr. B. (complacently) Ah, I'm getting my eye in now.
[Strike* sharply, and sends ball off the table.
Capt. H. (aside). (He 11 be getting somebody's eye out presently!
Mr. B. (receiving ball). Thanks—much obliged. (Explanatorily
t» F.) I put rather too much screw on that time.

Mr. F. {with pride). That's another to me, Marker!
[Makes a cannon.
Mr. B. (patronizingly). There, you see, you can nit 'em when you
take a little trouble. Not a bad stroke at all.
Mr. F. (modestly). I'm afraid it was a bit of a nuke. Oh. I go
on playing, don't I? That's two to me, Marker—(after playing
again) . . . and another to this gentleman.
Mr. B. (plays, and makes another cannon). 1 played for that.
Creeping up to you, Footleb, eh!
[Later. Mr. Footler's score is thirty-five — Mr. Balk's,
nineteen. Mr. Footles is benignly patronising; Mr. Balk
gloomy, and inclined to cavil.
Mr. I. (beaming with honest pleasure). Five more to me, Marker!
I hope you 're keeping the score correctly?
Mr. B. Well, you aren't going to tell me you tried for that! . . .
Two more! Come, I say—it's impossible to play against such
flukes as that—you played to go in off the red.
Mr. F. Oh, n-not altogether , . . (tniuet). There, you can't say
I didn't try for that!
Mr. B. (scanning the cloth). Um—don't like this at all . . .
Shan't soore this time. (He doesn't). Now you've got me!
(Gloomily). [Mr. F. plays, and makes three.
Mr. B. (disgustedly). There, I never saw the balls run as they do
for you in all my life!
Mr. F. (generously). "Well, you 're not in form to-night—I can
see that.
Mr. B. Form! What good's form against such infernal fluking?
There—go on—it's you to _play!
Mr. F. I was just looking round the table, that's all. Well, I
shall have a shot at the double event . . . Oh, hard luck!
Mr. B. (growling). Hard luok? Hard stroke, you mean! (Plays.)
Was that a cannon, Marker?
Marker (imperturbably). No, fir—nothing, Sir.
Mr, B. (hopelessly). It's no use—they won't run for me to-night!
Mr. Footler. Here, Marker, jigger, please. Is the red ball olear
of the cushion?
Marker (inspecting it). Good half-inch, Sir!
Mr. F. Then that's my game. (After playing.) Phew! a mile
off! You may beat me yet, old fellow.
Mr. B. Not to-night. I can't do anything. . . . There, ever see
anything like that in your life?
Capt. H. (in an undertone). I'm hanged if J ever did! They
ought to rent a table by the week if they want to play a game out!
Mr. F. Long game this! Tell you what, Balk, if you like to
take that twenty-five back, I've no objection!
Mr. F.'s Friend. Oh, I say—and how about my shilling?
Mr. B. (annoyed). Don't be too confident, Kootleb; I shall catch
you up yet. I play a waiting game.
Capt. H. Jove—and so do we!
Mr. B. I wouldn't make too sure of that shilling, Jones, the game
isn't over yet by a long way.
Marker (confidentially). Beg pardon, Gentlemen, but it's gettini
late, and those other Gentlemen are waiting to play—would you mine
playing fifty instead of a hundred upr Makes a shorter game,
Gentlemen.
Mr. F. Well, I'm quite willing.
Mr. B. Of course you are! But I never meant to give you
twenty-five in fifty—I'd give nobody such long odds as that.
Mr. F. Then, look here, suppose we play fifty up, and you take
twenty-five—that '11 make you forty-six to my forty-seven.
Mr. B. (brightening visibly). That's fair enough—all right, Forty-
six-forty-seven, Marker. I shall have a chance now. (Lies on table
and, in making stroke, kicks Mr. F. in waistcoat.) Conf—Footleb,
I shall have that stroke over again.
Mr. F. (removing to a safe distance). I shall take good care I don't!
Mr. B. (after missing again). Of course I knew I shouldn't bring
a stroke like that off twice running—(bitterly)—you ought to run out
easily, now!
Mr. F. (trembling with excitement). Oh, I'm not so sure about
that. [Aims jerkily.
Jones (his Friend). Mind what you 're about, old fellow—remember
I've a shilling on you 1
Mr. F. (after missing). Hang it, Jones! I wish you'd wait for
the stroke—iVj enough to put any^ fellow out!
Mr. Balk. Forty-seven all! (Plays.)
Was that a kiss, Marker?
Pah, never
Marker (impassively). No, Sir; 'nother miss, Sir.
Mr. Footler. I '11 make it safe this time. (Plays.)
got near it!
Mr. Balk. Now then— (plays)—tut-tut, not legs enough!
Capt. If. (aside). Legs! a centipede wouldn't have enough for him.'
Mr. Footler. Forty-nine—forty-eight. This is getting devilish
exciting! (Plays.) Oh, dear me, that's another to you—I must be
careful now!
Mr. Balk. Oh, you 're all right—I shan't get anything to-night.
Mr. Footler (amiably, as Mr. B. is aiming). Have

Mr. B. (angrily). Chalk! what the—there, it 'sail your . . . wait
a bit—it's not going to be a miss, anyway ... it's—hi! go on—go
on, can't you! (Bait wavers a few seconds, and drops into pocket.)
Game to me! (Magnanimously.) Well, Footleb, you play a finer
game than I thought you did, but I fancy I should beat you "by more
than this on a better table, and then you started twenty-five to the
good, you know! Capital exeroise, billiards—the King of indoor
games! [Mr. F. puts on his coat sulkily.
Marker to Capt. H. and Mr. S. (who have risen eagerly). Very
sorry, Gentlemen, close on 'alfpast eleven, Gentlemen—closing time!
Mr. F. (to Mr. Jones). Well, old fellow, if I didn't quite pull it
off, you '11 admit you had a good run for your money!
[Mr. Balk walks out with restored complacency. Mr. Footleb
follows with Mr. Jones in a more resigned frame of mind.
The Captain and his Friend reserve their remarks until they
are alone. Lights extinguished as Scene closes.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"Co." draws attention to Among the Turks, by V. L. Camebon,
C.B., D.C.L., as a first-rate story of adventure by land and sea;
also In Palace and Faubourg,
by "C. J. G." (who is he f), whioh
is very interesting, specially for
youthful Marionettes—Co. "begs
pardon — lapsus calami—would
have said, Marie Antoinettes,"
—if considered as a Christmas
book by the publishers, Nelson
and Sons. Nelson (and Sons)
expect every man this Christmas-
time to do his duty. Has Nelson
a column to himself in some
paper, as his great namesake has
in Trafalgar Square? But, a
propos of Trafalgar Square, I
must move on. "Next, please,

"Wells, Dabton & Co. Co.
cannot conscientiously encourage
children in story-telling, but this
is an exception, and to be recom-
mended. Easy stories (" It is as easy as . . . story-telling "—Hamlet
politely adapted), and bea—u—tiful piotures. Boys will like That
Bother of a Boy, whioh ia the story of an Imp, by Grace Stebbinq;
and some amusement may be found in The Moderate Man, issued by
publishers who have been Downey enough to get Harry Fubniss to
illustrate it.
Messrs. Macmillan are reproducing Miss Yonge's and Charles
Etnoslet's Books. They ought to be very popular; they were, onoe
upon a time. But, personally speaking for myself, and not for
"Co.," I never could read one of them, and can't now.
Mrs. Molesworth's " Christmas Posy" is first-rate, and entitles
the authoress to be called Mother Bunch. Same Macmillans bring
out double Christmas number of English Illustrated Magazine, which
keeps up its literary and artistic prestige. The Quill Pen-elopes of
London Society (Christmas number of course) are Mrs. Lovktt
Cameron (always pleasant reading). Mrs. Cashel Hoky and Mrs.
Florence Mabryat. "When will these three meet again? Next
Christmas probably. Good company these three ladies when you 're
training down to the country for Christmas.
My faithful "Co." reports that he has been reading with great
delight a Crack County, Dy Mrs. £. Kennard, whioh he fanoies is
either a hunting story, or the rough sketch for the_ scenario of a
Christmas Pantomime. He inclines to the latter belief, as he finds
suoh names as Lord Littelbrain, and Qeneral Prosieboy, which
remind him of the customary lines in the play-bills,—" Cricketers—
Messrs. Gloves, Stumps, Bats, and Balls; and'' Lawyers—Messrs.
Costs, Wbits, and Summons." If it is a hunting story, and
only a hunting story, why then it is equally interesting, especially
the earlier chapters of the first volume, in which is:recorded
a run after a fox in a fog! He, however, was sorry to notice
that the fair Authoress is rather too !fond of making her hunting-
men use strong language. Had the novel been illustrated, no
doubt it would have found a place in the Library of the late
Mr. Jorrocks.
Co." was under a misapprehension last week in putting down
the pretty Rosebud Annual to Messrs. G. Warns—it is published
by James Clabke & Co. "Co." has been Warne'd. By the way,
the Australian Flowers Album, with frames in the flowers for
holding photographs, is, Co. thinks, very "tasty." There's humour
in this idea of Smith and Downs's, if you only select the right people
to fill the spaces, as some faces set among the flowers do seem so
appropriately placed. B. de B.-W. & Co.

"REMEMBER!"
A WORD LN SEA.SOX.
Shade o/ Oordon, loquitur: —
Once more into the Desert, once again
Treading the sands scarce free of the red stain
Left by your lost slain thousands? Back once more
To face the swarthy spearmen's rush and roar
With a mere handful r Can it really be?
Have you forgotten El Obeid—and Me P
Beware! What matter who your hosts may head,
That Salisbury leads now where Gladstone led?
The doom of vacillation is the same,
Helpless confusion, failure, and disfame.
Yours to determine, lessoned by a past
At whioh your stoutest patriots stood aghast,
Yours to determine whether once again
The bravest English breasts should faint with pain,
With shame should sicken, at the piteous sight
Of Polioy, the prey of Party fight.
Sinkat, Tokar, Khartoum! These names should teach
E'en slaves of purse-strings, dupes of flowing speech

That comes from friends betrayed and heroes slain.
Ilemeraber! What you do, do well, at once!
He who, thrice schooled, forgets, is worse than dunce.
Yon is no region for the paltering pranks
Of trimmers tame from Party's rival ranks.
Withdraw your foot from out those treacherous sands,
Or plant it firmly there. The desert bands,
Their desperate valour in unequal fight.
The swift evasion of their trackless night,
You know. Send no more knots of men to fall
In a lone waste or by a ruined wall.
Send them no more, I say, nor be content
To sit in sullen silence while they 're sent,
Pushed here and there like pawns, without an aim,
By bungling players of a blindfold game.
Yours the responsibility at last.
As yours the shame by such dishonour cast;
Be yours the resolution! Still Khartoum,
But named, clouds every English face with gloom.
'Twas there such fumbling policy as this
Found tragic issue. Can you—dare you—miss
The obvious moral? Caution is not crime,
But feebleness is guilt. Be warned in time!
READ THIS! AN UNPARALLELED PRIZE!
Sow to Get a Healthy Circulation in the Cold Weather.
Champion Squibs' Unprecedentedly Generous Christmas Gift.
In reply to our offer of one guinea for the best suggestion as to
what would be at once the most popular and the most unique Prize
for a successful answer sent in to our Christmas Conundrum, wa
(Champion Illustrated Squibs) have received bushels of answers, of
which we print a few specimens.
"Constant Subscriber" writes—" I think you couldn't do
better than give one bound volume of your delightful paper to the
successful Competitor. True, its market price is only about seven
shillings, but / consider it worth ten times that sum, and so I am
sure will all your other readers who, like me, have no professional
connection whatever with your marvellous pennyworth."
"Generous Soul" says—"You do not state the limit of money
value for the Christmas Prize. However, knowing how munificent
you are, or wish to be thought, I fancy you could not do better than
offer two Special Private Pullman Cars, one for meals, and the
other for sleeping, such as the Czar of Russia uses, with a free pass
for, say. twenty persons for one whole year, over all the railways of
England and Scotland. This would get you a lot of readers among
railway travellers."
"Pale Student," who does not seem quite to have grasped what
our design for Christmas is, writes as follows:—"I hear that you

wish to do something really turpriting. Well, what could he a
greater surprise to jour readers than if your Christmas Number were
to simply contain, instead of the usual short stories and borrowed
scrap", humorous and otherwise (especially otherwise), the whole of
Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' printed 1 in extenso' t It might not
largely increase your circulation, and in fact would probably ruin
the paper, but think what an impetus it would give to the spread of
a taste for high-class literature!
"Pbactical" says:—"Why not make your prize something really
Christmassy? I would suggest half a prize bullock for the most
successful competitor, ten prime turkeys tor second, a monster plum
pudding for third, and so on through geese and fowls to a modest
kippered herring. In this way you would share the advantages
offered among a large number."
As none of the above suggestions are quite satisfactory, we have
decided to keep the guinea for ourselves, and to select the following:—
UNPRECEDENTED YULE-TIDE OFFERING!
as our first prize (the only one) for the forthcoming festive season.
A Full-size African Rhinoceros will be despatched to the private
residence of the person fortunate enough to give, in our judgment,
the best answer to the conundrum which will be published in our
next week's issue. In order to increase the pleasurable surprise
when it arrives at the door, we shall give no notice of its coming!
Thus, all our readers, successful or not, will share in the anxious
expectancy consequent on the possible uncaging in their street of this
truly noble quadruped. A special ship has been chartered to bring
the animal over from the Congo; and we should advise the prize-
taker to secure it in his back garden by a chain attached to the most
solid thing in the neighbourhood. It is probable that cats will avoid
the garden, and so a double advantage will be reaped by the fortu-
nate owner.
N.B.—Should any difficulty be experienced with the animal,
Messrs. Carter, Paterson & Co. would, if applied to, peremptorily
decline to call for it with one of their vans. Our readers will admit
that no such prize as this has ever before been offered by any
English journal.
THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
November 14.—A red-letter day. Our first important party since
we have been in this house. I got home early from the City. Lupin
insisted on having a hired waiter, and stood
a half-dozen of champagne. I think this
an unnecessary expense, but Lupin said he
had had a piece of luck, having made three
pounds out of a private deal in the City. I
hope he won't gamble in his new situation.
The supper-room looked so nice, and Carrie
truly said, "We need not be ashamed, of its
being seen by Mr. Pebkupp, should he
honour us by coming."
I dressed early in case people should
arrive punctually at 8 o'clock, and was
much vexed to find my new dress trousers
much too short. Lupin, who is getting
beyond his position, found fault with my wearing ordinary boots
instead of dress boots. I replied, satirically, "My dear son, I have
lived to be above that'sort of thing." Lupin burst out laughing and
aaid, "A man generally was above his boots." This may be funny
or it may not, but I was gratified to find he had not discovered the
coral had oome off one of my studs. Carrie looked a picture,
wearing the dress she wore at the Mansion House. The arrange-
ment ot the drawing-room was excellent. Carrie had hung muslin
curtains over the folding-doors, and also over one of the entrances,
for we had removed the door from its hinges. Mr. Peters, the waiter,
arrived in good time, and I gave him strict orders not to open another
bottle of champagne until the previous one was empty. Carrie
arranged for some sherry and port wine to be placed on the drawing-
room sideboard with some glasses. By the bye, our new enlarged and
tinted photographs look very nice on the walls, especially as Carrie
has arranged some Liberty silk bows on the four corners of them,

said, "That won't make your trousers longer, Juggins. You should
get your Missus to put a flounce on them. I wonder I waste my
time entering his insulting observations in my diary. The next
arrivals were Mr. and Mrs. Cummings. The former said, "As you
didn't say anything about dress, I have come 'half dress.' He had
on a black frock-coat and white tie. The James', Mr. Merton, and
Mr. Stillbrook arrived, but Lupin was restless and unbearable till
his Daisy Mutlab and Frank arrived. Carrie and I were rather
startled at Daisy's appearance. She had a bright crimson dress on,
cut very low in the neok. I do not think such a style modest. She
ought to have taken a lesson from Cabbie, and covered her shoulders
with a little lace. Wumminos and his four daughters came, so did
Fbanching, and one or two of Lupin's new friends, members of the
"Holloway Comedians." We had some music, and Lupin, who
never left Daisy's side for a moment, raved over her singing of a new
song called " The Garden of Sleep. It seemed a pretty song, but
she made such grimaces, and sang to my mind so out of tune, I
would not have asked her to sing again, but Lupin made her sing
four songs right off one after the other.
At ten o'clock we went down to supper, and, from the way Gowtng
and CuMMlNOS eat, you would have thought they had not had a meal
for a month. I told Carrie to keep something back in case Mr.
Perkupp should come by mere chance. Gowtng annoyed me very
much by filling a large tumbler of champagne, and drinking it
straight off. He repeated this action, and made me fear our half
dozen of champagne would not last out. I tried to keep a bottle
back, but Lupin got hold of it^and took it to the side-table with
Daisy and Frank Mutlab. We went upstairs, and the young fel-
lows began skylarking. Carrie put a stop to that at once. Stiix-
bbook amused us with a song, "What Have You Done with your
Cousin John t" I did not notice that Lupin and Frank had dis-
appeared. I asked Mr. Watson, one of the Holloways where they
were, and he said, "It's a case of ' Oh, what a surprise!'" We were
directed to form a circle—which we did. Watson then said,
"I have much pleasure in introducing the celebrated Blondin
Donkey." Frank and Lupin then bounded into the room. Lupin
had whitened his face like a Clown, and Frank had tied round his
waist a large hearth-rug. He was supposed to be the donkey, and
he looked it. They indulged in a very noisy Pantomime, and we
were all shrieking with laughter. I turned round suddenly, and
then I saw Mr. Perkupp standing half-way in the door, he having
arrived without our knowing it. I beckoned to Carrie, and we went
up to him at once. He would not come right into the room. I
apologised for the foolery, but Mr. Perkupp said, "Oh, it seems
amusing." I could see he was fnot a bit amused. Cabbie and I
took him down-stairs, but the table was a wreck. There was not a
glass of champagne left—not even a sandwich. Mr. Pebkupp said
he required nothing, but would like a glass of seltzer or soda water.
The last syphon was empty. Cabbie said, "We have plenty of port
wine left.' Mr. Pebkupp said, with a smile, "No thank you. I
really require nothing, but I am most pleased to see you and your
husband in your own home. Good night, Mrs. Pooteb—you will
excuse my very short stay, I know. I went with him to his
carriage, and he said, "Don't trouble to come to the office till twelve
to-morrow." I felt despondent as I went baok to the house, and I
told Cabbie I thought the party was a failure. Cabbie said it was a
great success, and I was only tired, and insisted on my having some
port myself. I drank two glasses, and felt much better; and we
went into the drawing-room, where they had commenced dancing.
Cabbie and I had a little dance, which I said reminded me of the
Mansion House. She said I was a spooney old thing.
PUNCH AND "JUDITH" A LA MODE DE PARRY.
An excellent performance of this, Pabby's Oratorio in London, at
the St. James's Hall, last Thursday.
One of the series of Novello's Oratorio
Concerts, with Dr. Mackenzie pre-
scribing—we should say, conducting.
The boys made a great nit. Quite an
Oratorio for holiday time, as there are
so many children in it. It will, of
course, be given again in the Christmas
vacation. In his preface to the Book
of the Words the Composer gives the
reasons (quite unnecessary) for select-
ing this Israelitish story," whioh he
has illustrated with Israel - lightish
music, as it is not in_ the least neavy
or tedious. Its reception was enthusi-
astic; Mr. Hubebt Pabby and
everybody was applauded, and Dr.
Mackenzie—now known as "the one
Mac," to distinguish him from "the
Two Macs "—beamed again as he " boo'd and boo'd " to the audience.

Now and Then.

As a very wicked sort of villain.

Makes John Dillon look almost a Saint.

TO MY HAIRDRESSER.
(Not to make Conversation.)
You tell me that the day is fine,
You say my hair is getting thin,
Anon you proffer Smearoline,
Or comment on my tender skin;
Good friend, for goodness' sake forbear,
I prithee only cut my hair.
For think—a shy, retiring man,
I shun the toilet's public rite,
Until my Cousins—Cousins can—
Reproach me for a Perfect fright.
And must I bear, too shy to snub,
The babble of your Toilet Club?
I know, for every day for years
I've scann'd the glass with careful eye,
Whether the heaven clouds or clears,
Whether the roads are wet or dry;
Indeed, indeed, I do not care
Whether you think it foul or fair.
And why observe, with honied zest,
What men by many phrases call,
That phase which must be dubb'd at best
Unduly intellectual?
What though my loftier temples shine,
That is no business of thine.
Think you, when, in your wrapper swathed,
I cower beneath the harrowing comb,
Or crouch, in creaming lather bathed,
Beneath the hose's numbing foam,
Or bear, while tears unbidden gush,
The rigours of your softest brush,—
Think you, at such a time as this,
I care to hear, with nerves unstrung,
The dirge of bygone days of bliss
Trip lightly from a stranger's tongue?
What if your victim stood at bay,
And told you you were bald or grey?
The head you handle like a block,
And brand with slighting comments cool,
Has bravely borne the battle's shock,
And starr'd the grey old walls at school:
Has sprained a Bishop's reverend wrist,
And badly bruised a Judge's fist.
They were not Judge and Bishop then,
But only chubby, scrubby boys;
And now they 're grave and reverend men.
I value those remember'd joys,
And grieve that evil should be said
About my own, my only head.

House of Commons, Monday Night, December 3.—" Monsignor!"
I gasped, as familiar figure flitted down Corridor, making for House
of Commons. "Is this you, or will the Conservative Party have the
long-delayed pleasure of beholding your wraith?"
"It's me, or perhaps I should more correctly say, it is I," said the
0. 0. M., playfully making a lunge at my tail with his umbrella, as
if he were lopping off a short but serviceable branch from a tree.
"Suppose you thought I was down at Ha warden P So I was; went
off about a week ago. Fancied I was tired: might leave Autumn
Session to younger men. Did very well lor first day or two;
vigorously read lessons in Church • wrote letters by the dozen, post-
cards by the score. Began an article for the Twenty-first Century.
Read Homer backwards; cut two old trees, and one early acquaint-
ance; tried to make myself believe I was happy. But no use.
Every morning papers came with Parliamentary Reports: Balfour
back, in high spirits; Prorogation apparently as far off as ever;
resisted temptation up to this morning. When papers arrived, con-
taining columns of report of Saturday sitting, could stand it no
longer. Irish Estimates on to-night; Balfour's salary to be voted;
opportunity for going over evervthing from beginning. Couldn't
face another week at Hawarden with business buzzing on at West-
minster ■ so jumped into train, and here I am. Ta-ta. Just going to
Boo for Balfour."
Booing for Balfour all round. Ellis began it; Healt took part
in it; Dillon had his say; and Trevelyan gave a brief history of
Spencer's administration. G. 0. M. beat everybody in vigour and
vivacity. Managed to say something new about Mitchelstown.
Balfottr swears mat the shot which slew Lojtergan was a. ricochet.
Photographs taken on the spot show that Loneroan was in direct
line with barrack window when shot fired.
"Were the photographs taken by ricochet 1" roared Gladstone,
leaning half across the table, and literally glaring upon the pensive
Balfour.
"Capital idea," said Mafle-Blundell. "Shall add a new wing
to our Mammoth establishment, and advertise photographing by
ricochet. Sure to take."

Grandolph's attack delivered by old familiar
war-way of the Soudan. Stanhope complains that
it was an ambush. House ostensibly met to discuss
salary and expenses of Chief Secretary. Ellis has
moved Amendment, cutting off Balfour's coals.
"But, first of all," says Tim Healt, "let's
drag him over them." Process began last
night, was to have been continued as soon
as Speaker could be got out of Chair to-day;
when Grandolph suddenly and unexpec-
tedly appears on scene ; moves Adjournment,
and attacks Government in rear; Glad-
stone, gladder than ever he came to town,
holds them in check in front. Plan of Cam-
paign carefully considered and laboriously
worked out. Leading elements secresy and
surprise.
House may not like this sort of thing,
Toby," Grandolph said. '' May talk about
underhand proceedings, hitting below the
belt, and all that; but if I can get my
respected leaders in a hole, I don't mind
what the gentlemen of England say about
me. The Markiss openly boasts that he
can do without me. We shall
Surprise complete. Consternation profound; even danger of
defeat in the division lobby. Stanhope came out well; most diffi-
cult position and best speech since he's been a Minister. When he
sat down, an awkward pause. No one quite ready to take sides
either with Geandolph or against. Nolan obligingly rattled
away.
Goldswortiiy, holding out his hat as if he were about to take up
a subscription for the Sick and Wounded, besought the Government
to "be firm." Harcourt, with unusual
timidity, felt the way; and finally the
G. 0. M., having had time to think matter
over, and look at it all round, threw up his
cap for Grandolph. A big division; some
anxious moments; a majority of forty-two
for Government, and disappointment for
Grandolph.
"I thought we should have run them
closer than that," he said. "But it
will serve. Only I wish we had the
Markiss in this House, instead of
on the other side of the corridor. I
suppose they told you of the message
he sent me when I let him know he
should hear from me shortly in the
House of Commons ?' Dear Ran-
dolph,' he wrote, ' I assure you you
can't intimidate me by any amount
of worrying of W. H. Smith.'
That'shim: utterly .'selfish."
Business done. — Randolph on
the Rampage.
Thursday.—Ctjbse of Camborne
muttering all over the House. Had
spent some time in framing one of
half, a dozen questions; succeeded,
after laborious effort, in making it
what he thought attractive; handed
it in at table; got up early this morning to enjoy sight of it in
print and anticipation of putting it in House; found the Sri ikir
had severely sub-edited it; taken out all the bad language, the
innuendoes, insinuations, accusations. This is what the Curse calls
"emasculating" his question. Rises to make complaint; shows
tendency to get behind Speaker's decision by reading out full terms
of original composition. Speakf.r too quick for him. "Order!
order! he thundered, in a voice with which the Curse is not un-
familiar. But he Btumbled on. "I wish to explain"
"Order! order! Put the Question!" says the Spkaker.
"Shan't!" says the Curse, and sits down pouting like spoiled
child.
Business getting further in the rear than ever. Votes accumulate;
opportunity of dealing with them decays. Time being shorter than
ever, and business more pressing, Saqe of Queen Anne's Gate moves
Adjournment, and proposes to discuss matter at length. The Grand

Young Gardner (where's his Wife ?) smiles at the claims of Old

round the House; sparkling speech of neatly
written-out impromptus. But Chaplin has
fallen on evil times. Present House doesn't
care for his pompous periods and his antique
mannerisms.
"DlSRAELi-and-Ditchwater," says Sir Thomas
Acland, retired Member, up on rare visit. Sat
in House fifty years ago; remembers real and
undiluted thing. Harcourt—a sort of supe-
rior Chaplin — had his fling. Then Old
Morality trotted out references to "duty,"
"the country." "convenience of House," and
so on. Said his say. Resolution withdrawn,
and House got to work.

Friday. —' Why is the Hon. Dadabhoi
Naoroji like the devil?" asks George Elliot,
Junior, coming in after dinner (" George
Elliot, Junior," says Folkestone, "has
inherited from George Elliot, pere, a per-
ennial after-dinner look, that grows a trifle DisraeU-and-lntch-
acoentuated towards eleven o'clock at night.")
"Order! Order!" I said, not, I trust,
altogether without reminiscence of the
deeper chest-notes and sterner manner
of tne Speaker. "It's all very well for
the Markiss, a master of flouts and
jeers, to speak slightingly of our fellow-
subjects from the far East. It is, I
suppose, an outcome of Unionist prin-
ciples. But obsoure people, like you
and me, dear George, must be very
careful."
"It isn't an insult—it's a conun-
drum."
"Oh, very well," I said, much molli-
fied. "Then I give it up."
'' Why is the Hon. Dadabhoi Naoroji
liko the devil? Because he's not so
black as he's painted."
After this, proceedings in House
seemed quite lively, although the busi-
ness under discussion was none other
than Employers' Liability Bill. Debated
it till midnight. Bradlaugh created
some sensation by going over to Gentle-
men of England.
"An early attachment, Toby," he
pleaded. "You remember how they
used to clutch me on the way to the
head of the stairs? They've got me
now, and I never will desert them."

BARE-FACED TYRANNY.
It is stated in an evening paper that " The Clerks in a
well-known Bank in the Strand are not permitted to grow
either moustache or beard." Let the Liberty and Pro-
perty Defence League look to this gross infringement of
personal freedom. If a man and a Clerk's hirsute adorn-
ments are not to be recognised as his own " property," and
if he is not to have'' liberty" to deal with them as he lists,
then, indeed, ownership loses its last basis, and British
freedom its last buttress. Let no shaven slave of draoonic
bureaucracy henceforth be tempted to render Oberon's
lovely lines in this fashion:—
I know a Bank wherein no brave beards prow,
Where clean lips and shorn cheeks unwhiBkered show;
Lips canopied with no moustachios fine,
Cheeks that know not the " mutton chop's" trim line.
There rules Autocracy, moved, as by spite,
To rob poor clerks of all hirsute delight;
Compelling each to shave, look cold and thin,
And, on chill winter mornings, cut his chin,
And to his desk come blue, with a sore heart—and skin;
This Bank's Bigwigs, kindly were they, and wise,
Would drop all such despotic fantasies.
A New Cast foh Drury Lane.—Last Saturday night
that gay young buster, Lord Ronald Gower, presented
a gigantic plaster (of Paris) cast of Shakspeare's head
and shoulders to Druriolantjs Magnus. The cast, which
Lord Ronald has had in his eye, with this object in view,
for some time past, is as white as a ghost, and at first it
was supposed that it was intended as a likeness of Lord
Mayor Whitehead. Druriolanus doesn't yet know
what he shall do with it, but appeared much gratified on
being presented by Mr. Leonard Botne, on behalf of the
Drury Lane Company, with a handsome silver flagon.
The gift was full ~rf signification, and yet there was
nothing in it.
SELECTION OF THE FITTEST.
The expression, in certain quarters, of fears that at the forth-
coming Election of Members for the newly constituted London
County Council, there will, owing to the apathy and indifference of
those nearly concerned, be a decided dearth of candidates of a desir-
able and acknowledged respectability, has suggested the publication
of the subjoined brief paper of test questions. Anyone, therefore,
anxious to save the new Council from the reproach of degenerating
into a gigantio assembly of typical Vestrymen, cannot do better than
scatter it among his friends. Candidates who find themselves able
to answer it satisfactorily, may enter upon the contest with all con-
fidence, assured that they are just the right sort of aspirants to fill
the exalted office with distinction and dignity, and discharge its
duties with ability and success.
1. "With a view to a clear definition and establishment of your
unquestioned social status, furnish your pedigree, in direct male
descent, for not less than twelve generations, and state:—
A—Whether you are a Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or only
an ordinary Baron;
B—If you have ever been Lord Chancellor, Archbishop of Can-
terbury, or Commander-in-Cbief; or,
C—Have discharged the duties of Prime Minister, Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Secretary of State for War, or of any other
important post in which you are likely to have become so
acquainted with the routine of official work as to guarantee
in some measure, your fitness for undertaking the respon-
sibilities attaching to the position of a London County
Councillor.
2. If so, state all yon know about a steam-roller. Draw a plan on
a scale of 3 inches to a foot of "a Compton's twenty ton compound
reversible granite-crusher," furnace and all, and explain.
A—What action the Parish is to take, if bv some mischance it
orashes through a shop-front and embeds itself in the base-
ment, to get it out again, and
B—How yon would propose to deal with it, with advantage to
the Ratepayers' interests, when it is thoroughly worn out.
3. A generous and impulsive Master of a Workhouse takes all the
paupers in his establishment to the Dress Cirole at Drury Lane to
witness an afternoon performance of the Christmas Pantomime, and
further treats them to a champagne tea on their return from the enter-
tainment. Should the expenses entailed by the above come out of
the Ratepayers' pockets? If so, state why, and write a short essav
exemplifying the broad distinction between the money-grabbing and
cheese-paring instincts of the ordinary Vestryman and the philan-
thropio and large-hearted benevolence of the new County of London
Councillor in their probable respective methods of dealing with the
foregoing ease.
4. How do you make gruel? If considered unpalatable and
rejected by the inmates of the Union, would you be prepared to
recommend that its place be supplied by Real Turtle, Liebig's
Extract, Arrowroot, or by some other patent farinaceous and nutri-
tive compound? If so, give your reasons why.
5. The tenant occupying No. 37 in a certain terrace writes to the
Authorities complaining of the condition of the dust-bin of his
neighbour, No. 38. The dust-cart is despatched forthwith, but the
dustman, mistaking his instructions, only empties the dust-bins of
Nos. 7 and 15. Meantime, the nuisance having become intolerable,
the occupier of No. 37, much angered, insists on the intervention of
the Sanitary Inspector, who, being nettled at the peremptory tone in
which he has been addressed, says that he can detect nothing
offensive in the condition of the dust-bin of No. 38, nor anything in
the shape of a "nuisance" on which to report. The occupier of
No. 37, now exasperated, is threatening the Authorities with pro-
ceedings, when typhoid fever breaks out suddenly and simultaneously
at No. 4, 19, 25, 39, 40, and 52, and the occupier of No. 61 writes an
indignant letter to the Times, giving a graphic history of the whole
affair. Is anybody to blame? If so—who?
Work this out, and indicate the sort of course a County of London
Councillor could pursue with dignity in dealing respectively with
A—The Dustman,
B—The Sanitary Inspector, and
C—The Tenant of No. 37.
6. Describe in a short poem, in blank verse, the doings of the
London School Board, from its foundation up to the present date.
Also analyse and examine the main features of the " Anti-Diggle-ite
Reaction,'' define a "Progressionist," and give a short account of
the earlier years of the life of Mr. Mundella.
7. Finally, do you ride well on horseback, and make an imposing
figure in the saddle? Answer this, and append a list of any other
notably aristocratic characteristics with which you happen to be
endowed and which, after you have answered the above technical
questions, will, in your opinion, enable you with greater aplomb and
presence, to discharge the exalted duties devolving on you in your
distinguished position as a London County Councillor.

An Early Riser.—We have always held the talents of Sir Henry Leland
Harrison, I.C.S., the popular Commissioner of Police and Chairman of the
Corporation of Calcutta, in respect, but we had no idea until we read the
biography of the Hon. gentleman in Dod'8 Peerage, Baronetage^ and Knightage
of Great Britain and Ireland, that his promotion had been quite so rapid as it
seems to have been. According to Don, Sir Henry, who was born m 1857,
entered in 1860, (after being educated at Westminster and Christ Church,
Oxford) the Indian Civil Service when he was only three years old! At ten
(1867J he was Junior (very junior!) Secretary to the Government of Bengal, a
position he relinquished at the not very mature age of fourteen (in 1871) to
become Magistrate and Collector of Midnapore. Seemingly he dispensed justice
to the satisfaction of the Indian Government until he was promoted on coming
of age (in 1878) to the post of Secretary to the Board of Revenue. A year later
he was elected a Member of the Rent Commission, and at four-and-twenty (1881)
appointed to the Commissioner Hhip of Police and Chairmanship of the Corpora-
tion of Calcutta, which he has doubled" for the last s>-ven years to the great
benefit of that important city and its neighbourhood. If the rise of Sir Henry
in the future is as rapid as it has been in the past, there seems to be no reason
why he should not appear in Dod as Governor-General of India long before he
is forty. Finally, it is to be honed that no mistake has been made in the date of
Sir Henry's birth (which Dod, it will be seen, declares to have occurred in 1857)
as such an error may possibly cause disappointment in the breasts of those
proud parents of preoocious children who, encouraged by the brilliant career thus
chronicled, may have already recognised in the Indian Civil Service the best and
earliest possible opening for infants in arms.

LONDON AS SHE IS.
{An Intercepted Letter.)
My Dear With,—I am so glad I did not bring you up to Town to
see the Cattle Show, as I feel sure (judging from my own experience)
that you would not have enjoyed yourself. It has been very dull
in London, and I am longing to return to you. You will remember
that I proposed originally staying only three days in the great
Metropolis, but I have been so terribly tritte that I have lingered on
and on for more than a week. As this is my first letter since I left
Bumbleby-on-Brain, I fanoy you will expect some account of what
I have been doing during my absenoe from that muoh-loved spot,
and consequently, to please you, I jot down a few particulars. Need
I tell you that I visited the British Museum, the School of Mines in
Jermyn Street, the Diploma Gallery at the Royal Academy, and
Exeter Hall? No, I need not. I hope you believe that I paid at
least one visit to eaoh of these admirable institutions. I repeat, I
hope that you do. However, all work and no play makes Jaok a dull
boy, so I determined to combine with information a little amusement
I rather fanoy that that eminent divine, your uncle, the Rev. J ere
xiah Crabapple, told me one day that he would like above all
things to see a "boxing tournament." Finding that such a contest
was indeed being held at Her Majesty's Theatre, I determined to be
present, so that I might send him some report of the proceedings.
Will you please tell him, with my affectionate but respectful regards,
that the Indian club exercise and some wrestling were sadly, sadly
frivolous, but that the fights in the ring were stunning. To wind up
matters, Jem „ Smith, the champion, was put on to box with his
little brother. I pitied his little orotner I
When your unole comes to town to attend the May Meetings, he
might really drop in to see " Nadgy."
The Monk's Room, which I visited out of compliment to the
Reverend Crabapple, is not half bad, and capitally played.
Herbert Vezin and Willard are excellent, and so is Alma
Murray, who seems to have discovered the secret of perpetual
youth. She is as comely as ever. I am afraid your revered relative
will miss this piece, as it is already out of the bills. Perchance, as
the author is a plucky gentleman who took a theatre himself in
which to produce his own play, it may be revived. Any way Mr.
Crab apple cannot do wrong to reserve an evening from Exeter Hall
for The Monk's Room. If it is not being played in May, we can go
instead to the Empire, where we shall see a first-rate ballet.
On Tuesday I looked in at the Farnell Commission, where I found
the same old game being played. Taking it all round, it was rather
a better day than usual, for we were treated to the evidence of Cap-
tain Boycott. The President made several amusing remarks, and
Mr. Justice Smith was also distinctly jocular, but the best things of
the sitting were thought by Mr. Justice Day who, however, kept them
to himself. I was much pleased with the reticence of Mr. Lockwood,
who never speaks except when it is absolutely necessary, and evidently
does his best to avoid being reported. Mr. Soames looked wonderfully
well, in spite of his marvellous exertions, and seemed as fresh as
ever. By universal consent it is admitted that the case of the Timet
has been admirably prepared. Mr. Grahahe was not present during
the whole of the sitting, but, in spite of his occasional absenoe, Sir
Henry James and the Attorney-General really seemed to get on
very nicely without him.
And now, my dear Wife, I must bring this letter to a close, as I
have important appointments to keep at Romano's (a meeting-house
close to Exeter Hall) and the Pelican Club, a name which has been
recently given to a well-known Sunday Society. Hoping to see you
soon, I remain. Your ever affectionate husband,

The revival of Maebeth at the Lyceum is postponed until after

the original music will be used, the answer is, that Sir Arthur's keys

For the finish of Scene 2, Act II., after the murder of Duncan,
Sir Arthur has composed a characteristic Scotch melody, to which
Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, with daggers in their hands, will reel
off. This is one of the Realistic effects.
Real Whiskey will be served at the banquet. There is a great

at him, and brandishing his Bword of the period:—
"I will not be
Put down by claymore!"
It is finally settled that Mrs. Langtry, Miss Violet Cameron, and
Miss Maud Millet will not appear as the Three Witches.
The proposal made by Mr. Cremer, of Oxford Street, to practically
illustrate the line, "all is but toys " (Act II., Scene 3), was, on con-
sideration, declined with thanks.
There are two medical men in Macbeth, One an English Doctor,
and the other a Scotch. Each will be "made-up " after well-known
celebrities. The Scotch practitioner in attendance on Lady Macbeth,
will be an easily recognisable portrait of another great "Mac,"—
in fact " the very moral" of him. Miss Ellen Terry will not adopt
the costume with which we are familiar in the picture of Mrs. Sid dons
as Lady 3f.,with a handkerchief round her face, suggestive of
mumps, toothache, or of "holding her jaw."
A new reading has been introduced by the MacMarshall in
Act IV., Scene 1., The Witches' Cave, when Macbeth on entering,
will look at the cauldron, give a significant sniff, as if relishing the
savour of national cookery, and exclaim—
"How now, you secret, black, and midnight Haggis!"
He will be then, in dumb show, invited to partake of the favourite
dish.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Christmas Entertainment for School Children.—The reso-
ution of "Vicar" to attempt to produce, with the limited means at
his disposal, the grand Opera of Faust as a Christmas treat for his
youthful parishioners, does infinite credit to his energy and resource.
The idea of substituting for the fiend Mephistopheles the genial
figure of Punchinello, out of regard for the tender age and general
theological scruples of his audience, is a happy one, but we doubt if
he will find the fine musical effects of the Second and Fourth Acts
satisfactorily rendered by a full chorus of three. His plan for repre-
senting the Apotheosis of Marguerite is a capital one, but we would
warn him to be careful that the steps, clothes-horse, and arm-chair,
which he is going to call into requisition for the purpose of producing
the effect in question, do not give way.
Broken Engagement.—You were certainly justified in resenting
the remark of your future father-in-law in the little family fracas
on the eve of your wedding, to which you refer; but it would, we
think, have given your case a better look in the Police Court if you
had not first torn his coat off his back, and then thrown him out of
window. His offer to " square" the assault on your undertaking to
pay for a portion of the wedding breakfast, though commercially
mean, might, perhaps, under the peouliar circumstances, be enter-
tained by you. With regard to the presents, you divide these, of
course, with your flancie, tossing for first choice. This is the
etiquette invariably followed on such occasions in the best society.
It is a pity that the three clergymen were kept waiting at the church
two hours and a half before any one thought of informing them that
the ceremony had been abandoned; but if they get troublesome about
their fees, let them have a Solicitor's Jletter to tell them that if they
want to recover them they must do it through the County"

Hands Acrots the Sea, the Melodrama at the Princess's is capitally

popular than ever. See him floor the Frenohmen. Song—
"You should see me dance the Polka."

You should sec him full of " go,"

Then Miss Maby Robke is charming, so is Miss "Webstee, with
double the life in her now she is away from the St. James's. Mr.
Pateman's Jean de Lussac is repulsively clever, especially when he
has on that tight fit which finishes him. As for Garden, it is quite
a pleasure, Garden, to see you as Turn Bassett; and in fact, all are
good, not forgetting such minor parts as Mr. H. H. Morell's Hiram
Hickory, a character sketch, adroitly worked into the plot by that
sharp playwright, Henry Pettitt, of whose work, however, this
drama is not the best specimen. Less well acted, Hands Across
might have resulted in Mr. Pettitt's determining not again to try a
pas seuL but to make his bow and return to partner.
Mr. W. S. Gilbebt seems to be considerably annoyed about the
failure of his piece at the St. James's. He would like to sweep all
the critics off the face of the newspapers, except one. Quite right;

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
My faithful "Co." says he has been very hard at work reading a
novel called Mary Myles. It is only in two volumes, but more than
enough. "Co." does not like the heroine
who gives her name to the book. He des-
cribes her as an artful minx, who, under
Sretence of being a governess from Girton,
irts with every Doy, man, and grey-beard,
she runs across. She has an unpleasant
habit of walking about without her shoes
and stockings, and after becoming an old
maid, ultimately marries a man many years
her junior. "Co." has also looked through
a somewhat elaborate work upon Kensington,
which he says contains several rather clever
illustrations. The letterpress, he thinks, less
satisfactory, as many interesting particulars
about the Royal suburb are unrecorded. "Co." is surprised that
there should be so many omissions, considering that the book is
written by no less a person than that eminent litterateur, the com-
piler of the Authorised Guide to the Tower. He has also dipped into
the Aspern Papers of Mr. Henry James, and read The Modern Warn-
ing, contained in the second volume. Written in excellent English,
the characters are unpleasant, and he hopes unnatural. He says he
can answer that there was never Buch a vulvar person as Sir Rufus
Chasemore, K. C. B., on this side of the Atlantic; and he hopes that the
Yankee snob, Macarthy Orice, on the other side, is equally mythical.
He fears that Aspern Papers will please neither Britishers nor their
American cousins. Mr. James should turn his attention to real
foreigners, and then, perhaps, he would score a suocess. My faithful
"Co. feels that Mr. James is rather out of his element when he
talks of Fifth Avenue and Piccadilly; and my faithful "Co." was
out of hit element when he called the clever brochure to which he
referred the week before last the Dawn of the Nineteenth Century,
instead of the Dawn of the Twentieth.
I don't go in for books much this week. Shall have to do so next
week. Christmas Books and cheque-books. Hark! the merry Christmas
Bills! They don't quite chime in with my idea of perfect happi-
ness. "Partons!" Now, what says " Co." f Co. has gone in for
crackers. That is " Co.'s" literature just now. He sings in praise
of Tom Smith's crackers, which, he says, reproduce the latest
fashions. The costumes being twisted up inside the cracker, which
may be known as " Smith's Closure," and are most ingenious, quite
"Smith up to date." So much for the Smitheries.
At the Cremeries, the toy-purveyor should adopt as his motto the
old French quotation, "A Toy Toujours." The great point here,
says Co., is that there is such a variety to delight the genuine shilling
customers. What boy or girl cares for a guinea toy, and other
articles of raro price? No, give 'em a few good knock-about toys at
a shilling a wooden head, and the quantity will please them as long
as the quality is sufficiently enduring—say, for six weeks, wheu
away back to lessons.
"Co." says I must mention Goodall and 8on, for "Novelties in
noto paper," and a neat little box of cards with all appliances for
whist, which is an education for a happy old age. Goodall, all
good. "My only books" are not "women's looks" this week, but
children's books—charming little volumes, nursery rhymes and
tales—old friends with new and attractive faces—by Ebnest Nistkr.

Scrap-maniacs are most destructive insects.
The Babon de B.-W. & Co.
CONFOUND THEIR NAVY-ISH TRICKS!
Olives Twist would not be "in it" with Lord Charles Beres-
ford in "asking for more." The brave and breezy Beresford
frankly avowed that he desired to add Twenty Millions to the Navy
Estimates! What Lord George Hamilton had to say in reply
practically amounted to this; that the British Navy was better than
it had been, but not so good as it ought to be. Between our salt
water Oliver Twist and our naval Micawber there does not seem
to be much comfort for John Bull. The official Micawber said that
the difference between himself and the tarry-breeked Oliver Twist
was that in him (Lord George Micawber) "the sense of oaution
was more fully developed." He added that when the Government
moved, he hoped their movement would be " genuine and prolonged."
Well, if they don't do their duty by our naval defences, doubtless
their movement, when it comes, will be "genuine and prolonged,"
and that its motor will be what Lord Tennyson calls " the wild
mob's million feet." But, meanwhile, events move; they move all
the time, and do not wait for sessions, or for programmes, or even
for Budgets. That is why Naval finance of the Pip and Herbert
Pocket order affords Mr. Punch little satisfaction, and not very
much hope.

peeple in the country, and they coud talk, and
they coud smoke, and they cood sing, without
being bored—yes, bored was the word as he
used—with a lot of tiresome toasts, and a
lot of dreeary speeches! Yes, and, to our
immense estonishment, the Gests all cried out,
"Here! Here!" And I suttenly must confess that a merrier, or a
larttnger, or a appyer party I hav seldom seen. They chatted away,
and told most emusing storys, and wun rayther ancient Deputy
acshally guv a commick ressetation, as made 'em all roar. Waiters
and all; and one Gent, who was a wisiter, by the name of Lane, I
rayther thinks—" most likely Hunnet Lane," as Brown rayther
cleverly said—sang 'em three most luvly songs most sweetly, one on
'em being all about " holler arts wearing a mask"—more shame for
'em! Werry welly-so far so good. But if wunse this sort of change
is allowd, where's it a going tor to stop?
Is it to be hexpeeted that Gents of great persitions in Sosiety,
such as Books, and Markisses, and Haldermen, and Hadmirals, is to
dress themselves in their werry best close, and put on all there
borders and chanes and things, and not to be treeted to all the time-
onered Toastes? No Royal Fammerly, and no Army and Nawy and
Wolunteers, and no old Copperashun, and no Howses of Farlement!
Why, the werry thort of it sends quite a shudder thro me as I
'writes.

Why, what did I hear a galliant Hadmiral say, ony larst week but
wun, when returning thanks for the Nawy? Why, that whenewer
he was a taking his Fleet into haction,—and he seemed to be doing
it about wunce a week by the way he forked—the wun thort as filled
his galliant sole was, that sum day, when the war was ower, he and
his brave comrades wood all be drunk sumwheres in the City! and
the nobel sentiment was cheered to the hecko. The same with the
nobel Ouse of Lords. They has such preshus littel hoppertunities in
their own gilded Chamber of making their woices nerd, or their
names nown, that if it wasn't for the thortful as well as geeniel
orspitallerty of the Manshun Ouse and the great Livvery Cumpnys
with their grand Toastes, nobody woodn't never hear on 'em, and
they'd be like the flowers a wasting their sweetness on the dessert
there.
I'm quite willing to allow that sumtiines, when the critticle
moment arrives, after the almost sacred Luwing Cup has gone quite
round the table, that the warious Gests makes themselves as cum-
feral as they can, and assoomes a hair of demmy semmy resignashun,
if not indeed of marterdom, that is sumwhat puzzling to us Waiters.
Brown, with his usual himperence, says as it s becoz they all thinks
as they knows xactly wot's cumming, as they've herd it all so offen
afore; but Brown's rong, as ushal, for I wenturs to say, with
dubble his xperience, that there's an amount of wariety interdooced
in perposing the werry same Toastes as to me is puffekly surprising.
It's sumtimes werry good fun to us when a werry stout Gineral,
or a werry red Hadmiral, goes on a pounding away for sumthink
like twenty minutes, and who takes the applause, that gits lowder
and lowder every minnet, for encouragement, when it's really all
hintended for chaff, and to drownd his poor woice. Sumtimes he
finds it out, and then don't he jest set down quiokly, pore feller!
No, Gennelmen Copporators, and Gennelmen Marsters, and Gen-
nelmen Wardens.it won't do. Change in sum few things may
Sosserbly mean himprovement, but any change in all the thortful
erangements of a grand, scrumpshus, and almost hinterminabel
Bankwet, wood be fatal to its sollem charackter, and lower it down
to the lewel of a mere Dinner, at whioh all sorts of peeple are
mingled together for mere eating, and drinking, and chat, and
amoosement. Long be the day ere that sad change shall cum to pass
in the grand old City of London, is the fervent prayer of one who is
quite satisfied with things as they is, and hii name is Robert.

Howe of Commons, Monday, Decem-
oer 10.—House full of fog to-night; obscures
even Irish Question; Members flit ghostlike
through the cloud; Irish Members suspect
Balfour at bottom of it; Ccnnisohami:
Graham sure it was Home Secretary.
Pluwket. questioned by Grand Young Gard-
ner, explains fog is entirely due to presence
of Members. Air carefully introduced to
Chamber through layers of cotton-wool; fog
intercepted; only fresh air in House; all
right up to Three o'Clock; then Members
troop in, and everything in a fog.
House declines to accept this explanation,
and Motion for Adjournment threatened.
Things look bad for Ministry, when well-
known figure looms through mist at table,
and familiar voice is heard. It is Old
Morality, riding on the whirlwind and
explaining the fog.

"Members brought fog in with them."
"Sir," he said, turning in direction where
he thought he saw outline of Speaker's Chair,
"the Hon. Member asks, What is the cause
of the fog? Her Majesty's Government
have nothing to hide in this matter. I will
be quite frank with the House. These fogs,
which occur generally in the winter time,
are occasioned thus:—Some current of air
being suddenly cooled, descends into the
warm streets, forcing hack the smoke in a
mass towards the earth. Fogs would be
more frequent but for the fact that the air
will not always hold in solution a certain
quantity of vapour, which varies according
to its temperature, and when the air is not
saturated it may be cooled without parting
with its vapour. I have now given the
House the fullest explanation in my power,
concealing nothing, and extenuating no-
thing, it being my only wish to consult the

onvenience of Members on both sides, to do my duty to the country,
and to perform the functions of the Government with the least
friction possible."
That settled it. Fop denser than ever, but everyone satisfied.
Irish Members with light hearts turned to boo for Balfovb.
Operation lasted till midnight, when
Closure moved. Condition of affairs
so exhilarating that Courtney
dropped into a joke. Years ago now
sini t; Jacob Bright made his repu-
tation as humorist by alluding to
GRandolph as "the noble Lord,
the Member for "Woodcock." Court-
ney, cheered by the fog, and soothed
by Old Morality's oration, deter-
mined to outshine this flash. Struck
a light on Tay Pay. Tay Pay from
time to time emerged out of fog,
yelled "Yah!" in somebody's ear,
and disappeared. Courtney lay in
wait for nun; he swooped down, and
caught him by left ear.
"This," , he said, shaking him
vigorously, "is the third time the
Hon. Member for Scotland Yard has
interrupted."
"' The Member for Scotland
Yard,'" says Fbaseb, V.C, "lacks
the brisk movement of 'Tay Pay ':
but it will serve for Sundays and
state occasions."

Wednesday, 2 a.m.—Been here, or
T**.rd^ZT^Co^thereabouts, ft*. ' three yesterday,
mind's eye. Monday, Dec. 10. Me ^ the Speaker took our chairs
together. No present sign of getting
home; daresay shall go on till Three o'Clock, which nicely divides
the day.
And such a night too! Scotch Estimates on; Scotch Members
don't often get a chance- when they do, don't easily let it go. Ander-
son, who led off at prodigious length, invented new process which
extorted grunt of admiration from Tim Healy. Moved to reduce
salary of Secretary for Scotland by £ 1000; amid growing impatience
from compatriots who had speeches ready, Anderson reached his
seventhly and sat down; then came dreary processsion of Scotch
Members till Robertson, vainly trying to catch the Speaker's eye,
temporarily gave up pursuit and left House.
"It's amazing," he said
glaring at Esslemont, "how
some people with nothing to
say wag their tongues."
Robertson back presently,
and gettinghis innings, talked
for half an hour. Meanwhile
Anderson sprang his patent
process on disheartened
House; withdrew Amend-
ment to reduce salary by
£1000; moved another to
reduce it by £200; this being
new Amendment, he was in
order in making new speech;
which he did.
Thinking over these things
sitting in limp condition on
plank bench, startled by hear-
ing curious whimpering,
"Boo-ooh!" Turned round;
found it was Tanner dig-
ging his knuckles into his
eyes and whimpering like
whipped schoolboy.
"What are you at now?"
I asked. "Booing for Bal-
four?"
"Boo-ooh!" ho said, with
another outburst. "He's got
my Btick."
"Who's got your stick?"
"Boo-ooh, Fielden, boo. I '11 tell the Speaker."
So he did. Seems he'd brought in broken baton; said to have
been used by Irish Constable; left it on table whilst he went out
to division; Fielden, coming in, put it in his pocket.
"Give me my stick!" screamed Tanner, when he came back, "or
I '11 tell my moth—I mean the Speaker."

Tanner of the Broken Baton.
Fielden playfully refused. Tanneb stamped and screamed, tore
his pinafore, wnimpered, and finally peached. Speakeb protested
he was tired of these personal squabbles. Told Fielden to give the
boy his stick. Nurse sent for, and Tanneb carried off to bed, kick-
ing and screaming. When we have come to this in House of
Commons, it's time to wind up business.
Business done.—Scotch Votes in Supply.
Thursday.—Came down to-day in thoroughly depressed mood-
Had a chat with Bebesfobd yesterday: tells me it's all up with us:
haven't got a ship in the Navy that could
stand against a penny steamboat on the
Seine; guns burst: engines won't work;
ships run aground, and the Cavendish
tobacco not at all what it should be. Worst
of it is, the Government won't learn.
Charlie wanted them to beach the Agamem-
non or Alexandra opposite terrace of House
of Commons, plant a few big guns on terrace
and fire away at Bhip.
"Then you'd see, says Chables.
But Hamilton won't see, and there we
are. That is the truth about the Navy in a
cockleshell. Cockleshell, however, couldn't
hold all Chablie had to say. Prodigious
effort; poured broadside after broadside into
Admiralty; Hamilton, with head hung
down, tore up with busy fingers innumerable
slips of paper in reply; a melancholy indict-
ment, leaving us not a ship to sail in or a
gun to fire. Curious part of it was that
nobody seemed penny the worse. Carthage
is as good as ruined—and Members went off
to dinner just the same! So many went that
at half-past eight House nearly Counted Out.
Bbown of Wenlock (ex-comet in 50th
Dragoon Guards), had come down determined
to shed last drop of his blood for country.
"I'm a handy figure aboard a ship," he
Baid, drawing himself out like a telescope,
"and though not used to the sea, will
enlist as a marine. In emergency, might
serve as spare spar."
But Cornet Brown, finding how things were going, concluded he
wasn't wanted; shut himself up a few feet, and went out.
Beresford had several more speeches to make on other votes, but
result of first oration not encouraging. !In the end, votes ran through
like greased lightning. England, dull-eared and blindfolded, went
stumbling to her doom!
Business done.—Navy Yotes agreed to.
Friday.— Army Estimates on to-day. Admirals retire, Colonels
advance in fighting form. Navy bad;
Army worse. An ancient nation tottering
to it* fall. Quite a cheerful Christmas
Story, in two Parts. Part One: The Navy.
Part Two: The Army. Conclusion: Both
hopelessly bad.
Sir George Elliot sits out dreary de-
bate, as last night ho listened to lament
over Navy. Wonder what he thinks of
it all? Doesn't seem particularly de-
pressed. Why don't they put him at head
of War Office or Admiralty? Wouldn't
matter which. Father wasn t a Duke, nor
is his brother an Earl; but he's a man of
great natural gifts, trained capacity, and
infinite resources, a credit to Durham, an
honour to Monmouth.
"That's the sort of man they ought to
offer any inducement to leave his private
affairs and look after the Nation's," said
Serjeant Simon, an Old Parliamentary
Hand, looking in to see how the House is
ge ting on without him.
Towards close of sitting, things took new
turn; opposition melted away; money
voted hand over hand; looks like adjourn-
ment before Christmas Day, after all.
Business done.—Army Yotes.

(an entirely imaginary forecast.)
Scene—The Offices of the New " Lady Guide Association." Intelli-
gent Gentlewomen, "Ladies by birth and education, of almost
any age, and of different dispositions and capacities, according
to prospectus, discovered seated in background awaiting an engage-
ment. In foreground, Clients are consulting Manageress.
Manageress (toCouple from the Country). Exactly; this is your first
visit to London, and you want to see everything during: the week you
are here. There is a lady there, the third from the end, with the
short hair and the pince-nez. She is in charge of the Intellectual
Sight-seeing Department, and you will find her a highly-intelligent
companion, thoroughly acquainted with all the objects of interest in
Sir Hans Soane's, the British, and the Geological Museums, Madame
Tussaud's, and the Tower, where she will render a warder quite un-
necessary. In the New Law Courts, for a small additional fee, she
will explain the origin and growth of Common Law and Equity; she
can translate the epitaphs in Westminster Abbey (if desired), and
tell you the exact height of every public building in London.
The Husband. Hev she a eye for a beast P Susy an' I be coom up
fur Cattle Show maainly.
Manageress. She has been through a course of lectures on Com-
parative Anatomy. Shall I call her?
The Wife. No offence to you, Ma'am, but I think I'd rather know
what that young woman in the fur-trimmings can do, before I make
up my mind, like.
Manageress. Ah, that lady? She is extremely well connected—a
Baron's daughter—she undertakes the Social Sight-seeing, but she
would be rather too expensive for you, perhaps?
The Husband. Oh, dang th' expense f let's hev* a good 'un while
we're 'bout it. Kindly ask her to step out. (The Hon. Miss
Frederica Georqina Churchmouse steps forward.) Now, Miss,
me and my Missus here 'ud like to hear what you nave to say for
yourself.
Miss Churchmouse {languidly). I think I could show you something
of Town while you are with us. Dear Lady Pettifoores kindly
allows me to bring my friends in to tea on any of her afternoons, and
I could get you cards for the Countess of Herringbarrel's crush,
and Lady Darvish's small dance, if you cared to go, that is. I would
walk in the Row with you after Church on Sunday morning—(but that
would he an extra)—and tell you who everybody was. If you thought
of giving a little party while you are in Town, I could get some really
smart people to come to you, and advise you how to do the thing,
with or without supper and flowers—a brother of mine supplies a
very fair ohampagne at a moderate price, and you would order the
flowers from our hothouses at Brokeby, of oourse. I—ah—don't

The Wife. We did think of going to the Theayter.
Miss Churchmouse. Nothing worth seeing just now but the French

lady with the blue eyes and a frizzy top-knot.

The Spokesman. It's this way, Ma'm. We're a mixed party,
and our ladies—well, they 're not so darned partickler about having
a goodlooking Guide. Birth and breeding we do take stock in. So,
if you've got a female member of your pampered aristocracy,
approaching middle-age, red-headed and squint-eyed, hitched up on
these premises, I reckon we '11 take her along.
Manageress. I'm afraid we have nothing but a Baronet's widow
to-day, who, at all answers that description, and I'm sorry to say
she doesn't squint.
The Young American (in an undertone). Say, couldn't we contrive
to get along with one of the younger ones at a pinch? If they had
a juvenile Duchess around now, it wouldn't signify much if she did
happen to be personable, so far as I'm concerned.
The Spokesman. I believe you, Bangs—there's no prejudice about
you; but if we 're to preserve the harmony of this meeting—we've
got to content ourselves with a plain patrician, or no one, that's
so! And, as there's nothing of that kind in stock just now, I guess

something wrong with the drains, and everything tastes of dry-rot,
and the housemaids won't carry up the coals, and we 're almost sure
the cook sells our kitchen-stuff through the area railings, and we
hear suoh very odd noises every night next door between eleven and

House of Commons, Monday Night, December 17.—Nice sort of
preparation for Christmas, Thick fog outside; Benches crowded
inside; debate on Suakin expected; Gladstone again in his place.
"You Bee I can't leave you, Toby," he said, with sprightly air,
but really apologetically. "Bade farewell to House three weeks
ago. Then Balfour twitted me, so obliged to run up to Town and
boo him. Really thought I was gone after that; but, having spare
Saturday, spent it at Limehouse. Day after to-morrow set off for
sunny South. No use going down to Hawarden for couple of days;
so, being in Town, may as well come down to House; being in House,
may as well deliver a speech. No trouble, I assure you."
Gladstone come, Old Morality gone. In his place Goschen sits
nervously washing his hands with invisible soap in imperceptible
water. Every prospect of a stiff debate. Holidays retire further into
the dim and distant future. Things made worse by receipt of telegram
from Old Morality, dated Monte Carlo. Here it is:—" And how is
that's his joke.) "Hope you are doinj?

But, of course, that only a dream. Jokem quite happy. All the

A regular tussle round Suakin. John Morley led off attack from
Front Bench; Gladstone brought up reserves; G ran dolph attacked
Ministry in rear. Don't know what would, have happened to Govern-
ment if Chaplin hadn't thrown himself into breach and solemnly
rebuked Gran-noi.ru. Grandolph laughed; but it was a hollow
performance. Business done.—Suakin Vote agreed to.
Tuesday.—Met Mr. Dick—I mean Lord Desman, slowly making
way down to House immersed in deep thought, with coronet under
his arm. "How's the Memorial getting on?" I asked.
"Pretty well," he said. "Head of Charles the First not been so
troublesome lately. Have, however, laid manuscript aside for short
time. Mind much occupied with Local Government Act; have my
doubts about Ritchie; Bill itself calculated to diminish the corn
average and reduce the travelling weight of fat cattle. It must be
seen to. So have brought in Bill for immediate repeal of Act. Down
now to move Second Reading; sorry to embarrass the.MARKiss; but
fublio duty- is a publio trust. Expect the Government will resign if
carry my measure, and probably the Black
Man would be sent for to Osborne. A nuisance
at Christmas time; but there are higher con-
siderations than plum-pudding. If you would
like to see a bombshell drop in Ministerial
Camp, better look in when I'm moving the

Aot. 1888, Repeal Bill. Mr. Dick,
producing some pages of the Memo-
rial, denounced Bill as " one of the

No one had reckless audacity to deny Mr. Dick's statement.

as if he was going to rise, but limbs refused to move.
"Great Heavens!" I murmured. "Is it possible the Act going
to be sacrificed in this way? No one to say a word in favour of
it. What Christmas Tidings for Ritchie!"
Lord Chancellor put the question. House stricken dumb. No
one said either "Content" or " Not Con-

dition of paralysis, Lord Chancellor
boldly declared "Not Contents" had it,
and Bill thrown out.

Blake Memorial at St. Margarets, Westminster.
Stout Sailor, pride of England's patriot sons,
Who vanquished her most valiant foe, Van Tromp,
Cast forth from her great Abbey's glorious pomp,
Thy fame shines bright as when above the guns
At Santa Cruz thy keen eyes flamed and saw
The path to England's Queenship of the Sea.
What may not later patriots learn from thee,
In days of slackened will and shaken law P
Not swelling words but sturdy deeds were thine,
Not conflicts voluble but valiant strokes.
Thou, firm of fibre as our native oaks,
Didst bear our flag unchallenged o'er the brine;
Made England's name respected, and her power
Acknowledged over all earth's watery ways.
Englishmen, emulous of such splendid praise,
Sailors, who deem sea-sway our native dower,
Patriots who'd keep our greatness at full flower
As in those strenuous days,

LITTLE PUSS IN BOOTS; OR, THE CATS' MEET AND THE HUNTING KIT! (OUR PANTOMIME POEM.)

The Early Bird had done pecking the worm,
Who resented the act with a struggle and squirm;
The Bright Chanticleer had proclaimed the morn,
And the Huntsman already was sounding the Horn.
Con spirito.
By way of parenthesis let us remark,
That the Bright Chanticleer was only a lark.
Who was kept in a very small cage on a shelf.
And who got up so early—he rose with himself.
The morning was bright, and the air was sweet.
Not a cloud in the sky—not a prospect of wet;
On the sward there assembled, a very smart set,
For there was to be—a special Cats' Meet.

Now Hunting Kit was the first to appear,
(The hounds were first—a detail mere);
Also to mention, I must not fail,
That the hounds were kittens (a mere detail),
And Hunting Kit had the pinkest of suits,
Including a marvellous pan of top boots.
Now People have often inquired how he kept in 'em—
We '11 tell you, they fitted so tightly, he slept in 'em.
Now every huntsman with any nous
Was bent on hunting the wily mouse.
The Gay Lady Tabitha (rivals said " Tush I")
Was keen on securing the coveted brush.
A silly old Poodle turned up at the start,
Not mounted—oh no! never fear;
He came in a Lowther Arcade dog-cart,
To follow full well in the rear.
With mollo chic 11!

With the sound of the unison song we are singing.

Hurrah, the View-halloa is heard—'tis a find,
"Hark forward!"—poor Poodle has " harked far behind."
Through everyone's property every one tears,
And (excepting the landlords) nobody cares.
We come to the farm of a grumpy old owl,
Who is armed with a pitchfork as well as a scowl.
He's very irate, as over his gate
Goes every hound, with leap and with bound,
There goes the mouse—right through his house,
And so do we—with heedless glee,
A truce to our mirth—we've run him to earth.
But tush !—never mind! Here's a much better find,
Superior to first;
A fine old mouse,
Who runs from the house—
A glorious burst!
What the Owl cried to Kit we never quite knew,
We heard what he said to a Groom,—
"To whip. To whip; To who, To who!"
(He ought to have said to whom.")
And after a chase, though flooded field,
Poor mouse did yield;
And gay Lady Tabitha, short of breath,
Was in at the death.
Then came the best of the fun of the fair,
For Kit first was seen to stoop,
And, holding the mouse high up in the air,
He shouted "Who-hoop I Who-hoop!
In spite of the rivals, who would say "Tush!"
Lady " Tab " was awarded the coveted brush.
Bemudded and splashed, we trudged along
Towards our home, with the usual song.
THE HOMEWARD SONG.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Nobody's Child.
THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
November 15.—Woke about twenty times during the night, with
terrible thirst. Finished ofi all the water in the bottle, as well as
half that in the jug. Kept dreaming, also, that
last night's party was a failure, and that a lot
of low people came, without invitation, and kept
chaffing, and throwing things at Mr. Pebxupp,
till at last I was obliged to hide him in the box-
room (which we had just discovered), with a
bath-towel over him. It seems absurd now,
but it was painfully real in the dream. I had
the same dream about a dozen times. Cabbie
annoyed me by saying, "You know champagne
never agrees with you. I told her I had only a
couple of glasses of it, having kept myself
entirely to port. I added that good champagne
hurt nobody, and Lupin told me he had only got
it from a traveller as a favour, as that particular
brand, " Jackson Freres," has been entirely bought up by a West-End
Club. I think I eat too heartily of the "side dishes," as the waiter
called them. I said to Cabbie, " I wish I had put those 'side dishes
atide." I repeated this, but Cabrie was busy, packing up the tea
spoons we had borrowed of Mrs. Cummings for the party. It was just
half-past eleven, and I was starting for the office, when Lupin appeared,
with a yellow complexion, and said. "Hulloh, Guv, what priced
head have you this morning?" I told him he might just as well
speak to me in Dutch. He added, "When I woke this morning,
my head was as big as Baldwin's Balloon." On the spur of the
moment I said the cleverest thing I think 1 have ever said: viz.,
"Perhaps that accounts for the ■parashooting pains." We all three
roared.
November 16.—Still feel tired and headachy! In the evening
Gowino called and was full of praise about our party last Wednes-
day. He said everything was done beautifully, and he enjoyed
himself enormously. Gowino can be a very nice fellow when he
likes, but you never know how long it will last. For instance, he
stopped to supper, and seeing some blanc-mange on the table, shouted
out while the servant was in the room, "Hulloh! The remains of
Wednesday?"
November 17.—Woke up quite fresh after a good night's rest, and
feel quite myself again. I am satisfied a life of going out and Society
is not a life for me. I told Sarah not to bring up the blanc-mange
again for breakfast. It seems to have been placed on our table at
every meal since Wednesday. Cummtngs came round in the evening
and congratulated us on the success of our party. He said it was the
best party he had been to for many a year, but he wished we had let
him Know it was full dress, as he would have turned up in his
swallow-tails. We sat down to a quiet game of dominoes, and were
interrupted bv the noisy entrance of Lupin and Fbank Mutlar.
Cummings and I asked them to join us. Lupin said he did not care
for dominoes, and suggested a game of "Spoof." On my asking if
it required counters, Fbank and Lupin in measured time said, " One,
two, three; Go! Have you an estate in Greenland?" It was
simply Greek to me, but it appears it is one of the customs of the
"Holloway Comedians" to do this when a member displays igno-
rance. In spite of my instructions that blanc-mange was brought up
again for supper. To make matters worse, there had been an
attempt to disguise it, by placing it in a glass dish with jam round
it. Carrie asked Lupin if he would have some, and he replied,
"No second-hand goods for me, thank you." 1 told Cabrie, when
we were alone, if that blanc-mange were placed on the table again, I
should walk out of the house.
November 18, Sunday.—A delightfully quiet day. In the after-
noon Lupin was off to spend the rest of the day with the Mutlars.
He departed in the best of spirits, and Carrie said, "Well.one advan-
tage of Lupin's engagement with Daisy is that the boy seems happy
all day long. That quite reconciles me to what I must confess Beems
an imprudent engagement." About nine o'clock to our surprise
Lupin entered, with a wild, reckless look, and in a hollow voice,
which I must say seemed rather theatrical, said, "Have you any
brandy P" I said " No. but here is some whiskey." Lupin drank
off nearly a wine-glassful without water, to my horror. We all
three sat reading in silence till ten, when Carrie and I rose to go to
bed. Carrie said to Lupin, "I hope Daisy is well?" Lupin, with
a forced careless air that he must have picked up from the Holloway
Comedians, replied: "Oh, Daisy? You mean Miss Mutlar. I don't
know whether she is well or not, but please never to mention her
name again in my preience."\
Sympathy. (Finlay's Version.)
I sirs with a cynical look,
If the G. 0. M. axes me why,
I (mentally) "cuts him a snook ":
"Lack of Sympathy makes me," sez I.

ROBERT ON THE EFFECTS OF BANKWETS.
My rewelations on the subjek of Toastes has brort me lots of corre-
findents. Sum on 'em arsks me if I was serous in my statements,
hy in coarse I was, tho' I'm
not much surprized at the
question. Why I remembers
wun ease as beat for down-
right imperance everythink as
I never herd on. The Chair-
man got up dreckly after
dinner and aoshally perposed
all the reglar Toastes all at
wunce! in wun full swoop, as
Beown said. It was at a
Copperashun Dinner too. Sum
of the yung fellers, of about
50 or 60, acshally larfed, but
the old 'uns shook their heds gravely. By the by, no wun in the jolly
Copperashun is considered as being old much hunder hayty.
Praps if I were arsked how it is as they lives so long and so jollily,
I cood a tale unfoald, but as I sumtimes has the idear of retiring from
my pressent perfeshun and starting as a consulting Feesishun for
adwising all peeple as particklar wants to live well and to live long,
how to do it, I wood rayther not unfoald that tale jest now.
I may praps add, that my xperience in that partickler line is
probberbly almost quite uneek, and in werry speshal cases of rich and
welthy and libberal old Gents as werry much wishes to live just a
few years longer, both in good elth and good spirits, I may be
priwetly hinsultea by letter addresst to the noffiss. It may estonish
sum peeple to hear that ony the summer before larst, when I was
offishiating on bord the Grand City Barge, I was told, and I bleeves
it, that in one squadreel as was being danced, the ages of the four
gennelmen who was a dancing amounted to werry nearly three
hundred years! and they all. had werry yung and werry pretty
partners.
One of the many results of my long xperience in the dining line is
the conwicshun that the werry finest aygester of a reelly scrumshous
Bankwet is Good Natur, or Good Temper, whichewer you likes to call
it. I can always tell by the tone and manner in which a Gent
addresses me at table, how he's a fitting on in that werry himportant
respek. If he speeks sharply or surlyly to me, I knows at wunce
wot's a goin on in his hunfortnite hinside, and I says to myself, ah!
if you had the good temper of a hold Citty Deputy, that patty of For
Grar wouldn't be a trubblin of you as it ewidently is, wile if he's
a good-tempered feller, he smiles at me when we cums to the werry
larst coarse, and says, "I'm not quite sure, Robert, as I wants any
more, but it reelly looks so nice that I thinks I '11 try jest a small
peace." And so he does, and then tosses off another bumper of his
speshal f avrit drink, and then Icons back in his chair smilin and appy
and full.
And what grand fellers sum men are after a reel good dinner! Sum
hignoramuses sumtimes wunders why, when sum of our werry
grandest charitys wants jest a helpin and to help 'em to keep up their
noble hinstitooshuns for all kinds of good and nobel hobjeks, they
begins by arsking a lot of people to dinner, and says wot a waist!
Bless their simple hignorance! Who nos, so well as we Waiters nos,
wot the effecs of a good dinner is, how it hopens the art, and unloosens
the tung, and unties the puss strings, and lets out the money. Why
many and many an old cormudgeon who never praps gave away a
suwerain to ewen a poor relashun when in his stnckly sober and
cawshus moments, after a reely grand dinner with plenty of fine old
Clicko Shampain or the driest Pummery in his estonished hinside,
will put down his name for five or ewen ten ginnys wen the fatal
paper cums round, and wen he nos that whatever 'he gives will be
enounced in a partickler lowd woice by the Lordly Tostmaster.
The horful pangs of regret when, the next morning^ he calls to his
fatal remembrance the wild hact of ginerosity of which he has bin
gilty owernite, is nuffin to me, and nuffin to the wise men who
founded the feast. Having dewoted nearly fourty years of my
waluable xistence to the study of mankind under these sumtimes
rayther trying suckemstances, I arrives at this result, — that
the one great nobjek to which all reelly sensibel peeple shood de-
wote themselves, supposing as they wishes to stand hi in the
opinyuns of others as well as their own, is to dewote their cheef
thorts, and their cheef study, to the eccomplishment of such a series
of reelly nobel Bankwets, as, both by their present enjoyments and
their subsekwent refieckshun, will shed an halo ower their mortal
xistence. Robert.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Deoembeb 29, 1888.

THE WESTMINSTER PLAY.
Smithicles, a wealthy and prosperous Athenian, is ordered to go
abroad by his medical adviser. Before doing so he entrusts the
guardianship of his House at "Westminster to his friend Goschenides,
and at the same time requests him to look after the doings of a spend-
thrift nephew named Churchiixio. He also bids Goschenides prose-
cute a law-suit, which he—Smithicles—and his friends have com-
menced against a foreigner called Osmanikos. All these commissions
Goschenides readily undertakes. No sooner, however, is Smithicles
safely abroad on his travels, than Chuechillio breaks into the
House at Westminster, snaps his fingers in the face of Goschenides
and his friend Stanhopis, and declares that the lawsuit against
Osmanikos ought at once to be abandoned, or a heavier fee paid to
the Counsel engaged. Mobi.es. a man who is not friendly to
Chubchillio, but is an enemy of Goschenides, joins in this demand;
and in his confusion, Goschenides drops his purse containing a Bill
on a Bank called " Employer's Liability "—which BiU is consequently
lost. Goschenides and his friends are, of course, very angry with
Chubchillio, who, on this occasion is supported by a number of poor
relations called Pabnelliti; when Habcoubtias, a comio slave,
interferes, seeing that Chubchillio and Mobles are going too far,
and assures them that a buried treasure (called " Popular Favour")
can only be obtained after a verdict against Osmanikos has been
pronounced. At the same time a Stcophanta (or Informer)
appears on the scene pretending that he has brought a message from
Smithicles ordering the suit against Osmanikos to be discontinued.
It so happens, however, that Smithicles—who has been enjoying
himself in Italy with an acquaintance named Gladstonides—sud-
denly returns in person to his House at Westminster, sends the
Stcophanta about his business, and gets (by the help of an able
advocate named Gbenpuellios) a verdict against Osmanikos.
Thereupon Mobles and Chubchillio apply to Cookion, an Athenian
agent for personally conducting traveUers to distant lands, and by
his aid are enabled to absent themselves for a time from Athens;
Mobles hastening to Naples to visit Gladstonides, and Chubchillio
seeking rest and recreation amid the inhabitants of Chili and Peru.
Thus all ends happily.

No more shall legal lore be turned to japes
And gibes, and scriptural terms" provoke the gapes.
Ask me no more!
Ask me no more, I hate the empty jeer.
The critic's hollow "cheek "—his cruel eye.
Great Scott! Oh, how I loathe his damning leer.
And when he chaffs—I'd like his Ruddigore,
I 'd love to see him weltering on the iloor!
Ask me no more!
Ask me no more. Never again I vow
Shall the crass critic lift his empty roar
At serious work of mine. And now.
I wish I'd vowed this vow befobk.
And kept to " Pirates "—{Patience, ruddy gore !)
Ask me no more! I
"The Old Mastebs' Album."—(Opinion of it by an
Old Musi*).—Mrs. Ram was much struck by this hand-
somely got-up photographic album. "Indeed," said the
good lady, "I do think it the finest book I've ever seen
for keeping photographs. I suppose its publishers
belong to some old City Guild; they generally do. my
dear," she explained to her Niece, and the Guild (a
named after some Saint." "Indeed, Aunt," returned
L.etitia, "to what Saint's Guild would this firm
belong?" "I don't absolutely know," replied Mr*. R.
reflectively, "but, I suppose, to the Guild of St
Albums."
BUMBLE ON BEER.
We all know Mr. Bumble's opinion on the results of indulging
paupers in meat. "Meat, Ma'am, meat," replied Bumble, with
stern emphasis—"you've overfed him, Ma'am. You've raised a
artificial soul and spirit in him, Ma 'am, unbecoming a person of his
condition; as the Board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical phi-
losophers, will tell you. What have paupers to do with soul or
spirit? It's quite enough that we let 'em have live bodies."
It might be reasonably inferred from this passage how far this
great and good man would have approved of Beer as a pauper
beverage. Punch feels tolerably sure that, were Mr. Bumble alive
to-day—as of course he is not—he would warmly commend the
"practical philosophy" shown by the Dolgelly Board of Guardians,
as lately recorded in a morning paper. A Guardian, we are told,
"offered to supply the paupers with a gratuitous cask of beer at
Christmas. Several Guardians demurred. Poverty was, they said,
created by drink, and it would be contrary to their duty to distribute
liquors amongst the men and women, many of whom were paupers
through drink. Ultimately the Board decided, by a majority, to
re/uie to accept the beer." What enlightened conscientiousness!
What self-denial! What wise consideration for others! Think of
the shocking and scandalous scenes that would certainly have been
enacted on Christmas Day in Dolgelly workhouse, had "a artificial
soul and spirit" been raised in those misguided, naturally high-
spirited paupers by the unwise indulgence of a glass of beer a-pieoe I
Thanks to the fostering care of their devoted Guardians, there is
now every reason to hope that the festivities',will be restrained within
becoming limits. If one Guardian was weak enough to offer beer,
the rest, it is pleasant at this season of universal charity and good-
will to note, had the strength of mind to reply, "Skittles!"
shakspeabe fob the season, (paterfamilias's version.)
There's a Yule-tide in the affairs of men
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to—indigestion I

Horrible Artillery Company?"

January.—On the 27th, in 1859,
the preeent German Emperor was
born. Consequently he is thirty
years old. So many anecdotes have
been told of His Majesty, that it is
difficult to find a new one. How-
ever, it may be interesting to note
that the Emperor, about ten years
ago. when he wa3 staying in.
Sydney. New South Wales, during
his honeymoon, was presented by
the German residents of that place
with a musical box, which played
only one tune. On learning this,
he tnmed round, and smilingly
observed to a courtier, " This may
be well called a musical box, as we
can never visit it for a change of
air!" The German residents of
Sydney laughed at the witticism,
but never forgave the sarcasm.

ANECDOTAGE FOR THE MONTHS.
February.—On the 18th of the
month, the late Charles Lamb
was bom as long ago as 1775. Had
he lived until now, he would have
reached the ripe old age of 114,
which would have certainly been
a prolonged life for a Lamb, or, if
it comes to that (to quote Dr.
Johnson), for a sheep either.
On the !)th (in 1667) Darnley
was murdered, and just twenty
years afterwards (on the 8th, in
1587) poor MARY, Queen of Scots,
was beheaded. It is only just to
the memory of Queen Elizabeth.
to assert that the cruel jest ascribed
to Her Majesty that " she had cut
off her cousin's head to prove to
the world that she had one," is
supposed to have been invented
some years before either Queen's
birth, by Will Somers, King
Henry VIII.'s reputed jester.

March.—On the 3rd of the month, in 1848, Locis
TuiLippi fled to England, where at first he was
treated with some discourtesy. On learning that the
name of his landing-place was Dover, he observed,
"I am not surprised to find that this is Dover, as I

EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF A DYSPEPTIC.
January 1.—Another dreary weary year to be lived through! Oh.
to be done with it all! Got as far as Club in afternoon. Walked
home despairing of Humanity. Considerable pain in epigastrium.
Query—internal!
Hbruary H.—Pairing time. No one pairs with Me! My doom to
drag through the melancholy days unloved, uncared-for, alone!
Remember passage in
some poet—forget
whom and exact lines
—but to effect that the
entire animal creation,
down to the very rab-
bits, had a mate, with
the single exception
of the poet himself.
Pathetic idea, and my
own case exactly. For-
tunately, I hold all
women in secret con-
tempt. Too depressed
for regular luncheon,
but snatched a Bath
bun and some ginger
ale at Confectioner's.
Wished I was dead
several times on way

patties especially good,

offensive worms are
the majority of the
people one meets—in
the streets, nothing
but hideous and malig-
nant faces—nowhere a
kindly look meets mine
—how I hate the
world! Call on the
Greens. Long talk
with Sabixa. Des-
cribed my lonely lot,
the singular fact that
no woman's lips have
ever yet murmured in
my ears the confession
that I was beloved.
Had not intended to
lead up to it—but
somehow find myself
engaged on coming
away. She is a charm-
ing girl — but it h
rather sudden. An en-
gagement must make
Kime difference in a
man's life, and I hate
changes. Melancholy
presentiment, which I can't shake off, that Love will bring no happi-
ness to Me. Possibly weather. Who can be blithe and hopeful without
blue 8ky, and warmth, and the blessed sunshine?
April. — Still engaged to Sabixa. The mockery of cloudless skies,
and soft breezes, when there is no Spring in the heart. Cucumbers in
season again. Uneasy about self. Pimple on left cheek — is it the pre-
cursor of some disfiguring eruption? Horrible to be unsightly to all
the world, and to Sabixa! Now I shall test her affection. Consult
Doctor-prescribes "exercise and green food."
May.—Really affecting interview with Sabina. Begged her to
visit my tomb at 1-ast once a day, suggested that she might stay in
town for purpose, this year, at all events. Have an idea that she did
not acquiesce with entire cheerfulness. Can she be selfish 1 New and

May.—On the 10th, in 1796, occurred the Battle of Lodi, memorable
for the only recorded attempt of Napoleon Buonaparte at an
English witticism. Referring to the use he made of his artillery,
after the engagement, he said, "Good nameg for flghtee—firee, firee,

June.—On the 4th, in 1859, the Battle of Magenta was fought, and
appropriately gave its name to a popular dye. On the 15th, in 1215.
Magna Charta was sealed, when, according to Macaulay (in his
unpublished MS.), King John produced the wax. On the 18th the
Battle of Waterloo was fought, in 1815, when Wellington, meeting
Blucher at the end of the engagement, is reported to have observed,
"My Lord, this will be a great day for our boots !"—a prophecy veri-

July.—On the 4th the Independence of the United States was
declared, in 1776, since when the day has been observed by Americans
in commemorating their escape from everything British save the
Irish Vote. On the 30th, in 11589, Derry was relieved, to the great
surprise of William the Third, who, in his quaint Anglo-Dutch,
observed, with a 6mile, that " at dirst he was Derryfied!"
August.—On the 1st, in 1798, the Baitle of the Nile was fought,
when Nelson produced (after years of patient preparation) his
celebrated classical witticism. "Can you tell me, my Lord," said Lady
Hamilton, " anything about your latest victory?" "Oh, Madam,"
returned the hero,11 it was just nothing. Nihil— nothing —Nile!"
September.—The 1st is usually known as the feast of St. Partridge,
although it is really the fete day of St. Giles, and, equally popular,
(as once sportively observed by Wilberforce, the philanthropist and
jester) of St. James. This is a great month with accountants, who
devote an entire day to the Leger with a running account. On the 20th
the anniversary of the Battle of the Alma recalls the now half-forgotten
jeu d'esprit of the present head of the British Army. Pointing to the
officers of the Guards, Lord Raolan observed, " Our victory is attribu-
table to their gallantry in a great degree," "A great degree ?" repeated
H.R.H. with emphasis, "certainly—this is neither Oxford nor
Cambridge, and yet here is their Alma mater I"
October.—On the 16th, in 1834, the Houses of Parliament were
burnt, ending appropriately, however (as was observed by Joseph
Miller, wit and centenarian) in smoke. On the 20th, in 1876, the
Deanery of Chichester went off the (P.) Hook. On the 25th, the Battle
of Agincourt (or as it was anciently pronounced, A-gin-court) was
