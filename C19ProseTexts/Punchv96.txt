Juki 29, 1889.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SCENE—A Glade in the New Forett. [Mr. Punch discovered seated under the tpreading bought of a tree, with only ToBr and a
tankard for " the best of all good companie."
Mr. Punch {sings). "Under the gTeenwood tree, "Come hither, come hither, come hither;
Who loves to lie with me, Here shall he see
And tune his merry note No enemy,
Unto the sweet bird's throat, But winter and rough weather."
A Voice. More, more, I pr'ythee, more!
Mr. Punch. What, my fine, fantastical, forest-haunting moraliser, my Burton in trunk-hose, my well-beloved Melan-
choly Jaques, is it you? Welcome, I say, welcome! Though surely you have lost your way, like other rambling ruminants,
for this is the New Forest, not the Forest of Arden, and it is—or was lately—haunted, not by the gentle Duke and his com-
rades, but by the fat Knight—him of Malwood, not of Windsor or Eastcheap—and his Grand Old Guest.
Jaques. Tis a far cry from Arden to Hawarden, and he who would devote holiday hours in mid-June to railways,
not ruminating, to perorating, not placidity, is scarce a man to my mind. "He is too disputable for my company."
Mr. Punch. Why, verily, your maxim, " 'Tis good to bo sad and say nothing," would hardly commend itself to
William the un-Silent. Now I am taking it easy, under the shade of boughs not melancholy in their beautiful Juno leafiness,
but "far from the madding crowd," and from Parliament, Morning Papers, the Special Commission, Portland Weddings, and
all other forms of modish plaguiness and palaver.
Jaques. The wiser you. You are the latter-day Touchstone of this bosky wilderness, " a rare fellow, good at anything,
who uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and, under the presentation of that, shoots his wit"
Mr. Punch. Well, well, you need not be shot standing. Pr'ythee be seated, Jaques, if—if you are not hindered, like
Mauley's spectre, by circumstances beyond your control; and drink—if there's a passage in your ghostly throat.
Jaques. For this cool tipple—yes. Iced Champagne Cup was not known in Arden; 'tis one thing in which you have
the better of us. Could the hungry and angry Orlando now rush in upon our feast, he might almost be excused for some
"strong enforcement" in his resolve to share it.
Mr. Punch. We have our Orlandos yet, Jaques.
"The thorny point
Of bare distress hath ta'en from them the show
Of smooth civility."
But they are to be found in City slums rather than in woodland glades, and would muster menacingly in Trafalgar Square
rather than in a forest opening. Poor souls! they need my genial ministrations.
"Invest me in my motley: give me leave
To speak my mind, ana I will through and through
Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world.
If they will patiently receive my medicine.
Dost remember the words, Jaques?

iv PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [June 29, 1889.
Jaques. Ay, and the chiding which they earned me from the good Duke. Dukes do not chide you, meseems.
Mr. Punch. They durst not; though sometimes I chide them, when, par exemple, they snub our young Volunteers,
block our City ways, or make mere impassable middens of our markets.
Jaques. Happy autocrat! You have that for which I yearned when I 6aid—
"I must have liberty
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
To blow on whom I please."
Mr. Punch. Nay, not so happy either—always. I was thinking, when you appeared, ot the myriads of misery-stricken
creatures, " in populous city pent," to whom one peep of this green, purple-pied glade would be as a glimpse of heaven, yet to
whom callous capitalists; harpy-landlords, jerry-builders, and sweaters, aided half-consciously by selfish swells and lax legis-
lators, would deny the breathing-room of a few " open spaces."
Jaques. Is't so, indeed? There is matter in that for much musing.
Mr. Punch. And more action. You, mine ancient Motley-wearer, mused too much, and too much moralised. The
fool in the forest, who sat and railed on Lady Fortune in good set terms, was perhaps hardly less wise, or less useful, than the
mock-melancholy Court-Gentleman who flouted him.
Jaques. Well chidden, in faith. I hope the Dukes, and other peccant personages, relish the 6tyle of your chastening!
Mr. Punch. Sir, I am but lately back from the huge Paris Show, the sky-soaring Tower, the square miles of marvels,
the ant-like myriads of swarming sight-seers. And now I am—save for your presence and my faithful Toby—alone in the
forest. And there as here, here as there, my thoughts are with the toil-tied millions for whose bleared eyes are no " sights"
whether of sweet Nature or wonder-working Art. The pent-up forces of grinding poverty are as the unseen lava underlying
all this glad world of greenery, and all that social world of grandeur. There, Jaques, is a theme after your own heart,—
but which I must treat after mine own manner.
Jaques. Proceed! proceed! I do love melancholy better than laughing.
Afr. Punch. So do not I. Like Rosalind, " I had rather have a fool to mane me merry than experience to make me
sad "—moonily and purposelessly sad. 'Tis not melancholy mooniness or aimless mordancy that will make the World patiently
receive the medicine of the Motley Moralist, my Jaques.
Jaques. How then, O rarer fellow than Touchstone, commend you the chalice of your wisdom to the hps of folly?
Mr. Punch. Not with infusion of rue or savour of sorrel. Like this "Cup," which you seem so to appreciate, the
tonic draught of the Motley teacher should be cool, not fiery, piquant indeed, but not all tarts and bitters.
Jaques. "I pr'ythee, pretty youth (for, in faith, despite years, you are both youthful and pretty), let me be better
acquainted with thee," I would know more of the greatest of Motley Moralists and his mode.
Mr. Punch. Verily? Then 'twere churlish to refuse you. I must now be off to London instanter. But I '11 leave
you my quintessential self for society in these sweet forest ways. You '11 find it better worth ruminating upon than the
dial-bearing fool, or even the poor wounded deer. It contains my wisdom and illustrates its modus. If ever you 're tempted
again into town ways, and care to turn up at my Fleet Street Sanctum, you shall be welcomed. Meanwhile, for cheering
and edifying companionship, I leave you my

THEME WITH VARIATIONS.
Seated to-day at the organ,
Ready to play what you please,
I (faze like an infinite Gorgon,
Till you feel hardly at ease.
Hark to the sough of the bellows
Storing harmonious gales,
When the pipes speak to their fellows—
"Well, I will play you the Scales.
Out of this simple material
Music's vast multitude throngs,
Festal and plagal and ferial,
Operas, dirges, and songs.
Here is a clue to unravel,
Here is a theme never fails;
A Switchback unending to travel
Over the smooth-running Scales.
Hark, how we rush up the gamut,
A ladder in fieriest need;
And now, like a hind who says, "Dam ut!"
We play very low down indeed.
Up, like a storm-beaten packet,
Down, and the passenger pales:
Here comes the steward, thro' the racket—
Gaily I play you the Scales.
Off goes the right hand, convulsively,
Up to the manual's end;
Left hand pursues it impulsively,
Like an unauthorised friend.
Fashion's caprices may criticise
Aught of its standard that fails;
Fearing scorn's finger nor pity's eyes,
Boldly I practise the Scales.
This is a wedding march—trousseau,
Presents, and favours, and rice;
Now 'tis the Dream of a Rousseau
Changed to a waltz in a trice.
Thus, unencumber'd, indefinite,
Each his own melody hails,
Each sees the hand of a chef in it,
Safe in the haven of Scales.
Some may interpret them leatherly,
Thunder of fort and of fleet;
Others will warble them weatherly,
Milkmaid and ferry complete;
Vesperish, cloister'd. and choirsome,
Heimweh with mill-wheels and dales,
Frankly unmeaning and tiresome,
All are embraced by the Scales.
Trade, with its spacious surroundings,
Spices, and bullion, and bales,
Argosies, sinkings, and soundings,
Postage for far-away mails;
Justice with eyes in a bandage,
Fish who are chivied by whales—
Ah, you might live to a grand age
Ere you could play out the Scales.
Beenxus and Rome, and its history,
Alpenstocks, axes, and veils,
Dragons and creatures of mystery
Swingeing their horrible tails.
Jockey, and boxer, and rower,
Men who climb walls out of gaols,
Butterflies bother that blower!
He's let the wind out of the Scales!
NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS.
Lord Salisbury.—To be more cautious in
my expressions, more temperate in my judg-
ments, and generally more reticent all round.
Mr. Gladstone. — To fire away at Home
Rule, hammer and tongs, as hard as ever,
and keep it up red-hot till an unexpected
flare-up somewhere gives me a chance of
cutting in, and, by hook or crook, carrying
my point.
Mr. W. H. Smith. — To let myself be
quietly effaced, and imperceptibly yield my
position as Leader of the House to my bland
and amiable friend Goschen.
Mr. Goschen.—To gracefully and stealthily
eclipse and Bupplant my revered and re-
spected colleague, Mr. W. H. Smith.
Mr. Stanhope.—To hit upon some soheme
by which, with or without the aid of the
Department, I may, within the next ten
years, hope to make good the deficiency of
funs at the present moment experienced
eenly by both the Servioes.
Lord George Hamilton.—To calm and
appease public opinion by a further flourish
over fresn "Manoeuvres, and to lull Lord
( 'ii milks into quietude by showing him (on
paper), what gigantic efforts I am making to
put the Navy into proper condition.
M. de Lesseps.—To save my own vanity
from disastrous defeat by appealing to the
vanity of mv fellow countrymen to bolster it
up by contributing £20,000,000 for the pur-
pose.
General Boulanger.—To get into the Dic-
tator's chair, somehow, and then watch to
see which way the National Cat means to
jump.
Prince Bismarck.—To take care that not a
halfpenny out of the Imperial Exchequer
is wasted over this East African Business, but
to see that it is nevertheless backed up by the
assistance of my pliant and accommodating
friend, Salisbury.
Mr. Balfour.—To keep the whip-hand of
that rascally pack of bloodhounds, the Irish
Party in the House of Commons.
The Irish Party in the House of Com-
mons.—To lose no opportunity for yelping,
growling, and snarling at that miserable cur,
the Irish Secretary.
The Chief Commissioner of Police.—To
take care that, now I've got fairly into
Waeren's boots, I don't manage to " put my
foot in it" quite so often as he did.
Mr. Irving.—Not to cut short the run
of my newly-mounted "Macbeth" at the
Lyceum, till the public shout to me, "Hold!
Enough!"

GOOD RESOLUTIONS FOR 1889.

Mr. Punch {to John Hull.) "Now, John, Youn Kikst Mem—As Epficikxt Navt.
Wh at! opening your new Diary, dear Bull?
Well, at this special season " we all do it."
Strange things may happen ere that book is full!
One " resolution " make, or you will rue it.
Meras: many will, no doubt, till the first page;
Things to be done, avoided, altered, mended;
But whatsoe'er to settle you engage,
Whatever's to be saved or be expended,
Take Mr. Punch's most particular " tip,"—
That 'tis a wise one you may take your davy—
The first resolve, never to be let slip,
Should be this.—" Mem:—Get an Efficient Navt!!!"
"Hashin." — Instead of, going to the Handoub district, our
cavalry have gone on an aimless skirmish in the direction of
Hashin, a name of ill omen, for we 're always hashin' our Egyptian
business.
• Who Said It ?—I don't know, but it is worth recording here. My
authority was Edmundus Ed. Mundi. An old stager, laudator (era-
pom Macreadi, remarked that Henry Ihvino did not possess the
physique necessary for the part of Macbeth. '' He has Sh aksfeake's
authority for doing without it," was Somebody's reply; "for doesn't
he make Macbeth himself exclaim, 'Throw physique to the dogs, I '11
none of it!'" Lovely! says

PUNCli, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.

Little Herbert Campbell as Cupid.
"Tell me, my heart.
Can this be Love?"
DRURIOLANUS TRIUMPHANS.
En iterum Druhiolanus !" Here we are again," and better than
ever! How can Druriolanus beat his own record? The domain of
, Pantomime is co - extensive
\ Lrf®**?^ / the fertile realms of
boundless imagination, and
though there are only a few
well-known themes of universal
fame, yet the variations on
them and the possibilities of
combinations and permutations
are well nigh infinite. A more
splendid and in every sense a
better Pantomime than The
Babes in the Wood has not
been seen for years at Drury
Lane. The Toy Scene alone
would well repay a visit, so
full of fancy and humour is it.
But for picturesqueness and
splendour it is eclipsed by the
Birds' Paradise, and for the
fun of this scene there is Mr.
Harrt Nicholls as premiere
danseuse, and Mr. Herbert
Campbell as Cupid with a
bow and arrow. In the bird
scene, group succeeds group until the exclamations'' How beautiful!"
"How pretty!" "How exquisite!" "How graceful!" became
wearisome by repetition, and one sits "in amazement lost" at the
fertility of the design and the perfection of its execution. Then
Madame Katti Lanner comes smilingly forward, and curtseys her
grateful acknowledgments, clearly intimating that, "By strict
attention to business, she means to deserve the continued favour of
the admiring public." When this clever lady has retired to the
wing whence she directs the movements of her numerous pupils,
the discriminating public insist on the Founder of the Feast
presenting himself before them to receive their unanimous verdict
of highest possible approval. Recognising the fitness of things,
Druriolanus is too old a bird to appear among the gorgeous
Cockatoos, Golden Pheasants, Humming-birds, and the rest of the
glittering feathered tribe, nor will he come in under Katti Lanner's
wing,—the^proscenium wing,—but waits for the change of scene to a
Baronial Hall, and then he
enters and bows, beaming,
hopeful, and so far satisfied, as
a man may well be who has
done his very best to please
his patrons; and then on we go
agam, with that Dog of Lauri's
—a poodle this time—full of
amusing antics, with Dan Leno,
capital as the Wicked Aunt,
and Victor Stevens severely
humorous aB the Wicked Uncle.
The topics of the day are lightly
touched upon, and Mr. G." as
a Wood-cutter, who is ready to
make a speech without axe-ing,
is recognised with mixed
greetings.
As for the ladies, they are all
like the ladies of Mr, Pick-
Kick's time in Ba-ath, where,
as the mincing M.C. observed,
"There was nobody old or
ugly." All young and lovely,
of course. Miss Harriet Ver-
non "semper viret," as bold
Robin Hood should be; Miss
Florence Dtsart is never
dysartened, except when away _
from Robin Hood: and, when Druriolanus gives Z7<» Bairn, dear little
she meets his glance, it is a case £1987 N"*0."9 and »*<*t httle
of Hood-winking her. Miss „ _ Bfrtle a.n «™«-
Maggie Duggan is sprightly He loTe8 both W18ely and t0° wheel!
beyond imaggienation: little .JSnea, so "iE-near, and yet so far,"
"Up above their .heads so high, like a fairy in the fly"—and a
whole bevy of smiling beauties, besides a lot of "sweet little mites"
from Katti Lanner's Nursery Grounds, who must not be omitted
from this mitey Kattilogue. The Ruffians are bold, resolute, and
sanguinary, while the music, being killing, makes the work of
Slaughter complete.
There is not a single scene which is not picturesque and effective.
The Forest scenes t»y Messrs. Perkins, Kantsky, and Caret—an

uncanny or uncaney name for little school-hoys to meet with in
holiday time—are charming. The Palace of Games by Julian Hicks
is splendid. Once more,'' Bravo
Hicks!" Ryan's Paradise of
Birds is brilliant, and Emden's
Transformation Scene is mag-
nificent, and extending over
the whole stage, cannot be
spoken of as an 'Emmed-in
Scene! (Oh!) At last Harry
Payne came on the stage with
"Here we are again!" and ho

bell, will not exhaust the treasures and the pleasures of this
great Pantomime, put together by the veteran E. L. Blanchard,
the playwright, Harry Nicholls the Joiner, and Augustus
Druriolanus Trtumphans.

TO A THOUGHTFUL LADY.
[On her sending me, as an invalid, a year of months, weeks, and days on
cards, inclosed in a handsome upstanding frame of burnished steel.]
Another Year! No. not a week
Of suffering 1 1 declare it.
The gift at no one's hands I'd seek,
Unless were added the physique
Courageously to bear it.
And you have given me, fair dame,
A brand new year. You 've bought it.
But you've been careful all the same
To add a strong and splendid frame
Of steel, which can support it.
DREAMS FOR THE NEW YEAR.
The ('zar of Russia.—A contented people and a solvent Exchequer.
The Emperor of Germany.—Government and the effacement
of the Bismarcks.
King of Italy.—X really united Italy and an invitation to the
Vatican.
The Emperor of Austria,—A pleasant family gathering of hus-
band, wife, and son.
The King of Spain.—A comfortable rocking-horse in a cheerful
nursery.
President Carnot.—The final disappearance of General Boulaxgee.
Prince von Bismarck.—A quiet time with a new and sensational
young master.
M. le Baron de Lesseps.—The completion of the Panama Canal.
The Khedive of Egypt.—The capture of the Madiii and Osman
Digna.
Lord Salisbury.—A prosperous ending to the Anglo-German Part
nership.
Mr. W. H. Smith.—A run of luck at Monte Carlo, and a coronet
in another place.
Mr. Balfour.—Peace and quiet in Ireland and the House of
Commons.
Mr. Ooschen.—A Budget that will be popular with everybody.
Lord Wantage.—A satisfactory substitute for Wimbledon.
Mr. Gladstone.—Furnished apartments in Downing Street.
Sir Wm. Vernon Harcourt.—The reversion of the Leadership.
Mr. Joseph Chumberlain.—K Testimonial from the Members of
the National Liberal Club.
Mr. Commissioner-of-Police Monro. — Intelligence in Scotland
Yard.
The Lord Mayor.—A Knighthood, and the thanks of those who
admire the "equestrian element."
The Hon. Artillery Company.—The return of the Prince and
the Duke without the Adjutant.
The Metropolitan Board of Works.—A costly Monument, erected
by public subscription in its honour.
The Parnell Commissioners.—The end of their labours before 1890.
And the Public Generally.—A Happier Year than 1888.

LE MONDE OU L'ON S'ENNUIE.
(Enter General and Mrs. Borington Smythe.)
Mrs. Stodgbury (Hostess). "How do you do, dear? I'm sorry to say the Sparkleuy Kniohts have disappointed us at
THE LAST MOMENT—AND YET I SPKCULLY WROTE AND TOLD THRM THEY WERE OOINQ TO MEET YOU AND THE GENERAL 1"
HIS FIRST APPEARANCE.
Hey presto! Time, the Thaumaturge,
Once more at his old occupation,
And posted at the morning's verge,
Essays his prestidigitation.
Hey presto! As he turns the glass,
The magic mists make rapid clearance,
And as the shadows part and pass,
The Young Year makes his hrst appearance.
His first debut on any stage;
And few performers, it is certain,
At such a very early age
Await the lifting of the curtain.
From darkness shaping into light,
An inexperienced adolescent,
The Fast in smoke-wreaths takes its flight,
And leaves him fronting the glad Present.
Glad? Well, to fresh unfrightened youth
The actual is ever gleesome.
The prick of pain, the sting of truth,
The ruthless sweep of sorrow's besom,
Are strange to him; but could he task
The memory of that Necromancer,
Not each gay question Youth miirht ask
Would have from Age a hopeful answer.
He will not ask; he too must live
And learn, and prove, and dare, and surfer.
Brave boyhood's buoyancy who'd give
For sapience of the dull old buffer?
Wisdom s a yoke, and Wit a joke,
And Power a vision swiftly flying;
These too shall end at last in smoke,
Like the Old Year in darkness dying.
Hey presto! Here's the youngling Year,
Fresh from the tripod and the censer.
Before his face the shadows clear,
Behind his back the mists grow denser.
Bodings avaunt! A festal chaunt
Brfits fresh friends at their first meeting;
Croakings the youngster shall not daunt,
We '11 hail him with a hopeful greeting.
Old Edax Rerum may devour,
But the old fellow still begetteth.
Sunrays still pierce the clouds that lour,
Summer still dries what Winter wetteth.
The watchers at a New Year's birth
Should not too tamely bow to sorrow,
But hail the boy with manly mirth,
And hopefully await the morrow.
TAKEN TO PIECES.
Dear Jack,—I promised you when we said
good-bye at old Birch's to let you know
how I was getting on in London. Fact is, I
have been taking the Governor about a good
deal. He's been with me here, there, and
everywhere. On Boxing-Day he went to
two pantomimes, and I expected to have
fairly tired him out. However, it seemed to
do him good, and at Drury Lane he actually
wanted to wait out the afterpart" of the
Babes in the Wood, but of course I could not
quite stand that, so I took him off, and gave
him a few oysters and a glass of stout in
Maiden Lane where you can get such things
to perfection. The Governor said it was a
shame not to stop and see Mr. Payne, who
was most amusing and always made him
laugh when he got hold of the wrong end
of the red-hot poker. But the Governor,
although an excellent fellow in his way,
is rather old-fashioned in his tastes, and
doesn't move with the times as quickly as I
do. See?
The very day I came home, I looked in at
the German Reeds', where they have a first-
rate entertainment. It is called The Bo'tun's
Mate, and when I tell you that Mr. Alfred
German Reed is the Mate, you may be sure
there's lots of fun in it. Miss Fanny Hol-
land (who the Governor declares grows
younger with every "illustration") was also
first-rate. Mr. Corney Grain, too, sang one
of his capital songs, taking everybody off,
and making us all roar. When I say he
took "everybody " off, I don't mean he took
me off! If he had, I don't think I should
have laughed so much. See?
No more at present. Off to see Hengler's
and Irving's Macbeth. Yours, Bob.
The Lady Macbeth Puzzle.
Some say she was meant to be thin,
Some say she was meant to be fat;
Some say she was meant to be this,
Some say she was meant to be that.
But, whatever William meant her to be,
She is, for the present, a Mys-Terree.
What the Clown doesn't want Nowa-
days.—" A magnificent opening."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[January 5, 1889.

ANGLERS TO THE FRONT!
Passing the other day down Cheapside, I saw the Lord Mayor in
his handsome State Carriage, with his two protecting outriders, in
the shape of mounted Policemen, looking as if they had him in
charge. He was accompanied by a gentleman wearing a bearskin
hat, and armed with a remark-
ably long Sword, whioh, I was
afterwards informed, was
never drawn except in the
presence of Royalty, and
whioh, being of English manu-
facture, was never known to
bend under any amount of
pressure that its somewhat
stalwart Bearer could bring to
bear upon it. His Lordship's
other companion was a toll
"Mm n(.,r h« Owners » y°-U?g «e^eman' of «>mewhat
Kipe-pear-ian owners, aristocrat™ appearance, who
curried what is called a gold Mace, which I learned was the very
identioal weapon with whioh the Lord Mayor of Walworth slew
Wat Tyler, several years ago. Having a leisure hour or two, I
followed his Lordship into Guildhall, and found a seat in the gallery
of the exceedingly beautiful Council Chamber that the Common
Councilman have lately built for themselves, or possibly for their
successors. Absit omen!
The first thing that arrested my attention was the appearance of
His Grace the Duke of Westminster, and some three or four other
illustrious swells, who came to ask the City to assist them in secur-
ing " North Woolwich Gardens "—well, but not favourably, known,
when under the management of " the People's Caterer "—as an open
n» for the enjoyment of the natives of what was described as the
riest and most dismal portion of the whole Metropolis. His
Graoe, with his illustrious friends, were allowed to sit on the dais
among the Aldermen, at which they all seemed much pleased, and
listened with much apparent respect to all the proceedings. A Mem-
ber, apparently of the Hebrew persuasion, cross-questioned his
Graoe as to the probable oost of maintaining the said Gardens when
secured as proposed, and which duty the Corporation was requested
to undertake, to whioh his Grace replied "a mere trifle." But his
questioner was not satisfied with that reply, observing, as I thought,
with great intelligence, as well as courage, that what might be con-
sidered a trifle to a Noble Duke, "rich beyond the dreams of avarioe,"
might be a considerable annual expenditure to a Corporation some-
what impoverished by the suspending of the Coal Dues: but his
Grace, smilingly observing that a few hundreds a year would be all
that would be required, the bold Hebrew sat down satisfied.
After His Grace's departure, a well-dressed young fellow appeared
at the Bar of the Court and presented a Petition to which I listened
with as much surprise as admiration. It appeared that the Petitioner
was, like myself, a lover of the "Gentle Art," and after having
for some years past been aocustomed to devote his few holidays to
fishing in the beautiful upper waters of the River Thames, he had
some time since been ordered by a certain Ripepearian owner, as he
was somewhat strangely termed,—probably an aristocratio name for
a fruit-grower—to cease from his accustomed sport in the neighbour-
hood, as far as I could understand it, of Messrs. M \ru: and Dur-
ham's well furnished establishment, on pain of fine or imprisonment.
The good-looking young fellow had boldly defied the would-be Ripe-
pearian tyrant, and, the law being invoked against him, he had suc-
cessfully defended his right on three several occasions, but a fourth
trial being now about to take place, he, having already expended
hundreds of pounds of his own money in defending a great public
right, now naturally sought the assistance of the old Corporation to
help him to carry on his great struggle. An ancient City Deputy,
who announced himself to be a Thames Conservative, supported the
prayer of the petition, and explained that the Ripepearian owners of
the Thames, strange to say, not content with themselves enjoying
the River that flowed past their beautiful Lawns, seemed really to
hate the very sight of any of the mere Public who sought to share
their enjoyment, and actually claimed to possess its very bed and
soil, on the somewhat silly plea that whenever the River ceased to
flow, or in other words ran dry, the said bed and soil would then
legally be theirs.
The Thames Conservative mocked at their claim, and proposed
adjourning all consideration of it until this event happened, at the
same time he demonstrated its palpable absurdity by stating that the
Conservatives were constantly giving permission to persons to dredge
away portions of the bed of the River whioh were token away by
them and sold, without the slightest notice being taken of the so-
called rights of Ripepearians. Besides, even this monstrous claim
had nothing to do with the rights of Anglers, as if there were no
water of course there could be no fish, and no grasping Sourapple-
arian had as yet claimed the water.
It was also stated that sometimes, when the patient and contem-
plative Angler was pursuing his harmless, but exciting occupation,
possibly being drenched to the skin by one of those welcome showers
whioh have the strange efieot of making fish both hungry and reck-
less, a fiend in the shape of a Ripepearian would shout to him from
the shore to be off; and if, as usually happened, he declined to obey
the stern mandate, the fiend in question, who was generally accom-
panied by a large Newfoundland dog, would throw a stick near the
Angler's punt, and send his dog in to fetoh it, thereby spoiling all
sport for hours to come.
The loud applause with which the Petition was received, and re-
ferred to a Committee to consider the whole question, sent me away
smiling and happy, and with a higher opinion of the jolly City
Fathers than I had previously entertained, which was even increased
when I afterwards neard that they had come to the resolution to
assist the Petitioner in his great battle of Right against Might, an
example which, I trust, will be followed by every Angling Associa-
tion in the Metropolis.
I got a portion^ of my information from the City Beadle, who,
although armed with the customary Stick of Power, was very civil
and communicative to me. Joseph Greenhorn.
A NAPLES JOURNAL-IST.
Villa Roccabella.—Here I am at last in sunny Italy! Nasty
journey. Heard of Colchester Election just before starting. Depres-
sing, though these occasional deviations from oommon sense on part
of constituencies must be expected, I suppose.
No end of a reception at Station. Made 'em a speech, however.
Ended up with " Evviva Napoli!" Populace immensely pleased.
Next Day.—Lovely sunshine. Cheering letter from Morlky,
assuring me that Colohester Election due to local influences. So I
thought. Bulk of Colchester populace intensely Home-Rule, he says:
but Unionists had all the public-houses, and drowned natural voice
of constituency in floods of gratuitous liquor. If so, the " flowing
tide" seems to be with our opponents! Must be in good spirits to
joke like this. Am in good spirits. Question is—shall I go up
Vesuvius to-day, run over to Rome and see Pope, or Humbert,
or visit Ruins of Pompeii?
Afternoon. — Walk along Posilippo and into town. Gratifying
enthusiasm of populace when they see me—especially lazzaroni, who
are becoming almost a nuisanoe. No more coppers left. Seem to
think, because I've been Prime Minister, I carry the Bank of Eng-
land about with me. But the " vivas" are constant. Must look up
local baptismal registers. Am I quite sure I was born in Scot-
land? Feel that at the very least a near ancestor must have been a
Neapolitan.
Day After.—Vesuvius? No: reminds one too much of Dizzy's
"mot" about the "row of extinot volcanoes." Capri? That's
where Tiberius lived when he sent the "verbose and long epistle"
to the Senate that doomed Sejanus, isn't it? Hem! Feel almost
tempted to imitate Tiberius—but who is my Sejanus? Harcourt?
Hartington? On the whole decide to defer Capri visit to another
day, as weather rather capri-oious. Fancy that " mot" cuts out
Dizzy's, though /don't profess to be a humorist.
Third Day.—To-day feel muoh friskier; so shall go over to Isohia!
(Dizzy nowhere again!) Delightful island, except for occasional
earthquakes. A good way from Italian mainland, so certainly ought
to have Home Rule I Ask Syndic if he wouldn't like a Local Par-
liament? Syndic says " earthquakes bad enough, but a Parliament
would ruin the island." Asks me not to mention the idea to anyone.
Evidently a bigoted Unionist. On return, some lazzaroni (who are
dissatisfied, apparently, with extent of my largesses), shout out.
"Viva Salisbury!" Awkward. Shan't look up baptismal
register. Think I shall go on to Florence soon.
Fourth Day.—Florence? No. Naples for ever! My Neapolitan
ancestry now beyond doubt. ViBit from Municipal Deputation,
assuring me that the cause of Ireland is also the cause of Italy.
Wish me to tell "Signor Parnelli" so, when I see him, and to
accept illuminated address which they bring with them, calling me
"The Liberator of the Captive." Allusion to Bomba, I suppose.
Tell them in reply that Naples is the most beautiful eity I ever saw,
and its Municipality more enlightened than any in the world. Keep
Syndio to lunch; tells me confidentially that they've got an in-
stitution in Naples very like the Land League." Called "the
Camorra." Don t encourage Syndic to go on in this strain. Evidently
doesn't understand English politics much. Sitting up to write
pamphlet which will astonish the Romans.

LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP."
(T/u Horse did, and this is the E'sult.)
CHRISTMAS ON VIEW IN 1988.
(Dictated by Prophetic Phonograph.)
My dear King Punch,
Yoce Majesty having expressed a wish to learn how we
spent our Christmas, I hasten to comply with your Royal desire. "We
decided to throw ourselves hack a century, and in spite of our ad-
vanced civilisation, to follow as much as possible the rude habits of
our semi-barbarian ancestors. In fact, your Majesty, we proposed
living through the season as it was lived one hundred years ago —that
is to say, in 1888.
Dispensing with our self-conveying post-bags, we employed some
men (at an enormous expense, for nowadays everything, as you
know, is done by thought-electricity)—to carry certain hideous paste-
boards round to our sky palaces. These hideous pasteboards a century
since were known as Christmas cards, and were remarkable for the
most grotesque designs. Some of them seemed to have been intended
to be amusing, for they displayed pictures of candles, old gloves, and
tattered paper. We were able to secure quite an assortment for
models, but, I am sorry to say, they did not please even the children,
who you will remember, are better artists than Raphael, Cope, R. A.,
and even that glorious light of the nineteenth century Professor
Sir BALDWiN-LEianTON. Here I may note that contemporary records
seem to suggest that Professor Sir Baldwin-Leighton was not only
an artist but also a gentleman who used to drop from the clouds in
a parachute.
Having examined our Christmas Cards (after trying hard to dis-
cover a cause for their use), we had breakfast, absolutely taking with
our tea a mixture of milk and sugar, as if we were eating beef! It was
then time to go to Church, and I need scarcely say we went, although
it seemed rather senseless leaving our telephones idle, where we had
only to sit before them, and listen to any sermon in the world with-
out moving from our own fire-grass side! But our ancestors were
wont to go to Church, and so did we. My aunt—my maiden aunt—
insisted that the chief object of our visit should be to examine the
bonnets of our neighbours. I fancy this is putting our earnestness a
little low, but certainly our predecessors were fond of display.
Returning from Churoh, we had what used to be called a "chil-
dren's early dinner," which I fancy in ages gone by must have been
rather a ghastly affair. We had the baby brought down by a genuine
old-fashioned nurse, and took it by turns to praise it after the olden
fashion. The infant was much disgusted, having just taken a double
First at Oxford. However by promising him a treatise upon mixed
mathematics we kept him quiet.
After dinner we had a representation of what used to be called a
Christmas Pantomime. Therein appeared a hideous monster with
cheeks daubed with red, a feeble and corrupted old gentleman, a bold-
faced hussy dancing about in the most idiotic fashion, and lastly, a
lanky trifler wearing spangles! Then an ancient policeman was
introduced, and the monster struck him across the knees with a
seemingly red-hot poker! I was absolutely ashamed that such an
exhibition should have been seen by my innocent children! How-
ever I am told that in "the good old times" (save the mark!) this
brutal buffoonery used to be rewarded with great applause!
After this, we liad what was called a " grown-up dinner," when all
our relations gathered together to devour some underdone beef, and a
fearfully indigestible comestible called " plum-pudding." A doctor,
who was present, warned us to eat neither, saving that he would not
answer for the consequences. However, my Uncle Bob persevered,
and hasn't been the same man since—which some of his relatives say
is rather an advantage than otherwise.
Now all this time we were feeling strange,—this kind of Christmas
was so entirely unlike that to which we are now accustomed, when
suddenly Aunt Maria accused Cousin Whitechapel of having un-
duly influenced Uncle Jeremiah in the making of his will. In a
moment we [all were talking in the angriest tones conceivable.
Brothers abused sisters, fathers mothers, and children parents. We
nearly came to blows. Suddenly I remembered reading of a similar
incident in 1888. I held up my hand for silence, and, having
secured it, delivered the following speech: —
"My good friends," said I, "we made up our minds to go back a
hundred years to live amongst our anoestors. It has been a failure.
I don't think they could have liked in their heart of hearts the sort
of Christmas cards, pantomime and dinners that we have seen to-day.
If they did, I think they must have managed these things better than
we can. But there is one institution that has come down to us
that is not affected by the age. We are just as good as our forefathers
were in carrying out a fine say-what-you-like do-what-you-like
jolly old Christmas family row!"
I am, with the greatest possible respeot, the slave of your Majesty,

TWO LITTLE (MRS. JOHN) WOODEN SHOES.
Dear Mr. Punch,
Uncle Secundfs and me and Granny took Bobdy and Sibyl to see
Goody Two Slws, at the Court Theatre, on Boxing Day. We should of taken
Mable too, but she is going to act in the Pantomine at the Vicar's, so of course
she was obliged to go and rehearse the Queen's Maries instead. The Play was
very pretty, hut I think there is too much sermonising in it for the holidays.
But first I must tell you about the muel, which was very amusing, and his rams
kep getting in the way; and a man behind the scenes, who we couldn't see, said
quite loud, it would trip vou up; so the muel left off pawring the rains, and put
them over his head, ana Granny said it put her quite in a fever. But first I must
tell you about Bobby calling out quite loud, "Here's the blackbird!" It wasn't a
blackbird, but a raven—not a real raven, of course, but an artificial raven, madeout
of a boy, with wings, and a false head. He wascalled/ae/:./ump«, but his real name
was Charles Groves, Jun. I got read, becos I thought Unole Secundcs would be
ashamed; but he kep Bobby on his knee, and laughed quite as much as he
did. Granny said Goody Two Shoes was a perf ec little angel; but of course
Granny doesn't go much to theatres now, but certainly she is a very nice little girl.
But first, I must tell you about Graspall, a wicked overseer, such a rum little
chap who acked'well, something like Ralnh Rackstraw, andsomethinglike Gaspard.
But best of all I think I liked Mist Flimsy, Queen of the Land of Leisure. This
was capatilly acked by a little girl called Gborgie Martin, but I forgot Molly,
the Rude Child of Nature, who was Miss Celia Tucker, and I think she must of
been GraspaWs Bister, becos he is called Tommy Tucker in the menu. There
was a lot of Fairies, and the scenery was very nice. I liked the Fairy ballet, and
Goody Two Shoes danced beautifully. Her name is Dot Hetherington. Sibyl
said she would like to of kissed her, but Sibyl is only a child and a girl. Cer-
tainly I shall recommend Goody Two Shoes to the other fellows.
Your affectionate friend, Tommy.
, P.S.—It was an artificial Muel, as well. F. Kitchen acked inside it. So was
the Cat.

A QUESTION FOR THE NEW YEAR.
[The Bev. George W. McCree, who has been a Christian
worker in London since 1848, writing to the Daily Newt, asks
the question, " la London growing Better?" and answers it in
the affirmative, giving his reasons for doing so.]
Is London growing Better? Question strange
To meet us thus at the New Year's beginning!
Have Science, Love, Religion, the whole range
Of bettering influences indeed been winning?
Have forty years of urgent effort wrought
Some palpable redemption from old evils?
Has Wisdom slain some fiends with which it fought?
And are men more of men and less of devils?
Aye, says the ardent worker, champion stout
Of all good causes, all remedial measures.
Gladly the heart shakes off some clinging doubt,
And the divine's calm optimism treasures.
Yes, streets are cleaner; cleaner is the speech
Of those who walk them, as their hands are cleaner.
The "tub " has done its work; more cheaply each,
Who cares, of knowledge may become a gleaner.
Halfpenny 'bus fares, penny books no doubt
• Have had their influence on our throngs of toilers;
The brute in man is somewhat bound about
By wholesome law; the tempters and the spoilers
Find eyes upon them in their darksome lair,
And there is less necessity for yielding
To slow corruption or to swift despair,
When agencies abound for help and shielding.
Yes, brave McCree, Punch reads your record o'er
With acquiescence and with admiration;
There is more sympathy 'twixt rich and poor,
And we are less a horde, and more a nation;
Philanthropy is now much more alert,
And modish Vice less vauntingly victorious,
Than in the old bad days of crime and dirt.
The conquest, though but half-achieved, is glorious.
And yet, and yet, amidst the New Year Chimes,
Recur remembrances less glad and cheering.
The Sweater's greed and the Slum-farmer's crimes
Abide with us; t» their extinction nearing?
Fights and foul language? Read the penny Press!
It spreads the knowledge of suoh things 'midst
others.
Worn waifs still starve in London's strain and stress,
Although 'tis freely owned all men are brothers.
Red crime roves undetected, and men gloat
Upon its records crude with zest unholy.
Ribaldry roars from the street-ruffian's throat,
And ohildhood's life is bondage melancholy.
The devilries of Drink are rampant yet,
The revelries of Lnst leave wreck behind them,
And eyes of ruined women still are wet
With the hot, helpless, hopeless tears that blind them.
Much has been done; how much remains to do!
Yes, life in London may be sweeter, purer;
Vice flaunts less barely in the public view,
Comfort abounds, our highways securer.
But People's Palaces and penny books,
Board Schools, Blue Ribbon Armies, Children's
Dinners,
Scarce touch the horrors of the Town's foul nooks.
The nameless woes of greed-enslaved bread-winners,
Mammon's cheap tools worn blunt, and cast aside,
From Bands of Hope get scant alleviation,
Nor will the pleasures of the halfpenny ride
Gladden the hapless victims of starvation.
Forty years' toil in London gives a claim,
My good McCree, to reverent attention,
But there are floods of ill and swamps of shame
In Babylon still that need the intervention
Of larger wisdom, strength of wider soope. [ringing
With the New Year whose chimes e'en now are
Dawns a new day from which wise watchers hope
The rise of better things. What is it bringing,
This large reform with whose initial stir
London shall soon from end to end be quickened'(
Will it wake Hope? Shall the blue eyes of her
Cheer hearts whom Babylon's shame so long hath
sickened?
Come, County Councillors, men of England come,
Stint mutual oharge, snap every party fetter,
Toil for our helots in their misery dumb,
And our huge London shall indeed grow better!

SUGGESTIONS TO AN EDITOB.
Sib,—The idea recently started in your columns of relievinsfthe
dulness of the average English home hy "Music atfHome" is a
noble one, as all your ideas are. It is, moreover, capable of infinite
extension. There are thousands of deserving organ-grinders at this
moment earning a precarious existence in the streets of our Metro-
polis, whose solacing strains would surely be welcome to sufferers
from various kinds of nervous disorders. In certain cases of para-
lysis and failure of muscular action, what would be more likely to
rouse the invalid to instant and vigorous movement, and to call all
his energies into play, than the repetition for the hundred and
twentieth time of our great classic airs, " Two Lovely Black Eyes"
or " Queen of my Heart" f While no home could possibly be called
dull where these lively tunes were in constant course of performance
by the patient and indefatigable executant.
I trust, Sir, that you will throw open your columns to receive sub-
scriptions for providing all sufferers of the classes I have named with
immediate attendance from a chronic organ-grinder or German
band. Any case of ennui, however slight, should entitle the victim to
receive instant treatment. To show that my heart is in this noble
cause, I inclose you a cheque for one hundred guineas, and this is
not the only sacrifice I am making on behalf of this great movement,
inasmuch as, when all the organ-grinders are removed to their new
sphere of employment, I shall miss the constant exhilaration of their
presence in the square beneath, so helpful to me in the completion of
my great work, The Key to all the Mythologies, the twenty-seventh
volume of which is now in course of publication.—Yours, &c.,
39, Muffin Bell Square. Edward Casaobon.
P.S.—If your columns are not engaged next Summer for the
discussion of a more imj>ortant topic, will you allow me to suggest
that the "Solar Myths would prove an interesting successor to,
"Is Marriage a Failure P"

as one more among the many conclusive proofs that genius—writing
currente calamo—is above rules. Pickwick is immortal.
Excellent in illustration, and interesting in matter, is the Double
Number for Christmas of the English Illustrated Magazine, especially
the article on Macbeth, anent its revival at the Lyceum.
There is rather a De Quincey-ish article in the Fortnightly by
Oscak Wilbe on Wainewkight, the penman, pencilman, and
poisoner. When I say De Quincey-like, I mean that it reminds me of
that bizarre "Essay on Murder considered as one of the Fine Arts,"
which, with another on a certain historical character, I wish the
Opium-eater had never written. Yet there is a weird fascination
about De Quincey's cynicism as there is about Thackeray's
detestable Catherine. 0. W.'s article is "not too De Quinoey-ish,
but just De Quincey-ish enough." In the same magazine Edmund
Gossb gives a fair enough literary criticism of Ibsen's 8ooial
Dramas, but wisely does not attempt to treat them from an English
practical dramatist's point of view. As we have them, not one
could be placed in its entirety on the stage without wearying an
audience, and I fancy not more than two would repay the trouble.
Of these two The Pillars of Society would be one, and powerful
writing (beyond mere adaptation), ingenious stage-management and
rare acting would be required to make it a success. As long as
Ibsen's Dramas are not placed on the English stage, they will be
enthusiastically praised by a certain clique, who flatter themselves
on knowing a great deal of everything, especially the drama. To a
Manager I should say, "Trust them not, they're fooling thee.
Beware! beware! The Baron de Book Worms.
THE MOAN OF THE MONSTROSITY.
[The Islington Vestry wants to put down the public exhibitions of " giants,
dwarfs, and abnormally fat women."]

If on our trade the Vestry works its will.
What once was known as " Merry Islington,"

How, how would he have earned his daily bread?

Quite so, dear Rosebery; 'tis a glorious rag;

DRILL AND DROLLERY.
In Infantry Drill, as Revised by Her Majesty't Command, 1889,
just published, there is muoh new and interesting matter. According
to the Army Order introducing the work, signed by " Wolseley,
A.G.. by command of His Royal Highness the Commander-in-
Chief," the Regulations now promulgated "are based on the
principle of demanding great exactitude in the simplified movements
still retained for drill, while oonceding the utmost latitude to all
Commanders, of however small a unit, in manoeuvre. The first
must be carried out literally, the second must be observed in the
spirit more than the letter." As to the "simplified movements
still retained for drill," they seem to be quite as numerous as ever
they were, and, in spite of their " simplicity," appear to be just as
likely to puzzle the suoking subaltern in the present and the future
as they were wont to do in the past. The " utmost latitude " matter,
however, is something new, and introduces a novel principle into
army organisation.
Under the heading of "Manoeuvres," the compilers of the new
book have a great deal to say on the subjeot of tactics, and explain
everything to Tommy Atkins most carefully. For instance, a sentry
has no less than fourteen duties assigned to him, which are set forth
at length. One of them is suggestive of the order given to the
younger members of a family when permitted to "come down to
dessert;" it runs as follows:—"His duty is to see and listen,
without being seen or heard; and to report the result of his observa-
tions," the latter part, no doubt (in the case of infantry) being added
by an inquisitive nurse.
Another "duty" is to learn "the names of villages, rivers,
&c., in view; and the places to which roads and railways lead,
which is rather suggestive of a School Board standard in
Geography. The Authorities seem to fear that the sentry may
become too polite and amiable (which, of course, would be unpro-
fessional, as things military are never civil), and consequently
publish for his guidance the rule, " he is is to pay no compliments, nor
allow anyone to distract his attention." The last, regulation (which
amply proves that the idea of "conceding the utmost latitude" to
the smallest unit is to be carried out with the greatest possible
generosity) runs as follows: — "If attacked, he should defend himself
by firing or using his bayonet, as circumstances may require."
Perhaps this utmost latitude " has been carried rather too far in
the compilation of the book itself. In dealing with "Flags of
Truce" (page 2'J2,, the authors suggest "that a smart officer, con-
versant with the enemy's language, and of a cheerful disposition,
should be selected." Surely this should have been amplified by
showing how the officer should be smart, linguistic, and cheerful.
To supply the omission, we give a few regulations, that oan be
incorporated in the next edition.
Duties of Officers Carrying Flags of Truce.
1. On reaching the enemy's lines, he shall take ten paces to his
front, laugh heartily, to denote that he is of a cheerful disposition,
and observe, Bong jaw, jer swee onchawntau der voo vaw, vooley
voo prenny ung drink f
2. He then may ask a riddle, and, if possible, should stand upon
his head, or perform some other feat of skill calculated to impress
the enemy with a sense of his liveliness.
3. If brought before the enemy's Commander-in-Chief, he should
approach him by the side (or closing) step, and thump him suddenly
on his back when his attention is attracted in another direction.
4. He should, when ordered for instant execution, if possible,
escape, with the assistance of the paraphernalia of the vanishing lady
illusion—a trick with which he should have made himself thoroughly
familiar before entering upon his hazardous undertaking.
The compilers themselves seem to be of a " cheerful disposition,"
as they suggest to the officer bearing the flag of truce, and his
trumpeter, that " they should not retire until satisfied, after being
persistently fired at, that they have been seen by the enemy,
and that he will not receive them." This touch of waggerv
proves the whole world (inclusive of "George, Ranger," and
Wolseley") kin!
To sum up, Infantry Drill will be found as amusing in times
of peace as it is to be hoped it will prove as valuable in the
hour of war. As the Adjutant-General and His Royal Highness
the Commander-in-Chief would no doubt humorously observe,
as a proof of their " cheerful disposition," " It is a Red Book that
should be read.'"

SHAKSPEARE IN TOWN.



A NICHT WT MACBETH.
acbbth's character is defined in his wife's taunt, 'infirm of
purpose." She knew him: and all that he lacked she possessed, and
much more hesides. Mr. Irving's Macbeth is, as it seems to me,
admirable. There is only one point where I am sure he is wrong,
and that is at the very outset of his stage career—I mean, when he
first enters. Instead of marching on as the victorious Chieftain, to
whom any achievement M et armis is possible, he comes on as though
he were brooding over a defeat.
His first few words should be delivered in a cheery tone to Sanquo,
"So foul and fair a day I ne'er have met." This is the grim
pleasantry of a Scotchman on the state of the weather, which is more
than usually " soft," even for Scotland. His wife has told him he
ought to be this, he ought to be that, and so forth, and he has begun
to think that prowess such as his could achieve anything. But to
murder Duncan—to knock the King on his head for the sake of his
crown—this has never crossed his brainuntil the three Witches—out
for a lark, mind you, and
disobeying Hecate's orders—
suggest it to him. But Mac-
beth has a great personal
regard for Duncan, and, if it hadn't been for his wife, he would not have hurt a hair of the old King's
head, though he might have managed to pick a quarrel with Malcolm and Donaldbain, and have
settled the pair of them in fair and open combat; and, indeed, to settle the Prince of Cumberland is
the first step that occurs to muddle-headed Macbeth at this early stage of his " criminal procedure."
A propot of the Witches, why is Hecate's scene in the Third Act omitted?
In this the Queen of the Witches gives Macbeth's character as " a wayward
son, spiteful and wrathful," and then she foreshadows what by pre-
arrangement the answers of the Spirits in the Cauldron Scene are to be,
and how they are to urge this wayward son," this man "infirm of
purpose," to be "bloody, bold and resolute;" to assure him beyond doubt
of his hearing a charmed life, and so to make him "spurn fate" and" scorn
death." If he were " bloody, bold and resolute " by nature, to what end
do the Witches take all this trouble to make him so P No: Macbeth is just
what Mr. Ievtno shows him to be, what his deuce of a wife and Hecate know
him to be, and, in my humble opinion, what 8hakspeare meant him to be.
Hiss Ellen Terry's reasoning about her impersonation of Lady Macbeth
seems to me to have been this:—" The grim gaunt female, the awful
Tragedy Queen with whom we have been accustomed to associate Lady
Macbeth, could never have been the woman to whom Macbeth was so
devoted that he writes to her whenever he has a moment's leisure, a letter,
not of commonplaces, but revealing the innermost thoughts of his heart, and
whom in his most playful moments, when trying to resemble her in masking
his murderous design under a gay aspect, he styles ' dearest chuck.' Surely
an interiorly fixed, firm, and deadly purpose is compatible with a fascinating I, this the Wicked Uncle dragging awsy one of tho B»bc to
exterior; if not, what becomes of our historic traitresses and murderesses, killed? No, it is only Macbeth bringing on Sir Arthur Sullivan ti
our Dklil wis, Lucrezias, our Marchioness de Himsvilliehs, and many receive the congratulations of the Audience.

others who would not have been so terrible had they not been so
fascinating? These, to the men they deceived, and to the man to
whom they were true, were
'dearest chucks,' and,
consequently, as, whether
I would or not, I cannot

"dearest chuck" of a
Lady Mac Miss Ellen

she is with her husband,

beth, listening for the result of her husband's murder-
ous visit to Duncan's bed-room is not Shakspeare's
Lady Macbeth, but Lady Macbeth Terry-lied.
Miss Terry strikes a note of tenderness on whioh she
fondly dwells when she describes Duncan's resem-
blance to her father as being the sole reason why she
did not kill him as he slept. But the real Lady Mac-

beth, soliloquising, would have despised herself for this momentary
weakness. As for the Sleep-walking Scene—I was not in the least
impressed by it. Now
there was just one scene S3~^
that Madame Ristori
could play to perfection,
and that was the Sleep-
walking Scene. Never
have I seen anything like
it. I can never forget it.
It was-simply awful. We
were looking on a dying
woman, ana, therefore,
were not unprepared for
the intelligence of her de-
cease, which so immedi-
ately follows this our last
view of Lady Macbeth on
earth.
Miss Terry looked the
"dearest chuck" to the
life, and personally I should
say men would be sooner
lea to the commission of
crime by a Syren than
driven to it by a Gorgon.
Miss Terry is probably
right as to

Thane's
wife But Th"8 i9'be " Dearest Chuck " of the present,
she must be the tiger-cat as well as the purring
domestic cat; and when alone the tiger-cat only.
Velvet and iron is Lady Macbeth.
For the mise-en-scene there can be but a chorus of
unanimous praise, except for the Ghost Scene. This, I
have heard, has since been altered. I intend to see the
revival again, as I am sure do many others; but, en
attendant, I offer a practical suggestion for improving
the Banquo Ghost trick.
Proposed Improvement for
Bakouo's Ghost.



Spring released. Sudden appearance of " blood-boltercd Banquo."
But the revival offers so many opportunities for suggestions, that I
must resume the subject as soon as possible, when I hope to give
more attention to the three classical Weird Sisters, Alexander
Macduff, Wenman Banquo, and the Scenic Artists, all of whom con-
tribute to make the production what it is, an unprecedented success.
''Merry Wives" at the Haymarket, oharmingly placed on the
stage, but I do not think Shakspeare would be best pleased at the
omission of the "Budget" and "Mum" intrigue, which makes the
last part of the play unintelligible. Mr. Kf.mble as Dr. Cuius, and
Mr. Righton as Sir Hugh Evans, are capital, but it is yet open to
them to make their comic combat still more comic by introducing
some of the business of "The Two Macs," which is of quite an
Elizabethan character, and would have enraptured the Queen at
whose royal command this farcical comedy was written and aoted.
Also the verses sung by Dr. Caius might be brought up to date
with a few topical allusions.
Macbeth rushes up, presses down lid, and sits on it,
"Why, being gone, I am a man again!"
What a Frenchman of the Sixteenth Century was like, a Nineteenth
Century audience has the same opportunities of knowing as a Nine-
teenth Century actor. But I should say that he would be rather
more Frenchified in accent and gesture than Mr. Kemblf. makes him.
I have rarely seen Mr. Righton to greater advantage than as Sir
Hugh Evans.
Mr. Brookfield looked Master Slender to the life, but, after all
his " Oh, Sweet Anne Page," is a monotonous iteration which would
irritate an audience if it were not traditionally accepted as the subtle
humour of a Shakspearian classic. It seems a difficult task to make
anything of this part, except in the scenes with Sweet Anne herself.
Mrs. Tree as Sweet Anne is far too melancholy. It is more
Ophelia than Anne Page, especially in the last Act, when she enters
dressed all in white singing a sad ditty, and might he Ophelia on her
way to the pond, or Joan of Arc going to execution, instead of a
sprightly young lady, pretty sly too, about to take part in a merry

practical joke, and determined to run away with the man she loves,
by wayof a little practical joke on her own account.
Mr. Vollaire did justice to Justice Shallow. But the life and
soul of these low-comedy scenes, entering thoroughly into the spirit
of it all, was that thorough Shak-
spearian droll, Mr. Lionel Brough.
As Mine Host of " The Garter" he
is simply inimitable. The Play, as
performed at the Haymarket, is well
worth seeing, if only on account of
Lionel Brough's Mine Hostt and
the thoroughly "merry" Mistress
Page of Mils Rose Leclercq.
And last, but certainly not least,
when padding is taken into consider-
ation, is Mr. Tree's Falstaff. In
everything that Mr. Tree has
hitherto undertaken there is evidence
of considerable care and cleverness.
To play Captain Swift by night and
Falstaff by day is a memorable feat
in histrionics. In the one, nature
assists art, in the other, the actor has
to rely upon his art alone, for nature
is dead against him. That, in the
process of evolution, he may extricate
himself from the costumier's uphol-
stery of padding, release himself
from various other difficulties of his own creation, and become at
some future time the second-rate Falstaff that Shakspeare drew in
this second-rate comedy, I am not in a position to deny; but that he
is not even this second-rate Falstaff at the present moment I can
conscientiously assert. Mr. Tree is no more physically fitted for
Falstaff than he is for Hercules, and, keen as may be his perception
of the humour of the fat old reprobate, he gives no evidence of it
from the first scene to the last of his impersonation. Of course it
interests all playgoers, as a matter of curiosity, to see what thin,
adroit, quiet Mr. Tree will make of fat, broad, boisterous
Falstaff. In the incongruity of the impersonation lies its chief
attraction.
Then, as to costume, why did not he adopt the perfect and pictu-
resque costume designed by John Tenntel for Mark Lemon
whe* he appeared in the part? As far as appearance went, Mark
Lemon was a model Falstaff, whereas Mr. Tree's Falstaff looks
like an obese, weak-kneed, overgrown Pantaloon.
I very much doubt whether there be anyone now on the stage who
can play Falstaff, for if an actor be physically unfitted for the part,
the necessity for padding, and the assumption of a hoarse sack-and-
fog voice, and of a roar instead of a laugh to match, are enough to
stifle any really humorous conception. At present Mr. Tree doesn't
give himself a chance, so I must give him one, and see him again.

AN "EVENING OUT;" OR, SOCIAL GOSSIP A LA MODE.
One of the most pleasant and startling parties which has been
E'ven during the present winter season took place on Tuesday evening
st at the charming residence of Mrs. G. W. Smithkins, at Polydore
Gardens. The rooms which had been tastefully decorated with a
dozen penny coloured lamps presented a most recherche' and fascinating
appearance, and everything, from the taking of the hats by the dis-
guised Greengrocer down to the music which was supplied by an
itinerant street Cornet, was provided for on that scale of luxurious
abandon for which the delightful premises in question are so well-
known. The place was crowded with pretty faces, and the dresses of
some of the smart people who came in shoals were quite remarkable.
Mrs. Boldkrino, in a damson redingote, trimmed with pompons of
pommes de terre an nature! looked majestic, accompanied by her
charming daughter whose sympathetic simper was tastefully set
off by a tea-green calico Directoire gown, chiffonni with Pompadours
aux points d Asperges. Mrs. Otto von Stump was dressed in a
yellow cotton velvet brocade, relieved by dentelles d'imitation de
Norwich, and from head to foot literally blazed with paste._ Miss
Witherskin wore a simple arrangement of white tulle, but with her
magnificent auburn wig and parure of sham emeralds, she oreated
quite a flutter of admiring consternation wherever she went.
Much of the success of the entertainment was due to the indefatig-
able efforts of the amiable host, who, in a suit of dress clothes hired
for the evening, was specially active in the supper-room in his
endeavours to induce his guests to swallow the champagne provided
for the occasion, which was " Jopson & Co.'s Cuvie Reservt, 1888,"
and cost twenty shillings a dozen.
The feature of the evening was, however, unquestionably the
cotillon, and the evidently pleasurable surprise evinced by all on the
production of the presents, which consisted of cocked-hats for the
gentlemen and fans for the ladies, made from back numbers of the
Daily Telegraph, must have more than satisfied the genial hostess
that she had succeeded in not only amusing but in fairly astonishing
her guests. The somewhat familiar attentions of a drunken link-
man, who volunteered his services at the conclusion of the party, in-
vested the departure from it with a lively character, that cannot fail
to have impressed the minds of the invited with the fact that they
had assisted at an altogether unique and exceptional entertainment.

Attention! — Our cavalry establishment
appears to be in a tolerably lively and hopeful
condition, there being several thousand horses
short of the required number, and as a
consequence, six or seven regiments able to
show a muster-roll of at least two or three
hundred troopers apiece who have provided
for them no mounts whatever. In this
dilemma the Authorities appear to have
applied to a tramcar company, but whether
with a view to utilising the vehicles or the
horses,—the former would seem the more
likely under the circumstances,—is not dis-
tinctly stated. It would be interesting to
follow the drill of a horseless trooper. What
does he do f Mount behind a comrade as a
sort of reserve,—or what? Yet it must be
clear that a lancer on foot, in a real battle,

Peace! Is it Peace? The New Year chimes
King mellow music round the earth.
'Mid9t Party strife, class feuds, foul crimes.
The Peoples snatch some hours for mirth;
And hand meets hand in greeting glad,
Princes and Premiers smile and glose;
And who so sour, so cynic-sad.
As seek the thorns beneath the rose?
Yet who is it that meets us here
Upon the threshold of the year?
Peace! Know we not that placid face,
Those flowing robes, those traiLing wings?
Is it not she whose gentle grace
The Monarch lauds, the Minstrel sings?
Credentials hers from Court and Camp:
The firm and faithful friend of all.
Who hears the legions' mailed tramp?
The music of her soft footfall
Drowns in men's ears the war-hosts' hum,
The blare of trump, the throb of drum.
Who loves her not, who doth not laud?
Truculent Kaiser, braggart Chief,
All bow before her, and applaud
The bearer of the olive leaf.
[Exit.
The very ravens chorus loud
In praise of her snow-plumaged dove.
Sweet Peace! She must be truly proud
Of such strong proofs of general love.
Potentates pass, and statesmen stray,
But hers is undisputed sway.
Look closer! In one forward hand
She holdeth forth the olive wreath,
But—is't Bellona's biting brand
The other grips, though set in sheath?
And those white wings, their plumes a-point,
Look lethal at a nearer view.
Surely the times are out of joint,
Surely men's aims are all askew.
When she, who boasts such conquering charms,
Like other conquerors, takes to arms.
Not shepherd David's sling and stone,
But grim Goliath's panoply
The form, the raiment seem ner own;
But sure her best-loved bird might flee
From that soft hand set to the hilt.
Those pinions so unlike the dove's.
Whose is the burden, whose the guilt,
That Peace, whom every Emperor loves —
In perorations—fronts our eyes
In so equivocal a guise 'i
Do they equip her thus, her friends
Who sing her praise in strains so loud?
Whither is it her way she wends,
With face so pale and step so proud?
What friend is it of hers who thinks
To mail her as for stricken fields?
When, like Tahpeia, down she sinks
Crushed by the burden of your shields,
Then will your hollow pceans cease,

Oh, this is really prime!
My soul it buoys and braces.
Ah, tinkle-tum-tink!
I verily think
'Tis better than " Camp\Town Races."

With the Mandolin's not in it.
Ri-tootle-tum tay!
I've mastered the way,
Or shall do in a minute.
Though Irish songs of late
Have been my vocal staples,
'Tis fun to essay
An Italian lay
By the beautiful Bay of Naples.
'Tis chilly, of course, but dull,
For the Irish Vote to angle.
'Tis much better sport
Naples' charmers to court,
With the Mandolin's soft twingle-twangle.
A Bella di Napoh
Is not a Hibernian beauty,
But to serenade
An Italian maid
Is a change from more arduous duty.
To thrum Ould Erin's harp
My business may be to-morrow;
Meanwhile I may win
From the sweet Mandolin
Some present relief from sorrow.
My fingering's really fine,
Rum-tinkle-tum-tinkle-tinklc!
Italian eyes
Are quite a surprise,
Like the stars in their skies they twinkle.
"See Naples and die," they say;
But that is irrelevant—very.
'Tis late to begin
On the Mandolin,
But at least I may rest and make merry.

Oh! Goldwtn Smith, great Goldwtn Smith,
Who set such store by manly pith,
You have a most effeminate fashion
Of getting in a towering passion!
Your last attack's a regular rough rage
Excited by that Female Suffrage
Which Sajjsbuby, a solid person,
Can look without a shriek or curse on.
I seem to see your angry jaw set
Against the pleas of Mrs. Fawcett.
You will not yield to she-seductions,
But set your baok up, and raise ructions.
But, gracious goodness, Goldwtn, you
Are always in a phillaloo.
Since you took quarters with the Yankee,
Your temper has been getting cranky;
You bounce, and flounce, and pounce, and
trounce,
Almost all men—and things—denounce.
You 're always game to "drink up Esil;"
Gladstone was bad enough, but Cecil
Is really worse, so far to dote,
As to espouse the Female Vote.
It may, or it may not, a hold win
Upon the land, but oh! my Goldwin.
Your tantrums—there's no other word—
Are just a trifle too absurd.
The way in which you whirl and twirl
Reminds one of an angry girl;
Not of a man composed and bold.
Women you flout ?—then do not scold;
For that is quite a woman's way,
And imitating her won't pay.
It surely is not wise for you.
Great virile sage, to play the shrew.
'Twill spike your guns, silence your battery;
For imitation is mere flattery.
So Goody—I mean Goldwin—please
To moderate your ecstacies
Of anger, lest the feebler sex,
Whose aims your manly soul so vex,
Should think you share—wildest of notions!—
Their " irresponsible emotions."
THE HORRORS OF EVICTION.
We are sometimes assured that the heart-
rending accounts we read of the scenes that
take place at Irish evictions are purposely
exaggerated. But a report, furnished a few
days since to the Daily Telegraph by one
of its correspondents, has an indubitable ring
of truth about it, while it contains one para-
graph in particular which no Englishman, be
he Unionist or Separatist, can read without
a blush of shame, a tingling wonder that
such things can be. The eviction occurred
on the Olphert estate, at a place called (not
inappropriately) Bedlam, and, in attempting
to overcome the gallant tenant, we are told
that a Policeman was injured by a pitchfork
in the lip and leg. This is as it should be—
but mark what follows:—" The ugliest wound
he received" Bays the telegram calmly, "was
a gash on the back of the head, which, it wot
asserted, was thrown at the inmates of the
house by an Emergency Man, a view shared
by the Police." Will not Dr. Tanner or
Mr. Conybeare demand the name of that
Emergenoy Man when the House reassembles
for its duties? Are Emergency Men to be
permitted to throw "ugly wounds," or
gashes," or even "the Dacks _ of their
heads " at the devoted inmates of Irish home-
steads with impunity ?—and is this a view
shared by that effeminate Nero/' Mr. Bal-
foub, as well as by the Police f The country
has a right to know whether such things are
done, and will continue to be done in its
name. Mr. Punch is very sure that neither
Nicholas of Russia, nor King Bomra himself,
was ever guilty of such incredible atrocities,
and he still hopes that the account may prove
to be inaccurate in some of its details.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
ThoUOH the sketches from A Tour through
Holland and Germany, by Messrs. Mahafpt and
Rogers, and brought out by Messrs. Macmtllan,
are not within measurable distance of Messrs.
Broughton and Abbey's tour in Dutchland—
which was full of Broughton-and-" Abbey
Thoughts"—yet it is an interesting book, if not
a particular^ amusing one. Mr. Loftte's Ken-
sington, published by Field and Tuer, is a charm-
ing work. It is the Queen's Christmas book par
excellence, for on the first page I read, " By Com-
mand!" and "Dedicated to Her Majesty the
Queen," which are indeed Loftie phrases. Would
that the historian had not been so intensely serious,
or that the Queen had seen fit to "command
some light comedy pen and pencil to assist Mr.
Loftle in his work. A little 'umble wit and light-
heartedness would have relieved the letterpress
of its dry guide-book tone. Instead of Kensington,
by Loftie only, I should have liked to have seen
Kensington, by Loftie and Lowly. Then, as the
acrobats used to express it, we should have had
an entertainment of ground and lofty tumbling."
I don't particularly care for Lady Bluebeard—
not the book itself (Blackwood), but the lady who
flits through Persia and its pages, and gives the
story its name. The author is apparently genuinely
in love with her; but she strikes one who has never
looked into her " sad grey eyes," or "kissed her
in the moonlight just before we sighted Bombay,"
as a trifle ill-bred, and disagreeably self-conscious.
Bear with the heroine, and the rest of the book is
delightful—not in quite a new way, because it
recalls Eothen, but in a combination of new ways,
because, with memories of Kinglake before he
took to history, there are in the book flashing
touches reminiscent of George Meredith. The
scenes are fresh, and described with skilful pen.
Bagdad, Bussora, Bushire, the Persian Gulf, the
Gulf of Oman, Muscat, and so on to Bombay, sighted
under the soothing circumstances already noted.
After Bombay, Baroda is visited, and in the de-
scription of the fetes given by the Gaekwar the
anonymous author equals any chapter in Eothen.
Apart from pictures of unfamiliar tracks on the way
to India, the pages sparkle with shrewd observation
and quaint conceits. The book is accredited to '' the
Author of Zit and Zoe," a little story reprinted from
Blackwood two or three years ago, which made its
mark as something really fresh. Lady Bluebeard
is better still. Babon de Book Worms.
LOWERING THE STANDARD.
In the New Year's Day Number of the Standard there appeared a
remarkable article on the English Drama in general, and the Shaks-
pearian revival of Macbeth in particular, worthy of the good old
Gamp and Harris days, but not quite up to the Standard of more
recent date. From among the number of clever things written by
this anonymous genius, we quote the following superb passage :—
"If Shakspeare's Macbeth is not like Mr. Irving's, so much the worse
for Shakspeare's Macbeth; and if we cannot conceive Lady Macbeth
having been such as Miss Ellen Terry represents her, whose fault is that"
"So much the worse for Shakspeare's Macbeth.'" In old days
Mrs. Gamp would have chuckled over this, and exclaimed, admi-
ringlv, "Why, drat the bragian boldness of the boy!"
A little f urth er on, this genius, who clearly knows all about the
stage, states his opinion that could Shakspeare have foreseen the
triumphs of Henry Irving and Ellen Terry, he would have written
Macbeth and Lady Macbeth to suit their " special gifts."
Then he says, speaking evidently from his own personal and
peculiar knowledge—
"Why, what is the very basis, system, method, and almost universal
practice of play-writing for the English stage? Does a dramatist conceive
and write his play, and then take it to a Manager and say, 'There is my
piece; please act it?' No doubt some persons are so unsophisticated as to do
so; but they are soon undeceived as to the chances of its being produced.
The very opposite process takes place. 'Write me a play,' says a Manager,
'and in it there must be a part for me, a part for so-and-so, another part for
so-and-so, and then the rest of tho piece may take care of itself.' In a word,
the play is written to suit the physique, personality, peculiarities, and special
gifts of the actor or actress; which saves the actor or actress a great deal of
trouble, and ensures the production of the piece."
From the above quotations it will be at once seen what sort of a
genius the writer of this article is. Clearly a disappointed Dramatist,
one of The Rejected, who, with his blank-verse Tragedy in Five
Acts under his arm, went to a Manager,—to any number of
Managers, probably, one after the other,—and said, There is my
piece: please act it." To whom the Manager courteously replied,
after a careful perusal of the] first ten pages, "There is your play:
please take it away."
No wonder this Rejected Dramatist speaks with so much intimate
knowledge of how plays are produced, and speaks so feelingly on the
"decline of the Drama," the Drama in question being nis own,
which was "declined with thanks." But can't this genius take heart
of grace, give up the leader-writing (a great loss to the public, and
some, perhaps, to himself), and write a Drama to suit Henry and
Ellen, or a farce for Johnnie Toole, or a comedy for the Kendals,
or a domestic drama for Terry, or a melodrama to suit the " special
gifts" of Terriss and Miss Nethersole, or a burlesque for the
special gifts" of Arthur Roberts and Vanoni? Let him do any
! one, or all, of these,—he has only to call on the several Managers for
orders, and we sincerely wish he may get them (as no doubt he will,
of one sort, where the business is not particularly flourishing) and
though we shall miss his contributions to the Standard, yet we shall
console ourselves by knowing that the English stage will be in due
time enriched by the work of a Dramatic Genius whose light had
been so long hidden under a bushel of journalistic prose.

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
December 17.—As I open my scribbling Diary I find tbe words
"Oxford Michaelmas Term ends." Why this should induce me to
indulge in retrospective I don't know, but it does. The last few
weeks of my Diary are of minimum interest. The
breaking-off of the engagement between Lupin
^ an^ Daisy Mutlar has made him a different being,
£J< and Carrie a rather depressing companion. She
ifS' was a little dull last Saturday, and 1 thought to
cheer her up by reading some extracts from my
Diary, but she walked out of the room in the
£ yl \ middle of the reading without a word. On her
- ° return I said, "Did my Diary bore you, darling?"
'»J Jity y I She replied, to my surprise, "I really wasn't
£k (./ listening, dear. I was obliged to leave to give
Q / - » instructions to the laundress. In consequenoe of
s^gSc-' some stuff she puts in the water, two more of
Lupin's coloured shirts have run, and he says he
won't wear them." I said, " Everything is Lupin.
It's all Lupin, Lupin, Lupin. There was not a single button on
my shirt yesterday, but I made no complaint." Carrie simply
replied, "You should do as all other men do, and wear studs. In
fact I never saw anyone but you wear buttons on the shirt-fronts."
I said, "I certainly wore none yesterday, for there were none on."
Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the
evening, and Cumjunqs never does. I fear they don't get on well
with Lupin.
December 18.—Yesterday I was in a retrospective vein—to-day it
is prospective. I see nothing but clouds, clouds, clouds. Lupin is
perfectly intolerable over the Daisy Mutlar business. He won't
say what is the cause of the breach. He is evidently condemning
her conduct, and yet, If we venture to agree with him, says he won't
hear a word against her. So what is one to do? Another thing
which is disappointing to me is, that Carrie and Lupin take no
interest whatever in my Diary. I broached the subject at the
breakfast-table to-day. I said, "I was in hopes that, if anything
ever happened to me, the Diary will be an endless source of pleasure
to you both, to say nothing of the chance of the remuneration which
may accrue from its being published." Both Carrie and Lupin
burst out laughing. Carrie was sorry for this, I could see, for she
said, "I did not mean to be rude, dear Charlie, but truly I do not
think your Diary would sufficiently interest the public, to be taken
up by a publisher." I replied, "I am sure it would prove quite as
interesting as some of the ridiculous reminiscences that have been
published lately. Besides, it's the Diary that makes the man.
Where would Evelyn and Pepys have been if it had not been for
their Diaries?" Carrie said I was quite a philosopher; but Lupin,
in a jeering tone, said, "If it had been written on larger paper,
Guv, we might get a fair price from 'a buttennan for it." As I am
in the prospective vein, I vow the end of this year will see the end
of my Diary.
December 19.—The annual invitation came to spend Christmas
with Carrie's mother. The usual family festive gathering to whioh
we always look forward. Lupin declined to go. I was astounded,
and expressed my surprise and disgust. Lupin then obliged us with
the following radical speech:— I hate a family gathering at
Christmas. What does it mean? Why some one says, 'Ah, we
miss poor Uncle James who was here last year,' and we all begin to
snivel. Someone else says, 'It's two years since poor Aunt Liz used
to sit in that corner.' Then we all begin to snivel again. Then
another gloomy relation says, 'Ah, I wonder whose turn it will be
next?' Then we all snivel again, and proceed to eat and drink too
much, and they don't discover until / get up that we have been
seated 13 at dinner."
December 20.—Went to Sjiirksons', the Drapers, in the Strand,
who this year have turned out everything in the shop and devoted
the whole place to the sale of Christmas Cards. Shop crowded with
people, who seemed to take up the cards rather roughly, and after a
hurried glance at them, throw them down again. I remarked to one
of the young persons serving, that carelessness appeared to be a
disease with some purchasers. The observation was scarcely out of
my mouth, when my thick ooat-sleeve caught against a large pile of
expensive cards in boxes one on the top of the other, and threw them
down. The manager came forward looking very muoh annoyed, and
picking up several cards from the ground said to one of the assistants,
with a palpable side-glance at me, "Put these amongst the sixpenny
goods; they can't be sold for a shilling now." The result was, I felt
it my duty to buy some of these damaged cards. I had to buy more
and pay more than I intended. Unfortunately I did not examine
them all, and when I got home I discovered a vulgar card with a
pioture of a fat nurse with two babies—one black and the other
white, and the words, "We wish Pa a Merry Christmas." I tore
up the card and threw it away. Carrie said the great disadvantage
of going out in Society and increasing the number of our friends
was, that we should have to send out nearly two dozen cards this year.
December 21.—To save the postmen a miserable Christmas, we
follow the example of all unselfish people, and send out our cards
early. Most of the cards had finger-marks, which I did not notioe
at night. I shall buy all future cards in the daytime. Lupin (who
ever since he has had the appointment with a stock and share brokers,
does not seem over-scrupulous in his dealings) told me never to rub
out the pencilled price on the backs of the cards. I asked him why.
Lupin said, "Suppose your card is marked 9rf. Well, all you have
to do ib to pencil a 3—and a long stroke after it—in front of the nine-
pence, and people will think you have given five tunes the price for
It." In the evening Lupin was very low-spirited, and I reminded
him that behind the clouds the sun was shining. He said, "Ugh!
it never shines on me." I said, "Stop, Lupin, my boy, you are
worried about Daisy Mutlar. Don't think of her any more. You
ought to congratulate yourself on having got off a verybad bargain.
Her notions are far too grand for our simple tastes." _ He jumped up
and said, "I won't allow one word to be uttered against her. She s
worth the whole bunch of your friends put together, that inflated,
sloping-head of a Pereupp inoluded." I left the room with silent
dignity, but caught my foot in the mat.
December 23.—I exohanged no words with Lupin in the morning;
but as he seemed to be in exuberant spirits in the evening, I ventured
to ask him where he intended to spend his Christmas. He replied,
"Oh, most likely at the Mutlars." In wonderment I said, "What!
after your engagement has been broken off?" Lupin said, "Who
said it is offr" I said, "You have given us both to under-
stand "He interrupted me by saying, "Well, never mind
that! It is on again—there!"
ENGLISH SOCIETY AS SHE IS SEEN.
(Through Atlantic Mists.)
Now that the more respectable among English Dukes, and the
bluer blood of English gentlemen, are finding brides in the United
States, a keener interest in high life in this effete country is natu-
rally circulating throughout the States. The New York Tribune,
fortunate in the possession of a London Correspondent to whom no
baronial pates are barred, takes the lead in supplying the demand
for news in this department. "G. W. S." himself has contributed
a series of articles on London Society and upon "The American
Girl" as she flashes through it. "Royalty," writes this unconscious
humorist, "is a caste apart. An intercourse with Royalty has, I
admit, an etiquette of its own." That understood, "G. W. S."
ramps with patronising step through the inner circle of English
Society both in town and country. Never, since Charles Edward
Harrington Fitzroy Yellowplush laid down his pen, has so mas-
terly an exposition of the greatness and the littleness of London
Society been set forth in print. Like Charles Edward, " G. W. 8."
is too intimate with the hupper suckles" to think much of them.
"G. W. S.'s" latest contribution is supplemented by one from
another hand. It lacks something of his lofty style, but displays all
bis intimate knowledge of the subject. "A Common-sense Duchess"
is the heading of the article, which treats of a lady lately dead.
"Ridiculous as it may Beem to Republican readers," says this high
authority,—
"the Duchess was severely criticised for her habit of walking forth alone
from her sombre mansion and calling a cab when in a hurry, instead of letting
a half-hour go to waste while the cumbersome vehicle appropriate to her
station should be made ready. The entire precinct was once thrown into a
flutter by the report, doubtless correct, that she had personally entered the
little bakery in St. James's Street, in whioh a postal agency was established,
and had there purchased stamps and affixed them to her letters, precisely as
one of the untitled multitude might have done."
Nor was this all.
"In the winter of 1869 the sentinel who mounts guard over the palace
wall of Cleveland Eow had the opportunity of relieving his dreary routine by
saving a child from being run over—a radical cab-horse from Pall Mall
having so forgotten the proprieties as to break loose and endanger human
life, as well as the drowsy tranquillity of that solemn region. A day or two
later the Duchess was seen to stop and speak to the guardsman, who was so
overcome by agitation that he could hardly hold his rifle steady. He would
have faced the cannon's mouth with less trepidation than exchange ten words
with this exalted Peeress."
This seems to have oreated a sensation equalled only by that with
which the West End heard of the indisoretion in "the little bakery
in St. James's Street." "The verdiot of the austere middle-class
throughout the neighbourhood was, that the Duohess had been repre-
hensibly unmindful of the dignity of the position, and that she
would have done better to send the soldier half-a-erown by her foot-
man." "And yet," exclaims the New York Tribune,—
"there are people on both sides of the Atlantic who profess to wonder
that the social sensibilities of Americans and Englishmen cannot at all points
be brought into sympathetic and symmetrical accord."
There are, indeed.

soon "Richard" will be "himself again"—not

he will essay the light and airy part of Richard

THE TURBOTS DIARY.
Off the North British Coast.—Well this is jolly. Here we are,
hundreds of ns, floundering away in shoals. Worth. I should think,
about a penny a dozen. Talk about there being as many good
fish in the sea as ever came out of it"! Nonsense. The proverb
ought to be altered. There are a good many more. Halloa!
though,—what's this? Blest if it isn't a net, and what's more I'm
in it. By Jove, it's a case. I'm caught.
On a Local Wheelbarrow.—Two or three score of us flung back
into the sea again, just to keep up the price. A downright shame I
call it. However, tney want two shillings for me here, and as no
one will give it (and quite right too), I'm packed off to London.
At Billingsgate.—Find I've got hopelessly into the " Ring." No
chance of being sold at my real price, which, including railway
charges, would even now be only about twopence a pound, but I've
been consigned to a leading West-end fishmonger by an enterprising
middleman, and goodness only knows what price they won't stiok on
me now. Wish I could open my mouth! Wouldn't I let 'em know
what they really ought to pay for me.
On a Fishmonger's Slab in a Leading West-End Thoroughfare.—
Here I am displayed along with some lobsters for which they are
asking five shillings apiece—and which, I '11 be bound didn't oost
sevenpence! As for the price they've put on me, it's monstrous.
If cut up, I'm to go for one and sixpence a pound, yet if
they were to get rid of me at twopence-halfpenny they would still
make a good profit. As to those red mullets at two shillings and
sixpence apiece, and those oysters at four shillings a dozen, I wonder
they 're not ashamed to be seen in the place; out I suppose, poor
beggars, like me, they ..can't help themselves. Oh! if I could only
speak!
On a Table in May fair.— Over at last! Dished up whole at a
faahionable dinner-party of eighteen. Appear to have given satis-
faction. But, what a swindle! Overheard the Cook say that the
Fishmonger had priced me at one pound five! and my real price
ought to nave been one and ninepence. Downright robbery; that's
what it is! Why don't the public take it up? But, there—I'm
only a poor fish, and with the Dcst will in the world—I can't help it!
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Tbb Toilers of Babylon. This, as an unsensational novel, is
among the best,'if Tnot quite the best of Mr. Farjeon's books up to
! now. The characters are original, the plot well-constructed and
worked out, and there are no pages of dialogue that the accom-
plished novel-reader knows at a glance can be skipped without losing
a single essential point. No skipper need take this in hand. It,
is interesting, and sufficiently absorbing without being unhealthily
exciting. The dialogue is throughout easy, but never commonplace;
the humour is unforced, and the pathos natural. The influence of
Dickens, the master, may be always seen in the work of one of his
most apt disciples, and it is most happily evident when Mr. Far/eon
does not labour, as he has done in the lighter chapters of some of
his other novels, to be Dickensianly funny, but is spontaneously and
quietly humorous. I strongly recommend it.
My faithful Co. has been spending a part of his vacation' in reading
The Fairy History of England, a companion volume to the Fairy
Geography, published some time ago. He reports that he has been
greatly entertained by the light touoh of the author, and has, with
the latter's aid, quite "rubbed up his knowledge." He says that,
after reading this unconventional account of tne darker pages of
Britannia's biography, he has felt himself in a position to hold his
own in the company of his children, even when they begin discussing
the invasion of Julius Caesar and the Battle of Hastings. Both
events are recorded in a style that does not lack either humour or
instruotiveness. So far, the Fairy History extends only to the
Plantaoenets, but he lives in hopes of seeing several other volumes
in the near future. Bason de Book Worms & Co.
Stars and Spangles.—Yankee Hamlet and Company protest
against the invasion of foreign Star Companies. Very natural, their
country is sufficiently " star-spangled" already.

undertake in less time and at half the price.

SOME CANDID CANDIDATES.
To the Municipal Electors of the Sewer Hamlels.
On presenting myself to the notice of this enlightened municipal
constituency as a Candidate for the London County Council, I may
perhaps be asked in what way I am specially qualified to serve the
interests of the ratepayers. The question, however, shows a lack of
appreciation of the true bearings of the matter. I can assure the
electors that while incidentally I shall be happy to do what I can to
benefit them, the interests whioh I intend principally to serve are
my own. As a late Member of the Guzzlington Vestry, and a repre-
sentative of the district in the Board of Works, I have consistently,
and I think successfully, studied the art of providing snug little
contracts for my personal friends, in addition to taking a fair share
myself. Whenever there has been presented to me a choice between
doing my duty or doing the ratepayer, I have unhesitatingly selected
the latter alternative. "Self-help" is my motto, and accordingly,
I have helped myself, whenever it has been practicable, to any little
pickings that might be going. I shall attempt to follow exactly the
same course if elected to the Metropolitan County Council, and I can
only hope that the good sense of the constituencies will result in
returning to that body as many members as possible who can claim
to be, like myself, both in name and in spirit—especially the latter
—complete and unmitigated Vestrymen. A. Jobber.
To the Free and Independent Voters for the N'. W. Slumshire County Council.
In response to an influentially signed request, made by the
farmers of the district—most of whom happen to be my own tenants
—and the neighbouring clergy and gentry, I have consented to come
forward as a Candidate for the Council of this part of the County. I see
no reason why these new-fangled bodies should have been invented,
but, as they have been, I think the proper sort of men should
be elected as members. I entertain very strong opinions as to the
necessity which exists of importing more hares and foxes into the
country, and prohibiting farmers from using wire fencings. I also
am of opinion that the rating of country mansions is absurdly high,
considering the prices one has to pay nowadays for good hunters;
and I would vote for all suoh expenses, as well as those of county
educition, asylums, paving, lighting, and highways, coming out of
the pockets of the ratepayers of the nearest borough. Remissions of
rent to farmers I theoretically approve of, when possible: but I think
that " grants in aid " should be employed to compensate landlords for
any loss of revenue they experience on this score. I may add that I
shall be much surprised if anybody has the assurance to offer himself
as a rival Candidate to myself. Mowbray de Boots Proudfoot.
To the Same.
I offer myself for the County Council of this Division of the
County because I am a Dissenter, and because religion has nothing
whatever to do with the contest. I rely for getting in on the dis-
content of the labourers with things in general, and on the fact that
there is a very large Anabaptist community in the various villages
of the shire, who may be confidently counted upon to vote for any-
body who will promise to have a slap at the Squires and Parsons
whenever practicable. Of the details of County management I am
absurdly ignorant; but I would pledge myself, if elected, to impose
suoh a rate on country houses as would cause most of them to be at
onoe shut up; and I am perfectly indifferent to whether or not such
a state of things would mean loss of employment to hundreds of
families in the counties, with corresponding increase of business to
shop and hotel-keepers in London, JS ice, Cannes, and elsewhere.
Ebenezes Muttoned.
To the Electors of South Clamberwell.
I offer myself for the Metropolitan Council on a frank political
basis. I am an out-and-out Democratic-Conservative-Radical-
Unionist. I am aware that all enlightened citizens deprecate the
intrusion of politics into these elections, and that if political con-
siderations are allowed to be paramount, jobbery will flourish, and
the ratepayers' interests will go to the wall. The Caucus of my party,
however, are of opinion that it will look well if it can be said that a
majority of the new Councillors belong to their own political per-
suasion, and they also believe that a distribution of future contracts
among business men of the same party will tend to an increase of
public virtue, and of Electors devoted to its views. As I happen to
possess what is called local "influence," consisting of three breweries
and a hundred public-houses in the district, the aforesaid Caucus has
requested me to stand for the position which I unblushingly solicit
at your hands. Guy Partthan {Ex-Col. 27th Free Lancers).

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
Introduction.
This title may need some explanation. It is not intended to
imply that Mr. Punch has a private luminary all to himself.
Great and truly distinguished as he ist he would scorn such osten-
tation, and is modestly content
with precisely the same quality
of moonshine as that, to quote a
certain advertisement/' supplied
to Dukes, Marquises, Earls, Vis-
counts, Barons, and the Nobility
and Gentry "—to say nothing: of
humanity in general. Never-
theless, he conceives that the
Moon is quite as much his as any
other person's.
Hans Andersen — as who
needs to be reminded ?—was, or
represented himself as being, on
sufficiently intimate terms with
the Moon to be favoured with
hints for many charming word-
pictures, which, under the title
of What the Moon Sato, have
for many years delighted the
world. It is true that the Moon herself disclaims any share in the
authorship of these sketches, and it is, to say the least, suspicious
that, according to the German text, Andersen's Moon should be
represented as of the masculine gender. However this may be (and
Mr. Punch's science and scholarship warn him from drawing too
decisive oonolusions from either oircumstance), it struck him lately
that a little tact and enterprise'would enable him to secure the
Moon as a contributor to his world-famous periodical. It is surprising,
indeed, that this has not been already accomplished by the Editor of
one or more of the high-priced Monthlies. Thoughts on Solar Myths,
by Her Serene Effulgence the Moon, would certainly make a good
appearance on the cover, and perhaps sell a second edition. But
it has been left to Mr. Punch to secure her last New Year's Eye,
through the agency of a powerful glasB, and after negotiations which
it would be tedious to detail. It is enough to say that the Moon
behavedt at first, with characteristic modesty, professing her total
unacquaintance with the art of literary composition—as if that were
any valid objection!—and finally retreating behind a cloud with an
apparent desire of evading further persecution. But Mr. Punch
persevered, urging that all persons of light and leading were now
engaged in furnishing the world with aneodotical reminiscences, and
that from so exalted a source the smallest contributions would be
thankfully received by him and by the Public.
Flattery overcame a resolution which was perhaps at no time
intended to be final, and presently the Moon came coyly out again
with a question respecting terms, which was satisfactorily answered.
And, in the end, she graciously consented to furnish these pages
with the fruits of her unequalled opportunities for observing con-
temporary manners and customs. Many of her pictures it has been
necessary to reluctantly suppress, for the Moon has witnessed much
that could not be divulged in print without causing pain and incon-
venience to a number of highly-respected individuals, and exposing
Mr. Punch himself to legal proceedings of a harassing and expen-
sive nature. Such of her revelations as follow will be found of an
absolutely innoouous character, and might even be considered trivial
and unimportant, did not the fact of their distinguished authorship
impart a value and interest which, to be frank, would otherwise
hardly be conceded to them.
FIRST EVENING.
"Last night," these were the Moon's own words, "last night I
looked down through a rent in the canvas of a travelling menagerie.
It was closed. Before the stove in the centre a grave and ex-
tremely respectable old stork was warming his wings thoughtfully,
while a racoon fastened by a long chain to the centre pole was
creeping up behind to nip one of his thin red legs. The great ele-
phant at the end was swaying his unwieldy body from side
to side behind 'his bar in an imbecile manner. Now and then a bird
uttered a drowsy croak, or a jackal howled, as my rays stole through
his bars; a sleepy snurring sound came from the cage where the lions
were; otherwise everything was still, for the attendants were all in
another tent, fast asleep. Suddenly, from a caravan near the
entrance, came the sound of an angry female voice—it was the wife
of the lion-tamer, abusing her husband as usual. Presently the door
of the caravan opened, and I saw a neat little room, with muslin
curtains and polished brass and pictures on the walls, as the light
from the lamp streamed out into the dark tent, awaking the animals.
Then the lion-tamer leaped down the steps in his shirt and trousers,
and after him came his wife, a great red-faced virago, brandishing
the little brass shovel from the fender. Round and round she
chased him. and he dodged her, getting now behind the stork, which
looked much scandalised by these proceedings, and now behind the
stove, where a sick monkey was blinking nervously inside his blanket.
All the beasts were now thoroughly awake, and watching the chose in
the greatest excitement; the noise was fearful, the laughing jackass
roared with merriment, the bear began to dance slowly with delight,
the hyena yelled; only the stork was calm, and went on warming
bis wings whenever he could get out of the way. At last the woman
tripped over the racoon's chain and fell—which seemed to amuse the
jackass and the hyena more than ever. The man gave a desperate
glance all round: already he felt the shovel on his shoulders, but for
the moment he was free! I could see his eyes glare wildly as my beams
fell upon them. All at once a thought appeared to strike him; the
woman was en her feet already, and swearing at the little racoon—he
had no time to spare. Before she could intercept him, he was up
the steps of the lions' cage, and in the next instant had slipped
in amongst them, closing the wicket behind him. There he stood,
amongst the dusky growling beasts, breathing hard and looking pale
id the Moon, " but safe! And the woman
_. least I thought so," said _
stood there on the trampled turf—baffled. She looked at her husband
for a moment, with on expression of concentrated contempt, and then
she said between her teeth, 'Come out, you coward!' Then one of
those tiresome clouds passed before my face, and so I never knew
whether he found the courage to come out or not."

PLAY-TIME.
The Silver Falls and the gold tumbles in at the Adelphi. Messrs.
Pettitt and Sims have written a first-rate First Act to The Silver
Falls. After this they seem to have become startled by their own
originality, and to have said to one another, "Take oare, Sims!
beware, Pettitt!
we mustn't get too
far away from the
beaten track," and
so, the other Aots,
though pictur-
esque and drama-
tic, are of a more
conventional cha-
racter. It looks
any one great
sensation scene,
but the interest is
well sustained
throughout, and it
i s capitally played.
Mr. Tekkiss is of
course the hero,
dinous speeches, of which he seemed at one time so enamoured, as if
ambitious of rivalling Wilson Barbett in long-windedneBs. Mr.
Tekriss is better than I've seen him for some time as Eric Normanhurtt,
and if he would only modulate his tones occasionally, the perform-
ance would be perfect of its kind. Heroes
are terrible chops for shouting, just as
heroines ore, as a rule, for screaming. Miss
Millward is on exception ; she is charming
as the good fairy, and Miss Olga Nether-
sole is diabolically delightful as the bad
fairy, or evil genius, of the piece. EUe ira
loin, "by the land permission of Mr. John
Hare," who knew what he was about when
he engaged Miss Allqone Upperleathers
—I humbly beg her pardon, but I can't
help it if she will be a "Nethersole"—
for nis new Theatre. She hasn't the physique
for great work, but what she does will be
great, by comparison, and good. Let her be-
ware of Messrs. Gasp and Guggle, two stage
villains that ere now have choked off more
than one promising and performing heroine.
Miss Clara Jecks. sprightly, lively, and
pathetio, is invaluable. I warrant she could be on "emergency
woman," and come out as either of the heroines at shortest possible
notice, and prove herself to be among the most useful of the Messrs.
Gatti s sub-jecks. Mr. Shine was better as the sailor in The Union
Jack than he is as the nondescript general store-keeper, Jack Slingsby,
but this is less his fault, I expect, than that of the authors, who
have not made a charaoter part of it. Clever actor, Mr. Shine;
didn't he play in something of Mr. Grundy's, a self-made mil-
lionnaire, m whose make-up there wasn't a trace of the moon-faced
young Shine as we now see him at the Adelphi, for he had com
pletely taken the shine out of himself.

OUR ADVERTISERS.
HUNTING.—An exceptional chance is offered to an enthusiast
of some organising capacity of enjoying a brisk ride to hounds
in a country where there is at present no meet within fifty miles,
by communicating with the Advertiser, who is anxious to dispose of
his property, situated on the bleak side of a mountainous bill,
together with several dogs collected with a view to their forming the
nucleus of a local pack. The latter consist of a Beagle, a Blood-
hound, a couple of MastiffB, one blind: three performing Poodles,
and a Pug Puppy, which, with a few additions, and a little atten-
tion and training, ought to afford capital sport when let loose on a
tame Fox that has been purposely kept in a kennel on the premises.
Though the vicinity is broken and rocky, there is a capital bit of
straight country to be got in the railway cutting, where, in the
intervals of traffic, a spirited mount, followed by a few amateur
sportsmen, new to the work, could not fail to enjoy a fresh and
exoiting run. Apply to " Harkaway," Spavinhurst, Sellborough.

PULL FLOQUET! PULL BOULANGER!
LAMBS AT THE LYCEUM.
It is worth while recording what views Charles and Mary Lamb
took of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in their delightful Tales from
Shakspeare:—
"Macbeth had a wife, to whom he communicated the strange prediction of
the weird sisters, and its partial accomplishment. She was a bad, ambitious
woman, and so as her husband and herself could arrive at greatness, she cared
not much by what means. She spurred on the reluctant purpose of Macbeth,
who felt compunction at the thought of blood, and did not cease to represent
the murder of the king as a step absolutely necessary to the fulfilment of the
flattering prophecy."
Then of Lady Macbeth'» reception of Duncan, which as a part of
Miss Ellen Terry's performance I selected for especial praise last
week, the innocent Lambs say:—
"The King entered, well pleased with the place, and not less so with the
attentions of his honoured hostess, Lady Macbeth, who had the art of covering
treacherous purposes with smiles: and would look the innocent flower, while
she was indeed the serpent under it."
Is not this Miss Ellen Terry's rendering to the very life of this
particular scene?
The Lambs' Tales were written for our innocent lambkins, and it
U from this charming collection that so many of us, when children,
have learnt the plots of Shakst-eare's plays, and the character of
the persons who figure in them. Without making further quotation,
I recommend the re-perusal of their story of Macbeth.
If Miss Terry has considered the Lambs' work as mere child's
play, I should advise her to read it over carefully, for there is so
much in their view of Lady Macbeth') character which so entirely
accords with a part of her own view of it, and so much which her
genius will at once adopt as representing the stern and repulsive
side of the character. Miss Ellen Terry has conceded too much to
her own sweet, natural self. She has made one " blend" of Beatrice,
Ophelia, and Lady Macbeth, in whioh the awful characteristics of
the last have been toned down. Lady Macbeth, say the Lambs,
"reproached him with his want of firmness," and, as I observed last
week, after witnessing the first performance, this infirmity of purpose
is the keynote to Macbeth't character and to that of his wife. I am
delighted to find myself corroborated in everv particular by the
gentle but judicial Lambs. Jack in the Box.

For its foul hands to do.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Snake-Charming. — Your attempt to "charm"the large Boa
Constrictor presented to you by your Calcutta friend by pursuing it
round the drawing-room, beating a frying-pan and a Chinese dinner-
gong, and playing "Home! Sweet Home!" on the Ophicleide,
though happily conceived, was perhaps a little risky; and the faot
that it turned upon you, hissing, seems to indioate that some rather
less exciting method of gaining its confidence might prove more
efficacious. It is fortunate that it eventually got into the grand
piano. Keep it shut up in the instrument for the present. By all
means get a dentist to draw its teeth as soon as possible, and, if you
cannot persuade your own private praotitioner to try his hand, take
it in a cab to the Dental Hospital. With regard to its food, you
cannot do better than continue the diet of blankets and rabbits, on
which it seemB to have subsisted since it has come into your charge;
but any shilling Handbook on the Management of the Boa Con-
ttrietor will give you the information you require. Don't worry
yourself about the amount of the reward 'you ought to offer if it
escapes. Time enough to do this when it does. But you may be
quite sure that anyone in the neighbourhood who gets hold of it will
only be too happy to let you have it back again for eighteenpenoe.
Disposing of a Steam-roller.—Certainly, if you desire to surprise
him, the best way to present your Uncle in the country with a steam-
roller you wish to get rid of, will be take it down yourself. This is of
course in the event of Carter, Paterson & Co. refusing to deliver it,
or it being found impossible to entrust it for transmission to the Parcels
Post. Your idea of tacking on to it a couple of waggons, two or
three bathing-machines, and a gipsy-van, and taking downa German
band, with as many relatives as you can get to join you, is a decidedly
happy inspiration; and your proposed arrival on your Unole's lawn
to greet him at breakfast, ought certainly to come upon him in the
shape of a startling and agreeable surprise. It would be as well,
for the purpose of proving the effioaey of the steam-roller with
which you are about to present him, that you should enterhisprnunds,
not by the ordinary lodge-gates, but through a brick-wall. Having
levelled all his geranium-beds and cucumber-frames in a little tour
round his premises, you can attract his attention by blowing off steam
in front of his breakfast-window. By following these lines, you will
not fail to please and surprise your Uncle on informing him you have
come to make him the present you propose, and whether he accept it
or not, you will have got rid of your steam-roller.
A skating match in the very ooldest weather must be highly un-
satisfactory, as the course itself will melt away during the first heat.
X/- NOTICE.—Rejected Communications or Contribution!, whether US., Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any description, will
in no case be returned, not even when accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed Envelope, Cover, or Wrapper. To this rule
there will be no exception.

8TOEIES OF THE WEIRD AND THE WONDERFUL.
THE UNUSUAL PENNY STEAM-BOAT.
Many years ago—it matters not how many—I was walking, one
cold wintry evening, on the Thames Embankment, and pondering as
to the advisability of taking a cab. For it was blowing a nor'-easter.
The spray from the angry
Thames was dashing over the
parapet, and causing even the
seasoned policeman to swear
beneath his breath.
"You had better go by the
boat, Sir," shouted a weather-
beaten salt, touching his tar-
paulin hat respectfully. Then,
as his head - covering was
carried away by the tempest,
"tie added, "It's cheaper than
Os$-*3<"rV-.— a Hansom, and much more
$U ^SSS? ^S^r^S^ comfortable."
!(I rMg^|E' /, ~^ I was °l°se t° t'le Temple
Pier, and, partly to get under
shelter of the ticket-shed, and
partly to be rid of my obtru-
sive but well-meaning in-
formant, I hurried down the
steps leading to the river's
edge. As I reached the plat-
form, the Thames, now moun-
tains high, rocked the barge from side to side as if it had been a
cockle-shell thrown upon the bosom of Niagara. Holding on to the
pigeon-hole of the office, I asked for a ticket to Battersea.
Here you are," said the Booking-Clerk. "Tuppence."
I paid the required sum, and five minutes later was aboard The
Peerless rerceval, as I found the steamboat was called that was
bound to carry me to my destination. To my surprise, I had not set
foot on deck a moment before all unpleasant movements came to an
abrupt but welcome termination.
"How is this?" I asked of an official wearing a uniform covered
with gold lace. "Has the storm abated?"
"Not at all," he returned, courteously removing his heavily-
bullioned cocked hat. "Not at all. But, the fact is, we keep The
Peerless Perceval steady by applying round the entire vessel a stream
of scented oil."
This I found was absolutely the case. I had scaroely finished an
expression of my admiration of this sensible, if somewhat costly
arrangement, when a Purser approached, and bowing obsequiously,
requested the honour of my presence at dinner.
"We dine early, Sir," he explained, "but I hope that the menu
will meet with your approval.
A glance at the bill of fare which commenced with oysters and
turtle-soup and ended with'soroe souffle and the pick-me-up Surprise
Sarah Bernhardt, re-assured me.
"And what may you charge for this ?" I asked.
"Nothing, Sir, replied the Purser, seemingly hurt at such a
question, "it is included in the tuppence. I hope you will find the
wines good. We still have some Perier Jouet of "74 that is drink-
able."
"And is the wine also included in the tuppence?"
"Assuredly."
I must confess that I found the dinner, both in viands and liquors,
all that it should be. Moreover, there were several extremely
pleasant persons dining at the same time, who welcomed my appear
ance with great cordiality. One was a Duke, another a Lord Justice
of Appeal, a third a distinguished General. I will not disclose the
purport of our conversation, merely remarking that from an Imperial
point of view, it was of the profoundest importance.
After dinner, I strolled into an admirable smoking saloon furnished
in the most luxurious fashion. Lounges of russia leather, tables of
marqueterie, and walls covered with costly paintings. There was a
grand piano in the centre of the room, at which a popular entertainer
was presiding, and in the distance I could see a Hungarian
band tuning up and ready to commence playing whenever its services
were needed.
On deck there was an awning of fine purple velvet, that protected
the passengers from the inclemency of the weather. In fact, nothing
could have been better or more complete than the arrangements of
this marvellous vessel.
Day after day, for weeks and months, I used to catch The Peerless
Pcrceral, and travel by her from the Temple Stairs to Battersea. I
picked up a number of most useful acquaintances on board, and,
owing to their influence, obtained the post I now occupy of Inspector
General of Pauper Imbeciles. Nothing could have heen more real
and substantial than my connection with the boat, and for each
journey I took I invariably paid the sum of twopence.
After awhile I indulged in a month's holiday in Switzerland. On
my return home, I put in an appearance at my office, and at my
usual time walked on to the Temple Pier. To my surprise, only one
of the ordinary boats drew up beside the barge at the appointed
hour.
"Isn't The Peerless Perceval still running P" I asked the Money-
takei, with some show of annoyance.
"The Peerless what ?" interrogated the official.
"Why The Peerless Perceval f" I repeated. "The steamer with
the excellent dinner, the morocco couches, the velvet awning,
the"
"What are you talking about?" interrupted the Money-taker.
"I know nothing of The Peerless Perceval."
And, on my word of honour, from that day to this I have never
been able to discover the vessel.
One word in conclusion. I have often been asked " if this story is
absolutely true?" I need not point out that such a question is
really an insult, although I must admit that my narrative is indeed
strange and perplexing. But to set all doubts at rest, I solemnly
declare that I nave told this story for the last twenty years—nay
more—that I never remember a time when I did not tell this story.
Yet further still—from what I have been assured by those upon
whose veracity I would stake my very life, I have every reason for
believing that this story was told hundreds of years ago by ray grand-
father before me! Need I say after this that it is distinctly true,
and can absolutely be relied upon?
THE BURGLE SONG.
(Not by Tennyson.)
Night's shadow falls on villa walls,
A ladder's up to the top story;
The host, sans quakes, his dinner takes,
The modern burglar's in his glory.
Go, burglar, go, bedroom windows trying.
Go, burglar, handy jemmy plying, plying, plying!,
0 hark, 0 hear! They 're roused, I fear,
From dinner, and we must be going.
The door we bar, we '11 be afar
Ere they succeed the gaff in blowing.
Go! Don't you hear sire shouting, son replying?
Go,'burglar, down the ladder flying, flying, flying!
Oh. hang it! Why will the fool try
To run me down? He's too dashed clever.
Confound his soul! That bullet-hole
Will stop his little game for ever.
Go, burglar, go, like the dickens flying,
And lie there, plucky citizen, dying, dying, dying!
HARD TRAINING
Or, How we Reach the Suburbs.
It must be already quite six degrees below zero in this com-
partment!
Is it possible that this is one of the patent new Refrigerating
Chambers for the foreign Dead Meat trade, into which we have been
put by mistake P
I hardly think that can be the case, because they are always
extremely punctual with trucks of "perishables" for the London
markets, whereas this train is already two hours and fifteen minutes
behind time.
The Company, by carefully omitting to supply foot-warmers or
other life-saving appliances in winter, must surely class its
passengers as " impenshables."
I see they are going to introduce " combustible bricks" to warm
cabs. I should like to have half a one here to express my opinion
of the Directors with.
That must be the sixth fog-signal that we have run over in the
last two minutes. I should feel more assurance of our safety if the
Guard had not jnst confidentially assured me that "he was blowed
if he knew whereabouts we were on the blessed line."
What is the difference between the Manager and passengers by
late trains in this weather ?—He is knighted, and they are benighted!
Original Shakstearian Reading.—The Observer of last 8unday,
in an article on billiards, quoted Cleopatra's invitation to Charmian,
"Let's to billiards" (Act II., Sc. 5, Ant. and Cleo.), as an ana-
chronism. We should have thought that any student of the Bard
knew by this time that the original—very original—reading in the
first Folio was, "Let us to Pyramids," which, of course, in the
mouth of the Egyptian Queen, is peculiarly appropriate.

AN EPICURE'S EXPOSTULATION.
[It is rumoured that an English Company U trying to pur-
chase from the Chart reux Honks the secret and monopoly of the
liqueur known as " Chartreuse."]
What, toss the daintiest digestive made
Into the venal vortex of mere Trade,
Like coarser liquors such as gin or Guincss's?
Too horrible a prospect! Brothers brave,
See to it, and your sovereign cordial save
From the dire fate its eminence that menaces.
As soon should high Olympus stoop to sell
The secret of its Nectar, kept so well
For aeons, to some mere terrestrial Syndicate.
No, Brothers of St. Bruno, with disdain
Keject the bid of the base thralls of gain,
And the world's faith in your monopoly vindicate.
What, buy you up P Such outrage ne'er was known!
No more I'd sip my chaste of verte orjaune
Without suspicion of adulteration.
Chartreuse would be a sham like much champagne.
Let no such dismal degradation stain
The loved liqueur's long standing reputation!
Is not the golden glory of the flask,
Its virgin verdant splendour, I would ask
Too choice a boon to sacrifice to "siller "?
That magic draught where old-world skill enweaves
Absinthium, pine-buds, and carnation leaves,
Still leave to the Carthusian distiller!
At the Lyceum.—We are very glad to hear that
Mr. Irving is recovering from his severe cold, and by
the time this appears we trust he will have re-appeared.
It was odd that when Mr. Irving had to resign for a few
nights the part of Macbeth, on account of huskiness of
throat, the onlv actor capable of filling his place was
one who was Wheezin'. Macbeth should have been

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Manufacture of a New Explosive.—By all means continue
your experiments with your recently discovered compound Thunderite.
if you possibly can, at the quiet little village in Essex to which you
refer. It is, of course, rather unfortunate that in your pursuit of
science, you should have blown off the church steeple, knocked the
front out of the Vicarage, and more or less wrecked every house
within a mile and a half of you, and, as you allege that six ounces
of your material will blow up the Houses of Parliament, perhaps,
under the circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that the neigh-
bours generally object to your keeping fifty tons of it stored in
a barn which you admit is so dark, that, even in the day-time, you
have to enter it with a lighted candle. On the whole, it woula be
your wisest course to temporise with them, for they must be now
tolerably familiar with your proceedings, and accustomed to the dis-
turbance. Whereas, it you were to take up your residence in a
crowded back-street in a London suburb, and continue your operations
there, and as an advertisement lay the entire neighbourhood in ruins,
as you propose, you might really sooner or later come into disagree-
able collision with the local Authorities. With regard to the farmer's
family that have all gone stone deaf from the noise, you might, per-
haps have an aurist down to look at them. Take no notice of the
complaint about the stunned pig. If the Vicar is "nasty" about
the steeple, meet him in a jocular vein, and no doubt he will come
round. It would, perhaps, be as well not to unroof the church—at
least at present. Still, we congratulate you on the success that has
attended your experiments, and shall be glad to hear from you later
how you have been getting on.
Haunted House.—We do not think that if you were to refuse to
pay your rent, on the plea that you had been worried by the appari-
tion you mention, that you would gain your case. Of course it is
annoying to have your study invaded as you describe by the little
man in the faded yellow coat and bag-wig, who shakes his head at
you three times mournfully, and then says, with a sigh, "It's the
mustard that did it!" but, after all, you nave your remedy in your
own hands. Why don't you bonnet him with the waste-paper basket,
or throw the inkstand, or something, at him? Spectres can't stand
this. The funeral procession of monks, that used always to walk
along the great picture-gallery at Gurmoyle on the eve of the heir
going through the Bankruptcy Court, was set upon, on the last occa-
sion of its appearance, by a young fellow staying in the house, and
well whacked into with a cricket-bat, and it has never been seen
since. Try the inkstand.
"LE BRAV' GENERAL."
General Boulanger sings from La Qrande Duchesse:—
"Et pif, paf, pouf,
Et tare, para, poum.
Je suis moi, le General Bourn, Bourn!"
Is this going to be the next "big Boom?" The twenty-seventh
is not far off.
The Drama in America.—It was not to be supposed that the
cry raised by the American actors for the protection of their
stage by the exclusion of their English confreres would not extend,
and it is now said that the playwrights are about to follow suit.
Nothing British is to be put up in the States at all. That this
will exclude Shaxspeire doesn't seem to daunt the native talent,
which feels itself quite equal to the occasion, and more than
one genius is already at work preparing to fill up the gap. They
have, as a matter of course, turned to some of his plots, regarding
them as common property. Two Gentlemen of Verona, for
instance, will be utilised as Three Gentlemen of Chicago, and
Hamlet will figure as The High Falutin Dane, or the United State
of Denmark. Macbeth becomes The 'Cute Thane of Cawdor, or
the Bustin up of Duncan, and Richard III. figures simply as
Bosworth Dick, Duke of New York. A version of Othello will be
given under the title of the Venetian Nigger, or the Kentucky Cuss
on the Spree, while one of the Tempest, somewhat modified by local
colouring, will be produced under the name of The Blizzard. If the
above programme be regarded as a sample, the Genius of the'' States"
may be said to be asserting itself.

PLAY-TIME.
Irene, the Ballet at the Alhambra, is both pretty and brilliant.
The second and third tableaux are full of life and variety,—the

"BaUet-Hauly!"
Neapolitan scene being especially good. M. Jacobi's musio is most
dramatic. He has done his work as thoroughly as if he had been
writing for voices instead of legs,
and yet it is ballet-dance music in
toe-toe. It receives excellent inter-
pretation from Signora Cossio,
Signorina Legnani, who must have
invented this name specially for
London, and Miles. Marie and Cor-
mani, who, as intelligent panto-
mimists, act as much of a story as
the hard - and - fast Music - hall
licensing system will permit. I don't
understand the law on the subject.
Mayn't Hamlet be played as a Ballet
at a Music Hall P—or must a Ballet
be without an intelligible and consis-
tent plot? The Ballets that used to
be done here years ago, always in the
reign of King Jacobi (without whom
the Alhambra couldn't exist) were
perfect plays in Pantomime. The
details of the story, therefore, of
Irene are necessarily a trifle con-
fused; but the costumes are splendid,
the grouping harmonious, the "go"
of it never flags, and the result is
complete success. The second Ballet
is very graceful, but this has been on
its legs for some time. Mr. James
Fawn, the Timid Fawn, in his Policeman's song, is very amusing,
or as Mr. Wagstatf would say, "very fawny." Altogether, a good
Entertainment.

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
SECOND EVENING.
"The other afternoon," began the Moon, "soon after I had got
up, I peeped through the windows of a smoking compartment in a
train that was approaching Dover. There was only one person in
the compartment, and he was lying back luxuriously, smoking his
cigar, and fixing his eyes upon my golden disc
with a sentimental expression—but I am accus- 'T, •'|ja"Y^' iM'
tomed to being looked at in that way, and I know j^^Kfry*
that it does not mean very much in most oasts. jgjgjMSj1
He had a reason for looking sentimentally at me - '-iwF*
just then, however—for I was his honeymoon.
Naturally, he felt very happy; the long, tiring
business of marrying, and drinking champagne,
and making the right answers to congratulating
friends, and saying good-bye, and getting all the rice out of his
collar was over—his wife, his own dear little bride, was in the
carriage immediately behind, with Punch and the illustrated papers
to amuse her, and ne was enjoying a cigar that seemed to possess
a fragance more exquisite than he had ever known—for he was
a great smoker, and this was the first tobacco he had tasted all
that day. And every now and then he took his cigar from
his lips, and smiled, and kissed his hand to me (I told you there
was nobody elso in the compartment), and murmured 'Darling!'
over and over again. I heard him quite plainly, but I am not
quite sure that he said it to me. And the train rushed on,
screaming over the glinting rails; and when they came to collect
the tickets, I saw the bridegroom throw away nis cigar with a
sigh, for there was not time enough to smoke another. At last the
train stopped at the long pier beside which lay the white-funnelled
steamer fretting impatiently to be off; and he got together his bag
and his dressing-case, which were quite new, and very splendid
(love and happiness had made him careless about expense), and leaped
joyfully out. He looked everywhere for his bride—in vain; in the
carriage where he had put her so tenderly, Punch and the other
papers were still lying, (your paper, if you will forgive me for
mentioning it," said the Moon, rather maliciously, "was not even
cut), but nowhere was* his darling to be seen. Only by-and-by
her trunks came tumbling out of the van with the brand-new
initials on their tops staring at him in ghaBtly mockery. Soon the
Guard came up, and informed him that the lady had got out of the
train at the first stopping-place, and left a note for him. I read
it over his shoulder, for it was quite short. '7 have gone back to
Mother's,' I think it said. 'You will enjoy your honeymoon
better without me. I am really not prepared to play gooseberry to a
cigar.' What the last words meant I don't know, said the Moon,
"but they seemed to make him very angry. The last glimpse I
had of him was when he was telling the Pier-master to hold his
tongue, and the Guard not to be a fool; and then he strode away to
the telegraph offioe, cursing the selfishness of women."
Punch's Short and Straight Tip to the New London
County Council.
The days of Bumble and corruption number,
Monopoly let the land no longer cumber.
Nor bid the question of Town Slums to slumber.
Yield not to Party Spirit or Class Snobbery,

But come down hard on robbery and on jobbery.

And our new Board will well deserve its lodging.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Christmas Day.-
THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
December 24.—I am a poor man, but I would gladly give ten
shillings to find out who sent me the insulting Christmas card I
received this morning. I never insult people; why should they insult
me? The worst part of the transaction is—
that I find myself suspecting all my friends.
The handwriting on the envelope is evidently
disguised, being written sloping the wrong way.
I cannot think either Gowing or Cummings would
do suoh a mean thing. Lupin denied all know-
ledge of it, and I believe him, although I dis-
approve of his laughing and sympathising with
the offender. Mr. Franching would be above
such an act, and I don't think any of the Mur-
laks would descend to such a course. 1 wonder
if Pitt, that impudent clerk at the office, did it?
Or Mrs. Birrell, the charwoman. The writing
is too good for the latter.
We caught the 10"20 train at Paddington, and
Bpent a pleasant day at Carrie's Mother's. The country was quite
nice and fresh, although the roads were sloppy. We dined in the
middle of the day, just ten of us, and talked over old times. If
everybody had a nice uninterfering mother-in-law, such as I have—
what a deal of happiness there would be in the world. Being all in
good spirits, I proposed her health, and I made, I think, a very good
speech. I concluded rather neatly by saying, "On an occasion like
this, whether relatives, friends, or acquaintances, we are all inspired
with good feelings towards each other. We are of one mind, and
think only of love and friendship. Those who have quarrelled with
absent friends should kiss and make it up. Those who happily have
not fallen out can kiss all the same." I saw the tears in the eyes of
both Carrie and her Mother, and must say I felt very flattered by
the compliment. That dear old Reverend John Panzy Smith, who
married us, made a most cheerful and amusing speech, and said he
should act on my suggestion respecting the kissing. He then walked
round the table and kissed all the ladies, including Carrie. Of
course one did not object to this, but I was more than staggered when
a young fellow named Moss, who was a stranger to me and who had
scarcely spoken a word through dinner, jumped up suddenly with a
sprig of mistletoe, and exclaimed. "Hulloh! 1 don't see why I
shouldn't be on in this scene." Before one could realise what he was
about to do, he kissed Carrik and the rest of the ladies. Fortunately
the matter was treated as a joke, and we all laughed, but it was a
dangerous experiment, and I felt very uneasy for a moment as to the
result. I subsequently referred to the matter to Carrie, but she
said, "Oh, he's not much more than a boy." I said that he had a
very large moustache for a boy. Carrie replied, " I didn't say he
was not a nice boy."
December 26.—I did not sleep very well last night—I never do in
a strange bed. I feel a little indigestion, which one must expect at
thia time of the year. Carrie and I returned to Town in the
evening. Lupin came in late. He said he enjoyed his Christmas,
and added, "I feel as fit as a Lowthcr Arcade fiddle, and only
require a little more ' oof' to feel as fit as a £500 Stradivarius.
I have long since given up trying to understand Lupin's slang, or
asking him to explain it.
December 27.—I told Lupin I was expecting Gowing and Cum-
mings to drop in to-morrow evening for a quiet game. I was in
hope the boy would volunteer to stay in, ana help to amuse them.
Instead of which he said, "Oh, you had better put them off, as I
have asked Daisy and Frank Mutlar to come." I said I could not
think of doing such a thing. Lupin said, "Then I will send a wire,
and put off Dais;." I suggested that a post-card or letter would
reach her quite soon enough, and would not be so extravagant.
Carrie, who had listened to the above conversation with apparent
annoyance, directed a well-aimed shaft at Lupin. She said,
"Lupin, why do you objeot to Daisy meeting your father's friends?
Is it because they are not good enough for her, or (which is equally
possible) the is not good enough for them?" Lupin was dum-
founded, and could make no reply. When he left the room I gave
Carrie a kiss of approval.
December 28.—Lupin, on coming down 'to breakfast, said to his
mother, "I have not put off Daisy and Frank, and should like
them to join Gowing and Cummings this evening." I felt very
pleased with the boy for this. Carrie said, in reply, "I am glad
Sou let me know in time, as I can turn over the cold leg of mutton,
ress it with a little parsley, and no one will knew it has been cut."
She further said she would make a few custards, and stew some
pippins, so that they would be cold by the evening. Finding Lupin
in good spirits, I asked him quietly if he really had any personal
objection to either Gowing or Cummings. He replied, "Not in the
least I think Cummings looks rather an asB, but that is partly due
to his patronising 1 the three-and-six-one-prioe hat company,' and
wearing a reach-me-down frock coat. As for that perpetual brown
velveteen jacket of Gowing's—why, he resembles an itinerant pho-
tographer." I said it was not the coats that made the gentlemen;
whereupon Lupin, with a laugh, replied, "No, and it wasn't much
of a gentleman who made their coats." We were rather jolly at
supper, and Daisy made herself very agreeable, especially in the
earlier part of the evening, when she sang. At supper, however,
she said, "Can you make Tee To Turns with bread?" and she com-
menced rolling up pieces of bread, and twisting them round'on the
table. I felt this to be bad manners, but of course said nothing.
Presently Daisy and Lupin, to my disgust, began throwing bread
Sills at each other. Frank followed suit, and so did Cummings and
owing, to my astonishment. They then commenced throwing
hard pieces of crust, one piece catching me on the forehead, and
making me blink. I said, "Steady, please, steady!" Frank
jumped up and said, "Turn, turn, then the band played." I did
not know what this meant, but they all roared, and continued the
bread-battle. Gowing suddenly seized all the parsley off the cold

a stop should be put to this foolery at onoe. Frank Mutlar
shouted, "Time, Gentlemen, please, time!" and turned out the gas,
leaving us in absolute darkness. I was feeling my way out of the
room, when I suddenly received a hard intentional punch at the
back of my head. I said, loudly, "Who did that? There was
no answer, so I repeated the question, with the same result. I struck
a match, and lighted the gas. They were all talking and laughing,
so I kept my own counsel; but, after they had gone, I said to
Carrie, "The person who sent me that insulting post-card at
Christmas was here to-night."
HOW LONDON WAS DEFENDED.
(A Prophetic Legend, as probable as any other.)
The combined German, Russian, and French Armies were steadily
advancing. Kensington, which extended to Richmond on the West,
Dorking on the South, and St. Albans on the North, had been
captured, and the invaders had got as far as Charing Cross, where
they had bivouacked for the night. In spite of their near approach,
Field Marshal Punch was calm and confident. He ascended to the
roof of his Emporium, which extended northward from St. Bride's
Church, and examined the electro-magnetic speaking-trumpets.
They were in perfect order.
"Fire one off," said the Field Marshal to the Chief of his Staff,
and in a second a joke—a gigantic joke—was sent pealing for miles
towards the sea. There came back reverberations of laughter from
Stepney, Tilbury, Southend, Ramsgate, and Dover.
"We have nothing to fear so long as our ammunition lasts," cried
the General Commanding in Chief, well [pleased with the result of
the trial shot. "Where are the Interpreters?"
Three persons, of foreign appearance, presented themselves. They
had been sitting beside the gigantic speaking-trumpets, on a pile of
volumes. They held in their hands a dictionary, a grammar, and an
Ollendorff.
"You understand your instructions?" demanded the Field
Marshal.
"Certainly," was the reply, given in three languages. One of
the Interpreters answered in German, another in French, the last in
Russian.
"As the great Napoleon once observed," continued Punch,
"C'estbien!1'
Then the day broke, and the early morning sun, shining through
the fog, showed the advancing armies. They marched down the
Strand, they seized the Law Courts, they occupied Drury Lane
Theatre (after a severely contested battle with Lord Mayer Augustus
Harris), and at length poured into Fleet Street.
"Fire!" shouted Punch; and in a moment the volumes were
opened, and the three Interpreters, each in a different language,
began to read the words of witty wisdom into the gigantio speaking-
trumpets. There were shrieks and groans—and then all was still!
An "hour later the Duke of Wolseley rushed up to the Field-
Marshal, and throwing himself into his arms, wept upon his shoulder
with gratitude.
"Why this emotion, your Grace?" asked the Commander-in-
Chief.
"Because," sobbed out the emotional author of the Soldier's
Pocket-book, "I am so happy and so grateful. The combined
armies are no more."
"They are dead?" queried Punch.
"Yes, every man Jack of them," continued the Britannia Metal
Duke. "When they heard your jokes, my Field-Marshal, thun-
dering down Fleet Street in three different languages, it was too
much for them. Not one has escaped. The Germans, the Russians,
and French, have all died of laughter!"
And thus London was saved!

DOG FASHIONS FOR 1889.
Doroupine, Crocodachshund, Pomme-de-Terrikr (Black-axd-Tax), Ventre-a-Terrier (Scotch), Hippopotamian Bulldog,
German Sausage Doo Hedge-dog. {By Our Special Dog-fancier.)
SLOW—BUT NOT SURE.
"As for Germany, the must also bo content to march slowly and cautiously
in the colonial path, with all its side issues."
Prince Bitmarck in the Beichstag.
One might say, "0 Chanoellor Otto, where you go mit yourself
alone?"
As was asked of Breithann's Hugo by " de maiden mit nodings on.''
And if Otto answered frankly—though our Otto will scarce do jo—
He would probably make admission that he doesn't exactly know.
For it is not easy-going in Afrio's swampy brakes,
And doubt besets the tracker at every step he takes;
For there are reedy mazes, and tangles of snaking roots,
And the foul swamp ooze is trying to the stoutest of leathern boots.
Slow? Cautious P Yes, my Otto, and the heavy Teuton tramp
Suits better the field of battle than the slush of the dismal swamp.
The biggest of beetle-crushers most ponderously " put down "—
Won't serve in the dank morasses where Behemoth might drown.
Yet the game is worth the candle, or so you affect to think,
And though you may flop and flounder, yon cannot afford to sink,
Like that foolish Sitter Hugo, who was so completely done
By the rascally Rhine " meer-maid, vot hadn't got nodings on."
You are not a credulous Ritter, but a " Bummer " brave and bold,
And much more given to selling than open to being sold,
With your motto Blood and Iron," and your maxim " Do ut det:"
But what is your game, my Otto, in perilous paths like these?
The quarry "Colonial Empire"? Well, Otto, you know what's
what;
And the Teuton has struck its trail, Otto, and you must follow its
slot,
Awhile, awhile, at any rate. Alone? That is hardly known.
"I ton t dink mooch of beoplesh dat goes mit demselfs alone,"
Said that artful minx the Mermaid, and she "had" the Ritter fine,
And yon 're artful, my Teuton Titan, as any nymph of Rhine,
And John Bull is a handy neighbour, if he '11 but go hand in hand
On the path you want to travel in this swart and swampy land,
Which nis foot is much more used to than your own big-booted
feet;
Big game he's used to tracking, and on freedom he is sweet.
'Tis a foolish fad, this latter, which you 're far too 'cute to share,
But if he's prepared to pay for it, why, that is his own affair.
By a little seeming sympathy—for a time—he may be won.
It's remarkably like the little game of "de maiden mit nodings on "!
"First creep, then go," my Otto, is a maxim old and wise,
And you 're very fond of maxims, big boor with the bulbous eyes;
A " grenadier on a window-pane" is not your mark, that's clear!
But the Richtebs and Bambergers, and other such small deer,
Must not appear to triumph. Of course 'tis not your plan
To attack the right of property (so ancient) of man in man."
If John Bull likes to think so, or if Salisbury oan persuade
His master to believe you, and to lend his useful aid
To a sort of sham Crusader in an awkward kind of mess,
With his head in a brake and his boots in a bog, it may help you to
sucoess.
Meanwhile 'tis "fair and softly!" Big game is the hunter's lure.
Slow is your progress, Otto; but is it quite so sure?
John Bull looks on, my Otto, with an air of some surprise;
But is it sheer credulity that gleams in his keen grey eyes P
Whatever 8alisbuby may say, or do, John makes shrewd guess
At the Teuton Tracker's real game, and he reads the Reptile Press.
"You helpsh yourself, by doonder;" said " de maiden mit nodings
on;" [down."
"Dat fetched" the Ritter Hugo, and "she pooled his coat-tails
But John's coat-tails are stoutish, and whoso hangs on thereto
Will find, I think, that to make him sink needs a heavier weight
than you!
Coal Dues, of which we all desire the cessation.—City fog
and filth, which are certainly largely due to Coal!
To Blatant Boanerges.
It the Kingdom advanced, 0 belligerent Booth,
By hysterical hisses and bellowing boys P
Is the victory of Shindy the triumph of Truth,
And the Gospel of Peace an Evangel of Noise P
'Tis the sweet " Still small Voice " that can purge, guide, reform,
And that came amidst silence, and not in the storm.

TOMMY'S TURK.
Younu Tommy had a turban'd Turk,
A model toy, a birthday token;
You wound him up, and wateh'd him work—
Till he got broken.
His head would wag, his eyes would roll,
He moved his arms with gesture stately,
And played a dozen antics droll,
Which pleased us greatly.
The idol of the chattering^crowd,
He acquiesced in every notion,
And with unfailing tact allow'd
Our deep devotion.
He ruled, a despot kind and strong,
The nursery's turbulent tribesmen swaying,
Till something with his works went wrong,
And he ceased playing.
None can tell how. His subjects set
Such store upon his fellow-feeling,
That they were likely to forget
Mere wires and wheeling.'
Did Willy's killing kindness press
Down the reluctant Paynim's thrapple
Those crumbs of cake, and watercress,
And bits of apple?
Did Cissle, curious child of Eve,
Seek to explore his inmost being,
And, frightened, her researches leave
Unblest with seeing ?|
Or Mab, who duty never shirks.
An advocate of Western polish,
Had dreams perchance of teaching Turks
To speak in Dollish.
For all the dolls at home can speak,
And, on the slightest provocation,
Engage, with ventriloquial squeak,
In conversation.
And she, belike, essay'd to teach
The unresponsive Asiatic,
And caused, instead of answering si>eeeh,
Reserve rheumatic.
He sits, serene as other Turks,
In faultless Oriental vesture;
But never since they hurt his works
Has changed a gesture.
0 Tommy's Turk, your fate and mine
Are by a mystic bond united,
And neither of us gives a sign
Of being blighted.
On Southern shores the waters fair
Murmur their office pure and priestly,
And Elsie flirts and dances there ;—
It's simply beastly.
Unmoved I meet my daily lot,
Mechanically eat my dinner,
Indifferently lose a "pot,"
Or back the winner;
Waltz with dear Mrs. Bumblebee,
Although no normal arm can span her—
Fat, fair, and fortiter in re,
And suave in manner.
Or to Miss Jonquil on the stairs,
Where Elsie shone a drift of whiteness,
Pour out the unexpressive pray'rs
Of pure politeness.
And if our fingers chance to touch,
If I gaze fondly at her tresses,
It is because their taste is much
The same in dresses.
1 '11 hie away to Gamlingay,
Chester-le-Street, or Therpe-le-Soken;
I cannot work; like Tommy s Turk,
My springs are broken.
HARDY SUCKERS.
SiRj—I am sure all your readers will be
gratified to hear of the extraordinarily mild
season we are having at Fossilton-on-the-
Sludge. While in other places tender plants
have gone to the Conservatory (or gone to
pot), here my thermometer frequently registers
80 degrees; I am quite certain of the fact,

BURGLARY TALK.
At a Suburban Dinner Party.
I think we may say that we have taken every possible precaution.
Yes, that is a Detective enveloped in that drawing-room curtain.
I am told that the spring window-bells connected with the electric wire apparatus will act
instantly on the slightest touch.
You would hardly Buppose it, but those geranium-beds on the lawn are prepared an dynamite
spring-traps to blow up at the merest foot-fall.
I hope all our guests will get in safely. It would be really very awkward were any of
them to be shot at coming up the garden-path.
Ha! I am glad to see the dear old Colonel has wisely taken the precaution of putting on
a cuirass under his shirt.
Are all the six-chambered revolvers duly loaded, and placed in the dinner-napkins?
Those ship's cutlasses slung over the backs of your respective chairs are only for self-
protection in case of any sudden surprise.
By the baying of the six highly- trained
bloodhounds that I keep in the stables, I
should say that burglars were already about.
I wonder why that female servant has
gone into hysterics on the floor above.
Dear me I this is very odd, but all the
bed and dressing-room doors appear to be
locked on the inside.
I do not think that we can get out of the
house to see what is the matter until we
remove these wire fastenings which are
evidently meant to peg us in.
If the male guests would make a simul-
taneous rush for it and jump thirteen feet
from the drawing-room window, they
might, perhaps, manage to see what is
going on outside.
To judge from the reports of those pistols,
quite a battle-royal must be in progress on
the lawn.
Ha! there goes the dear old Colonel right
on to his head, having been tripped up by
a concealed wire.
It is strange, but the burglars seem to
have escaped over the garden-wall with my
wife's jewel-case, and £350 in gold and
notes that was lying about on her dressing-
table.
I am glad to know that the Doctor
reports hopefully on the condition of five
of the seven wounded guests for whom I
have had to turn my dining-room into a
temporary hospital.
It I had only known at half-past six
yesterday evening that two o'clock this
morning would find me in this uncomfort-
able condition, I certainly would have post-
poned my little dinner.
Ha! at last, here is the one Policeman in

GOOD NEWS TOR GHOSTS.
(By Our Own Bogey.)
"The Mayor and Corporation of Hastings have
determined to spend a thousand pounds on sink-
ing a well at a spot indicated by an operator with
a divining-rod.''—St. Jamet'i Gazette.
It really seems extremely odd,
This use of a divining-rod,
In Eighteen-eighty-nine;
If folks upon the Southern coast
Go on like this, they'd love a ghost—
A chance for me and mine.
I've been of late a little out
Of fashion, and began to pout
To find, in shilling books,
The smart detective take my place,
The hero of some murder case,
"With not a thought of "spooks."
Yet, bless you, in the olden time,
'Twas I that did discover orime,
And now it's rather hard,
To find the work by others done.
I think that I '11 bring up my son
To serve in Scotland Yard.
Yet here's a chance, I will uprear
My phantom form on Hastings Pier,
And haunt the Sussex shore:
If hazel rods lead men a dance,
There should, I fancy, be a chance
For able ghosts once more.
Apples and Pears' Goddesses.—In the
'' Pears' Beauty Show," now just announced,
it cannot be an apple which is to be given
to the fairest. Yet, if Mr. Pears is to be

Goddesses. He '11 have to use a lot of soft-
soap «n the unsuccessful candidates, who
will each be taken singly in this Exhibition
of Pears. Hope it will all end Applely.

MIDDLE-AGED MASTERS AT THE GROSVENOR.
Why, eert'nly. You have often heard of the Old Masters, and
you have frequently looked at the Young Masters (and, for the
matter of that, the Young Misses as well—but let us be serious).
Here we have a collection of pictures
between 1737 and 1837. Assuredly
not Old Masters — presumably not
young; therefore they must be
Middle-aged! Ha! ha! Never
heard of 'em before P Oh, haven't
Jou? Have you not heard of Sir
os hi-a Reynolds, Romney,
Hooabth, Cotman, Crome—not the
inventor of Chromo-lithography—
Wilkte, James Ward, Turner,
MORLAND, StOTHARD, BONINGTON,
Constable, Etty, Lawrence,
Wilson, Hoppner, Blake, and De
Loutherbourg? Now you know
what the Middle-aged Masters are.
They have not the mellow majesty
of the Old, or the superficial skit-
tishness of the New; but they have
Private and Confidential. many e™eUent qualities of their
own, which may be studied to very
great advantage. In this pleasant Gallery you will find more
than three hundred speoimens of this particular period of British
Art. Some will astonish you, and others will hugely delight
you. Among the latter you will find specimens by one Sir Josht/a
Reynolds, and one George Romney, which you would find
difficult to beat among the Old Masters or the New. Among a
number of curiosities in a glass case is a dead field-mouse, that John
Constable sat on. This was probably a critic of the day. We
wonder what Constable's sitting-weight could be, for the poor
mouse is flattened out like a fern-leaf in a Family Bible. Constable,
having taken him up, seems to have put him down most effectually.

LITERAL LYRICS.
The Pork King's Daughter and the Impecunious Duke,
Euphrates Titus Blazer, U. S. A., reflected
"I guess I 've cornered—wal, successfully iD pork;
And my financial status is, you bet, respected
In circles slicing slightly bigger than New York."
And then he called his daughter to him, just remarking,
"Look here, my gal, as you will have a pretty pile,
And no doubt air prospecting matrimonial larking.
We '11 cross the pond and go a reglar bust in style.
For dollars can do anything across that water.
So, though, there's oatches here that might be fixed up tit,
A British nob's the lead for E. T. Blazer's daughter,—
For, darn them and their titles—they are real grit."
Thereon they crossed the pond, and found themselves located
In princely circumstances at the Metropole,
And E. T. Blazer was delighted and elated
To find how much on this side dollars could control.
His every word was listened to as very weighty
By all who sought his pleasant company to gain,
He drenched his friends in Pommery and Greno, eighty;
Each new acquaintance was cemented with Champagne.
He paid his way. He purchased friends by scores. Was caught up,
Asked out, invited, toadied, fawned on everywhere.
He spent his dollars freely, and at length he bought up
The entree to a Ducal palace in Mayfair.
It was His Grace of Basinghall's well-known town mansion,
Where things'had formerly been done in royal state,
But where to-day, his income showing no expansion,
The dinners, wines, appointments,—all, were quite third-rate;
In fact its lordly owner simply was restricted
In showing hospitality through lack of means,
For all his tenants paid no rent, aud unevicted
Had thus to wrack and ruin brought his wide demesnes.
His troubles to conceal his Grace made no prof ession;
At Basinghall closed shutters faced an unkempt lawn:
At Mayfair he allowed a man was in possession,
And all the famed ancestral jewels were in pawn.
Nor was this all. His laRt few thousands ho had madly
Invested in a specious beef and ham concern,
And, as the speculation had turned out but sadly,
His Grace at last himself knew not which way to turn.
Then E. T. Blazer saw his chance; approached quite hearty,
And said, "Wal, Mister Dook, you bet, I '11 make your game:
It's flat that you 're a blazin impecunious party,
And so, I guess, I'm fits on purchasing your name.
That means my daughter must be fixed up as your Duchess.'
I dessay that your price will be a tidy one,
And so I've drawn this cheque that seven figures touches.
That squares you! eh?" The Duke reflected, then said "Done!"
So at Mayfair no more a man was in possession,
No longer the ancestral jewels were in pawn;
The Duke, he went it: lived well up to his profession,
And Basinghall again looked on its well-kept lawn.
And at his wedding all Society delighted
Rejoiced exceedingly, and hailed the welcome fluke
That saw, with sound commercial instinct, thus united,
The Pork King's Daughter and the Impecunious Duke.

A GOOD SHILLING'S-WORTH.
At Burlington House. What an interesting collection in Galleries
Nos. II. and III., specially No. III., where we could spend a con-
siderable portion of the day in contemplating the portrait of " Rem-
brandt—by
Himself.f'
Yes,"REM-
brandt,
quite by
himself."
Through
the open
door we
catch Bight
of H.R.H.
the Duke
of Cam-
bridge in
full regi-
mentals',
by the late
Frank
Holl, and turn again, with a sigh of relief, to the study of The
Old Master. Yet two or three of Holl's portraits require only the
finishing touch of the Great Artist, Time, to merit a place not so
very, very far away from the inimitable Rembrandt by Himself.
But "by itself," it will remain! The nearest to it, in the next
room, are Holl's Lord Spencer and Piatti.
In No. II. there is a delightful Jan Steen, lent by Lord North-
urook, showing a Comic Music Hall Singer—a Macdermott or
Leyisourne of tho period—rehearsing a comic song, and chuokling
over the point he is going to make. Mrs. Ram says that " she had
always thought Steen was a painter of marine subjects, so called
from his having been a native of Brighton. If not," she asks, "who
was the Old Steen?"
Look at Jacob Jordaen's No. 78, "A Quiet Dinner.'" Every-
body making a din at table: each one not a host, but a "dinner"
in himself.
Notice 80. By Jan Steen. The Hogarthian details tell the story. It
is called, The Doctor. „
No. 86. Heureux Age. Lent by Mr. Alfred De Rothschild.
A charming Watteau, snowing the infancy of cricket. Pretty design
for a Christmas Card.
No. 89. CaUed a ''Pastoral Scene." By Watteau. All em-
bracing, or trying to. "Where innocence is bliss," as Mrs. Rams-
botham observes. No. 95 is also lent by Sir Richard Wallace,
and represents Gilles, the celebrated Pierrot, playing a guitar.
Happy days! Nothing to do but to pic-nic, sing, dance, make love,
and masquerade! So they danced on until the mask fell off, the
tune changed,—and the time too.
No. 109. A gem of Greuze's, called A Bacchante. From the
view, more like a Frontante. Another characteristic Watteau comes
from Mr. Alfred de Rothschild, L'Accordte du Village. The
centre figure is a dog, who is looking uncommonly knowing. "Every
dog has his day," and this particular dog is evidently having his day
kept by the entire village. He is a lucky dog, feted to be happy.
Here's a Rembrandt, small and early, lent by Mr. Humphry Ward,
representing Robinson Crusoe's great-grandfather. But here we
finish our brief stay, and, before quitting Burlington House, we
must take one last fond look at Rembrandt, by Himself, No. 157,
round the corner. Magnificent! If you've only a quarter of an

belongs to Lord Ilcht

SHAKSPEARE ON THE STREETS.
(See ''King Ueitry the Fourth," Act III., Sc. I.)

"Glendower (to Hotspur). Cousin, of many men,
I do not bear these crossings."
THE BLOOM OF LONDON (COUNTY) PRIDE.
(The Unreported Report of a Meeting that never Met.)
The Council had met, and were considering the election of
Aldermen. There was a goodly gathering, and m the centre sud-
denly appeared a Personage that seemed a combination of leaders
from newspapers, House of Commons speeches, and old traditions.
"I am Public Opinion!" thundered the Personage, and then it
became known that it was the desire of Publio Opinion that the
Councillors should give their individual views on the subject of the
election of Aldermen.
"Well," said the Member for West Marylebone, looking through
Ms pince-nez, and smiling, "I cannot help feeling that some one
should be selected—who has entertained Her Majesty to five o'clock
tea."
"You mean Sir Reginald Hanson," observed the Member for the
Strand, "and I don't agree with you. Give me an Alderman who
can organise a procession that will do credit to the City like"
"Mr. Augustus Harris," put in one Member of the City, with a
sneer. "But you have horses. I know the very man to attend to
them."
"You mean the Earl of Rosebeby," added the other Member for
the City. "Well, perhaps, yes; but horses are not so interesting
as ants or bees. Why not get a good Naturalist, and some one who
admires the Bank Holiday Movement."
"Like Sir John Lubbock, for instanoe," murmured the Member
for Haggerston. "Yes; but we must do something more than look
at horses; we must tackle Mayors—Lord Mayors; and as for ants,
why the aunts of the City Companies (as a Cockney would say)
should be our game. Now, for an Alderman, we could not select
anyone better fitted for the post than that earnest reformer, Mr."
Firth !" lisped the Member for St. George's, Hanover Square.
"I think Firth thould be lasth! Now a Volunteer"
"Who is first-rate at organisation—that's what you mean,"
interrupted the Member for Woolwich. "Yes, I know; but you
won't find him in Howard Vincent— you had better far take me!"
"What's the Hughes 'i " was the frivolous commentary of Public
Opinion—the mood of Public Opinion is very changeable. The
Voice continued, in a more earnest tone—a tone full of gravity, "You
say that the perfect Alderman should be beloved and respected by
Royalty?"
Hear, hear!" cried Sir Reginald.
"And good at pageants."
"Certainly!" ejaculated Augustus Drubiolanus.
"And fond of animals—horses, ants, and bees!"
"So we think," replied Sir John and the Earl.
"And a real reformer, a perfect organiser, and, in fact, a thorough
statesman and philanthropist!"
"Yes, yes! was the universal shout.
"But where will you find a man, who in his own person oombines
all these qualifications?"
There was a dead silence.
"There is only one person in London, England, Europe, the world,
so qualified," continued the Voice of Publio Opinion, "and that
person is"
Then the Power of Public Opinion was exhibited even in the
London County Council, and there was a shout that sounded far and
wide of "Mr. Punch!"
"Yes," assented Public Opinion, "Mr. Punch is the best possible
vol, xevj,
Alderman, as he is the best possible everything else, so would you
escape the ignoble fate of Bumbledom, keep your eye upon Mr. Punch,
and ask him to pull you through."
And with this, Public Opinion disappeared, and the Members of
the London County Council were left (for the moment) to their own
devices, and the cheering influence of their pretty portraite as pub-
lished in the current number of the Illustrated London News.
STORIES OF THE PAST.
My Dear Mb. Punch,
Thebe has been so much correspondence about Links with
the Past, that I think my own experience will be of interest to your
readers. If so, it is heartily at your service.
When I was a lad, I perfectly well recollect being taken on the
shoulders of my grandfather to see Her Majesty Queen Victoria
proceeding in State to Westminster on the occasion of her Jubilee.
My grandfather then told me (as the fireworks were being let off)
that he had spoken to a gentleman who was present at the execution
of King Chables the First.
"How can that be P" I asked, " for according to your own account,
you were not living at the time of the Battle of Waterloo!" which
indeed, was constantly his assertion.
"Iam surprised that you should doubt my word! " replied my
grandfather.
"I doubt your word," I respectfully returned, "because your
story seems so marvellous. It is impossible to believe it!"
"Then, if you do not believe it, it is no use to tell you, that the
man who spoke to my grandfather, and was present at the execution
of Chables the Fibst, was a Baron who had actually signed Magna
Charta!"
'1 You do not say so!" I exclaimed, fairly astounded at the gigantic
jumps we were making from the Present into the Past. "Why, in
two lives about five centuries are covered!"
"Yes, I fancy that is about the right measure," said my grand-
father, musingly, "but I have not entirely exhausted the subject."
"Why did the man who spoke to my great-grandfather at the
execution of Chables the First, and who had signed Magna Charta
years and years before, serve for a further link with the past?"
"Certainly; he was acquainted with persons who knew Richabd
the First intimately, and had himself dined with the first of our
Henries."
"Dear me," I returned, "this is indeed interesting. Then he
might have taken part in the Battle of Hastings P"
"Taken part in the Battle of Hastings?" exclaimed my grand-
father ; "whv, he had not only taken part, but had been killed in
the Battle of Hastings!"
Trusting that this brief recital of undoubted facts may advance the
cause of historical research. I remain, yours sincerely,
An Old-Fashioned Liar.

"New lamps for old!" was a tempting cry;
Where Pleasure beckons, her followers fly;
But, for ardent emulation
For headlong hurry that nought oan restrain,
Is there aught like the modish Pursuitof Gain,
Which fires the mixed multitude drawn in the

Of the Spirit of Speculation?
A winsome Spirit, though wild on the wing,
A Siren, and sweet are the songs she will sing
In the ears of all who listen.
How her smiles invite! How her tresses float
In an aureate trail! How her votaries gloat
On her Danae charms, and delightedly dote
On each golden note
From her argent throat!
How they glow, and gleam, and glisten,
Those eager eyes of the hurrying throng,
Thralls of her witchery, slaves of her song,
Suppliants keen for her kisses!
Follow, follow! The foot that nears
That Golden Witch hath no time for fears.
And Folly follows, nor stops her ears
With the wax of the wise Ulysses.

Moved as though by a single soul.
Beauty draws by a single nair,
But each of her locks is a separate snare,
Floating far in the ambient air.
What is the largess she showers there?
Scrip unlimited, stock and share!
Bubbles to hold?
Mere rainbow gold?
Out upon prudence! Be orave and bold!
No faint heart ever won this fair dame,
With hands like Ophir and eyes like tlame.

She at least hath no gifts for such
As fear her face and flee.
Let them toil in the beaten groove,
Thralls to the Labour they reign to love,
Delve and drudge,
And mouth the fudge
That Thrift doles out to the dolts who trudge
Through Gain's long path, when the fools
might fly.
Winged like the Witch of the wanton eye.
Life is short and Labour long.
Leave dull toil to the dusty throng;
This is the way for the shrewd and strong.
The slow-hived wealth of the moiling mass,
The plodding Issachars, each an ass
Born to grind in the mills of Class,
Make garnered gift
For the wise whose thrift
Is to live on the load that the many lift,
To dredge in the true Pactolean drift,
The stream flows on, but its channels shift;
The wise breast not the flood, but band
The keen of sight and the swift of hand
In Monopoly of the golden sand.
Which years deposit and moments sift,
The Witch knows well, would she only say,
How the harvest of decads is reaped in a day.
Follow, follow! Let her not slip,
Wooers of fortune, thralls of the "tip,"
From Mammon's mansion and gambler's
den,
Lights of the pencil, stars of the pen,
Plungers, flutterers, women and men,
Hangers on to the giants of gain,
Parasites in the Gold King's train,
Slaves of the " Ring," and dupes of the
Rein;
From court, church, counter, come forth, come
forth!
Ho lode-star ever, set high in the North,
Ever so drew,
Pointed so true.
No Siren ever so sang, so flew;
No Circe mustered so motley a crew
From every rank, craft, station.
Harpy is she, or Ariel?
Do her votaries know? Can her victim* tell?
But, known or not, she is worshipped well,
With gold for altars, its chink for bell,
The—Spirit of Speculation!
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Potting up Foreign Guests.—It was, no
doubt, inconsiderate of your brother to have
sent you without notice the Jooeypookah
Cannibal Island Football Team, and expected
you to put them up and provide for them, on
their arrival in England, in your small house
in Leopold Square; still, you seem to have
got on better with them than might have
been anticipated. It will evidently be difficult,
from what you mention, to prevent them
tearing up the stair-carpet and cutting it
into short lengths for purposes of personal
adornment. But why let them through the
house at all P We conclude you have con-
signed them to an upper floor. Let them
only enter or quit this by a fire-escape attached
to one of the windows. You can easily hire
one for the purpose. Try this. By all means,

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON."
Quest. "It's very kind of you to"
Busts. "Oh, we should not have felt comfortable unless we'd come with you,
AND—SKEN THE LAST OF YOU "1 I
in future, feed them on cat's meat, as you propose. With regard to their practice, they
ought, of course, to get this in the square, but as you say they are at present using a
human skull as a football, and as this has apparently terrified all the nursery-maids and
children in the place, and caused a general cry of complaint from the parents, it would be
as well if you could induce them to arrange their time of play somewhere between the
small hours of the morning. Yes, we think you might introduce them between a song of
Signor Damosiis and the Bohemian Bell-ringers as a "special feature" at an afternoon
drawing-room party, but it might be as well to have a dozen policemen handy in the hall,
in case they should suddenly take it into their heads to make an attack upon your guests.
Certainly let them go on to the Parish at the time you mention. You cannot reasonably be
expected to put tbem up for more than a month, or, at most, five weeks.
Whale Culture.—We do not think, that, seeing that you say it is sixteen feet in length,
you will be able to keep the live whale that has just been sent you by your Uncle at Labrador,
in your upstairs cistern. Far your best plan will be to deposit it, as soon as possible, in the
nearest swimming-bath in the immediate neighbourhood of your house. To do this take it
there in a furniture-van, with about sixteen men, whose services you may require at the
baths, as, to prevent the possible interference of the attendants, you may find it necessary to
get the creature at the lost moment in with a rush. Having, therefore, taken the bath ticket
and given the signal, let your sixteen men seize the whale, and making a dash through the
entrance-hall, without waiting to answer any questions, rapidly force their way into the
swimming-bath and consign it to the water. Once there the whale will instantly revive, and
if, on your showing the attendant the ticket for its bath, he appears dissatisfied, you can
try to put him in a good temper by pointing out to him, with a pleasant smile, that at least
it will not require any towels. Yes, we certainly think you cannot do wrong in feeding it on
tinned lobster. Any shilling handbook on the Management of the Whale will tell you this.
Amateur Chimney-Sweeping.—Yes, you can certainly, if you are dissatisfied with his
charges, dispense with the services of your ordinary chimney-sweep, and sweep your own
drawing-room chimney, if you don't mind a little trouble. You have only to collect all the
curtain-poles, broom and mop-sticks, walking-oanes, and umbrellas in the house, and,
strapping them tightly together in a long line, surmounted by the hall door-mat fastened
securely to the top, push this, as well as you can, by degrees, up your drawing-room chimney
—and there you are. If this apparatus, however, as not unfrequently happens, doubles up
and refuses to work, you can still fall back on the Breton plan, which consists in getting on
the roof of your house and letting a Christmas-tree attached to a rope down the chimney to
which you are directing your attention. As this, though a highly efficacious method when
successful, sometimes brings down the entire interior of the chimney itself, it would be well
to exercise some caution in having recourse to it, if you hold your house on a repairing
lease.

•which, as evry body ort to kno, is a great mistake, speshally at a
really grate Bankwet, sich as 1 wunce herd
the Dook of Cambridge say he coudn't get
nowhere but in the City. No, when at
Dinner, nobel Gents, give your hole mind to
it, and resurve your arguing till you gets
your desserts, and then you can do as you
Slease. Well, these 2 unwise Gents was a
isoussing of the old saying that " There's
nothink new under the Sun." One said as
there was, and other said as there warn't.
Well, the thing as the one on 'em said as
was new, was suttenly a staggerer to me as
well as to the other Gent, and it was, that
you ooud now buy most butifnl cordials,
and. nice drinks of many kinds, that tasted
like wine, and looked like wine, and yet
wasn't wine, and woodn't never not make
peeple hintoxioated!
Well, this seemed such a staggerer to me,
that I thort in course as the other Gent wood have thrown up the
sponge at wunce, and confessed hisself beaten. But no, not a bit
of it; on the contrary, he said as the ancient Egipshuns, ewer so
many thowsend years ago, knowed of a certain stone as was called
Giptdler, or sum sich name, which had the wunderfool power of
making water look like wine, aye, and taste like wine! But that
the cunning old Preests kep the secret to theirselves, and it died
when they died 1
Just at this most intrusting moment I was obligated for to leave
them, to attend to other dooties, and I herd no more. But wot a
rewelashun! And the werry fust thing as ocours to me, now,
setting down quiet at tome, is, woodn't a Gent who sat down and
carmly and quietly drunk, say 2 bottels of this innercent wine, be
likely to make the same complaint as the Farmer did when he
had finisht the Bottle of Claret that his Landlord set him down to,
insted of a Bottle of Port, wiz., "that he didn't seem to have got no
forreder?" But a truce to any Bitch fillosophical questyuns as them,
for now turns what I calls a werry strikin fac.
Ony larst week, a gent of the name of Hideess, I thinks it was,
tho' that does sound more like a helderly lady than a middle ages
Gent, called on me to arsk me to dine with him, and a few other gents
of my perfession jest to try a hexperiment as was about to be tried
as to having jest as jolly dinners as are had now, but without not no
hedakes etseterer, etseterer, arterwards.
laterally, most naterally, I hopened both my too eyes with
estonishment and wondered wot was a cummin next. But as he
seemed to be a waiting for me to say sumthink, I Bed, "Afore 8ir
aooeptin your werry perlite inwitashun, I shood most suttenly like
to ether see or hear your 3Iaynoo." "Quite reesonable," says he,
and so he begins: "With your clear Turtel Soop you has jest a small
glass of Maryskeno, and if you much likes it. as you most likely
will, you may have another. Then with your Fish, jest one glass of
1874 Black Currant Wine will be found simply delicious. With the
Ontrays I should give you two or even three glasses of Orange
Shampane, speshall cuvay, which not being werry sweet will jest
suit those who prefer their Shampanes dry. With the Poultry, or
Jint, a glass of Ginger Hale will be found werry refreshing, while,
with the Game, Winter Punch is der regare as the French says.
With the Cheese you will have jest one glass of Orange Bitters,
and then with your Dessert of course you can select from a waried
list of werry old faverits, commencing with fine old Strawberv Syrup
of the celebrated 1880 growth and ending with old Gingerett.
How 1 must have looked when be had finished his owdashus list
1 carnt of coarse say, but my old wisage must have bin summut of a
studdy, for he says, says he, "I don't at all wunder at your look of
hutter estonishment, becos you know we all ether sneers or larfs at
all great dishcoverys at fust. I dessay as your own Farther larfed
at Gas when he fust herd about it, as a good menny peeple does now
at bottling up a speeoh or a song in a box and keeping it till it's
wanted, so don't you let your estonishment prewent your accepting
my hinwitashun, or coming to it with a hunbiassed mind."
Of coarse I didn't see my way to onerably refuse him, and so,
saying ho wood let me know the day and thehower, away he went,
leaving me almost speechless with surprize! We Waiters as is
agreed to go, are to have a meeting a day or so before "the apointed
day," to decide upon what safeguards or prewentives we are to
consume afore we submits ourselves to this orful xperiment, the
effecs of which I hopes I shall live to relate.| Robert.
Mem. by a Voter.
Blectoru. paradox sure is complete:
Every Candidate runs, and yet stands, for a seat.'
A VERY SHADOWY GRIEVANCE.
My Dear Mr. Punch,
You will see by the signature I have appended to this epistle
that at one time I was a peraon of some importance. This is true
enough, for when the Heralds visited my part of the country at the
commencement of the Seventeenth Century, they found my pedigree
written up to date and perfectly correct. As you represent, nowa-
days, all that is good (inclusive of respectability), I venture to
address you in the hope that you will exercise your immense
influence to secure for me justice and relief.
Without entering into unnecessary details, I may hint that circum-
stances over which I have no control, cause me to walk about a
corridor at midnight in a most desirable country mansion clanking
chains and uttering moans of a heartrending character. I am
acoompanied, while making these professional perambulations, by a
female member of my family, who prefers to float through space
minus a head. _ We nave done this sort of thing for more than a
couple of centuries, and have quite grown to like the exercise. After
our walk in the corridor, we usually adjourn for a chat to an apart-
ment that is known as the Red Room. We do not interfere with
anyone, and are perfectly harmless. In fact, 1 fancy that we are
rather an acquisition to the house than otherwise, for certainly, the
estate-agent, who had the letting of the place some time since, made
a great feature of the fact that it was inhabited by a couple of
old-fashioned spectres. I need scarcely say that we are on visiting
terms with all the best county ghosts, and are frequently invited to
spend daybreak in other houses, on such special occasions as the
anniversary of a murder or the foretelling of a family calamity.
From this you will see that we are quite persons to know, and
having claims to universal respect. And until recently our claims
have never been questioned, and this brings me, my dear Mr. Punch,
to my grievance—that the tendency of the age is to ignore ghost-lore.
Times were—and not very long ago—when Christmas brought with
it scores of stories calculated to foster a belief in the weird and super-
natural. Nowadays, if a spectre is introduced into a tale he must
be explained away by natural causes, or treated as a sort of superior
music-hallical experiment, which for the moment has been one too
many for scientific research. Now this treatment has been most
damaging to our reputations as awe-inspirers, and has caused us
considerable annoyance. Of course we do not pretend to perform in
public, still our manifestations have been witnessed by so many of
our descendants, that we have grown accustomed, so to speak, to a
gallery of admiring spectators. Since the adoption of the tone about
us to which I have referred, instead of being impressed by our
appearance, the persons we have haunted have been only moved to
ridicule. But as one substantial proof is worth a dozen theories, I
give an instance, whioh occurred as recently as New Year's Day, in
support of my assertion.
On the 1st instant my female relative and myself, after our usual
performance in the corridor, glided into the Red Room to have a ohat
over old times. This is always to me the pleasantest moment of the
dawn, as I oan talk without interruption, myfemale relative having,
as I have already informed you, no head. When we were standing
in front of the slowly expiring fire I noticed that the room was
occupied. Sitting up in bed was a gentleman, who, instead
of falling into the regulation fit on seeing us, merely gazed
at us earnestly with the assistance of an opera-glass! I
did my best to horrify him. I groaned and rattled my chains,
and my female relative most obligingly made the most of the
absence of her head. But all this had no effect upon him. I
saw that our reputation was at stake, and that a supreme effort
must be made to fill his mind with terror. Leaving my female
relative to entertain him (she has rather a ghastly way of disap-
pearing and reappearing in green fire), I hurried off to beseech
support from those of my ghostly colleagues that I could find in
the neighbourhood. Fortunately, New Year's Day is rather a grand
occasion in our profession, ana I soon whipped up a Knight in
Armour carrying a blood-stained dagger, an old gentleman in the
costume of the period of George the Second, holding a broken
walking-stiok and a snuff-box, two "somethings" in grave-clothes,
and a drowned sailor. With these auxiliaries I returned to the Red
Boom and continued the haunting. The gentleman in the bed
received the knight with a sneer, the old gentleman with a grin, the
two somethings with a " Pooh, pooh!" and the drowned sailor with
an exclamation of vigorous contempt. He gazed at us all for a
moment, and then, putting the opera-glass down, and observing,
"It must be that cheap champagne!" quietly went to sleep! We
then held a meeting, and, in compliance with a resolution thereat
passed, I am writing to you, my dear Mr. Punch, to ask you to do
your best to cause to be restored to us the dignity we prized so
greatly, and which, for the time, we seem to have entirely lost.
I beg to remain, yours, faithfully,
A Well-connected Ghost.

About the best number I've yet seen of Our Cele-
brities; of which the proprietor and monographer is
the eccentrio epigrammatist and merry musician,
Louis Enqel ; the photographist, the accomplished and
artistic Count Walert, of Regent Street; and the
\l€"t mum publishers, Swan and Sonnenschein. What a corps!
Jjyfu/WW^ If that isn't sweetness and light—with Sun-in-shine for
'the photos included—I don't know what is. But to
proceed. Here wo have, first, Emma Albani Gte—not "Woe Emma," but
Gte Emma,"—looking, as she is, "a thing of beauty, which is a Gte for
ever ;" then Canon Duckworth, who, in his academicals, seems an uncom-
monly " big, big D." Of him writes the monographer:—
"Needless to say that his pure English, and full ringing organ, and a very accurate
use of words, stand him in good stead as a preacher."
Perhaps "acourate" is meant to suggest "a curate " as it
was in this subordinate part that the Canon must have learnt
his business. As to his organ, the monographer has previously
said, speaking about the Reverend Gentleman's St. Mark's
Church,—appropriate place f°r a man °f mark,—that his
organ was a Walker,—Walk eh being the well-known organ-
builder (my anathemas on all organ-grinders!J, and one
of the finest-toned in London." Summary,—a line Preacher
with a good deal of organic Walker. The third portrait is of
Mr. Boehm, R. A., who was so highly spoken of years ago by
Sir Robert Peel in the House of Commons. The eminent
sculptor is represented in one of the several attitudes which,
as a practical man of genius, he tried for himself by straddling
across a chair, while designing his striking equestrian statue
of the Duke of Wellington. Mr. Hokum, so the mono-
graphic Enqel informs us, " gets up every morning at six in
summer and seven in winter," and then gets on horseback
in any weather,"—and when he doesn't, I suppose he sits
astride across a chair as he does in this picture and jogs his
memory for exercise. Our Celebrities ought to be doing
well, under the guidance of their guardian Enqel.
I like short stories. Brevity is the soul of wit. Per-
sonally, therefore, I am grateful to Mr. W. H. Pollock for
"collecting" and,"re-collecting" those forming his new
Volume, entitled A Nine Men's Morrice. Why A Nine
Men's Morrice? There are nine tales • and a Morrice is a
dance, a round dance,—and—and—well, on further con-
sideration, why not A Nine Men's Morrice t or A Nine
Mssr's Morrice t But the name's nothing, the collection is
everything. "Edged Tools," a quizzical spookical story, is
excellent; and The Thought Reader," and "One of
Charles Mainwaring's Lies," both dramatically told, would
be equal to the one I mentioned first, if the Author, instead of
abruptly refusing to tell us any more, had been graciously
pleased to satisfy the reader's curiosity, which in both in-
stances he has so skilfully succeeded in arousing. I was inclined
to say, with Mr. IVeller, Senior, at the conclusion of each of
the last two stories, " That's rayther a sudden pull up, ain't
it, Samht?" and, obviously, W. H. Pollock, adapting
Satn's words to the occasion, would have retorted—" Not a
bit on it—you vish there was more—and that's the great
art o' story writin'." "Well," said Mr. Welter, Senior,
"there's something in that." If you enjov a quiet smile,
read " Mr. Morton's Butler." As a satirical burlesque of the
supernatural story, it is excellent; but being a fragment, it
is only suggestive of possibilities. "The Green Lady" is
the best of all; a real chuckle- starter. For the hour before
dressing for dinner, or the twenty minutes' before undressing
for bed, you can't have a better companion than A Nint
Men's Morrice,— at least so thinks your humble Bervant,
The Baron de Book Worms.

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
THIRD EVENING.
"Not long ago," said the Moon, " I looked through the window of
a village inn into a bright and cheerful room, with highly-coloured
calendars hanging on the walls. Round about, on benches, sat the
chief personages in the village, for it was a very
respectable house. There was the butcher, and
the wheelwright, and the carpenter, who also
carved tombstones, and the chief draper (the
other was a Teetotaller), and even the chemist,
who kept the post office—they were all there,
drinking their Deer or their spirits-and-water
with a sober satisfaction, and puffing at their pipes, as I have seen them
do for many and many an evening, and hope to see them doing for
years and years to come. Generally they are content to talk—slow,
ponderous talk it is, with pauses between, such as in all rustic inns
is considered a rather stimulating exchange of thought; sometimes
they play cards—though not when the chemist or the Parish Clerk
is there. This night, however, they enjoyed a sensation altogether
new to them—a stranger had come in, and volunteered to sing to
them. They are none of them very musical, though they complained
bitterly not long ago, when the Vicar improved the barrel-organ out
of the church—the Parish Clerk was particularly offended, for he
could play sixteen double-chants without once changing the barrel.
They sing sometimes themselves, but not often, as they all know
each other's songs by heart, while those of the stranger were unlike
anything they had ever heard. He sat with his thumbs in the arm-
holes of his waistcoat, and his eyes on the smoky ceiling, and sang
song after song to them in a sweet falsetto voice, whioh somehow went
straight home even to their torpid bosoms. He sang of patriotism and
freedom, of lovely children fading slowly away, of stars and angels,
loys of honest industry, of the sanctity of hearth and home, of
the duty of helping one's fellow-men. His face had nothing remark-
able in it—what expression it had was certainly rather unpleasant
than otherwise; but, if he had been one of the Minnesingers of old,
they could not have listened in more entranced delight. I thought
some of it a little mawkish myself," said the Moon, "but I have
noticed that mawkishness touches most people down in your part of
the world more deeply than anything else. When he had finished,
there came a long hush, amidst which he handed round his hat. As
they begged for one more song, he sang them 'A Daisy from
my Uncle SamueVs Grave,' which, as the Butcher remarked,
'banged everything.' Then, after a chorus of thanks and praises,
and a few additional coppers, he went forth into the night, leaving
the assembly looking into their glasses of gin-and-water with eyes
that were moister than usual.
"But while the singer, still softly humming the words of his last
song, was passing under tne sign which swung at the corner, some men
pounced upon him suddenly out of the shadow. And from what was
said at the time, I learnt that they were policemen, and that he was
a particularly dangerous burglar, who had made his escape from
prison by means of a brutal and cowardly murder. I saw him raise
his white, whimpering face to mine as they were taking him away
handcuffed; but the party in the inn room sat sipping their
liquor, and knew nothing of what had happened to the singer, whose
pathetio tones were still eohoing in their ears. After all, said the
Moon, languidly, "pathos'is pathos, I suppose, and so long as one
is genuinely moved, it is a mistake to be too particular as to who
does it."
The House of the Wolfings. By William Morris." Who are
"the Wolfinqs?" Of course this advertisement means that their
house has been painted, papered, and deoorated, and the furniture
for it designed by William Morris, who is far more at home in
house dec-orating than in Socialist mob-orating.

Of course Madame Nebuda, Mile. Janotha, and Signor Piatti are

so associated with the "Pops," they may come to be considered as
"Pop-guns." Well, if so, this dignifies pop-guns.

SERVICE FOR VETERANS.
Rather! Here's a chance for some of 'em! See this ad-
vertisement in the Daily News of Thursday last ?—
TWO GENERALS. One for cooking, one for housemaid's work. Small
quiet family. Age 20 to 25. Wagei £14 to £16.
Fancy Lord Wolselet and Sir Evelyn "Wood applying for
the places! Lord '' Garnish" Wolselet would be nis name as
cook, while "Evelyn" would be charming for a housemaid.
It's too pretty. But, of course, there must be a number of
unemployed Generals who would be only too delighted to serve,
if the wages of the service were just a trifle higher. And now
that women are taking so much work that used to be done by
men only, it is right that our middle-aged warriors en retraite
should have a chance, as members of " the Household Brigade,"
in small quiet families. But we doubt whether any Generals are
to be found as young as from "20 to 25." This, perhaps, is a
misprint for "40 to 55." Army prospects are good. If "Lady
Guides"—bless 'em!—are to be substituted for Commission-
naires, then, by all means, let us have'1 old soldiers " as cooks and
housemaids. Uncle Toby and. Corpora/ Trim might possibly be
of our opinion.
PHELPS'S FAREWELL.
At the Munching House. Great Representative Gathering
last Thursday at Lord Mayor's Farewell Banquet to Mr. Phelps.
Pretty speech by Lord Mayor Torpedo with neat quotation.
Telling epigram by Mr. Phelps, "A man who never makes a
mistake will never make anything." Mr. Phelps must have
made plenty of mistakes, or he never would have made this epi-
gram; for this is an epigram and no mistake! A really pathetic
and graceful good-bye. Lord Rosebery seemed to have had his
usual joy oumess taken out of him by his elevation to the dignity
of County Councillor, and was absolutely dull in proposing the
health of Her Majesty's Judges and Bar of England. Lord Cole-
ridge in returning thanks was in excellent vein. Nothinir in his
speech became him like the finishing of it. Sir Frederick, P.R.A..

"lengthened sweetness long drawn out. Quite a serious
LECKY-ture. Altogether a memorable occasion. Speoially so

because the dinner-hour was at the sensible time of 7 for 7'30, and we

plenty of imitators in the City. Next Lord Mayor, Sir Henry Isaacs,
please copy. Nowadays "6 for half-past" is barbarous.
HARMONIOUS PROCEEDINGS.
Mr. Carl Armbruster is giving Mutinies of Wagner's Tristan und
Isolde, this week. The last one is announced for February 4. This
last date will clash with the first Matinfe of Pickwick, at the Comedy
Theatre—the dramatic Cantata composed by Edward Solomon. Rather
hard on poor Wagner this.
Madame NoitDiCA looked charming, and was in splendid voice at St.
James's Hall last Wednesday. Lloyd, too, was delloydful! And, as
Mrs. Ram said afterwards, "Mr. Eggshell was receivea with rapturous
applause." Evidently "Mr. Henschel." Dr. Mackenzie (not Morrel,
but A. C.) conducted. His Dream of Jubal is announced for February 26,
first time in London. The dance-music occurs in a scene supposed to be a
Ju-bal Masque, where the orchestra consists entirely of Jew's-harps, a very
fine effect. Another "first time in London," is The Light of Asia, composed
by Dudley Buck,—quite an organ swell '.—and it is hoped that Sir Edwin
Arnold will take a leading part in the solos. Sir Edwin has never done
anything of the sort before, and therefore this will be one of "Arnold's
first exercises." The dramatic Cantata, to be produced at a Matinee at the
Comedy Theatre, Feb. 4, entitled Pickwick, nas nothing to do with The
Light of Asia; quite another " wick," though the music is by Solomon.
Theatrical Intelligence.—It is understood that a sequel to Paul
Jones is in preparation. It is entitled Peter Robinson.

QUESTIONABLE QUESTIONS;
Or, How We Examine Now.
To Hie Editor.
Sib, —I quite agree that Examiners nowadays set far too hard ques-
tion*. I have been reading for five years
with a jolly, but rather expensive, Pri-
vate Tutor, and I thought, and bo did
the Governor, that I was sure of passing
the matriculation exam, at a third-rate
College at Cambridge. The "General
History Paper" was, however, fearfully
.stiff. Fancy asking a fellow to "state
what he knows of Julius Cassia,
Wilkes, Jeremy Taylor, the Crusades,
and the Free Trade Agitation!" The
consequence was that I failed to get in
—and my Tutor (with whom I am to stay
one more year} says the Examiners ought to be ashamed of them-
selves. At all events, I am ashamed of the Examiners.
Yours pluckedly, A. Plowman.
Sir,—As one who has been for some years a Government
Examiner in Elementary Schools, I feel bound to defend myself and
my class from the aspersions recently cast upon us.
How can we expect that the general average of intelligence can
ever be raised unless questions of reasonable difficulty are set at
examinations P Following this principle, I habitually put to little
boys and girls aged about twelve years, who are just entering on
Vulgar Fractions, questions which could only be adequately answered
after several years' practice in Logarithms.
I am also rather fond of putting this problem:—" If one man and
a boy can reap a field of corn in five days, seven and a half hours,
and twenty minutes, how long would two men take to reap the same
field?" You will see that it is a catch, and that there is no answer
Eossible; but I have seen children puzzling over the sum for an
our at a time; and, indeed, it was so successful on one occasion in
testing mental capacity, that a little girl had brain fever directly
after the examination, and a boy became a hopeless imbecile, solely
owing to inability to solve the problem. I hear that even now (in
his asylum) he babbles of fields of corn.
Yours, complacently, P. E. Dant.
Sir,—The following question was one of the easiest set to my poor
boy in the recent examination for entrance into the Home Civil
Servioe:—
"Supposing that you had a donkey that declined to exert itself in
a progressive direction, and you had determined to expedite its
movements by walloping it; given the strength of the donkey as
55 604 lb. Avoirdupois, the thickness of the stick as J? lb., and your
own muscular development as ordinary—find the exact amount of
time, expressed in fractions of moments, which would be required
before the animal's speed could be developed into half that of a
Derby winner."
I have sent the question to two Wranglers I know. One has
replied evasively; the other, I hear, has written to a mutual friend
to inquire after my mental condition. Comment is needles*.
Yours indignantly, Peter Famili-ass.
REVOLVERS AND ROBBERS.

you may thank your stars. And if he kill you, why, then there will
be an end of you. and he shall never more be able to rob you again.

Dogberry. Truly, Heaven forefend I should call in qnestion the
law of the land. It is, and ever was, the perfection of human
reason. Mark you, the Law allows your burglar to carry a revolver
as well as yourself. He can use it at his peril if he list, and so may
you. It were wiser, perhaps, to provide him with whipping-cheer
for carrying a deadly weapon. You can use it with a rope about
your neck, as well as he. But for all that, Oh, that Bumble were

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
December 29.—I had a most vivid dream last night. I woke up,
and on falling asleep, dreamed the same dream over again precisely.
I dreamt I heard Fbank Mitlab telling his sister that he had not
only sent me the insulting Christmas card, but
admitted that he was the one who punched my
head last night in the dark. As fate would
have it, Lupin at breakfast, was reading extracts
from a letter he had just received from Frank.
I asked him to pass the envelope that I might
compare the writing. He did so, and I examined
it by the side of the envelope containing the
Christmas card. I detected a similarity in the
writing in spite of the attempted disguise. I
passed them on to Carrie, who began to laugh.
1 asked her what she was laughing at, and she
3aid the card was never directed to me at all. It
was "L. Pooter," not "C. Pooter." Lupin
asked to look at the direction and the card, and exolaimed, with
laugh, "Oh, yes, Guv.; it's meant for me."
habit of receiving insulting Christmas cards
and of sending them, too." In the evening Gowing
enjoyed himself very much last night. I took the opportunity to
confide in him as an old friend about the vicious punch last night.
He burst out laughing, and said, "Oh, it was your head was it r I
know I accidentally hit something, but I thought it was a brick
wall." I told him I felt hurt in both senses of the expression.
December 30, Sunday.—Lupin spent the whole day with the
Mutlars. He seemed rather cheerful in the evening, so I said,
"I'm glad to see you so happy, LuprN." He answered, "Well,
Daisy is a splendid girl, but I was obliged to take her old fool of a
father down a peg. What with his meanness over bis cigars, his
stinginess over his drinks, his farthing economy in turning down the
gas if you only quit the room for a second, writing to one on half-
sheets of note-paper, sticking the remnant of the last cake of soap
on to the new cake, putting two bricks on each side of the fireplace,
and his general 'outside halfpenny bus'-mess, I was compelled to let
him have a bit of my mind." I said, "Lupin, you are not much
more than a boy—I hope you won't repent it."
December 31.—The last day of the Old Year. I received an extra-
ordinary letter from Mr. Mutlar, Senior. He writes. "Dear Sir,—
For a long time past, I have had considerable difficulty in deciding
the important question, 'Who is the master of my own houser"
Myself—or your son Lupin? Believe me, I have no prejudice one
way or the other, but I have been most reluctantly compelled to give
judgment to the effect that I am the master of it. Under the
circumstances, it has become my duty to forbid your son to enter my
house again. I am sorry—because it deprives me of the society of
one of the most modest, unassuming and gentlemanly persons I have
ever had the honour of being acquainted with." I did not desire the
last day to wind up disagreeably, so I said nothing to either Carrie
or Lupin about the letter.
A most terrible fog came on, and Lupin would go out in it, but
promised to be back to drink out the Old Year—a cuetom we have
always observed. At a quarter to twelve Lupin had not returned,
and the fog was fearful. As time was drawing close, I got out the
spirits. Carrie and I deciding on whiskey, I opened a fresh bottle,
but Carrie said it smelt like brandy. As I knew it to be whiskey,
I said there was nothing to discuss. Carrie, evidently vexed that
Lupin had not come in, did discuss it all the same, and wanted me
to have a small wager with her to deoide by the smell. I said I
could decide it by the taste in a moment. A silly and unnecessary
argument followed, the result of which was we suddenly saw it was
a quarter past twelve, and. for the first time in our married life, we
missed welcoming in the New Year. Lupin got home at a quarter
past two, having got lost in the fog—so he said.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Noveltt in Drawing Room Decoration.—You are quite right in
these days, iu your opinion, that to be " peculiar" is everything, and
some of your ideas for stealing a march on your neighbours in the
matter of originality are quite admirable. Your papering your draw-
ing-room ceiling with back numbers of the Daily Telegraph is, to begin
with, a most happy inspiration. By all means have up the kitchen
dresser. You can cover this with cracked soup-plates and tubs con-
taining large laurel plants. These, too, you may continue round the
room on brackets, placing several conspicuously on the over-mantel.
Your suggestion, too, that you should paint your muslin curtains in
broad stripes or spots with Aspinall's Enamel is excellent. Your
floors, dado, arm-chairs, rugs, cushions, could also with advantage
be treated with this useful decorative compound. Fill up the corners
of vour room with trophies of straw, and, taking up your carpet, cut it
in lengths, and nail it tapestry-wise in festoons over your doors. This
is very effective. But your taste will direct you, and you will soon
find that, with a very little effort, you can easily succeed in rendering
your rooms remarkable.
Lion Taming.—Your safest plan of becoming an efficient "Lion
Tamer" would be, unquestionably, as you suggest, to secure two
three-day-old cubs, and feed them by hand in your own drawing-
room with raw mutton-chops. As soon, however, as they begin to
grow you must be on the look out; they are sure to fpring on you
sooner or later. We believe a great deal can be done with a glass
eye, red-hot pincers, and a heavily-loaded riding-whip; but we
should advise you, when the creatures are full-grown, to keep them
in something more secure than the hen-house you mention. Your
best plan, when they are really getting savage, would, perhaps, be
to take a few finishing lessons of any well-known "Lion King."
Your desire to accomplish the feat of holding your head in the brute's
mouth is natural, and does oredit to your professional spirit, but we
would recommend you to make your first essay on some aged beast,
who has lost all his teeth, and has already dined. But if you are
determined to succeed in this risky experiment, you had better take
PATERFAMILIAS LOQUITUR.
The holidays are o'er! no more we see
Boots in all places where no boots should be;
No more the hungry brood sweeps clear the platter
With the perpetual grace of cheery chatter;
No more the bolster battle-cries are borne
Through the warm slumbers of the early morn.
No more indignant James comes in to tell
How Master Tom has stormed his citadel,
And, scorning covert threat, and suasion soft,
Rules for an hour the monarch of the loft.
Once more 'tis safe the shrubbery paths to tread
Without a javelin hurtling by one s head;
No longer lurk behind the orchard-trees
White-headed Indians, chubby Soudanese;
And neighbouring pigs wallow with wonted grace,'
Free from the terrors of the sudden chase.
Again we face the frost, without dismay
Lest we be called to skate an hour ere day,
Or with a book endure a day-long fall
Secure from lawless cricket in the hall.
Now in the servants' mystic realm again
Their ancient order and decorum reign;
Yet can I read in Bibb's, the butler's, eye,
A latent sorrow for the larks gone by.
Unruffled now in temper, and in look
Sedate and calm once more is Mrs. Cook.
Yet all her larder's treasures she'd explore,
And spend her skill to greet the boys once more.
The Coachman, as a Lord Chief Justice grave,
His loved solemnity no more must waive;
Majestic silence seals his lips, and yet
I know his dignity is half regret.
For now the lords of home's fair pastures free,
Plunge in the schoolroom's fierce democratic;
Now in reluctant ears the school-bell sounds;
Ou the soaked grass once more the football bounds;
Tho home-sick novice hears the horrid thud,
And headlong prints his flanneh in the mud.
Now ponder sullen brows o'er Homer's page,
While luckless masters share Achilles rage,
And rising scholars mourn their studious lot,
And brand the classic bards as " awful rot."
Ah! though at home the endless clamours cease,
There is much desert to a little peace.
Come, Easter, come, to Pater and to boys,
And bring them back with all their tricks and noise.
the bull by the horns and attempt it in a diver's helmet. This may
somewhat incommode and even surprise the lion; but, on the whole,
it will give you your best chance of coming through the ordeal in
safety.
To Remove the Effect of Inkstains on Blue Satin Furniture.
—Having had the misfortune to upset a bottle of ink over the light
blue satin seat of an armchair of vour handsome Louis XIII.
drawing-room suite, your best plan will be to make the rest of it
match as simply as possible. Get, therefore, several more bottles of
ink and proceed to splotch" all the other chairs, sofas, and otto-
mans recklessly in like manner. Having done this, give out to your
friends boldly that it is a new Japanese design from Paris, and you
may be tolerably sure that though they will Btare, they will admire
and finally endeavour to match it. A red-hot poker and blotting-
paper will be of no use. Don't hesitate, therefore, but go boldly to
work.
How to Utilise a Flre-Escape.—We think that having won the
fire-escape in the raffle you mention, you were bound to receive it on
delivery, and think you have done wisely to consign it, for the
moment, to your front area. Take care, however, that it does not
prove a means of admitting a burglar to your top storey, upon which,
while the fire-escape occupies its present position, you will certainly
do well to keep one or two armed detectives continually on the qui
mm. Yes, you can certainly cut off the ladder and turn it into
kitchen chairs, and use the carriage part as a sort of low-pitched dog-
cart, and, hiring a cab-horBe, put in an appearance in it, as you
suggest, in the park. But painted black it would make a nice sort
of handy open, two-wheeled hearse, that might possibly be patronised
now and then by a deceased friend of a sporting turn. This is only
a suggestion. But think it out. There is something in it.
We read in the Times that " the Illustrated London News has
offered to erect a facsimile of Shakspeabe's House on the Champ de
Mars during the Exhibition." Of course "The House of Moliebe"
will be delighted. Perhaps the plans will be designed by Mr. Irving,
who says he can draw a good house for Shaxspearf. at any time.

VERY MUCH ON GUARD.
Thr Household Brigade are to be congratulated on the success of
their theatrical entertainment at the Chelsea Barraoks Theatre on
Friday, the 1st of February. Everything was admirably done, and
the performances went without a hitch from beginning to end. The
piece de resistance, a burlesque entitled " The Real Truth about
Icanhoe or Scott Scotched," was brightly written, and if containing
here and there an old joke, was (so the audience seemed to think)
none the worse for that. The author, Mr. E. C. Nugent (late
Grenadier Guards), had been fortunate enough to secure in Mr.
Edwabd Solomon the best possible collaborates to supply the
necessary music—and luckily, a great deal of music seemed to be
necessary. The play was full of tuneful songs and graceful dances,
the latter executed to perfection by Miss Kate Vauohan and Miss
Jenny McNcxty. But in spite of the pleasing efforts of these
accomplished ladies, the music was the feature of the evening. It
is clever to a degree, and there was scarcely a number that was not
awarded the demand (not always granted) for an encore. So well
were the audience pleased with Mr. Solomon's work, that they
honoured him with a special call at the end of the performances.
Of the actors. Lieutenant George Nugent (Grenadier Guards), was
far and away the best. Mr. Nugent is really amusing, and were he
to give up soldiering (which for the sake of the country, it is to be
hoped he won't), might command an excellent salary as an actor on
the professional boards. Lieutenants Sir Augustus Webster and
George MacDonald (both of the Grenadier Guards), were also very
good —for amateurs. It would be invidious to single out any other
gallant officer for honourable mention, as they all individually and
oollectively attained to about the same level of excellence. And here it
may be noted that the youthful subalterns (now immortalised) turned
their professional knowledge to good account. Nothing could have
been better than their advance in line—they never lost touch either
of themselves or the audience. Tommy Atetns (who was strongly
represented at the back of the auditorium), seemed to greatly relish
this extra drill—extra drill that had evidently emanated from the
Stage Manager's sanctum after consultation with the Orderly Room.
On the other hand, the Typical Hero of the Defaulter's Book seemed
a little slow in recognising a clever travesty of a Sergeant's " instruc-
tions" on parade—perhaps the burlesque revived painful memories.
Before the piece of the evening, an original play, of very serious
interest, called In Honour Bound, was performed. It went, how-
ever, with more laughter than tears, apparently because the audience
had formed a wrong impression of its character. _ No doubt when
Mr. Sydney Grundy wrote the play, he intended its pathos should
raise it (in spite of its tiny proportions), to the level of Romeo and
Juliet, Othello, or even Macbeth. In spite of this, on Friday last,
for some reason or other, In Honour Sound was undoubtedly
accepted by the audience as a dangerous rival to Box and Cox—a
faroe it can scarcely be said, by the unprejudiced, to have resembled
(even faintly) in any really important particular.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PLAY-TIME.
The revival of Still Waters Run Deep at the Criterion is, in every
way remarkable, but especially so in the revelation of the real
Mrs. Sternhold. But when once Mrs. Beere had made up her
mind as to how Mrs. Sternhold must be played, then the piece ought
to have been re-modelled on the exact lines of Charles de Ber-
nard's novelette.
Mrs. Bernard Beere's acting is too powerful for the play as it is;

little Wyndham putting down Big Hawkealey. "Don't you try that again.
Recollect it is a hale Lancashire Lad (myself) against a battered London
Rout—and you '11 get the worst of it!"
though it would not be too powerful had Tom Taylor not so
oleverly bowdlerised Charles dk Bernard's novelette, Le Oendre.
She thrilled me,—I admit I am easily thrilled,—but such force is
wasted on the Mrs. Sternhold whom the English playwright created.
According to Tom Taylor, Mrs. Sternhold was only a vain, elderly
woman, who had made a fool of herself; and not the French
original, a guilty wife, jealous of her own daughter, or, it might
have been, of her step-daughter, for it is a long time since I read
Le Gendre. But, altogether, the acting at the Criterion is above
the level of the play itself; though, with the exception of one scene,
Mr. Standing's Captain Hawkshy is certainly below it.
The tone of every character in the piece must be taken from
Mrs. Sternhold; and, if Mrs. Sternhold is not a vain, silly person
pour rire, but a
olever woman who
has indulged in an
insane criminal
passion for a
scoundrel, then
all the serious
characters (the
interest in whose
actions depend
solely on the in-
terest we take in
her) must be raised
to almost tragic
power of dramatic
intensity. From
the moment we
have Mrs. Bee re
portraying the
guilty wife and
jealous mother of
De Bernard's
story, instead of
Tom Taylor's
Brother Potter's
sister, — a vain
and middle-aged
widow, a model of Situation (not in the piece):—The halo Lancashire Lad
middle-class pro- E?1* threat into execution, and chucks Captain
priety, guilty only Hawkealey out of the window
of the imprudence of having written love-letters to a swindler who
had pretended a romantio affection for her,—the tone of the
characters is entirely altered, and a tragio weight is imposed on a
structure which is not calculated to support it. In a sentence—the
comcdv gives way under the force of the acting.
Miss Mary Moore as the wife, in her great scene with Mrs. Stern
hold, in the First Act, and her reconciliation with her husband at

the end of the play, was simply perfect. No better contrast could
there be than between Miss Moore and Mrs. Beere. Mr. Wyndham
is in most serious earnest, and he could not give any other reading
of his part when a Mrs. Beere is playing Mrs. Sternhold with so
much intensity. Mildmay can no longer chuckle to himself over
her making "such a fool of herself," for this expression bears a
very different meaning when applied to Mrs. Beere's and Charles
de Bernard's Mrs. Sternhold, instead of to Mrs. Wigan's and Tom
Taylor's Mrs. Sternhold. "Speak to my aunt," whispers Mrs.
Mildmay to her husband, "as you have spoken to me; and his
reply, "I do not love her as I love you," was intended to be received
with a laugh. Such a laugh relieved a pretty and touching situa-
tion, which was raised at the expense of Tom Taylor's elderly,
made-up Mrs. Sternhold,—the audience perceived at once that
the wife's request was ridiculous, and that the husband was
only laughing at its absurdity. But when Mrs. Sternhold is
such a woman as Mrs. Beere, there is no joke about the matter, and
not only is the request not absurd, but the reply ought not to raise
a smile. Tom Taylor meant Mrs. Sternhold to be a ridiculous
elderly person, painted and powdered, and fancying herself more
attractive than ner youthful niece; but Mrs. Bernard Beere's
Mrs. Sternhold is Balzac's femm* de trente ans, a very dangerous
person, against whom an inginue like Miss Moore's Mrs. Mildmay
wouldn't have had a chance.
I cannot say that Mr. Wyndham either looks or speaks like a
"hale Lancashire lad." That this broad-chested, jolly, healthy
Captain Hawksley should cave in to the slight, natty Mildmay, is
an additional tribute to the latter's physical and moral strength,
and damning proof of the former's cowardice.
Mr. Blakeley is a capital Potter, but the comic old Potter's occu-
pation is gone by the side of this new Mrs. Sternhold. Potter
should have been restored to his proper position as the husband of
Mrs. Sternhold. However, in the hands of Mr. Blaxeley he is
very funny.
Mr. Giddens gives a clever sketch of the bustling impecunious
Irishman, Dunbilk; but the type, like the name, is rather out of
date. The house at Brompton (a locality which has been recently
almost entirely absorbed in Kensington), where there is a flower
and kitchen garden, to suit Mildmay's provincial tastes, is also
strongly suggestive of the "long ago." When Tom Taylor wrote,
Brompton possessed many such snuggeries; but now it would be
difficult to find even one, almost as difficult as to define Brompton.
In the Second Act the rapid change from the first to the second
Scene is managed in an incredibly short space of time—a very few
seconds, in fact.
But to sum up—altogether an interesting evening, whioh muoh
delighted Jack in a Box.
THE DIAKY OF A NOBODY.
January 1. — I had intended concluding my Diary last week,
but a most important event has happened, so I Bholl continue for a
little while longer on the fly-leaves attached to the end of mv last
year's Diary. It had just struck half-past one,
and 1 was on the point of leaving the office to
have my dinner, when I received a message
that Mr. Perkupp desired to see me at once. I
must confess my heart began to beat, and I had
most serious misgivings. Mr. Perkupp was in
his room, writing, and he said, "Take a seat,
Mr. Pooter- I shall not be a moment." I
replied, "No, thank you, Sir, I'll stand." I
watched the clock on the mantelpiece, and I was
waiting quite twenty minutes, but it seemed
hours. Mr. Perkupp at last got up himself.
! said, "I hope there is nothing wrong, Sir?"
He replied, "Oh dear no—quite the reverse, I hope." What a
weight off my mind! My breath seemed to come back again in
an instant. Mr. Perkupp said, "Mr. Buckling is going to retire,
and there will be some slight changes in the office. You nave been
with us nearly twenty-one years, and, in consequence of your conduct
during that period, we intend making a special promotion in your
favour. We have not quite decided now you will be placed, but in
any case there will be a considerable increase in your salary, which,
it is quite unnecessary for me to say, you fully deserve. I nave an
appointment at two—but you Bhall hear more to-morrow." He then
left the room quickly, and I was not even allowed time or thought to
express a single word of grateful thanks to him. I need not say
how dear Carrie received this joyful news. With perfect simplicity
she said—" At last we shall be able to have a chimney-glass for the
back drawing-room, which we always wanted." I added, "Yes,
and at last you shall have that little costume which you 'saw at
Peter Robinson's so cheap."
January 2.—I was in a great state of suspense all day at the office.
I did not like to worry Mr. Perkupp, but as he did not'send for me,

and mentioned yesterday that he would see me again to-day, I
thought it better, perhaps, to go to him. I knocked at his door, and
on entering, Mr. Perjcupp said, "Oh, it's you, Mr. Pooter—do you
want to see me?" I said, "No, Sir—I thought you wanted to see
me!" "Oh," he replied, "I remember. Well, I am very busy to-
day, I will see you to-morrow."
January 3.—Still in a state of anxiety and excitement, which was
not alleviated by ascertaining that Mr. Pkrkuit sent word he should
not be at the office at all to-day. In the evening Lupin, who was
busily engaged with a paper, said suddenly to me, "Do you know
anything about chalk pit»x Guv.?" I said, "No, my boy,_not that
I'm aware of." Lupin said, "Well, I give you the tip.
'Well, I give you
Chalk pits
are as safe as Consols, and pay six per cent, at par." I said a rather
neat thing, viz :—" They may be six per cent, at par, but your Pa
has no money to invest." Carrie ana I both roared with laughter.
_ funny thing:—" Mind you
fall into them!'' Lupdt put on a supercilious smile, and said,
"Bravo 1 Joe Miller."
January 4.—Mr. Perkupp sent for me and told me that my posi-
.ion would be that of one of the Chief Clerks. I was more thai
overjoyed. Mr. Pehkupp added he would let me know to-morrow
what the salary would be. This means another day's anxiet
don't mind, for it is anxiety of the right sort. That reminded me
that I had forgotten to speak to Lupin about the letter I received
from Mr. Mutlar, Senior. I broached the subject to Lupin in the
evening, having first consulted Carrie. Lupin was riveted to the
"Financial News," as if he had been a born capitalist, and I said,
"Pardon me a moment, Lupin; how is it you have not been to the
Mutlars any day this week?" Lupin answered, "I told you—I
cannot stand old Mutlar." I said, "Mr. Mutlar writes to me to
say pretty plainly that he cannot stand you!" Lupin said, "Well.
I like his cheek in writing to you. I '11 find out if his father is still
alive, and I will write him a note complaining of his son, and I '11
state pretty clearly that his son is a blithering idiot 1" I said,
"Lupin, please moderate your expressions in the presence of your
mother. Lupin said, "I'm very sorry, but there is no other
expression one can apply to him. However, I'm determined not to
enter his place again. I said, " You know. Lupin, he has forbidden
you the house." Lupin replied, "Well, we won't split straws—it's
all the same. Daist is a trump, and will wait for me ten years, if
necessary."
January 5.—I can scarcely write the news. Mr. Pbbkupp told me
my salary would be raised £100. I stood gaping for a moment,
unable to realise it. I annually get £10 rise, and I thought it might
be £15, or even £20, but £100 surpasses all belief. Carrie and I
both rejoiced over our good fortune. Lupin came home in the
evening in the utmost good spirits. I sent Sarah quietly round to
the grocer's for a bottle of champagne, the same as we had before,
"Jackson Freres." It was opened at supper, and I said to Lupin.
"This is to celebrate some good news I have received to-day.'
Lupin replied, "Hooray, Guv! And I have Borne good news also,
A double event, eh?" I said, "My boy, as a result of twenty-one
years' industry and strict attention to the interest of my superiors in
office, I have been rewarded with promotion and a rise in salary of
£100." Lupin gave three cheers, and we rapped the tables furiously,
which brought in Sarah to see what the matter was. Lupin ordered
us to " fill up" again, and addressing us upstanding, said, " Having
been in the hrm of Job Cleanands, stock and sharebrokers, a few
weeks, and not having paid particular attention to the interests of
my superiors in office, my Guv'nor, as a reward to me, allotted me
£5-worth of shares in a really good thing. The result is to-day I
have made £200." I said, "Lupin, you are joking." "No, Ouv,

EXPEDITION."

.ong ago," so the Moon (male this time—fresh from Germany)
told Mr. Punch, "I looked down upon the harbour of a town on the
Red Sea. I peeped into a ship, which had been turned into a hospital for
wounded soldiers.
For. as you pro-
bably know, the
town (which is
called Suakin) had
been besieged on
its land sides for
months by a rabble
of fanatical Der-
vishes, fierce and
savage foes, who
came close up to
its walls, building
forts, and digging
trenches, from
which, night and
day, they poured
shot and shell into
the crowded streets and bazaars, and killed several of the inhabitants.
For a long time nothing was done to drive the besiegers away, but at
last it was decided that some very active measures ought to be taken.
Troops were brought, and a battle followed soon after, in which the
Dervishes, though they were brave enemies, and fought gallantly,
giving and expecting no quarter, were driven away without much
difficulty, for the defenders were quite as brave, and more numerous.
Still, some of them were killed, and many wounded, and the latter
had been carried on board a ship to get well. In one of the
hammocks a trooper was lying, who was getting better, and was
already well enough to be allowed to read the newspapers which had
been sent out to him from England. He was reading one of them now
by the light of a lantern which hung near. and. as I shone in, I
could read it too," said the Moon. "I think he was anxious to
know what his countrymen at home were saying, and this paper was
dated about the time that the news of the victory had arrived. As
he spelt out the lines of print I saw his face (which was a good and
honest one, but not very intellectual, perhaps), growing more and more
puzzled, as if he found some difficulty in understanding what he read.
Well, the newspapers told him that a considerable number of his
fellow-countrymen—so far from regarding him and those who had
fought with him as heroes, or even as brave men, who had performed
an unpleasant duty, looked upon them as a set of cowardly butchers
and murderers. He read that several clever and eloquent speakers
in Parliament had denounced the victory as a disgrace, and declared
that Suakin belonged by rights to those savage Arabs who had oome
across the Desert all the way from Khartoum to attack it, and who
showed no mercy to man, woman, or child; that it was theirs, and
ought to be given up to them. Now the poor wounded Trooper had
never thought of himself as a hero—he had simply done his duty,
that was all—and, though the enemy were only savages and
fanatics, they had fought with desperate courage, and he nad not
imagined till then that there was anything disgraceful in defeating
them—nor had I," said the Moon, for that matter. But there it
was, in black and white—all that the clever men who wrote in
papers or made speeches thought of the affair, and he was very much
troubled in his mind about it. At last he told his neighbour what
was worrying him, and asked his opinion. His neighbour was the
Sergeant-Major of his troop, who had also been in the battle—he had
narrowly escaped being killed, for his sabre had snapped short off,
and his revolver refused to go off at the right moment, so he was
lucky in being only severely wounded. The Sergeant-Major heard
the whole account placidly enough. 'Don't you bother your head
about it!' he said, feebly; 'they wouldn't go calling us them
names, and backing up them dirty Arabs, if it warn't on account
jf politics—it's all politics, and don't mean anything in particular.'
'They do say we ought to ha' tried kindness on 'em, though,' said
the Trooper, doubtfully. 1 Kindness!' said the Sergeant-Major—
'let 'em oome out here, and try it themselves! It's easy talking of
being kind to a howling savage, as keeps pot-shotting at you with
a Remington, or jobbing at you with a spear—but it ain't the way
to raise a siege, not to my thinking, it isn't:—but there, as I said
before, it's only politics. Bless you, they don't believe it them-
selves, some on 'em—leastways, it's to be hoped not!' So the
Trooper lay still with an easier expression—but I noticed," added
the Moon, that he did not finish reading his newspaper."
Soudan Thought.—We 've heard a good deal lately of "the
Kabbabish men." Several correspondents want to know if these
are Hansom Kabbabish men or Growlers?

"No Victory?" Nav, simple Simon, you 're wrong;
He has gained the old Victory, often repeated,
Of blague over blindness. It fetches the throng,
That flamboyant figure so flauntingly seated.
Just look at it! Boys at its majesty melt.
Though manhood may see 'tis a sketch a la Skelt.
Skelt's heroes were rather unreal, of course;
But they knew how to stride, and to swagger and straddle,
To prance and curvet on a high-rearing horse,

A circus Bucephalus looks a fine thing
As it scatters the sawdust and romps round the ring.
Houp-ld! It is hardly heroic, that shout,
Not a war-cry of Koland or Bayard precisely.
At Ivry it would not have answered, no doubt,
But for Paris to-day it will do very nicely.
A histrion hollow shows better, one feels,
Than a bourgeois who blunders, a " Statesman" who steals.
He looks fierce as an Indian hunter of scalps,
As fine as Mur.it when he led a battalion.
There's a touch of Napoleon crossing the Alps.
You call him a hero pour rire, a rapscallion?
Ah, well, his success mediocrity shames;
So there's not much advantage in calling him names.
Were snbjeots not foolish, how feeble were kings!
'Tis noodles and numskulls make Bombas and Nekobs.
If Friends of the People were not such poor things,
We should not be troubled with so many " heroes."
Till the clever are true and the honest are wise,
The world will be led by the nose and the eyes.

Apollo-like graces and Jovian nods
Lend grace to pretence and give power to platitude.

So they mustn't find fault with his beak or his legs.
See how 'twixt the legs of this Skeltian chief
Show towers and buildings in Skeltian perspective!

It was a secret, sombre, subterranean den, lying deep down
under the bed of the river, approached through a perfect maze of
passages, and lighted only by the latest artificial light. As two-
penny-worth of this light, however, was warranted to illumine a
million square feet of cellarage for twelve calendar months, it had
been rigorously suppressed in the interests of that monstrous
monopoly the Automatic- Accumulator -Solar-Ray-Direct-Storage
Syndicate.
He was a wretched-looking creature, the sole occupant of this Cave
of Trophonius, a cross between an Alchymist and an Apparitor, as
weirdly wizen as the former, as darkly disguised as the latter.
"Eureka.'" he yelled with a triumphant shriek. It shook the
complicated cranks and cordage which made his cell look like a
metallic spider's web, and startled the passengers on board the
"Noctivagant Nautilus," one of the new line of Moon-Motor
Citizen Boats which ran from Battersea 1o the Tower Stairs for one
half-penny in two minutes, thirty seconds and one-tenth.
"Fool! he muttered, half throttling himself with his own
skeleton hand. "When shall I subdue my accursed, unfashionable,
world-proscribed enthusiasm to discreet silence? That idiotio howl
is quite sufficient to put my relentless pursuers on my track. And
just as I have perfected my long-meditated plan for an Automatic,

chequer—the curse of Science on the sordid breed!—will permit so
much as the appearance of the merest model of it? No, that
last atrocious Act for the Absolute Suppression of Inventors has
settled my hash. In these ultra-humanitarian days, too, when
capital punishment, save for Inventors, has been entirely
abolished!"
He sank down upon an Iridium anvil, cast his arms around a
retort of pure transparent Diamond, and wept tears sufficient to float
his own Aluminium Fleet.
"And why?" he shouted, rousing himself at last, and apparently
addressing the highly-finished model of a hundred-pounder gun
capable of being packed in a hat-box, which hung beside a waist-
coat-pocket torpedo.
He was answered, but not in the way he expected. The door of
his den was suddenly opened, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
clad, like all officials of the tin' c, in complete anti-dynamite-asbestos-
cum-adamant mail, appeared at the head of a detachment of the new
Volcanic-Vulcanite-clad force of Police known as the Vesuvian
Invulnerables. These formed a cordon around the now entirely
crushed Troglodyte of the Thames.
"Why?" echoed the Chancellor, in tones of spirit-palsying
severity. "Wretched man, too well you know. Else, why hide you
here in this new Cyclops cavern of inventive infamy P Are you not
of those, traitors to Thrift, defiers of Rhadamauthian Law, dis-
turbers of Procustean Order, who already have nearly been the ruin
of the State. Is it not owing to you and your kind that Salisbury
Plain is .piled Pyramid-high with the wreckage of obsolete ships,
the debris of exploded guns, and the refuse of useless rifles, a
Pelion-upon-Ossa of rusty ironmongery, which originally cost a
mountain of gold, and is now not worth carting away as old metal P
Have you, and men of your pernicious sort, not for many years led
nations a ruinous dance of Experimental Emulation in Systematic
Slaughter? Have you not played Old Gooseberry with European
Exchequers, and made the Lives of the Chancellors a burden to them?
Have you not seduced peoples by the perilous path of Patents to the
very verge of the fathomless gulf of International Insolvency? Have
gou not rendered necessary the passing of a Draconic Code of Anti-
.cientifio Enactments compared with which the Irish Penal Laws
were mere legislative pleasantries, and Mr. Balpotjr's treatment of
O'Bbxek a benevolent jest. In short, are you not an Enthusiast, and
—oh! culmination of unpatriotic infamy !—an Inventor P"
The crushed caitiff, the villanous victim of ardent scheming, the
Sersistent planner of expensive improvements, sank prostrate on the
oor of the Cyclopean eavern. He had not a word to say for himself.
"Thank Heaven, you are the sole survivor of the malignant
brood! "continued the Chancellor, with ultra-official fervour. "I
have been on your serpent-track for years; at last, I catch you in
your own wicked web. (That is a mixed metaphor—but no matter!)
Seize him, Bobbies—I mean Vesuvian Invulnerables! Away with

2. Take a leaf out of the book of Madame Tussaud and the Chamber of Horrors. Allow
an extra charge of one shilling to be made to all visitors desirous to see Dr. Richardson's

4. Get an experienced Dog-trainer to select the cleverest of the lost, teach them to jump

BETTERS AND GAMBLERS.
Mr. Punch,—There is unquestionably one
law for the Poor, and another for the Rich,
or rather for the Ungenteel in comparison
with the Genteel. People who can afford to
risk any money at all in betting, are not
poor; and others, that can't afford to risk
large sums on the Turf, or in any other form
of gambling, but, with expensive establish-
ments to maintain, do yet risk them, are not
rich. Their expenditure exoeeds their in-
comes. They require to be protected against
themselves and their gambling propensities,
equally with the gentlemen of the pavement
and the public-houses. But this protection is
denied the poor wealthy. Every daily news-
paper almost, records a "raid" effected by
the Police on a licensed victualler's premises
allowed to be used by small gamblers for the
purpose of betting and playing games of
hazard. No matter if these be partly games
of skill—like "skittle pool," and that the
ventures are no higher than threepenny, six-
penny, and shilling stakes. The gamesters
and their host are liable to be fined, and are
fined accordingly, and sent to prison if they
can't pay,—very much to encourage the
others.
But, Sir, yon know that 'we never see re-
ported a raid or a foray executed by the
Police on any of the premises constantly used
for betting by noblemen and gentlemen con-
nected with the Turf or Stock Exchange.
Now, don't you think that these great gam-

GIVING THEM THEIR CHARACTERS.
The quite novel light shed recently at the Lyoeum on the charac-
ters of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth respectively, to say nothing of
Mrs. Langtry's New York revival, and the hnndred-and-one on dits
in relation to Mr. Mansfield's forthcoming much-talked-of produc-
tion at the Globe, have all helped to stir the " New Reading" dis-
coverers into a state of unwonted activity. Subjoined are a few of
their latest suggestions:—
A proposoi Macbeth, "A 8ixty Yeabs Student" writes:—" By
all means let Macbeth turn out to be a rather jovial, nice-minded,
pleasant-spoken sort of fellow, and his wife a good-natured and
affectionate creature, with an eye to business, and never so wide
awake as when in the Sleep-walking Scene, but this doesn't half do
away with the Tragedy. Duncan should be the real ruffian, on
which the whole of the ghastly business turns, arriving at the castle
in an advanced stage of delirium tremens, in a fit of which it is
evident that, at a later hour, he commits suicide. That he is hope-
lessly drunk on his arrival, is clearly indicated in the text, for he
addresses Lady Macbeth with the line—
"' Give me your hand: conduct me to mine host.'
"Then, stumbling up against her with the words:—
'"By your leave, hosteu!'
reels up the steps into the Castle. I take it this gives us all we want
to clear the characters of our hero and heroine. As for Banguo's
appearance, mind you, after supper, that can obviously be set down
to an acute form of indigestion."
Dealing with Hamlet, in a similarly critical spirit, "A Reasoning
Roscius remarks:—"As to the Dane being off his head, this is
simply absurd. His game is evidently Spiritualism. He ought to
go through the usual hanky-panky, table-turning with Horatio,
Marcellus, and Bernardo, and then, after eliciting a succession of
raps, dismiss thenij and fetching out the regular Dark Stance
Cabinet, finish up with the usual illuminated banjo business, during
which he carries on his conversation with the Ghost, whose head
appears at a hole in the cabinet-door covered with phosphorus,
according to the accepted text, modified here and there, of course,
to suit the varying situations. I must add, that Hamlet must, by
no means, be made up ' young.' The Queen refers to him near the
end of the play as being fat, and scant of breath,' thereby clearly
indicating that to represent him even as a heavy, obese, middle-
aged, overgrown sort of Sir John Falstaff would be only to err in
the right direction. He should be a coarse ponderous hulking
fellow of about five and fifty. This would help to carry off his
philosophy, and, in some measure, explain his peculiar conduct to
Ophelia."
With regard to Othello, "A Genuine Lover of Humorous
Comedy" writes:—"I cannot conceive a more wanton distortion of
the merry Moor's obvious characteristics than the usually accepted
view of him which stamps him as 'jealous.' "Why P The charge is
monstrous! The key to his character is simply his keen relish of a
thoroughly good practical joke. His accidental smothering of
Desdemona is evidently one of these. He ought to come on in all
the earlier scenes with a banjo, to carry out the idea of his being not
the Moor, but the Moore and Burgess corner-man of Venice. I am
not sure that I wouldn't dress him in red-and- white-striped trousers,
a long blue-tailed coat, a shirt-frill and a large white tie. But this
is a detail."
"Richardson Redivivus" after insisting that King Lear is
the most "mirth - provoking oharaoter" Shakspeare ever
drew, and that all his scenes with his daughters, if rightly un-
derstood, should be hailed by any intelligent audience as regular
"side-splitters," passes onto the consideration of Paul Pry, who,
he says, after a good deal of mature soholarly reflection, he has
discovered to be not a comic character at all, but a melo-
dramatic villain of the deepest dye. He argues against his carrying
an umbrella, insisting that he should be provided instead with a long
Spanish stiletto, and an ample and mysterious cloak. He further
lays great stress on the fact, that whenever he enters with his catch
phrase of " I hope I don't intrude," he ought to appear with blue
fire, either through a vampire-trap or secret panel, and not quit the
stage before he has stabbed somebody. He adds, in conclusion, that
he has forwarded all his notes on the subject to Mr. J. L. Toole, in
the hope that the popular Comedian will see his way to their adoption
on the next occasion of his reviving the well-known piece.
LINES SUGGESTED BY AN ELECTOR.
How happy is the Party penman's lot,'
Whether he wins or loses all is well.'
What though the counted votes against him tot?
Success in failure his keen scent can smell.
Loudly he crows when he the leek has eaten,
And ne'er is so triumphant as when beaten.
Equal to either fortune? Better far.
He snatches happy omens from defeat;
Winning, he loudly thanks his lucky star,
Losing, he finds in loss a savour sweet,
Like one who with two-headed coin doth toss,
Loss is but gain, but gain is never loss!
THE (NEARLY) PERFECT ENGLISHMAN.
(Translated from the French Press.)
Oh, yes, the brave General is an Englishman. His mother—ah,
Mb dear, dear mother!—before she married his father, was an
English "Mees." She was a perfect specimen! Tall, long, fair
hair; beautiful and much-exposed front teeth! Thus, he is right—
the brave General to_ be proud of his English blood! For he has
many of the characteristics of the native of Albion—not perflde, but
White-oliffed Albion. He eats rosbif and drinks portare-biere for
breakfast; and when he is greatly moved, he cries with tears in his
voice, "Oh, /Shocking!" Then, who has not Been him with his
boule-dogue with its blue ribbon collar and silver bell? This
boule-dogue was born in the most fashionable part of London—Vaux-
hall Bridge Road—and is called " Auguste." Both the brave General
and the boule-dogue are English to the backbone. The boule-dogue
is fond of sport—he is pleased to jump through a hoop, and can
dance the polka on his hind-legs. It is only natural that he should
fear rats. But the mice! Ah! he can hunt the mice!
The brave General is an expert at all English sports! Ah! how
he plays the cricket! It is wonderful to see him in his flannel shirt
(worn over a well-starched linen one), walking at every "over"
from one set of the stumps to the other set of the stumps! As a
General, of course, the Elected of the Seine wears spurs at all times.
At the cricket his spurs assist him in catching the ball.
Then at the lawn-tennis! Oh, the brave General knows well how
to play! Often he touches the ball with his bat, although he can
miss it. Ah, yes! how well, with what grace, he can miss it! And
when he does touch the ball with his bat, with what terrible force
does he drive it against the net!
But, before all and above all, he is a sportsman! Of course"he
wears his uniform, but that does not prevent him from putting along
hunting-horn round his body, nor carrying a game-bag attached to
a thin silken cord hanging by his side. And his patent leather
shooting shoes! And his white kid gloves! Ah, he is charming!
And it is then that Auguste distinguishes [himself! The brave dog
and the brave General hunt together. They thoroughly understand
each other. Auguste examines the bushes, the ditches, the shop-
windows! At length the fox is found, and then the brave General,
drawing his sword, gives Reynard bis coup de grace! Ah, indeed,
Boulanger is aperfeot Englishman-jookey, gentleman-rider! I who
write this wish him every success. (Signed) Henri Pump,
Of the Anglo-French Press.

Ha, ha! Aror /*• / know it!"
A GLORIOUS SPIN AFTER A JULY RABBIT.
A Hunting Story, by the Auttwr of "A Shoot with a Foxhound,"
"A Real Good Snipe," " The Hcnie Bay Harriers," "A Knacker's
Mount," dec, <fcc.
It would have been impossible to have picked out a more wretched
dav for the opening meet of the Season than was Tuesday, the first
of July, 188—
"You must not keep him waiting, Sir," said Captain Dasiiover's
servant, as he helped Eds master on with a thick Ulster, which com-
pletely covered his red coat, his snowy
breeches, his top-boots, and all the brave
insignia of the chase.
"I hope he is not too fresh," muttered
the Captain, stifling an oath. "As it is
raining, don't you think Sammy had better
return to his loose-box until it olears up?"
"Bless you, no, Sir—in this county they
often hunt in the wet."
Thus reassured, the Captain approached
|.. his Bteed (who stood patiently while he
J,,?; • li successfully ascended the saddle, with the
y5-r~*Ci ^rjjl material assistance of the stirrup), and,
seizing his umbrella, slowly sauntered away.
"A pretty pair!" exclaimed the Groom, critically watching the
departing steed and his rider before returning to the dining-room to
remove the remnants of his master's lunch— a pretty pair!"
It was a bad day. A dense fog lay over all the land, enshrouding
both hills and valleys, shops and public-houses, turnpike-gates and
boot manufactories, in its weird and ghostly embrace. It rested like
a soft grey counterpane upon the fields, toning down to a sombre
tint the rich brown of the upheaved earth. As for the lamp-posts
and the red signals from the chemists' windows, thev were blurred,
and seemed to be impregnated with moisture. Everything was
dark, everything was dull, and the rain poured down in buokets-
full.
After five minutes' careful riding (the meet was at some little

distance from the place of departure), the Captain joined the field,
which had already assembled.
"Nuisance this rain," growled the Master, as soon as the Captain
had reported himself. "On my word, I hardly know what to do.
The hounds are sure to catch cold if I don't take 'em home. What
do you say, Dashover?"
Well, replied the Captain, pulling at his reins with both hands at
once; '' now that I have got my bit of wood out, I think we had better
have a spin. Folks don't like to be disappointed on such occasions."
The Master, hearing this, gave orders for the day's proceedings to
commence at once, and the hounds were trotted off at a brisk pace to
draw a covert close by. But the rain and fog continued, and many
of the field went home. Milestones looked dark and formidable,
their dimensions increased instead of diminished by the imperfeot
light. The omnibus horses sniffed the damp air through their open
nostrils, and discharged it with disgust. They looked round sus-
piciously at the grey and unrecognisable conveyances beside them,
were nervous and timid, and distrusted the commonest object. A
wheelbarrow (containing penny ices), a donkey, a sheep-dog, filled
them with apprehension; and all this time, borne on the leaden-
coloured atmosphere, rang out the eager, murderous notes of collies
and poodles, celebrated for their slaying qualities. Suddenly there
was a cry of "Gone forrard, aw-a-ay! which proclaimed that
Master Bunny had left the snug underwood of the covert. There
was evidently a hot scent in the open, for the hounds dashed out
after him close to his tail, and, taking a bullfinch, disappeared
in the ditch beyond. They threw their tongues merrily, and
added their boisterous, chirruping music to the accompaniment of a
distant, but appreciative brass band, of sporting proclivities.
"Gone forrard aw-a-ay!" Indeed, " Aw-a-ay!"
Off they went! Friendly gates could not be taken advantage of,
so the field hurried along the high road as if they had to catch a
train, which was seldom late! The pack had vanished from view,
having stopped in the kitchen-garden attached to a oountry public-
house, and the only way to get up to them was to negotiate every
possible and impossible fenoe on foot. Providenoe must provide for
the rest!
Crash, crash, went the timbers of a stiff double rail as a waggon of
hay moved aside to let a hansom pass! Suddenly they heard a rail-
way whistle, and the Master called off the hounds. He appealed to
them by their names, and, obedient to his cry, they came whining
towards him, and began fawning about his boots.
"Darn this rain!" he exclaimed, resentfully, as he distributed
sugar amongst his canine favourites. "It ain't fit to hunt in."
This had been for a long time the opinion of Captain Dashover,
who had turned back, and was on his way home. He was progress-
ing slowly as, beneath him, was one of the most perfect and resolute
walkers that ever looked through a bridle, when he saw Master
Bunny seated in the very centre of the road, devouring a piece of
oabbage. In a moment his horn was to his lips, and he blew a
strange, weird note that he had never heard before—perchance he
would never hear again! "Yoicks! Hi away! Hout and aboot,
Mon! Hoick, my beauty! Hoick, hoick at him! Hi forrard, hi
forrard tantivy! and the Captain was fairly excited. Sammy, the
horse, entered into the spirit of the thing, and took up the running
at a gentle trot. Disturbed at his meal, the wily rabbit jumped away
carrying his green-stuff with him. He ran on in this manner for
some yards, and then stopped and began a fresh nibble, but was off
again by the time the Captain had reached his new position. This
was repeated over and over again. Cap-
tain Dashovkr leant forward in the saddle,
and clasping his good horse's neck within
his arms, spoke an encouraging word to
him. Whatever tho man's faults were, he
was brave and knew no fear!
But Bunny was not to be caught. He 1
leapt and leapt until he approached the
sea! It was then the Captain stopped,
for he liked not the look of the sands. He
was on the eve of returning home when
Sammy suddenly pulled up, pricked up
his ears, and made a decided point at a oathing-machine. Alack,
alack, for poor Bunny! After a desperate encounter, the Captain
emerged from the submarine conveyance carrving with him the life-
less form of the quarry! He almost sighed as, in duty bound, he
sounded his horn onoe more, and shouted out yet again, " Hi forrard!
Hi forrard, tantivy!"
• •••**
"Pleasant run, Sir?" asked the man, touching his hat as the
Captain dismounted.
ExoeUentt" returned Dashover, paying the customary half-
orown, and pointing to his watch to prove that he had not enoroached
upon the second hour at the lower rate of two shillings, he left the
livery stables. Half an hour later he was hurriedly discussing a
boiling cup of tea and a well-toasted mufllu in his thrice-welcome
snuggery at home!

HERCULES FURENS.
(Modern Teutonic Version.)

"Eros, ho!
The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach mc,
Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rare:
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns n' the moon;
And with these hands, that grasp'd the heaviest
club,
Subdue my worthiest self."
Antony and Cleopatra, Act IV., Scene 10.
The shirt of Nessus! Teuton Hercules,
Art on thine -<£ta? Hot and ill at ease
At least thou seem'st. As when Alcides tore
Hooted Thessalian pines, and raised a roar
That sounded far o'er the Euhoio wave; [rave.
So crossed or thwarted dost thou ramp and
And every luckless soul who dares to stand
Erect within the reach of thy strong hand,
Wouldst treat like Lichas, hurling him afar
To plunge, like Vulcan or a falling star,
Headlong through air to ocean.
So the gods
Set heroes' muscles with their wits at odds,
In the old Titan times. Achilles raged,
And Ajax, foiled hy sage Ulysses, waged
A foolish war with flocks, making mad way
Amidst "the mingled multitude of prey
The herdsman's yet imparted care." So, too,
Alcides, whose god-given strength could hew
The hydra down, its poison felt at last;
And luckless Lichas from the hill-top cast,
Because a woman's jealousy had foiled
His eager passion and his purpose spoiled.
Thrice the great Hera-hated hero lost
His reason's balance, proud and passion-tost.
Is it that brawn and brain close-wedded work
Wild mischief; that the seeds of madness lark
• Sofhoclis' Ajar.

In all heroic might P What leech shall cure

Who, stirred to wrath, poor woolly sheep destroys,
Or vents his spleen on women, doctors, boys P
Strange proof of the sardonic whims of fate,
Strange satire on humanity's estate.

As brave as brawny, and as big as bold,
Should, tantrum-smitten, fall upon the flocks,
And midge-enraged retort by heaving rocks!

To hurl the stripling heavenward, grip of steel
Close-clenched upon the hapless youngster's heel!

Its folds constrain, its subtle poison stings
The hampered hero into fury wild;
Only the highest strength is calm and mild.

To mend Mark's fortune. Enobarbus knew
Cold Cesar had " subdued his judgment too."

In Policy's despite. Resume the club,

Ship Ahoy! Messmate,
For, my dear boy, I can see you! Not every
day, my hearty! because, when it is foggy, it is a long
way from Trafalgar Square to 85, Fleet Street. But you
should hear my voice, Mr. Punch, and, if you can't, why,
my dear eyes! here is my letter. Not that I used to
garnish my conversation with such old-fashioned nautical
terms when I was in the flesh. I put them in here
and there because I have been so long mast-headed (or,
rather, pillar-headed) in Charing Cross, that you would
not believe me a sea-dog—you land-lubber!—unless I
gave you a taste of the briny. And now, Mr. Punch, as
you are a sensible person, who knows a marling-spike
from a forecastle (please pronounce it "fokesle") yarn,
I will assume that you want to learn the reason of my
addressing you. Yes, you are right, my son of Nep-
tune!—I nave got a grievance. Having a grievance, I
write to you—I select you in preference to the Editor of
the Times} as I fancy that excellent and erudite gentle-
man has just now other fish to fry in the neighbourhood
of the Law Courts, and can't be bothered with the grum-
blings of a one-armed one-eyed old bronze statue stuck
on a column, like Patience on a Monument! And that
reminds me of what my grievance is. I am going to
complain of a Monument, and ask you to get it removed.
You hammered away at Wellington until he was
taken from Hyde Park Corner to Aldershot, and, if
you get my monumental incubus carted off to Brighton,

FELINE AMENITIES.
"I wish you hadn't asked Captain Wabeham, Lizzie. Horrid man I
I can't bear him!"
"Dear me, Charlotte—isn't the World bio enough for you both?"
"Yes; but your little Dining-room isn't!"
or, better still, Jericho, you will deserve the thanks not only of the dead, but of
the living.
You see, my heart of oak! up here I can catch what they are saying down
below, and I can assure you it is not pleasant listening. Charles the First made
an awful row when they put up the other one," and Havelock was equally
indignant. When Napier came he used language that really was dreadful, and
reminded me of the sort of things the troops used to utter when they were doing
duty in Flanders. He has kept it up ever since, and I am ashamed that Gordon
(who has just joined us) should have to hear it. The worst of it—shiver my
timbers!—it is justifiable. I ask you how would you like to have a person
dressed in classical costume, on a circus horse, set up close beside you? And
he is a person who did a deal of harm when he had the opportunity, and brought
the monarchy, of which we are all so justly proud, into disrepute. He is the
odd, the very odd man out, as they can't find any one to balance him. But
even had he been the best of men, his statue is so utterly ridiculous, that it is
a disgrace to the neighbourhood. After all, Charing Cross is not the place for
a circus, and the effigy is absolutely meaningless, unless appropriately supple-
mented with the presentment of Grimaldi in the habit as he lived. So cart the
circus-horse and its rider away, my good Mr. Punch, and earn the everlasting
gratitude of Your sincere friend and admirer,
Sparrow's Nest, Trafalgar Square, W. C. Nelson and Bronte.
P. S.—I see that some land-lubbers have been publishing my love-letters!
It is fortunate for them that circumstances over which I have no control prevent
me from getting at them! Wait until I secure a ladder, and then, bless their
dear eyes! they Bhall see what a British Tar can do with his fist, in the cause of

Has found too long at Courts his freest course.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [February 16, 1889.
THE PICKWICK SYMPHONY.
By One who Ought to Know.
"The play's the thing;," as the memher of the football club said
when they broke both his legs, smashed half-a-dozen ribs, and
jumped on his stummiok. Dessay it is, but it doesn't do for a man
at my time o' life to be out late o' nights. But my son Sammy—

A Dickens of a Cantata. The Sacred Lamp fitted with a new patent
Pick-wick.
smart young fellow is Sammy—'all-porter at the Kanunculus Club,
-aid a mattxnee wouldn't hurt me. Vot's that?" ses I. "Do you
take it 'ot or cold?" "Veil," ses he, "it depends upon the veather
and the wentilation. It's French for a play in the arternoon. I've
got a day orf o' Thursday, and I'll give you a snack in servants' 'all
—and we '11 go and see Pickwick." "None o' that, Sammy," says I,
pullin' him up short. "Never make game o' serious subjecks, as the
man said when the barber larfed arfter cutting his nose off by mis-
take. If they 're goin' to make fun o' the dear old Guv'nor, I'll let
'em see. Though I am seventy-four, I'm 'ale and 'arty, and can
pop in my left pretty 'andy if they 're up to any of their imperence."
Oh, you splendid old bounder," says Sammy, larfin fit to Dust his-
Belf. There's no imperence; it's a Dramatic Cantata." "Vot's
that, Sammy?" ses I; "if you don't condescend to talk English to
your only father, I snail be sorry as ever I had you eddicated. All
I can say is it don't sound proper; but if you'll pledge your word.
Sammy, as a 'all-porter and a gentleman, that my dear blessed old
Guv'nor ain't held up to reddicule, I '11 go."
And lor' what a time we 'ad in the servants' 'all! A snack he
called it. Why the swarry we had at Bath years ago was nothin'
to it, and Mr. John Smauker and Mr. Tackle vere noveres along
o' the affable young gents as sat down to dinner with us. They all
'ad heard o' me, and larfed and cracked their sides even when I
talked about the veather and asked for the mustard; every one was
so pleasant that I wanted to spend the arternoon there, with a glass
o' not brandy-and-water. But Sammy cut me short when I was
telling 'em all about the lark we 'ad at Nitkixs's, and said, quite
undutiful-like, "Come along, my rosy old fernomenon, keep that
till you publish your reminiscences," at which they all roared, till
the Secketerry sent down his compliments and he vished to know if
the kitchen-ohimbley was a-fire. As it was, we were late at the
Theatre—it was crammed full; but a friend o' Sammy's, who had
something to do with the Theatre—I think it was the Author—had
kep' a private box for us; and there was pretty music going on,
and a youth, not old enough to be trusted with a triangle, was
conducting the band, and makin' beleeve to play all the music with
a white stick as he flourished about. "Oo's that, Sammy P" says I
ses he, quite sharp and unfiiial, and up goes the Curtain!
TheTe was my old friend, Mrs. Bardell—but, there, if Mrs.
Bardell had only been half as pretty as Miss Lottie Venne. there
would have been no work for Dodson and Fogq, and I should have
had none o' the Guv'nor's money, or should have run away with
her that night I went up to pay the rent. If our Mrs. B. had only
sung like that, it would ha' been a question who would ha' run off
with her fust—Me or the Guv'nor, or Winkle, or Snodgrats, or
Tupman. Then Tommy Bardell comes in, and he and his mother
sing together. Then the Baker comes upon the scene. I'd forgotten
all about him; but now I remember the brazen-faced Lothair that I
always used to see lurkin' about Goswell Street. I'm certain our
Baker, though, couldn't sing half so well as Mr. Rutland Barrington.
I kept on noddin' my head to his delicious "Baker-roll," till Sammy
gave me a kick, and said, "Now, then, you mercurial old Mandarin,
mind that old noddle o' yourn don't roll into the stalls." But
when at last I saw the dear old Guv'nor—bless his dear old gig-lamps
and gaiters—come on to the stage, I shouted " Hooroar!" Sammy
said it was Mr. Arthur Cecil; bat I turned and said, quite solemn-
like, "Samivel, my son, I don't believe you." There he was, with
his dear old bald head, his capacious waistcoat, his blue coat, and his
kerseymere pantaloons. When he sang a song aboutme," The Happy
Valet," I nearly kicked the front of the box out, and shed tears
behind the curtain. Then to see the dear old chap sit down to
breakfast so nat'ral-like with a real relish. Always singin' he
was, and uncommon well he sang too. Vy didn't he tip us a stave
like that at Dingley Dell P And when he wasn't, Mrs. Bardell she
came in and took it up, and gradually got canoodlin' around him
—jest as our Mrs. Bardell tried to do. Then they sang a " sympa-
thetic duet"—then came the "Bardell Bolero, which everyone
cheered. Still she led the dear old man on—oh, how my poor old
Dad would have liked to see the artfulness o' vidders held up to
reddicule in publics—and at last faints slick off in his arms,Just like
our Mrs. B. did. The Baker returns, Tommy comes in, Mr. Pick-
wick gets more and more perplexed, and the piece finishes just the
minute before I was introduced to my dear old Master.
These players are bold enough—but they seem to know where to
draw the line. They have had the temerity to impersonate Mrs.
Bardell, Mr. Pickwick, and the Baker—but I don't think they are
quite darin' enough to try to take off Sam Weller—that would be
rather more than they could carry as the 'bus conductor said when
they wanted to put twenty inside. "Sammy," says I, when we
were taking three dozen of oysters apiece before tea, "the author of
your bein' is obleeged to you for your treat. Your snack was excel-
lent, your oysters are capital, and your Pickwick is first-rate. And
there is no one in the world can be a better judge of Pickwick—
Pickwick was the only man who was a hero to his wally—than his
old servant and faithful friend, your aged, but still lively parient,
Sam Weller."
WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
FIFTH EVENING.
"The other afternoon," began the Moon, "I saw a dear old
gentleman coming out of a toyshop, laden with parcels. The people
in the shop looked after him as he stepped into his carriage, and
supposed that he must have a num-
ber of nephews and nieces, whom
he was evidently in the habit of
spoiling. Now I knew that he had
none but grown-up relations, and
that he rather disliked children
than otherwise, and so I followed
him to where he lived, for I was
really curious to find out what he
would do with all the things he had
bought. I looked through the win-
dows of his room, and presently I
saw him come in, and put all his
parcels down, and carefully lock the
door, laughing to himself as he did
so with a glee of which he seemed
half ashamed. I was afraid he
would draw the curtains, but he did not seem to mind whether I saw
him or not, so long as nobody else did. First of all, he cleared the
table, and then he undid the packages one by one, and set out the
toys. There was a little railway train that went by clockwork on a
circular railroad, and he fitted the lines together, with all the stations
and tunnels, and wound up the engine, which ran, whirring and clat- I
tering, round and round. It was really a pretty sight. Then he
brought out regiment after regiment of the most beautiful tin-
soldiers, and set them up in order of battle, and fired peas at them
out of a oannon, till he was tired of that; and next he unpacked a
village, and after that a model fort, until I could almost have
believed that the table was part of the real world. He was perfectly
happy, playing with them, and there was nobody to send him to bed
until he was quite ready to go. And I knew that this had been the
dream of his life ever since he had left off being a boy, and had
had to amuse himself with grown-up things, or to work, without
leisure even for serious play. Now he was rich, and retired from
business, and able to please himself, without caring for the opinion
of the world, and this was what gave him most pleasure.

"I am not sure," added the Moon, "that I have not seen old
gentlemen, with nothing to do, and plenty of money to spend, who
amused themselves in ways which I thought far more foolish. For
all that, I sometimes wish he would ask a child or two in, now and
then, to play with him—but he never does."

ROBERT'S BOLD EXPERIMENT.
The " appinted day " for our great xperiment came orf last Batter-
day,—alius a slack day for us Waiters,—and we held our prelime-
nary meeting a day or two afore, to settle all about our safegards
afore running of our fearfool risk. We then
decided to have jest one glass of sherry and
bitters afore leaving home on the day of the
dinner, to prepare our poor insides for their
sewere trial, and a glass of sumthink hot, strong,
and sweet, reddy for us wen we got home. So
on Satterday, as I have said, we boldly assembld,
at 5 o'Clock sharp, to meet our fate like men.
', There was suttenly a werry unushal look of
,7 dogged resohishun, not to say depresshun, upon
'' the countingouses of all nine on us, when we
enterd the ouse of ospitalerty seleckted by our
kind Ost, who receeved us with as much geneality,
_ and ewen warmth, as if he had bin the Prime
Warden of sum Prime Liwery Company, and had taken his prelime-
nary glass of Sherry, Sec, as we had. But in coarse he hadn't.
The fust thing as struck us rayther forcibly was, that he was not
drest quite in the hi dress as his name woud have led us to xpect, as
of course we was, and alius are, but we arterwards learnt as he was
from the naybouring kingdom of Whales, which of coarse xplaind it.
We began with clear Turtel Soup, as promised, and suttenly
neether Being nor Rthek coud have beaten it. The one glass of
Maryskeno to be drunk with it was sumthink quite diffrent to what
we had xpected, but it wasn't at all bad, and Bbown ewen took a
second without flinching. B«t wen we cum to taste the 1874 win-
tage of the Black Current Wine, with the biled Sammon, we fust
looked at our Ost, and then at one another, and then we all put it
quietly down, ana took quite a long pull at sum Olimpia Water,
bottle full of which was most thortfully put before each on us.
With the ontrays we was handed some reel Orange Shampane,
which, if not quite like sweet Click Oh, was suttenly quite as good
as sum of the new brands as has been interdooced lately, which
praps aint saying much. With the remarkabel fine Saddel of
Mutton that followd, we had sum Ginger Hale, which was not at
all bad, and nicely warmed our somewhat estonished insides, which
was becoming jest a leetle ohilled at the large supply of cold water.
With the Game we had sum Punch, quite diffrent from any we
had ewer tasted afore, and called Winter Punch from its preshus
coldness, I spose.
The Orange Bitters with the Stilton was much admired, and was
unanimously repeated, as it quite warmed us up after the Punch.
The Dessert a good deal pnzzeld us, as there was such a wariety
of drinks to choose from. We began with the fine old Strawberry
Syrup of the silly brated 1880 growth, and then tried the Mureller
Cherry, and coud distinoktly teU the diffrence! But the faverite
was suttenly the Old Gingerett, which was reelly quite warming
and cum for ting.
Weather we shood have werry strongly objeckted to a glass or 2 of
fine old Sherry, as a last final settler, I declines to say; but Bbown,
in proposing the helth of our nobel Chairman in a bumper of Pine
Apple Cider, declared that not only was we much oblidged to him
for his orspertality, but that we had all thorowly injoyed our
rayther novel xperiment, and shood not at all mind trying it again
in the Summer, and we all shouted out. Here! Here!
I hardly expecs to be beleeved when I says that a reel Copperashun
Deputy, tho' a werry yung un, came in and jined us at Dessert,
and drank away at most of the lot as if he reelly preferred them to
old Port and Claret, which of course he may have done, and acshally
said as we shood all do the same if we wood but persewere 1
And now as to the final werdick.
In the fust place, we spent a nice cheerful evening, thanks to our
Ost and his trend the Deputy. In the second plaice, we didn't have
nothink to pay. In the third plaice, we didn't none of us drink the
glass of sumthink nice, as we had intended for to do when we got
home. I, for one, didn't want it, and, besides, Honner seemed to
forbid it, and there's Honner among Waiters as there is among—
well, say other people. In the fourth plaice, we all seam to have
slept the sleep of the temprate Waiter, and we hadn't not no hed-
aches on the follering morning!
And I werrily beleeves that, if they oood jest manidge to hintro-
duce a leetle more ginger into the warious liokwids, and not hand
round Black Current Wine with the biled Sammon, and, as I was
told as the dinner didn't cost more than harf the 'ushal price, that a
good many peepel as hasn't got quite so much money to spend as
other peepel, might be in juiced to try the new sistem, at any rate
ocashunaDy, and most speshally in warm weather.
There's jest one other important matter, as will keep on a pegging
away at me, and it's jest this—I alius finds as them as is most
libberal with their wine, is alius the most libberal with their money
to us pore ard working Waiters; but the nateral hinference as
surgests itself is such a paltry and shabby one, that I bannishes it
away with all the oontemp as it deserves. Robebt.

Second C. D. Started by the London edition of the New YorkHerald.
Mr. P. Come, you are out there—how about the Observer and the
Sunday Times, to say nothing of a number of London weekly papers
with special Sunday morning editions?
Both C. D.'s We never read them, because they appear on Sunday.
Mr. P. Indeed! Well, of course, you are quite right to act up to
your principles. And as, no doubt, you are consistent, I suppose
you never see any morning paper on a Monday?
First C. D. What nonsense! Of course we do. How should we
get on without the latest intelligence from abroad, and the latest
comments thereon P
Mr. P. All of which are most probably written and set in type
foryou on the Sunday for the following Monday.
First C. D. (astonished). Dear me!
Second C. D. (astounded]. You don't say so!
Mr. P. Yes, I do. And, pardon me, you really know very little
about the matter. You see, the movements of the world cannot be
ignored for two days out of the seven; and consequently there must be a
paper published on a Monday. Of course there should be as little
Sunday labour as possible, and I feel sure that in every newspaper
office in the kingdom this rule is observed. The great point is, that
there should be one day of rest in the week, and this point our trans-
Atlantic contemporary seems to have overlooked. I do not think its
omission will be to its ultimate advantage. As for the Observer and
the Sunday Times (both of them very old established papers), they
have supplied the want of a comparatively small public for many
years. I have no doubt you would find that in their cases no more
work is done in their offices on a Sunday morning than in many a
Fleet Street composing-room on a Sunday night. As to their distri-
bution on the first day of the week—does it entail in their cases
much more than getting a few tobacconists, who would be open on a
Sunday to sell cigars, to vend journals as well? Railways and cabs
and omnibuses are necessary evils that we are forced to tolerate every
day of the week, month, and year, and a news-cart or two on a
Sunday morning are not so very alarming after all, especially if they
carry to the home a paper that may outrival the attractions of the
pubuchouse. You mean well. Your Grace, and My Lord, but a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing. By all means secure one day of
rest in the seven for everyone, but do not run a tilt against neces-
sary labour, which, in the case of the London papers to which I have
referred, is practically work very late on Saturday night or very
early on Monday morning.

office to subscribe to the Observer," and the Bishop
carefullt/ produces the requisite funds for one year's order

"Now, if I Jump it, I shall certainly fall off ; and if I Dismount to open it,
I shall never oet on again."
A VALENTINE.
To an Advanced Woman.
Lady, in the ancient times,
I had sung to you of love,
Mingling freely in my rhymes
Soft allusions to the dove.
Now you'd scorn
me if I wrote
What the old-
world poets
taught;
For, as your slang
goes, your
"note''
Is all philosophic
thought.
You are equal now
t with man,
Rather better, as
it seems;
H With amazement
do we scan
All your high am-
bitious dreams.
You would vote, and then hold sway
In St. Stephens, and methinks
Han must by the cradle stay,
While the child has forty winks.
Once we numbered 'mid your charms,
Soft low voice and tender eye;
Now you wave a Maenad's arms,
On the platform shrieking high.
Where is all the gentle grace.
Where the soft seductive glance,
In the bold virago face,
Like a " PHroleute " of Franoe f
You go in for every " fad,"
Fancies that fanatics please;
Vaccination 's counted bad,
Thus you help a dire disease.
Little children, though they learn
Ample lessons all the time,
Their poor pittance must not earn,
Since it is in Pantomime.

Lady, though you 're now enroll'd
On committees, talking loud,
Trust me, in the days of old
You'd more reason to be proud.
Then no mannish maids we knew,
Man for woman's love would pine:
Can a cross between the two
Win me for a Valentine?
AN ALDERMANIC DIARY.
Find that I've been made a "County
Alderman" for London! Very gratifying,
but haven't the ghost of a notion what I'm
expected to do. It seems I've been "co-
opted," which sounds like the Stores. Friend
drops in, and tells me I'm elected "on the
Progressive ticket," and that it's " a glorious
triumph." Ask him, diffidently, whether as
an Alderman I shan't have to eat a lot of
dinners. Friend surprised; says that all that
sort of thing is done away with: dining not
a bit Progressive, it seems, and "we must
leave luxurious banquets and wine-bibbing
to effete old Corporation." Question still
remains. What are my duties as Alderman?
Meet brother Aldermen at my first County
Council. Find they are just as much at sea
as I am about their future" functions. A
spirited debate going on about "Barking Out-
fall." Some Councillors want to abolish it
and take London sewage down to East Coast.
Vote for the Outfall, to save expense to rate-
payers. Surprised afterwards to hear that
"Progressive policyis dead against Barking."
Warned by chief Wire-puller of Progressive
Party that I'd "better be careful" how I
vote. "Having been elected by reformers,
I am expected to vote a» a reformer," and
more to the same effect. Annoying.
Invited to grand City banquet. Never been
to one before. Go, and have a delightful
time of it. Never realised what good fellows
these City magnates are—almost as good as
the wine they generously provide for their
guests. Much gratified, too, to see what a lot
they seem to think of me. Query—is the Cor-
poration, after all, as effete as some people say?
Next Day.—Progressive Wire-puller calls.
"Regrets to hear I was seen at a City banquet
last night." I can't deny it. "Then all he
can say is, that he hopes it won't occur again."
I tell him that I hope it will occur frequently.
He makes a slighting allusion to flesh-pots,
and ends by saying that " there will be a pro-
posal, from the reactionary Councillors, that
Aldermen shall be invested with robes and a
chain, and I shall be expected to vote against
it." It seems that a robe and chain are con-
sidered the reverse of Progressive. Why?
Have voted—/or the trappings! Regret to
say, proposal lost, as most of Aldermen going
in constant fear of the energetio Wire-puller,
who organises the Party, and appears to dis-
organise most of its members. Go to another
Civic spread, and get a City official—on my
promising never to vote against the interests
of the old Corporation—to lend me hit robes
and gewgaws, including massive gold chain.
Now feet something like an Alderman.
Query.—Am I becoming a Retrogressist P
Anyhow, can't be pushed out of my position
for three years; so don't much care what the
Progressive Wire-puller thinks of me.
Later.—Attend a still more sumptuous en-
tertainment, this time given by a City Company.
Fine institutions, old City Companies—not
Progressive, perhaps, but hang progression 1
Go to bed in my robes and chain.
A PERSONAL ANSWER.
{By a Prejudiced Party.)
Why should not Ladies smoke
The fragrant cigarette?
Ah! surely that is asked in joke,
My sweet-lipped pet!
I know the practice grows,
Like others that are baneful;
But see a "weed" beneath your nose?
The thought's too painful!

Personal? Why, of course!
Yet 'tis "most relative."
Answer of more conclusive force
How could I give?
Let females coarse and plain,
With lips none care to kiss,
Puff what is womanhood's worst bane,
Though manhood's bliss.
But you, with birdlike lips,
And breath like briars m June?
No! Take my earnestest of tips—
'Tis not in tune.
Take no foul cigarette
Beneath that dainty nose.
Heavens! Who would fuming Tophet set
Too near the Rose?

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Economical Entertaining.—Your determination to show your friends how to lessen the
expense of social intercourse, and to exemplify your idea hy giving a oheap entertainment
yourself, is certainly spirited, hut we think on the whole we would advise you not to men-
tion your project, as you propose, on the cards of invitation. Your idea of decorating your
rooms with a dozen penny coloured lamps is tasty, and ought to afford some pleasure and
surprise to the two hundred and fifty guests you talk of inviting. Sixteen shillings is not
a large sum to spend on the supper, but as you say you are determined not to exceed this,
perhaps your plan of laying it out on tinned oysters would be the most effective. They
should be carefully re-served up on shells got from some adjacent dust-heap, and then, if
their flavour be well smothered with Chili vinegar and Cayenne pepper, it is just possible
that, coupled with the fact that there is nothing else to eat, they will pass muster, and even
in some instances, be swallowed hurriedly with relish. We think your receipt for
champagne-cup a little risky, one bottle of Jobsoa & Co.'s " Dry Creaming" (1889) being
hardly enough to mix with the six gallons of water, as you suggest. Perhaps a bottle of
cheap potato spirit, if added to the baverage, would help to give it character and a little
more of the "go" usually associated with this fashionable drink. Your method of
supplying the necessary music, by getting a mechanical street-piano into your hall, and
giving the man ninepence to play it the whole evening at the bottom of the stairs, is in
every way excellent. By all moans secure the services of the drunken linkman you
mention. Such an official is invaluable in assisting at the departure of your guests, and
would, with his familiar sallies, lend a fitting eclat to the conclusion of the whole enter-
tainment.
Dealing with a Mutiny on Board a Pleasure Yacht.—Your having started with
your friend the Duke and a distinguished company for a cruise down the Channel, with
a crew consisting of a crossing-sweeper, two Lascars, three "unemployed" riverside
loafers, and an ex-pirate, under the command of a dismissed Boulogne steamboat-steward,
who assured you he would be " quite sober as soon as he came on board," was hardly a
proceeding that promised a very successful issue to your voyage, and we are not surprised
to hear that at the close of the second day, when you had got out of the Thames, and
beyond the immediate hail of every passing ship, you found yourself suddenly face to
face with open mutiny. It must, as you describe, have been very annoying to you and
your guests, just when you were preparing to sit down to a comfortable little seven o'clock
dinner, to have had your cabin invaded by the
whole crew, hopelessly drunk, demanding a
year's wages in advance, the key of the spirit
cupboard, a free passage to America, and
threatening to scuttle tne yacht forthwith,
if these outrageous terms were not instantly
complied with. Your clearing out the in-
truders with a mop seems to have been a very
happy inspiration. Of course, the correct
thing would have been to have put the ring-
leaders in irons, but as you say you had no
irons on board, this was obviously impos-
sible. Your subsequently sending the Duke
"forward" in his slippers to read the Riot Act
to them, while you watched him from the
skylight with a loaded revolver, may be
regarded in a certain sense as a substitute for
this, and we think—though it led to nothing
more serious than his Grace being obliged
to retire under a shower of stout-bottles—was
certainly a little risky. However, "All's
well that ends well," and it was undeniably
fortunate your chancing on that tug that
eventually towed you into Margate. As you
evidently made no terms with the Captain,
you had better pay the £751 14s. (id. he de-
mands for his assistance, and not dispute it
in the County Court. It is a pity that, on
arriving, you quite forgot to hand your
mutinous crew over to the local police, and
that they all of them in consequence escaped.
An Awkward Bequest.—We can quite
understand your feeling puzzled to know now
to turn the hundred and fifty Bathing-
Machines, of which you have lately come
into possession under your Great Uncle's will,
to any profitable account, but feel convinced
that, if you only give free rein to a little
invention and enterprise, that you will
speedily solve the difficulty. Your idea of
starting a Farthing Omnibus Company has no
doubt something in it; but why not purchase
a hundred and fifty coal-barges, clap a
bathing-machine on to each, and supply the
public with a cheap and serviceable house-
boat? If you could do this, and manage to
get them all down at Henley by the next
regatta, we feel quite confident that you might
do an enormous business, and make quite a
little fortune. Anyhow, if worst comes to
worst, you can, of course, as you suggest,
get rid of them in half dozens through the
columns of the Bazaar in exchange for piano-
organs, bicycles, Japanese fans, guinea-pigs,
concertinas, cranberry jam, rare postage
stamps, and other attractive and useful
articles, for, as you very sensibly point out,
a bathing-maohine is always a useful thing
in itself, and sure to be in much request
amongst English middle-class families, espe-
cially those located in inland county towns
and suburban districts, where you might
anticipate some difficulty in running across
one at a moment's notice. Still, we think it
is a pity that the Executors had them sent
away from the sea-side, and delivered to you
at your place at Wimbledon, without giving
you any notice of their proceedings. It
would have been, we think, better, had they
first consulted you on the subject. However,
no doubt you will get rid of them in time.
We shall, of course, be 'glad to hear from
you how you get on with their disposal.
Pigeons and Crows. — The Post reports
experience of " heavenly weather" at Monte
Carlo—the shining hour improved by nobility
and gentry, British and foreign, with the
manly sport of pigeon-shooting. It needs not
be said that pigeons are plentiful at the
great Continental resort of gamblers and
gunners. Besides the birds turned out of
the trap, other pigeons are let into it, to be
plucked only, none shot, except those who
now and then shoot themselves, for example.

BALLADS OF TO-DAY.
FURNIVAL'S INN.
(By Houquet Walkere.)
iNyour still garden, when the bells are chiming,
When the rooks clamour, and the crocus blows.
And house-boat snails the border-bricks are sliming,
And light and shadow line the lawn in rows,

Think how, amid the roar of City traffic,
I make heart's music to the jarring din,
And spin Alcaic, Elegiac, Sapphic,
Taking mine ease in Furnival's Old Inn.
"FurnivaVs Inn, and FurnivaPs outt,
Fumival 's grown a gadabout;
Furnival 's here, and Fumival's there,
Thorough the crescent, athwart the square;
Furnival's off, and Furnival's on.
Whither, ye Shepherds, has Furnival gone T"
Bolls there a 'bus bv, or careers a hansom,
Rattles the peaceful Pickford's chariot-van,
Love still, with smiling eyes, will pay the ransom,
Still chant serene what man hath made of man.

Stay not the traffic now in Fetter Lane,
The Mail-cart Knight reveres his great exemplars,
And drives his palfrey half as fast again.
Still, through a conflorescent spilth of splendour,
Vanquishing Venice and the lim lagoon,
The heart will yearn for England's April tender,
Singing, Go, rill, along with sober boon.
And, like some great Express to Bath or Grantham,
Gleams of your voice that day you came to tea
Mingle for ever with the old-world anthem,
Sung on May morns to Tudor minstrelsie,

Her Majesty, having expressed her willingness to dispense with
the daylight display of shoulders at her Drawing Rooms, in the case
of applicants who can satisfy the Lord Chamberlain that on account
either of "illness or infirmity or advancing years," they are entitled
to a dispensation, it is probable that that functionary will find him-
self in some difficulty when called upon to discharge the rather
delicate duty entrusted to him. However, let him take heart. He
has merely to prepare the following brief paper of questions, and
request every fair applicant to fill up as much of it as she will or can
—and the thing is done:—
1. What illness have you had? State whether it was nettlerash,
measles, one of the five fevers, or any other contagious or infectious
disease that would necessitate your being wrapped up in its conva-
lescent stage in an East wind?
2. Are you infirm? If so, Btate the nature of your "infirmity."
Are you deaf, lame, or blind? Do you wear a wig. false teeth, or
a glass eye, or are you able to mention any other artificiality about
you that may warrant you in claiming the exemption on the plea
of your being considered "infirm "?
3. If you put forward the excuse of "advancing years," give your
age on your last birthday, and state, if you can, how your
"advancing years" tell on you? Do you totter and stagger as
you walk, and are you helped up the steps by the footman r Are
you hopelessly imbecile? Is your memory either going or gone?
or are you merely a middle-aged frisky matron, who tries to cut
out her own daughters, who say of her, behind her back, "Oh!
Mamma's too dreadful!" If not this, mention one or two signs,
such as a paralytic stroke or two, indicative of the fact that you are
generally breaking up, and should therefore enjoy the privilege of
attending the Queen's Drawing Room in a dress that will not accele-
rate the process by leaps and bounds.

If Mr. Frederick G. Kitton's first Number of Charles Dickens
by Pen and Pencil is a good sample of what
the whole work will be like—and there is no
reason to suppose it is not—it is likely to be a
valuable addition to the Biography of the
Author of Pickwick. In the present Number
there is a portrait of Dickens in 1835, there is
the portrait by Maclise in '39. There are
many additional Illustrations of great interest,
and in the letter-press there is not a little
that will be new to the countless admirers
of our great Novelist. The whole work seems
to be carried out with an exactness, and the
most careful attention to minute detail, that
renders it especially valuable. , TV

Dear Charlie,
'Ow's Eighty-nine serving you? Fust time I've wrote yer this year.
It's a pelting like fun as I start, and we 're in for a drencher, I fear.
Skates to-day seems as useless as snow-shoes; I've only 'ad mine on me twice,
But I do want to tip yer the tale of the gammock I had on the hioe.
The year began topping, dear pal, though old blokes as would doss in a bog
So long as 'twas muokilv warm, did complain of the frost and the fog.
Fog and frost! The old gonophs may grumble along o' the cold and the dark.
But they do me a treat. Who wants light when you 're out for a lap and a lark?

That's the wust of our climate, confound

It is sech as gives sport to hus snide 'uns. I went to Hyde Park and

Till the hice-men wos reglar at sea, and the crushers went dotty ashore.
We dodged 'em, we did ducks and drakes with big stones as went skidding along,
And bashed one or two gals on the hankies. In course this wos rorty and wrong;
But the fun of it, Charlie, the fun of it! Lor', I did laugh fit to crack,
When I shied a big chunk at a hico-hole, and caught a old bloke in the back.
He 'owled and went down like a hegg, and the crushers was soon on the nick,
But A 1 ain't a sprinter, and 'Arry for Bobby's a trifle too quick.
So we kep up the barney, dear boy, till the ice-men and slops wos that riled
That they pooty nigh bust, and the ice, so the papers all spluttered, wos spiled.

upon that matter. (Regaining his habitual self-confl-
dences. No, I alluded to the offer that has been made to
the Volunteer Artillery of two hundred and fifty-two
field-guns.
Mr. P. Pardon me, my Lord—but gammon! Call
that a move in the right direction, why they are all of an
obsolete pattern?
A. G. But still they will be useful for drill.
Mr. P. And the Volunteers, in exchange for these
old-fashioned muzzle-loaders, are to return into store the
40-^ounder rifled breech-loaders they already possess!
A nice arrangement trulv! How are the gunners to learn
their breech-loading drill?
A. G. (vaguely). By joining Schools of Instruction or
something.
Mr. P. Come, come, my Lord, you are too sensible to
mean what you say. As a matter of fact only officers
are entitled to attend the schools. And how many (non-
coms, and commissioned combined) can afford the time?
A. G. (shifting his around). Well, Sir, at any rate,
it's introducing a novelty.
Mr. P. It hasn't even that questionable merit. There
were numerous Volunteer Field Brigades (one of the best
was the 3rd Middlesex Artillery) until the War OfTioe
took it into (what it is pleased to call) its head to break
them up.
A. G. Well, Sir, as I suppose, we shall have to submit
to you, in the long run, what would you advise?
Mr. P. I advise nothing! I order that the obsolete
guns be returned into store, and that ones of the latest
pattern with all the most recent improvements be served
out to the Volunteers in their stead.
A, G. (grumpily). Anything else, SirP
Mr. P. Why, yes. "Just see that the Reserve of
Officers (that most useful body of men) are properly
treated. After a man has served twenty years, grant
him a step of brevet rank. It is only just. The
auxiliary Forces have this advantage, why not the
Reserve P
A. G. (making a note in his book). Certainly, Sir.
Yes, Sir. I will Bee that your suggestion is carried out.
Anything else, Sir?
Mr. P. Why, yes. I am busy. So you, my Lord,
can go! [Lord Wolseley salutes and exit, while Mr.

THEfollowingappears in the Daily Newt: —
f \ OVERNESS, dismissed from Conservative
vT clergyman's family for her Gladstonian views,
desires the assistance of her party in getting
SITUATION as COMPANION, or to teach young

Undoubtedly this is a case for the considera-
tion of Mr. Gladstone. In the same way, had
the lady been dismissed from a Liberal clergy-
man's family on account of her Salisburian
notions, the matter should have received the
immediate attention of Lord Salisbuby. At
the same time, we object to any Governess
having "views," and we deprecate the intro-
duction of politics into the schoolroom. If
this kind of thing were allowed to go on, poor
I'ateiuwmi lias would never have a moment's
peace. When he sought the quiet of his
home he would be made miserable by the
"views" of rosy Radicals or gleesome
Gladstonians; he would be annoyed by the
orations of Home-rulers in home-spun,
Tories in tailor-made frocks, Liberals in lace,
Conservatives in crinoline, Socialists in short
petticoats, and Fenians in frills. In fact, he
would find the house divided in most un-
parliamentary fashion.

ALL IN PLAY.
Dear Mr. Punch,
Whm I learned that it was your desire that I should, so to
speak, sample the London Theatres, not only for the henefit of the
Metropolitan Public, but for the information of the greater part of

"Good Old Blood and Thunder."
the civilised world (always " coming to town "), I was delighted, as
I knew I should at length have an opportunity of seeing Mr. Wilson
Bah rett once more in a romantic character. This pleasing tragedian
is, in my opinion, at his best as a persecuted hero of Melodrama.
I admit that some like his Hamlet (which certainly is a creation that
would not be considered incongruous in the Tottenham Court Road),
while others, I confess, find more pathos in his Claudian, than in
all the " serious moments" of Mr. Toole in Paw Claudian (good as
that popular gentleman is in the character) put together. For all
that, personally, I prefer Mr. Wilson Bakeett in some such imper-
sonation as John Langley in Good Old Times, than in any other.
It is delightful to hear him declaiming, in the centre of the stage,
the noblest sentiments. It is magnihcent to find him brave but
luckless during three-fourths of a piece, to come out braver than
ever and overwhelmed with good fortune in the last quarter. In
Good Old Timet (I did not quite understand the title, but fancy it
may be meant as a subtle compliment to the "leading journal,"
when I suggest that Good Old Punch would be better), Mr. Wilson
Barrett is a Sheriff of Cumberland, who has a mad clergyman
known as "Parson Langley" (this is the only way I can account for
this strange ecclesiastic being seemingly dispossessed of his property
by his own son, and certainly wearing the gaiters of a bishop) for a
father. As Sheriff, he has married Miss Eastlake, who, for some
reason or other, shirks meeting the murderer of her father,—a
murderer who also happens to be her lover, and who has concealed
his identity under an assumed name. Mr. Barrett becomes jealous
of this former lover, when
he pays him a visit on
Christmas Eve (which is
being kept festively in
Holme Place, Derwent-
water, with two motto-cards
and a few sprigs of holly),
but upon hnding subse-
quently that he (the mur-
derer) has been shot by his
(the Sheriffs) wife, oblig-
ingly takes the consequences
of Miss Eastlake's crime
upon his own shoulders.
ThoBe consequences entail
transportation for a series
of years to poor Mr. Wilson
Barrett, for life to Mr.
A Dangurous Situation. The Part-Author LewI8 Waller (the excel-
withhu (fowling.) piece, lent representative of the
villanous early lover of Miss Eastlake), and expatriation to Miss
Eastlake herself. The consequences further entail scenes in a convict
settlement, a long panorama, a serio-comic savage, a wholly humorous
colonial clergyman, and several sketches of low cookney lite. Here let
me say that I have discarded the names of the dramatis persona, and
kept to those of the performers, as the easiest means of identification.
To the last I was in doubt about the real title of the heroine, and I
fancy had the matter been brought before the learned President of
the Probate Division of the High Court of Justice, that his Lordship
would have been equally puzzled. Perhaps the most pleasing inoident

in the play is where Miss Eastlake, cleverly disguising herself as
Marie Antoinette, takes her convict husband into her household
without his discovering her identity. This is the nobler conduct on her
part, as the persecuted Mr. Barrett continually carries about with
him a gun that he handles so recklessly that it must be the terror of
all those within its range in the neighbourhood. In the course of
this charming situation, Mr. Barrett laments that he (the infant in
question unhappily being defunct) "will never see his baby boy."
And there are few who do not join in his sorrow, as a long line of
Langley's (with speeches to match) is a prospect that offers to most
persons a weird fascination. In the last scene the mad "Parson"
arrives in Tasmania (apparently with the insane idea of causing
Miss Eastlake to be hanged) is united to his son, and all ends
happily. This being so, it is unnecessary to add that the heroine
ceases to be Marie Antoinette by discarding her wig, and, having
done so, becomes once again the comely Mrs. Langley.
I can conscientiously recommend Good Old Times to those who
like the more ancient form of Melodrama. It reminded me fre-
quently of Good Old Skelt, not to say Good Old Penny Plain and

Twopence Coloured. On the first night the Panorama was a little
unmanageable, and consequently it was a comfort to me to see that
Mr. Wilson Barrett (who was very much to the front in a stationary
canoe) was accompanied by his Chaplain, as I cannot help thinking
that it would have been an extra trial to this always courteous
Tragedian had not the presence of a Clergyman exercised a restrain-
ing influence upon what would naturally have been, under suoh
trying circumstances, the bent of his eloquence. Had I been in big
place as part Author and leading Actor, I know that I should have
found great difficulty in uttering noble sentiments behind the scenes
to the stage-carpenters. However, all's well that ends well, and
Good Old Times ended very well indeed. Both Mr. Wilson Barrett
and Miss Eastlake received any number of floral souvenirs—a
demonstration which gave the former an opportunity of displaying
once again his pluck and common sense. This time not behind, but
before the curtain. A bouquet caught fire, and Mr. Wilson Barrett
immediately put it out with his boots.
Of the other theatres, I may.say that Nadgy is doing well at the

am told, has strengthened his legs in Sir John Falstaff, whioh were
thought at first (by the hypercritical) a little thin for the part. This
versatile Actor seems to be able to accomplish everything—he can
even supply his own understudy! Pickwick is flourishing at the
Comedy, and Macbeth is drawing enormous audiences to the Lyoeum.

Visitors to London should go to all the theatres; because, truth to say,
there is something worth seeing in every one of them. Probably by
the time these lines are published, the weather will be positively
charming. However, when I went the rounds, I found the roads
covered with ice and snow, and furs and wraps for evening dress
de rigueur. So cold was it, that it was with genuine reluctance
that I found myself The Critic from the Hearth.

their onnered bench, and he hadn't no Skarlet Kobe on, and, as has
bin said, a Alderman without his Skarlet Kobe is no ansumer than a
live lobster.
The butifool Counsel Chamber seemd just about to fit its new
ockepants, but I opes as they won't forget as they 're ony Quorterly
Tennants and allreddy under notice to quit.
I seed quite a lot of the old ritefool Owners up in the Gallery, and
they looked on at the rayther noisy perceedings, I think, with more
estonishment than hadmirashun. But they had a good menny broad
grins at the rayther noomerus mistakes as the yung Counsellors
made. Seweral Pints of Order was called for, but, I rayther think,
as many on 'em, judging from their thirsty looks, wood have
preferred ordering Pints of quite a ditterent kind. Why the wery
artiest larf of the hole arternoon was caused by the alushun of one
Counsellor to a " Shampane Supper!" Ah, my poor hard-working
Lundon Common Counsilmen! you may hutter such delishus words,
and cheer 'em to the Ecco, as you did on Tuesday arternoon, but
they will never be anything more reel to you than reckleoshuns of a
fairy dream!
At the end of the 2 hours of not werry hinteresting tork, xoept
when one onerabel Counsellor called another onerable Counsellor a
Trayter 1 Lord Primrose Rosbberry was elected Chairman in
plaice of the other almost unanimusly, and went and took his seat in
the Lord Mare's onered chair. And then came the treat of the
arternoon, and that was the new Chairman's speech, which I most
respecily calls a reel staggerer. In the fust plaice he sed as he had
never spent two more unoumferal hours, for they had all bin a tork-
ing about him all that time, and he wasn't alowd to say a word. He
then estonished us all, Counsellors, and Common Counselmen, and
"Waiters, and all by declaring that he quite agreed with the few
gentlemen as had woted against him that, neether by traning, or
capasity, or xperiens, was he at all fit for the plaice! Of course I
naterally thort as he was about to give it up, but he didn't, but
occypied the Chair for about two hours, and, allowing for what we 'r»
accustomed to in Lord Mares, did it werry creddibly. How the old
sperrit bubbles up in a true man! One of the new Common Counsel-
men, whe is also a old Common Counselman, kept adressing the new
Chairman as "My Lord Mare," at whioh they all larfed, hat I 've
werry little dowt but that my Lord Primrose Roseberry wished as
it was true. Who nose but that the singler mistake may be the
f erst thing to put the hambialius idear into his Lordship's honnerd hed.
Sum great Feelosofer has remarked that you can allers form sum-
think like a currect idea of the amount of branes in a Publiok
Assembly, by the proportion of ball deds among 'em, as it is the
hactivity of the brane as wares off the hare. Judging the New
Counsellors by this standpoint I shood say as they compares werry
unfavorably with the Ouse of Commons where the habsence of hare
is remarkabel.
The Counsel broke up about 7 a clock, and most on 'em drove away
direckly ether in their own private Carridges or Cabs. But a eon-
lingered about jest as if they thort as the grand
Old Copperashun might posserbly ask 'em to dinner, and it woodn't

inwited 'em to a nice snug little dinner at the Gildhall Tawern.

THE NAGS' TALE.
A representative gathering of London horses has just taken
place (in response to an urgent "whip") to consider the state of the
streets, and to support the action of the horse-owners and horse-
lovers who recently met at

Light and Leading.
the Barbican Repository to
debate the same subject.
A Bay Mare proposed that
their respected friend, the
Sorrel Nag, having once had
the honour to run in the
Derby Race (cheers), should
ocoupy the Chair.
The proposal was voted by
acclamation.
The Sorrel Nag, on taking
the Chair, begged to thank
his assembled friends for the
honour they had done him,
He supposed every horse present understood the object of the meeting.
{Cries of " Yes, yes ! ") He believed a gathering had recently taken
plaee in the City, at whioh some very sensible opinions were expressed
as to the exeorable state of the London pavements. (Cheers.) After
all, men could not know so much about that sort of thing as horses
themselves. Men laid the pavements, and horses used them. It was the
horses that slipped—the men only whipped. (Laughter, and cheers.)
He would now invite suggestions from any horse present. (Cheers.)
A Cab Horse, whose name failed to reach the reporters, in a lively
and humorous speech, desoribed the awful condition of asphaltewhen
greasy. The wood pavement was little better. "What was wanted
was scouring when muddy, and this scouring could take place at night.
(Cheers.) If that were done, and gravel strewn in slippery weather,
they would have very little to complain of. (General cheering.)
A Brewer's Dray Horse hoped his presumption—(" No, no.'")—in
rising to address such an aristocratic assembly of horses would be
pardoned. He knew he was called clumsy, but then he was very
strong. (Cheers.) What he could not understand was, why the
Authorities insisted on laying wood or asphalte at the bottoms of hills,
just where a horse's real collar-work began. (Cheers.) He would
rather sacrifice his oats any day than have to go up Ludgate Hill
in a greasy thaw. (Sympathetic cheering.)
A Spirited Roan said he noticed that the City people were going to
form themselves into a Standing Com-
mittee to watch the state of the reads.
The Horses who had to use the reads
were a fallingCommittee. (Laughter.)
He thought it was very appropriate
that the Authorities to appeal to about , _
the slimy nature of the pavements *:^KS
should be the Commissioners of Sewers.
(More laughter.)
A Piebald remarked that he should
like to say a few words about shoes,
which he feared were a necessity of what A Turn for the Turf (a sketch by
was called civilisation. He had recently Hone-lie).
had to change his shoe-maker
The Chair-Horse, interposing, remarked that he thought they
must keep off the subject of shoes; to which the Piebald replied
that the difficulty was to keep them on. (Laughter.)
A Bus Horse said that what he ohiefly complained of was having
too heavy a load behind him. To expect two horses to drag a cum-
brous machine uphill and down dale, with an average of twenty
passengers constantly in it or on it, was sheer cruelty. (Cheers.)
Another Bus Horse said in the Company to which he belonged, the
horses were well treated. ("OA."') He meant what he said. He
would never condescend to draw what was called a "Pirate,"
belonging to some needy private jobber, who could not afford to treat
his animals properly. (Cheers, and " Question.'")
A vote of thanks to the gentlemen who had taken part in the City
being carried without a singlt
dispersed to their respective stables.

Two rival hosts. They twangled musically,

But now four-square to the four winds they blow
Conflicting blasts, loud, gentle, fast, and slow,
Cacophonous and querulous of tone.

In harshly hurtling forth discordant shindy.
One wonders much what stable party-wall
Will be the first to totter and to fall
At this sonorous summons wild and windy.
The public tympanum has long been strained
By vigorous reveilles that have rained
All the recess in ceaseless charivari
From brazen lips and loudly-braying throats,
Till sense has wished the noodles and their notes,
With other nuisances, at—well, Old Harry.
Bugles and penny-trumpets silence now
Before the rousing right official row
Of the four heralds in their motley tabards.
Now hurrying hotly up, the rival hosts
Will tumble with loud tumult to their posts,
Maces will lift, and swords will fly from scabbards.

Sounds an advance that is not wild or weak;
So think at least the troops that heed its summons.

Big-lipped, the steadiest twangler in the Commons.
Hark! Tirra-lirra.' Surely that is not

'Tis strident, strong, a blast to fret and frighten.

Full-puffed, and nervous tremulous finger-tips,

No want of wind! Some hold there's overmuch,
And that the ancient stately truth of touch,
Famed in old tourney days, has now diminished;
But blow he can, like Boreas, and will blow
Until the tourney's issue all men know,
Or the old Herald's fiery course is finished.
And in his rear what blast is that which blown
Appears to blend and mingle with his own?
The harp upon the tabard 'scutcheoned only!
Yes, 'tis the new Hibernian Herald, he,
Whose tirra-lirra has so little glee,
Who, fixed amongst the four, yet looks so lonely.
Blow! Blow! Alarums and Excursions soon
Will follow. 'Tis a more than doubtful boon,
This innovation of the Fourfold Flourish.

VERY CIVIL LAW.
Is the course of the prosecution of Patrick Mollot for perjury
a witness of the name of Delaney was examined, and informed the
Court that ho was " a convict undergoing; penal servitude for life,"
for having conspired to murder Mr. Justice Lawson. A little later
Mr. Charles Matthews, the most courteous of Counsel, had
occasion to recall this misguided and luckless individual, when the
following dialogue is reported:—
"Mr. Matthews : I think, Delaney, you wish to make a correction in
your evidence. You said on Friday that you had not seen the prisoner from
the year 1882 until you saw him in the dock here, when you gave evidence.
Ia that so ?—Witness: No. I saw him in Holloway Prison.
"Where you are at present detained ?—Yea."
"Where you are at present detained " is delightful, and suggests
reflections of the pleasantest character. Why should we not he
polite with our prisoners? After all, harshness is a relic of bar-
barism. We have it on the authority of Ovid that the polish of
social life "Emollit mores, nec tinit esse feros," and Burely the
Bench and the Bar should lay the lesson to heart. Instead of the
usual painful conclusion to the more serious trials at the Central
Criminal Court, which commences with "Prisoner at the Bar," and
ends with "mercy on your soul," why should we not have something
like the following ?—
Scent.—The Old Bailey.
The Audience are awaiting the delivery of the Sentence.
Judge (assuming his black cap). Mr. William Sikes, will you
favour me by kindly standing at that Bar for a few moments—I will
not inconvenience you for many seconds. Thank you. I must ask
your pardon for wearing my hat while you remain uncovered, but
the fact is this Court is terribly draughty, and I find that even my
wig is not a sufficient protection against the chance of my taking a
sudden chill. Coughs and colds are so very prevalent at this incle-
ment season of the vear. Hem! I am sure we are very much
obliged to you for giving us so little trouble. Thanks to you. the
evidence upon which the jury have founded the verdict they have
just delivered is of the clearest possible character, and they have had
no difficulty consequently in arriving at a just conclusion. I am
sure that you will wish to join with me and the Lord Mayor who
sits on my right in offering them our sincerest recognition of their
valuable services. I will not weary you with the details of a matter
in which you have taken a prominent part, and with which, there-
fore, you are equally conversant as myself. It is my duty, however,—
a duty which is at once a pain and yet a pleasure,—to inform you that
the law requires certain formalities to be observed which I am con-
vinced will meet with your entire approbation. On leaving the par-
ticular portion of the Court which has been graced with your presence
on this most interesting occasion, you will be invited to return to
the apartments you have recently occupied. You will find that my
worthy friend, the Sheriff, has studied your comfort by providing a
handsome carriage and pair for your convenience. It is heartily at
your service, and I hope you will have a pleasant drive. A little
later, the Sheriff will call upon you and submit other arrangements
in contemplation, for your consideration. I have no doubt every-
thing will be entirely to your satisfaction, and—you will pardon the
innocent pleasantry—that enough rope will be given to you. We
must not De too strict with persons like yourself, accustomed to have
their own way. In conclusion, believe me, you have my earnest
desire for your future happiness. I must now reluctantly say adieu,
as we both have engagements that require immediate attention—
moreover, I am unwilling to trespass further upon your goodnature.
I have the honour to wish you a pleasant afternoon.

Surely this would he an improvement upon the present painfully
disagreeable formula. Perhaps Mr. Justice Hawkins (who has not
unfrequently taken a part in proceedings somewhat similar to those
to which we have referred) might like to inaugurate the new
regime? His Lordship is never wanting in courtesy, even now.
Were he to advance in the direction we have indicated, we feel sure
that, in a very short time, it would be a genuine pleasure for all of
us to hang upon his every word.

DOWN SOUTH.
Villa Rouge-gagne, Monte Carlo, Feb. 14.
Cher et Caro Monsignore Punchio,
Here at 9'30 a.m., having just finished my early chocolate and my
fragrant cigarette per esser felice—the adjective reminds me of what Mrs.
Ramsbotiiam said when, after telling her nephew not to smoke in the dining-
room, she found him with what he called " a fragrant weed " in his mouth, so
that, as she said, "I caught him in fragrante delicto"—but this quite en
parson^' as the waiter said when he saw his white tie reflected in a looking-
glass—here I am, sitting out amid the orange and lemon trees, feeling myself
making part of a Burne-Jones picture, in summerish attire, under a sunshade,
looking out on to the blue Mediterranean, down on to the hot and dusty road to
Nice, and up at the safiron-coloured tiles and the pale white-and-yellow walls of
the Citadel of Monaco. It is too hot to walk much—except, presently, down
hill, as far as the terrace of the Casino—so I prefer to bask beneath the pleasant
verandah while I read the day before yesterday's Times, which recounts how
London is in difficulties, as usual, with the snow, how the sun has shone fitfully,
for a few minutes at a time, during the day, and, in a general way, how beastly
the weather is everywhere but here.
On Monday we had our share of wind, for there was what Mrs. Ram terms
"a Minstrel," which raised blinding clouds of dust, and one minute you were
hot, and the next you were cold, the whole entertainment " presenting," as the
dear old lady above-mentioned says, "a complete illustration of one of Allsop's
Fables about the Sun, the Wind, and the Traveller." But to-day life is worth
living,—and it would be stiU more so if one oould look back without regret to
the result of last night's roulette, when I lost quite fifteen franos, or could
anticipate with certainty the successful issue of planking down the maximum on
a single number,—and, at the present moment, life would be perfectly enjoyable,
if two dirty raffish-looking troubadours, with a couple of guitars, had not
invaded the gardens, and commenced a serenade. Where are the police?
Where is the army of Monaco? They don't expect polioe, but they do expect
"coppers." And J shan't be happy till they get them. Their style and manner
reminds me of the Derby Day, and of the itinerant musicians whom one sees
outside public-houses in London, pursuing their caUing,
or rather, their bawling. I fancy under the influence
of a Franco-Italian sky I am dropping into poetry.
"It's the fine weather brings them out," says our con-
fidential waiter at the Hotel Windsor, " Comme let oiseaux
au prinlemp$" which is small compliment to the birds.
L very body here, in this wonderful Casino! Many who,
I imagine, must be neglecting their professional duties
"to serve tables." Some excellent people would like
to see each of these tables a " tabula rasa," but where's
the special and particular harm, any more, that is, than
in horse-racing, card-playing, Stock Exchange specula-
tion, or any other form of gambling?
Perhaps all gambling is bad,—I don't say it isn't, and
I certainly am far from saying it is,—but why is this
particular form of it at Monte Carlo to be denounced as
so utterly monstrous?
"Why," says some one to me. " notice the faces round
the tables! Look at the people! Did you ever see such
a set? Look at the women, regard the men! The Demon
of Play has seized them all! It is a Pandemonium 1"
"Quite so," I reply, "and by the way I observe several
distinguished English Statesmen and highly respectable
English ladies in that orowd—and—and—as tne red hasn't
turned up for the last four times, I shall put on lesguatrt
premiers, and on red—excuse me." And turning to
apologise to my companion for interrupting his flow of
moral conversation, I find I am addressing myself to a
perfect stranger, and that my virtuous friend has con-
trived to get a seat, and has his money on in four differ-
ent places. The Mediterranean is blue, the oranges and
lemons are yellow, the sun shines brightly, the air is
exhilarating— health before everything by all means. But
at Monte Carlo—as in Denmark where there was some-
thing rotten in the state tempore Hamletto—" the play's
the thing"—il n'y a que ja—run ne va plus—and. so I
finish my brief correspondence just to let you know where
I am. Well, I am on the four first, the middle dozen,
and red. I sign myself yours truly, singing—
"Monte Carlo is my Name!"
P.S.—I have returned from the Casino. Yes. The
rambling ought to be stopped. The weather is chilly,
will have the fire lighted. Such a fire! Only wood-
no coals. Bah! Why come here for health and change
of climate? Isn't good honest snow and muck in England,
and no sun, better than losing 500 francs in three-
quarters of an hour? And to think that if I had only put
on the qualre derniers, instead of the quatre premiers (as I
did), I might have won something fabulous. I shall send
for my bill. Where's a cheap restaurant? Shall I have
one turn more at the tables? Well, just one. To-night.
P.S. No. 2.—Lovely night! Beautiful moon! Stars
magnificent! Such an atmosphere! Who would stop in
England, and, above all, in smoky London, if they could
only get out here? Let me see; I '11 just empty out my
pockets—750 francs; that leaves me 250 to the good.
After all, there's no harm in gambling; merely pour
passer le temps. And then the place is so healthy!
Why, one can be up till two in the morning, and take
anything and everything, and Bmoke any amount, with-
out feeling the effect. The air is so exhilarating. Shall
stay here a few days more. Shall I play again i that is
the question. At present I am inclined to say, Monsieur,
faites votre jeu! J'y suis! I send you this as a sort of
diary j ust to show you what good the climate here is doing
to' Yours truly, M. C.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
SIXTH EVENING.
Hear what the Moon told Mr. Punch .—" I knew an Ant some time ago.
He belonged to the class of worker Ants, though he had been too much disturbed
in his mind of late to attend to his duties. Often of a night, when I was at my
full, and all the other ants in the hill were
busily engaged in their various labours,
he would come to the entrance of the
ant-hill, and gaze up at me with sorrowful,
hard, bright eyes. Frequently the other Ants
would follow, and endeavour, r>y striking him
with their antenna, to recall him to the work
he was born to perform—but he heeded them
not. He complained bitterly that the whole
universe was m league against him. Many a
time has he reproached me for what he called
my ' cold and passionless serenity'—and yet I
could not help it," the Moon said, plaintively,
"and I was really sorry for him. For a long
time I did not know the reason for his unhap-
piness—I thought it was what in Germany is
called' Welt-schmerz,' or despair over problems
in life which his intelligence was powerless to
solve. This is not uncommon among the more thoughtful Ants, and is'a very
sad thing to witness, because there is no certain cure for it.
"However, it was worse even than this, as I learnt a few nights ago. It was
not to me, after all, that he confided his sad secret, though I happened to be
shining when he unburdened himself to a Soldier Ant who was on sentinel duty
at the gates. They conversed, of course, by touching one another with their
antennae, but I understood them quite well. From what passed, it appeared
that this unhappy Ant was indeed to be pitied. He was suffering, as he said
himself, from the pangs of hopeless love, an attachment for one so far removed
from him in station that any return was impossible. The Sentinel was a rough
old warrior, and I thought he might have shown more sympathy. Females, such
was his opinion, were not worth so much fuss being made over them; he recom-
mended the other to ' be an Ant,' and forget his infatuation, but this, the Civilian
Ant declared, was out of the question while he lived. Then, gathering courage,
he disclosed who it was that was the object of his passion; and I myself grew
pale as I heard, for I could not have imagined such audacity. When I have
told you, it will be your turn to be shocked. You may even disbelieve it,
though it is quite true—the object of this misguided lover's attachment was no
less a personage than the Queen of the Ant-hill herself! "With antennae that
were quivering with emotion, he described how he had first beheld her, sitting in
the State Apartment, surrounded by pupa and eggs, and how he had never been
the same Ant since. Yes," said the Moon, thoughtfully, "I have seen many
lovers in my time, some of whom were in much the same position. I have seen
Antony at the feet of Cleopatea, I have heard the lutes of Rizzio and of
Chastelaed—but that poor, humble, labouring Ant showed a passion more really
volcanic than any I had ever witnessed before. He absolutely rolled in the dust,
and bit his hind legs in the agony he suffered, though the Sentinel remained un-
moved by it all, and, as soon as the hapless lover had grown calmer, summoned
the guard, and informed them of his monstrous presumption. Next I saw that
they marohed back through the gates into the Ant-hill with the labourer Ant
between them—a prisoner. The whole affair must have been kept very secret,"
eonoluded the Moon, "for, up to the present time, I have not seen a word about
it in any of your papers. 1 et I should like to know his fate, for I have not
been so interested in anything I have seen for a very long time.'

Tub Curse of Koshiu, by the Hon. Lewis Winofield. Curse-o'-Koshno.'
Sounds like a sneeze, doesn't it? But, anyway, this is not a book to be sneezed
at. It is an original story, treated in an original manner, which is mighty
refreshing in these days, when most novelists run in the same groove. It is a
thrilling romance, written in Japan, with real Japanese sensation, properties and
scenery painted on the spot. It is a genuine Japanese story, which is not, to an
untraveDed chap, an easy task to write—a capital bit of Japanese lacquer, whioh
should not lack a large, number of readers.
THE IMPROMPTU ARMAMENT.
A Lay of the Gunless Fleet.
"It has been circumstantially stated, that at least 15 great
war-shipB are useless for purposes of defence or attack, because
they are without guns."—Universal Review.
"It's as fine a fleet as you'd put to sea,
If you come to measure by steam and tons;
But you see, my Lord, it's no use to me,
If it ain't got none of them blessed guns!"
It was a rough old Admiral who spoke,
And then a muffled oath or two ne swore.
The First Lord smiled. He recognised the joke.—
The French in force wer6 threatening the Nore.
For war had on a sudden been declared,
And things had gone,—well, just a little wrong.
In fact Whitehall had not been quite prepared,
Although on paper they had come it strong.
The Channel somehow had been deftly cleared:
And now the sole force left, the foe to meet,
Was, as the evening papers truly "feared,"
These fifteen vessels of the Gunless Fleet!
And so the First Lord thought it out a bit.
"Look here," he cried. Don't fear. We'll see you
through,
You '11 have your ships all right and trim and fit;
And this is all, you know, you '11 have to do.
"Behind the Horse Guards—there, two guns you '11 find;
They mayn't, perhaps, prove quite the proper sort—
But take 'em. Then a third I've in my mind,
At Margate, by the flagstaff on the Fort.
"On Ramsgate pier you'11 find a couple more.
If of their size you 're going to complain,
Well, go to Mr. Aabbis. He's a store,
And p'raps might lend you some f rom Drury Lane.
"If you want more, there's some cracked thirty-twos
They '11 let you have, at Portsmouth, I '11 be bound.
So, thoujrh if not quite up to modern views,
Your fleet in guns won t be half badly found!
"So set about your work without delay!"
The Admiral responded, "Yes, my Lord I"
And gloomily went on his darkened way,
And, in low spirits, got his guns on board.
They had but one a-piece. He shook his head
As he, in tears, surveyed the sorry sight:
And then he called his Captains, and he said,—
"D 'you know, I think, we didn't ought to fight.
"But here's my orders sealed." He looked them o'er,
Then shook his head again. "It's all no go!"
He cried—" we've got to stop 'em at the Nore!
So follow, Mates; I'm off to meet the foe!"
Then they set sail. They hadn't far to run
Before they met the foe, and did their worst,—
Which wasn't much, for every British gun
That day, soon as they fired it, straightway burst.
And so the Frenchmen triumphed down the line,
Sank half the fleet, and took the rest in tow;
Sailed up the Thames, crushed Woolwich by a fine,
And with a shot or two laid Greenwich low.
And when the Times came out next day and moaned
In three long leaders o'er the " base defeat,"
And let the First Lord have it hot, and groaned
At his shortcomings with his " Gunless Fleet;"
Until it stirred the mob, who then and there,
Determinediobbery should have its fall,
Dragged the First Lord from his official chair,
And lynched him on a lamp-post in Whitehall.
Rough justice, p'raps—but still it served its turn;
For to the Board the revelation came,
That this new lesson they might have to learn,—
That public trust was not a party game!
And since that day each First Lord has relied,
The chances of invasion to prevent,
On ships with proper ordnance supplied—
And not on an Impromptu Armament!"

Nobody did it.
THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
January 21.—I am very much concerned at Lupin having started
a pony-trap. I said, "Lupin, are vou justified in this outrageous
extravagance?" Lupin replied, "Well, one must get to the City
somehow. I've only hired it, and
can give it up any time I like." I
repeated my question, "Are you
justified in this extravaeance?" He
replied, •" Look here, Guv.; excuse
my saying so, hut you 're a hit out
of date. It does not pay nowadays,
fiddling about over small things. I
don't mean anything personal,
GuVnor. My boss says, if I take his
tip, and stick to big things, I can make
big money!" I said I thought the
very idea of speculation most horri-
,„ fying. Lupin said, "It is not specu-
lation—it's a dead cert." I advised
him, at all events, not to continue the
pony and cart; but he replied, "I
made £200 in one day; now suppose
I only make £200 in a month, or put
it at £100 a month, which is ridiculously low—why, that is £1250 a
year. What's a few pounds a week for a trap?" I did not pursue
the subject further, oeyond sayinsr that I should feel glad when
the Autumn came, and Lupin would be of age, and responsible for
his own debts. He answered, "My dear Guv., I promise you faith-
fully that I will never speculate with what I have not got—I shall
only go on Job Cleanand's tips, and as he is in the 'know,' it is
pretty safe sailing." I felt somewhat relieved. Gowing called in
the evening, and to my surprise, informed me that, as he had made
£10 by one of Lupin's tips, he intended asking us and the Cummings
round next Saturday. Carrie and I said we should be delighted.
January 22.—I don't generally lose my temper with servants, but
I had to speak to Sarah rather sharply about a careless habit she has
recently contracted of shaking the table-cloth after removing the
breakfast things in a manner which causes all the crumbs to fall on
the carpet, eventually to be trodden in. Sarah answered very
rudely, "Oh, you are always complaining." I replied, "Indeed,
I am not. I spoke to you last week about walking all over the
drawing-room carpet with a piece of yellow soap on the heel of your
boot." She said. And you re always grumbling about your break-
fast." I said, '' No, I am not, but I feel perfectly justified in com-
plaining that I never can get a hard-boiled egg. The moment I
crack the shell it spurts all over the plate, and 1 have spoken to you
at least fifty times about it." She began to ory and make a scene,
but fortunately my 'bus came by, so I had a good excuse for leaving
her. Gowing left a message in the evening that we were not to
forget next Saturday. Carrie amusingly said, "As he has never
asked any friends before, we are not likely to forget it."
January 23.—I asked Lupin to try and change the hard brushes he
recently made me a present of, for some softer ones, as my hair-
dresser tells me I ought not to brush my hair too much just now.
January 24.—The new chimney-glass came home for the back
drawing-room. Carrie arranged some fans very prettily on the
top and on each side. It is an immense improvement to the room.
January 25.—We had just finished our tea, when who should
come in but Cummings, who has not been here for over three weeks.
I I noticed he looked anything but well, so I said, "Well, Cummings,
| how are you? You look a little blue." He replied, "Yes; and I
feel blue, too." I said, "Why, what's the matter?" He said,
"Oh, nothing, except that I have been on my back for a couple of
weeks; that's all. At one time my doctor nearly gave me up,
yet not a soul has come near me. No one has even taken the trouble
to inquire whether I was alive or dead." I said, "This is the first I have
heard of it. I have passed your house several nights, and presumed
you had company, as the rooms were so brilliantly lighted. Cum-
xnros replied, "No. The only company I have had was my wife,
the doctor, and the landlady; the last-named having turned out a
perfect trump. I wonder you did not see it in the paper. I know it
was mentioned in the Bicycle Newt." I thought to cheer him up,
I and said,—" Well, you are all right now?" He replied,—" That's
not the question. The question is, whether an illness does not
I enable you to discover who are your true friends." I said such an
observation was unworthy of him. To make matters worse, in came
Gowing, who gave Cumminos a violent slap on the back, and said,
"Holloh! Have you seen a Ghost? You looked scared to death,
like Irving in Macbeth." I said, "Gently. Gowing—the poor
fellow has been very ill." Gowing roared with laughter, and said,
"Yes, and you look it too," Cummtngs quietly said, "Yes, and I
feel it too—not that I suppose you care." An awkward silence fol-
lowed. Gowing said, Never mind, Cummings. You and the
Missis come round to my place to-morrow, and it will cheer you up
re '11 open a bottle of wine."
January 26. An extraordinary thing happened. Cahrie and I
went round to Gowing's, as arranged, at naif-past seven. We
knocked and rang several times without getting an answer. At last
the latch was drawn and the door opened a little way, the chain still
being up. A man in shirt-sleeves put his head throueh and said,
"Who is it? What do you want?" I said, "Mr. Gowing. He
is expecting us." The man said fas well as I could hear, owing to
the yapping of a little do?), "I don't think he is. Mr. Gowikg is
notatnome." I said, "He will be in directly." At this moment
Cummings and his wife arrived. Cummings was very lame and
leaning on a stick, but got up the steps and asked what the matter
was. The man said, " Mr. Gowing said nothing about expecting
anyone. All he said was he had just received an invitation to
Croydon, and he should not be back till Monday evening. He took
his bag with him." I was too indignant to say anything. Cummings
looked white with rage, and as he descended the steps, and struck his
stick violently on the ground and said, "Scoundrel!
A WEATHER WAIL.

Can any man be weather-wise!"—bongs of a Sanfarorum.

What is the use of forecasts and

Silly the study of air and of sea.

patical.

and magnetical,
How you will grieve if your

If in fur garments you 're peripa-

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
An Amateur Menagerie.—Your deter-
mination to make the two full-grown Bengal
tigers and the boa constrictor, that have
recently reached you as a present from your
friend the Indian Nabob, the nucleus of a
little private Menagerie, which you purpose
starting for the amusement and entertain-
ment of your friends, does credit to your
spirit ana enterprise, and your temporary
sojourn at your invalid Uncle's suburban
residence seems, on the whole, to offer some
conspicuous advantages for the inauguration
of your little project. It is certainly a matter
of congratulation that, with the aid of the
sixteen dock labourers who brought them,
you were able, by getting their heads into a
couple of coal-sacks, to move the tigers
up to the back drawing-room; and that,
though they have torn down the looking-
glass, the chandelier, the wainscoat, and have
eaten away the inside of a cottage-piano, as
yon keep them supplied with a fresh leg of
mutton every half nour, you may consider
that, for the moment, at all events, you have
them fairly under control. Your having,
however, consigned the African lion you
Surchased at the Wild Beast Emporium at
[ile End the same evening to the bath-room,
though only a temporary measure, strikes us
as slightly injudicious; for, in the event of
your invalid Uncle wishing to take his
customary bath before retiring to bed, the
creature could hardly be got out of the way
at a moment's notice without the interven-
tion of at least a dozen policemen, provided
with red-hot pincers, gags, and other suitable
apparatus, thereby causing a commotion, cal-
culated to act prejudicially on the nervous
system of any one who, like your Uncle, is
under strict injunctions from his Doctor to
avoid, at all costs, any unusual or unneces-
sary excitement. The elephant that you have
managed to get into the front area seems all
right, though his "trumpeting" all night
appears to nave annoyed your neighbours
opposite; but it is a great misfortune that
you have let the boa constrictor escape out
of the attic window, and that it should have
terrified a five o'clock tea-party next door by
coming down the drawing-room chimney. By
all means send round a clothes-basket for it,
with your apologies, as soon as it is dark,
and keep it in future, as you propose, in the
linen-cupboard. As your Uncle is still keep-
ing his room upstairs, perhaps it would be as
well not to mention the arrival of the oreatures,
especially as you are intending, as you Bay,
to get them all down to-morrow to the house
of a friend in the country, who has given you
leave to bring a few domestic "pets" with
you. Yes, certainly, if you can't get an
omnibus big enough, take them all down in a
furniture-van. The elephant, by the way,
might walk. It would perhaps be as well to
arrive in the dark.
Rare Plants.—The itinerant vendor who
persuaded you that he was letting you have
a selection of "the choicest Orchids out" at
one-and-twopence a dozen, must have been
deceiving you. We don't know the Tropica
gigantiflora Hackneywicki, but feel sure you
oan't have been offered the correct thing at two
plants for three-halfpence. We are afraid
that you have been taken in.

The tree-tops feather
The sharp, cold line of the sky;
In the windy weather
The clacketty mill-sails fly.
The brown furrows
Follow the sturdy team;
On sandy burrows
Patches of sunlight gleam.
(The breezy vision
Is banish d from fancy's eye
By fierce collision
With a corpulent passer-by.)
Like solemn Hindoos
The night-clouds are swathed in white,
And the shop-windows
Shame them with shameless light;
But day lingers
Over the weary land,
With wan fingers
Soothing its sleeping hand,
As a lone mother,
Weary with anguish wild,
Her grief will smother
Nursing a neighbour's child.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON COMMISSION.
Preliminary and Explanatory,—I must confess that I felt very
greatly gratified when my learned friend, Mr. Toby, Q.C., M.P.,
having work in "another place," asked me to "take a note," for
him, of the proceedings now claiming attention at the hands of the
President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division, and
Messrs. Justices Smith and Day.
"Just jot down what occurs to you, Briefless," he said. ""Tou
see we have a pretty full report in the daily papers, to say nothing of
the verbatim shorthand note supplied by the Court itself, so that I
am not very anxious about the evidence. Bnt I should like to know
how it's going. I give you the greatest latitude, and would suggest
(if you have no objection) that you should not robe, for you will be
more at home without your wig and gown."
1 did not quite follow my learned friend's reasoning in the last
particular. However, without further prefaoe, I append the '' note"
taken in the unconventional fashion that has received his recom-
mendation.
Tuesday, February 19. — Some difficulty in obtaining a seat.
Seemingly the place, if
any, to which the green
ticket I held entitled me
was oocupied. Upon re-
monstrating, I was in-
formed that I could not
possibly have it, and I
felt that as I was not in
my robes, I was practic-
ally powerless. I was
glad at length to sit
amongst the gentlemen
of the Press, for whom a
limited number of places
had been reserved. The
rest of the Court was
occupied by persons who
certainly did not look in
the least like journalists.
I was forced, I fear, to
be the oause of great inconvenience. I oannot sufficiently thank, under
these trying oircumstances, two eminent descriptive writers who, in
the most courteous manner imaginable, permitted me, so to speak, to
occupy a moiety of their laps,—each supplying one of their knees
for my accommodation. However, in this position I suffered under
the disadvantage of having to take my note with a very friendly
(but still an) elbow in my ribs on one side of my body, and an equally
friendly (but still equally an) elbow in my ribs on the other. My
situation was further distracted by the movements of one of the
officials, who while the Court was present, was foroed to give direc-
tions to somebody (who I fancy was sitting on someone else's hat) in
dumb show.
The proceedings commenced with an application by Sir Charles
Russell to commit someone for contempt of court. My hearing is
scaroely so good as it used to be, and I regret to say I did not quite
oatoh what passed. And this was the stranger, as Sir Charles and
the President spoke with
their customary distinct-
ness. I asked a gentleman
near me to tell me what had

Reserved for the Press.

Reserved for the Pnblio.
The same old game,"
was the immediate reply.
"Russell to get the affi-
davit and the rest of the
bag of tricks, and then
those chaps on the Bench
will think it over."
Scandalised at this disre-
spectful reference to their
Lordships, I turned my
attention to the witness-
box, and found Mr. Mac-
oonald (the Manager of the
Timet) in possession. I must confess that I was astounded at
the acuteness shown by this gentleman in answering some of
my learned friend Mr. Asqutth's questions. His caution, his
candour, and his shrewdness were eqnally remarkable. As for
my learned friend, he acquitted himself so admirably, that I made a
mental note that, should an opportunity ever occur, I would do my
very best to get him to consent to act as my devil. During the
hearing a point of law was raised—Had a Counsel the right to ask
the Manager of a newspaper for the name of a contributor P Sir
Charles Russell contended that he had, and when asked (by
Mr. Justice Smith) for a case, gave the instance of a witness
refreshing his memory from a diary or an account-book. The Court
having (so it appears to me) shown some dissatisfaction that the
name of the cause referred to had not been disclosed, I beg to supply
the omission, speaking roughly, from recollection. I ask leave to
instance the unreported case of Brown v. Jones, or was it Smith v.
Rohinnon t
Wednesday.—As I had been so seriously inconvenienced on the
previous day by having no seat, that I had had to abandon my note-
taking prematurely, I entered the Court early. My right to sit down
again being challenged, I appealed to the universally respected
Secretary to the Commission for redress. That learned gentleman,
having explained to me the scope of the verb hypothecate, most
courteously invited me to occupy a seat in the box usually reserved
for the Jury. I was very grateful thus to find at length a spot, the
possession of which could not be challenged, as I had hitherto felt a
sort of Nineteenth Century forensio embodiment of the old legend
(immortalised by the pen of Sue, and the pencil of Dour.) of the
continually perambulating pedestrian, who, although travelling all
the world over, had a legal domicile in Palestine. And here I may
note that I was much amused at the changes of position of some of
the spectators from day to day. The movements of Mr. Shaw-
Lefevre, for instance, reminded me of a game of ohess. On the
Tuesday this eminent statesman had occupied a seat with the Junior
Bar, but on the Wednesday he had moved down a bench, and, so to
speak, had taken a Q.C.—presumably my learned and respected
friend, Mr. Lockwood, who did not appear during the sitting.
Then there was Professor Brtce (whose Lectures before now have
filled me with a sensation of indescribable awe), who occupied a
place next to a well-known artist, who on the previous day had been
on the other side of the Court, and during the adjournment, presumably,
had (once more to use the ohess phraseology) "castled." The genial
Professor appeared to take a great interest in his neighbour's
sketches, and seemingly frequently encouraged him to renewed
exertions with a smile of friendly approval. This being the case, I
was sorry to find, later on, Mr. Bryce shifted away from his neigh-
bour, and carried (by a sort of Knight's move) from the right of the
Bench to the left of the Witness Box.
The feature of the sitting was the cross-examination of Mr.
Houston by Sir Charles Russell. It is my candid and deliberate
opinion that more searching questions could not have been put to
this witness, even had I oross-examined him myself.
Thursday.—I notice that a great deal depends upon the Ushers of
the Court. Seemingly, when one of these officials thinks a statement
of sufficient importance has been made to cause a sort of bold whisper
(and thus warrant the parenthesis " Sensation" in the daily reports),
he shouts " Silence!" He adopts the same plan to mark the proper
insertion of " laughter " after some one has audibly smiled. To-day,
for the first half an hoar or so, there being nothing to do, the Ushers
had a grand time of it. The Secretary was also well to the front.
The celebrated Parnell Letters were examined in the course of the
day's proceedings, and then came his opportunity. _ This resembles
in some degree what followed, thrown into a dramatic form:—
Mr. Attorney (addressing Secretary courteously). Will you be so
good as to separate these two letters, which, I find, are in the same
case?
Secretary (very distinctly). Tou are quite right, they are in the
same case. (Solemnly.) I put them in the same case myself, for
convenience. {Ax a concession.) But if you think they will be more
convenient in separate cases—(with an
air of authority)—I will have them
divided, and put into separate cases at
once!
Mr. Attorney (bowing deferentially).
If you please.
Secretary (good-naturedly). Certainly.
{Decisively.) The letters shall be put in
different cases forthwith.
This dialogue, heard in a dead silence,
was really most impressive and interest-
ing. Exciting, however, as was the
evidence given during the sitting, the
day's sensation was, in fact, the sensation
of the Day. It has been suggested (in
my opinion most improperly) that the
excellent Justice of that name, has
occasionally, during this protracted
inquiry shown signs of weariness. I must
confess that, when the occasion warranted it, his Lordship was
much awake indeed. Several times during the course of the examin-
ation and cross-examination of Mr. Pioott, Mr. Justice Day Bhowed
that he was following the inquiry with as much interest as the most
excited spectator. It may have been a surprise to those who had a
preconceived idea of his Lordship, but to those who have long known
him as one of the ablest Judges on the Bench, and one of the wittiest
and kindest of men, this demonstration of acute intelligence caused
no sort of astonishment.
At the luncheon adjournment one of the officials, as usual, was good

enough to pive information on seemingly abstruse points of law to
the more intelligent and younger members of the aristocracy, who
very properly seemed to regard him as a second edition of that
admirable legislator the present Lord Chancellor. Again Sir
Charles Russell conducted his case with an ability that made me
feel regret that I could not claim him as a pupil who had read in my
own chambers.

note. I must confess the last

"Will we walk a little faster?" said the Miller to the Maid.
"There's the Cooper close behind us, and a Miller's ne'er afraid;
But 'twould make the laddie's heart beat sair beneath the chestnut
shade,
If he saw us walk together in the hey-day, yeo-ho weather,
Since hand in hand a week agone wi' you the Cooper stray*d."
"Oh, Miller, Miller, Miller," the winsome lass replied,
"In flow'ring rush and meadow-sweet that grow the stream beside,
The ferry-boy his ferry-boat against the bank has tied;
Then, sweetheart, blithe and merry, you shall row me o'er the ferry;
Though Cooper John is cross and sad, the stream is deep and wide."
He has row'd her o'er the river; they have climbed the fencing
slight,
Where Lettice fair, the laundry lass, has hung the kirtle white,
And in Farmer Giles's clover-field their troth they 're fain to plight;
But the brindled bull was feeding, broke in upon their pleading,
And toss'd them o'er the palings in the golden evening light.
Up to the star-land sailing,
Over the pleasaunce paling,
It is merrie, merrie merrie in the crimson evening glow;
Birds in the orchard housing,
Kine in the olover browsing,
And a ferry-boat is drifting fast where deep weir-waters flow.

PATCHING THE "PALLADIUM."
Mr. Nestor-Punch speaketh :—
Who knows not Ilion's tale? How, dropped
from heaven,
Pallas's statue, to King Ilu« given,
Assured the safety of Troy's citadel
So long as Troy that image guarded well?
True patriot's charge was the Palladium's
Neglected, lost, or out of due repair, [care;
Its power-protective property was lost
To traitors shrinking from its charge or cost.
For what could reconcile "the Dlue-eyed
maid" [trayed?
For her stol'n statue, and her tower be-
"For so religion and the gods ordain,
That if you violate with hands profane
Minerva's irift, your town in flames shall
burn."* [learn
Jons Bull, from the old legend you may
Opportune lesson. Trust your Punch, old hoy,
Ana take to heart this ancient Tale of Troy.
Traitors kick out, strike dogs of faction dumb,
England, like Troy, has her Palladium,
Britannia rules the waves! The brave old
boast [cost.
If you'd maintain, you must not count the
Britannia 'b self in crested helm arrayed
Resembles wondrously the blue-eyed maid
Whose shield was Troy's assurance, and
whose spear, [fear.
Unblunted, shook Troy's fiercest foes with
The helm, the trident, and the buckler, John,
Are arms that Pallas would be proud to don
As goddess-guardian of our sea-girt isle.
One pictures Neptune, with a pleasant smile,
• Viroii, JEneid, II.
Placing his tri-pronged fork, the emblem
grand
Of ooean rule, in his great sister's hand.
'' Here you are, Pallas! John 's a pal of mine,
My pet and partner on the billowy brine;
Your head-piece and my trident ought to be
Combined to keep him ruler of the sea—
Minerva armed by Father Neptune! Come!
That's something like a New Palladium!"
Twig, John P The truth is patent to your eyes,
Though put by Punch in semi-classic guise.
Ilion's Palladium was Minerva's form—
Whilst Troy held that, no foe its walls might
storm:
Ours is Britannia, armed to hold the main,
So that no foe our citadel may gain;
'Tis yours to keep the Sea-queen helmet-
crowned,
Her trident pointed, and her buckler sound.
That duty to fulfil grudge no expense,
England's first need is National Defence.
Patriots no wise expenditure would spare
To keep our great Palladium in repair,
Whioh lost, or left to fall into decay,
England, like Ilion, shall have seen her day;
Her pride is lowered, and her hope is sped,
Then let Ulysses come, or Diomed,
Alien astuteness, foreign valour, creep
Into our citadel what time we sleep,
Or count our ooin, we by false thrift ensnared,
For valiant onset shall he unprepared,
And lost in petty reckonings of pence,
Lack time or heart for National Defence.
No, John; to do yon justice, you'll noi mind
The cost of your Palladium, if you find
Its guardians vigilant in honest care,
And its proud panoply in full repair.
'Tis their first duty, all too lone ignored,
They've spent your money, but have not
restored
That tutelary figure to such state
As only makes you master of your fate.
What mean those blunted points—that dinted
shield? [should yield.
Not thus the crest should droop, the neck
Erect and cap-a-pie the shape should stand,
Vigour at heart, and valour in its hand.
Cost money? Yes, good Goschen, without
doubt, [he's about,
And Bull—like Punch—would Know what
In loosening his purse-strings once again,
So often loosed aforetime, and in vain.
No trumpery temporary patching, pray,
To furbish our Palladium for a day;
No squandering of millions, spent tant wit,
On arms that bend, and helm that will not fit.
No, put it once for all in sound repair,
John Bull's Palladium, and he will not care
To haggle over pence. But fumble on.
As you, and those whom you succeed, have
done
This many a weary year, and John, tired out
By rival bogglers turu-and-turn-about,
Each potent in self-praise and party curse,
Till each guards the Palladium — and the
purse;
Kicks out the rival duffers—and does worse.
John will declare the whole bad squabbling
batch
Not patriots hut Sinons; not a match
For hostile Greeks, or champions, or spies.
But warders who invite the foe's surprise,
Like those of old Troy's Temple, who slept on,
Waking to find death near, and their Palla-
dium gone!

'CLEVER WITH HOUNDS." MR. TOPPLE'S SECOND HORSE.
MOANS AT A MATINEE.
"For years we've come to this decision,
That lovely woman blind* our vision!"
The Gloomy Oargler of the Qangei.
In a well-cushioned ten-shilling Stall,
An elderly gentleman sat;
But he sat ana saw nothing at all—
His vision was barred by a Hat!
For a lady was
sitting Wore
— I fear the
old gent
muttered,
"Drat!"—
When he saw
that her lady-
ship wore
A marvellous
ste eple-
crownedHat!
It obscured e'en
a glimpse of
the stage,
With feathers,
and flowers,
and plait;
And the playgoer got in a rage—
His pleasure was spoilt by a Hat!
All the music he heard, it is true,
And sound of the dance—pit-a-pat;
But of Bingers and danoers the view
Was hid by that horrible Hat!
Thus for aught he could tell of the play,
He might nave been blind as a bat;
He had nothing to do but survey
The build of a frivolous Hat!
So he dodged it each side with a frown—
And, testily, murmured he, "Cat!"—

He got up, but they all oried, "Sit down!"
He wished he could sit on that Hat!
Now let Managers auickly decide
To issue at once their fi-atf,
That the ladies should all be denied
Such tyrannous use of the Hat.
For why should we ten shillings pay—
Can Managers answer me that r—
To see, at a long Mati-nl«,
Just naught but a feminine Hat?
WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOOH SAW.
SEVENTH EVENING.
"I love the Children," said the Moon,
"especially the quite little one*—they are
so droll. Why do you look like that? I
trill know. ... Oh, so Hans Andersen
declares I said the same thing to him long
ago, does he? / should have thought it
would have been more polite to put it down
to a ' literary coincidence ;' but, as you will
probably be able to find all that I was going
to tell you in his book, I shall evidently
waste my time in talking to you!" said
the Moon, looking distinctly flushed.—" Good
evening!" and, drawing a cloud around him,
he promptly became invisible. Mr. Punch,
however, lay low and said nuffln," and
presently, as he had foreseen, the Moon came
out again. "If you really want me to go on,"
he said, in a much milder tone, "I will—
but please have the goodness not to mention
Hans Andersen to me again. I know very
well that I am not clever, and that he was a
genius—but, for all that, one doesn't care to
ave words put into one's mouth, even by a
genius, does one?
"Last night, then, I shone down on a small
garden at the back of a suburban villa. Two
children, a little boy and a still smaller girl,
were digging in one of the side-beds; both
looked very solemn, and this was proper, as
they were engaged in a sad occupation. They
were burying the little girl's doll, which had
died that morning, of scarlet fever and old
age. At least, the boy said so most positively,
and his sister,—although she would never
have discovered for herself that the doll had
died, and could not, even now, see any striking
difference in her ap-
pearance, — had too
much respect for his
opinion to dream of
contradicting it. So
the doll—a forlorn-
looking object, cer-
tainly, — was being
buriea, and the boy,
who was grave-digger,
undertaker, and chief
mourner, all in one,
was enjoying himself
in a decent and sepul-
chral fashion. Before
he had quite finished
digging the hole,
(which he made deep
enough to hold a doll's
house), the little girl slipped quietly away,
because, so I thought at the time, she could
not bear to stay to the very end. Presently,
however, she came back, carrying some little
china dishes, which, to my great surprise,
she placed in the grave with the doll. 'For
the worm*.'' she said in a whisper, and I
really think she found an odd comfort in
this forethought of hers, for when I left the
pair, she was planting a garden-stick bearing
an appropriate inscription above the doll's
resting-place with what was almost a cheer-
ful air.'f

"BUS"-ING ON THE CHEAP.
(What it may Come to.)
Conductor, I have come from Hammersmith, and wish
to be set down at the Bank. Here is a half-penny—oonld
you oblige me with change P
What I Twopence for the journey from Greenwich to
the Royal Exonange P Oh, this must be a Pirate Tram,
and I shall certainly speak to a Polioeman.
It is satisfactory to have hot-water tins and the electric
light provided in the 'busses of the Universal Omnibus
Company; but I should feel more oomfortable if the Con-
ductor always got his " Sunday off."
This Tram Line must be a triumphant success! Not
only does it return fifty per cent, dividend to its share-
holders, but it takes passengers from Hampstead to
Croydon for three-halfpence, and gives them mulled
claret in winter, and iced ohampagne-cup in summer,
gratis, on the journey.
No wonder that the Underground Railway has closed
its stations and gone into the Insolvency Court. The
rivalry between the "Road Saloon Company" and the
"General Car Company" is so great that the latter
actually carry their passengers for nothing, and supply
them with concertina melodies, sandwiches, and the
daily papers to beguile the tedium of the way.
Yes, that "wheeler" certainly does appear to be
rather thin, and I am convinced that he is only supported
on his legs by the rigidity of the pole to whioh he is
attached. But it is, of course, impossible for the Company
to pay thirty per cent., and carry passengers fifteen miles
for a penny, without economising their quadrupeds' oats.
Hi, Conductor! I asked to be put down at Hyde Park
Corner, and here I am at Piocadilly Circus! Why, the
man looks just as if he had been asleep! It's abomin-
able, and I Bhall complain to eh, what ?" Only five
hours' sleep last nignt," do you say? "And fourteen
hours'wotk a day, 8undays included?" H'm! Result
of free competition in fares, I suppose. But is that the
same thing as fair competition P
DUE SOUTH.
Evening of the Fifth Day.—Beautiful night for walk-
ing home. Moon bright. Air fresh. Charming place!
Lovely weather! After many ups and downs at the
tables, I have come off a winner of ton francs. Had 1
lost ten francs, I do not think the night would appear to
me so lovely as it does. It is a long way up to the Villa
Rouge Gagne, so my companion, who says he is out to
"see life, purposes taking light refreshment en route.
Among the many light refreshment-places here, one of
the most successful seems to be an English Bar, on a
small scale. Here distinguished compatriots stroll in
after the tables, to take a "John Collins"—I believe
this is the name of the harmless beverage—or a few
oysters and stout, or a glass of beer, or spirits and water.
Odd to come all the way from London merely to play
roulette in a hot and orowded room, and afterwards to
sit at the bar of a small public-house overlooking the
blue Mediterranean. But I do—and so do very many
others. In front of this bar, within the last few minutes,
the policy of an empire could have been quietly arranged
over a "John Collins" or glass of whiskey-and-water
and a cigar. We stroll out into the moonlight, and just
look in Chez Peters." Here, while the dignified but
obliging and industrious Monsieur Peters serves be-
hind the bar, sportsmen gather round the simple marble-
topped tables, discussing pigeon-shooting, and strange
stories of the chances of war, at trtnte et quarante and
roulette. One very big man, with a loud voice, is ener-
getically recounting to a small circle of admirers some
wonderful coupe that he had made at the tables. Thirty
thousand francs at one go is the lowest amount he will
condescend to talk about.
"I put down, Sir," says he, emphatically thumping
the marble table with his fist, and addressing no one in
particular, "four times I put down a thousand francs at
each corner, and one of the numbers came up every turn."
"No!" exclaim some young men who are listening,
open-mouthed.
"Very odd!" drily remarks a shrewd-looking person,
with the cynical air of an elderly Mephistopheles.
"Yes, Gentlemen, I did," says the big man, empha-
sising his narrative with more thumps on the marble

THINCS ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE EXPRESSED OTHERWISE.
"Well, I must say Good-bye, Miss Green. I've dot my Sermon to
PREPARE."—"OH, SURELY TOUR SERMONS NEED NO PREPARATION I"
table, "and then I put down forty on passe, a hundred on six premiers, and
another forty on 22. They all turned up, and so I went on, an dthat evening
made just eighty thousand francs, in something under an hour."
"No!" again murmur the younger portion of his audience, while the elderly
Mephistopheles, lighting a cigarette as he raises his eyebrowB, and observes,
"Did you really? Very strange!"
I certainly became interested in his stories. They made me thirsty. Some
one suggests oysters and stout. I think, hearing of all these vast sums of money
being won, has given me a strong inclination for oysters and stout, as sug-
gested. Though I had not thought of them before, I now feel that I can't
possibly go on for another five minutes without them. An additional incentive
is, that the friend who has joined us, and who suggested this form of nourish-
ment, is in excellent spirits, having unexpectedly won forty franos, and offers
to provide the entertainment at his own expense. Offer immediately accepted.
And so we sit down to oysters and stout, and bread and butter "Chez Peters,"
at Monte Carlo, and for all that we see of the Southern sky, the brilliant moon,
and the blue Mediterranean, we might as well be at Rule's, in Maiden Lane, or
Wilton's, in King Street, St. James's. But when we leave "Peters," and
walk up the hill, then we feel the effects, not of the supper, but of the invigo-
rating air, and the clear atmosphere; and as we look upwards at the deep blue
sky, and the brilliant moon, we say to one another, Shakspearianly, '"On
such a night' we could stay out for any length of time, and walk anywhere,
without fatigue"—which sentiment may be more poetically expressed in the
words of the immortal bard, who sang, "We won't go home till morning, Till
daylight doth appear." As a matter of fact, it is, 12'30, and we retire now, one
of the party to Villa Rouge Gagne, and the other two to the Hotel Windsor.

the stroke of half-past four.
House delighted with evidence
of Leader's agility and lightness
of heart. Gladstone arrived half
an hour later, but content to walk
in ordinary fashion. "All very
well for young fellows like 0. M.," he said, "to betray this sportive-
ness. Another letter makes all the difference. G. 0. M. must
eschew such vanities, and reserve strength for the final and crowning
labour of his life."
Harcourt, into whose sympathising ear these words were dropped,
squeezed his revered Leader's hand, and wiped away a tear.
_ A pretty full House of Commons; but the Lords looked more
lively, with benches well filled, rows of ladies in the gallery, and
crowd of Privy Councillors on steps of Throne; Bishops turned up
in serried row, representing Peace below the Gangway, whilst
Londesborough and Pknhhyn, in military array, fittingly embodied
martial strength of Great Britain. Granville played prettily
around the Speech, dealing some nasty thrusts as he smiled. Brought
up Selbornk in state of almost Pagan wrath; accused Gladstone
and his colleagues of "organising opposition not against the policy
of their opponents, but against the administration of the Law.
The Marjciss, with few rapid touches, sketehed-in real pioture of
Irish Question—O'Brien struggling into his small-clothes; Healy
dashing out of Police Court, and Harrington mourning for his
moustache. Noble Lords chuckled hugely over this, and, there
being nothing more to be said, went home.
In Commons even less show of fight Everybody agrees that there
shall be row over John Morley's Amendment to Address: but that
not coming on till Monday. In the meantime two sittings to dispose
of. At eight o'clock some one proposes Count Out. Very nearly
done, but just fails, and speech-making goes on till midnight.
Old Morality in fine form. Sells the House once or twice by
approaching table with portentous air, pausing till profound silence
reigns, and then making formal announcement. Irish Members noting
his serious look, thrilled by his deliberate manner, thought he was
at least about to proclaim a Province in their unhappy country; so
cried, "Ha! ha!" "Ho! ho!" and "Pigott!"
0. M. sternly regarded them, making
their flesh creep: then solemnly said, "I
beg to remind the House that, under Stand-
ing Order No. 16, unopposed Bills may be
brought in before the commencement of
publio business to-morrow."
Made impressive oration in reply to Glad-
stone's disquisition on Speech from Throne.
"I trust," he said, " due regard will be had
to the exigences of the public service and to
the duties this House has to discharge to the
country." Later, evidences of foreign
travel manifested themselves. Extolling the
Government as the custodian of English
honour abroad, and the fructifier of its hap-
piness at home, Old Morality, glancing at
his note-book, said: "Eviter let contrt-
f aeons! Exiger le veritable nom! Se
mtfier des imitations.' Quant d moi, M. le
Speaker, jefrappe settlement sur la boite.'"
and suiting the action to the word, he
brought his clenched hand down on the
brass-bound box.
This splendid passage strangely moved
audienoe. Two distinguished members of

"Quel homme!" cried M. Johnston, of

"Wee, wee!" said M. Brown-Jones, of

ON COMMISSION.
Tuesday, February 26.—Quite delightful to find so many persons
of distinction turning their attention, at length, to the Law. The
wife of an eminent ex-Premier was accommodated with a seat
amongst the Press. So far as 1 can understand, it seems to he a rule
of Court, when in doubt as to what to do with an importunate cele
brity, to find him or her (as the case may be) a seat amongst the
Press. Thus the seats reserved
for the chroniclers were, as my
learned and laughter - leading
friend, Mr. Lockw.ood", would
say, rather suggestive of
pressure." I am qnije -sure,
however, that my learned and
laughter - leading friend will
agree with me that the occasion

See-Saw.
scarcely warranted a distinctly mirth-provoking display of what (in
our opinion) might be termed forensic jocularity. For the occasion
was certainly a solemn one.
On the Commissioners taking their places, after bowing to the Bar
(by the way, I fancy their Lordships must sometimes miss the cordial
courtesy of the briefless brotherhood who have had to surrender their
benches to others), there was a slight pause. My learned friends,
the leaders on both sides, were present, but the witness-box was
empty. Then it transpired that Mr. Pigott (a gentleman whose
cross-examination, I think I may venture to say, without laying
myself open to a charge of contempt, was becoming quite a feature
in the case), had removed himself without giving reasonable notice of
his intention so to do. Immediately Mr. Attornex—(by the way,
how Bincerely my learned friend Mr. Solicitor must regret that he
is not associated with his brother Law Offieer of the Crown in this
deeply interesting case)—had announced and proved that Mr. Piqott
wa» non est, Sir Charles* Russell, in his most persuasive manner,

asked for a warrant
for the witness's ap-
prehension. To this
the Bench consen-
ted, after acknow-
ledging, in suitable

eluquenoe. Then there was quite a competition for a place in the
witness-box. Mr. Soames was Sir Richard's candidate, and Messrs.
Lewis, Labouchere, Parnell, and persons of leBser note were ready
to represent the other side. Ultimately, Mr. Shames appeared, and
gave additional particulars about Mr. Pigott's correspondence—a
correspondence always of a more or less interesting character. After
Mr. George Lewis nad been called, came an adjournment—nay, I
believe many adjournments—in fact, I do not think I should
be far out if I describe the day's proceeding as "intermittent
ournment." The order was somewhat as follows:—1. Fiery
address of Sir Charles Russell about something or other. 1. Mild
remonstrance of the Bench. 3. Renewed fiery address. 4. Desire
of Mr. Attorney and " the friends, with whom he was associated,"
to consider their position. 5. Adjournment. Their Lordships'
appearances and disappearances were not only frequent, but (from a
spectacular point of view) most pleasing—the Commissioners seemed
to be taking part in a new figure of a sort of forensic set of legal
Lancers. The " setting" every time the Commissioners appeared on
the Bench of the Judges to the Bar was full of a semi-gay and semi-
gloomy grandeur. During the absence of my learned (but slightly
embarrassed) friend, Sir Richard Webster, and those with whom he
was acting, my learned and laughter-leading friend, Mr. Lockwood,
occupied his place, and I have reasons for believing employed his
brief leisure in preparing proofs that, had they been made exhibits
in the case, would, I fancy, have illustrated the situation in a manner
entirely satisfactory to all parties. And here I may note, that
during the absence of the Commissioners, their ever courteous
Secretary served as a truly admirable locum tenens. One of the most
dramatio situations of a day full of excitement was the moment
when a loudly-talking audience were hushed to a deathly silence to
hear the ever courteous Secretary ask (in tones at once solemn and
business-like) for the name of the constable who should be charged
with the duty of apprehending Pigott._ The day's proceedings were
brought to a pleasant close by a merriment-compelling joke of Sir
James Hannen about "catching a hare," which sent me and the
rest of my learned friends into hearty but respectful convulsions.
Wednesday.—Again the Court was crowded. Since the adjourn-
ment it appeared Sir Richard Webster had devoted his whole
attention— almost entirely every second of his time"—to the
grave matter claiming their Lordships' consideration. My learned
friend handed to the Court a packet bearing a superscription,
which was alleged to be in the handwriting of Mr. Richard
Pigott. Sir fJames Hanwen gave the necessary permission to the
ever courteous Secretary to read the documents wnich the packet was
found to contain, and the obliging official (with the zealous aid of
talented assistants), carried out his Lordship's instructions. The
documents consisted of a signed confession, witnessed by Mr. George
Augustus Sala, and a brief but cheery letter from Mr. Pigott,
pleasantly intimating that he " would write soon." The Attorney-
Gekeral then made a statement, in which he presumed (and, if I
may humbly suggest, rightly presumed) "that everyone would
agree with nim that no one ought to attach any weight to the
evidence he (Pigott) had given." He further expressed sincere
regret, in which I think all of us (and I even venture to include the
persons accused in the number), must have shared, that the letters
received from Mr. Pigott had been published. Mr. Paenell
was then called, and on oath denied the authenticity of the letters
which had been imputed to him—he had neither written them nor
authorised them to be written. He moreover gave evidence of his
skill as an expert in the comparison of penmanship. During the
examination of this witness Sir Charles received assistance from my
learned friend Mr. Asqutth, whose services in the case (if I may
be permitted to suggest) have been of very great and very distinct
value. My learned friend's learned leader listened with the greatest
attention to his Junior's remarks.
However, this did not create
surprise, as Sir Charles is well
known for the marked courtesy he
invariably displays to those mem-
bers of the Outer Bar who have
the honour to act with him.
Shortly afterwards, as there were
no other witnesses ready for
examination, and Sir Richard
Webster having also expressed a
desire for further time, the Court
adj ourned. Thus the proceedings
of this sitting only ocoupied about
forty minutes, and were not quite
of so exciting a character as those
of the previous day. Indeed the
rising of their Lordships was at
so early an hour, that my learned
friend Sir Charles Russell
did not consume his usual self-
strengthening "refresher" — a
compound in a soda-water glass,
that, from a distance, suggests
some delicious preparation of coffee. However (and I have no doubt
my learned and laughter-leading friend, Mr. Lockwood, will confirm
the assertion), the documents received from Mr. Pigott were in them-
selves a "refresher" of a sufficiently supporting character.
Friday.—Only formal evidence and paper-reading. However, the
law-loving spectators were oheered by the promise that an important
statement would be made to them on the following Tuesday.

EE ALA.
Another Study from Life, after "Ideala."
She came among us with a flourish of trumpets, and
we have never heen able to get rid of her since. We
have leaped over her, careerea around her, and yelled at
her._ Yet there was nothing very remarkable about her.
I think something was wrong with her hair. But she had
those lustrous and translucent eyes, like great saucers
of whelks, which thrill yet confound the unobservant
spectator with a sense as of some remote and ill-disci-
plined longing. She had curious notions on the subject
of dress, and it was never easy to say exactly what she
had got on. Sometimes she would appear in a sort of
loose bed-curtain that fitted her like a sack; sometimes
in a cretonne tea-gown bouillonne, with a niching of
antimacassars; but whatever she wore it was Bure to be
staring and inappropriate. "It isn't the clothes that
make the woman, but the woman that makes the clothes,"
she said to me one afternoon, throwing off with her rich
aluminium laugh one of those profound philosophical
aphorisms that used to fall from her so plentifully at
about this time; and we all clapped our hands and capered
after her.
It was at a garden-party at the Bishop's that I first
met her, and she was in one of her absent moods. A
performance of Punch and Judy had been provided for
the entertainment of the guests, and she was seated
opposite this watching the progress of the story with a
rapt and earnest gaze, slowly helping herself the mean-
while from a large plate of muffins that she had uncon-
sciously appropriated and held on her lap. At length she
reached the last half-slice that made up the dozen, and
apparently realised the feat she had accomplished, for
she rose with an impatient sweep of her head, and made
for the house. I don't think she can have been feeling
very well after that, but we were anxious to see what she
would be up to next, and we followed her. Reala was
in a ourious mood that afternoon. She found the dear
good old Bishop fast asleep in an American rocking-chair
with his feet on the drawing-room mantelpiece; and she
tilted him out of it under the grate. "We quickly rescued
him, and sat him up on a sofa, and rubbed his legs for
him, but on being informed what had happened, he only
emailed feebly and shook his good old head and said, "It
was so like Reala!" Reala meantime was supremely
unconscious of the whole incident. She had taken the
red-hot poker from the fire, and in a dreamy abstracted
manner was drawing patterns with it on a blue satin
ottoman. On one of us pointing out to her the damage she
was doing, she suddenly looked up with a surprised smile,
and saying. "Dear me, I thought I was stirring the fire!"
deposited the poker, still red-hot, in the gold-fish globe.
In less than two minutes the fish were boiled, and as she
swept out of the room, humming the refrain of a low
music-hall comic song, we all with one accord, echoed the
good old Bishop's words, and said, "How like Reala!"
• • • * •
But a great change had come over Reala latterly. "We
had all noted it, and agreed that her moral nature had
undergone a pantomimic-transformation scene. The trnth
was she had met Jerrymander. I don't know where she
picked him up. "I just saw him, and went for him,"
Reala had said to me one day, with her own marvellous
incisiveness of expression, when I asked her about him.
She had found him at the Pauper's Cosmopolitan Palace
of Superfluous Delights, a colossal undertaking to which
he had been appointed managing director. She was at that
time thinking of putting Bradthaw's Railtcay Guide into
blank verse, and I fancy she went to him to give her a
hint or two how to set about it. They took in the half-
penny papers at the palace, and so she would naturally
have had these to fall back upon as] a library of
reference.
But it was a peculiar institution. It had been founded
by several millionnaires, for the purpose of supplying
indigent paupers with useless commodities. These were
arriving all day, at the front entrance, in waggon-loads;
and Jerrymander's spacious eight-windowed room, to
which they were continually being transferred, afforded
a spectacle of chaos and conf nsion that defies description.
The splendid Louis Thirteenth silk-brocaded furniture
of the apartment was literally covered with piles of jam
tarte, diamonds, pork chops, heads of celery, unstrung
pearls, rich Eastern silks, choice ohjett de vertu, patent

a Fan, or a Scent-bottle, or something of that sort!"
blacking-bottles, polishing-paste, jewellery of the most delicate description,
kitchen utensils, cases of British wine, and a thousand-and-one other miscel-
laneous articles.
Here Reala would sit watching Jerrymander as he rushed raving about the
room, tearing his hair, and maddened by the confusion and disorder which he
was powerless to control. They would be for hours together like this, then he
would suddenly start up and say, "There is no means of getting a sandwich in
this confounded establishment; let us come to the railway buffet round the
corner, and have a regular champagne luncheon." Reala asked no questions,
but followed him. And this went on daily. But things came to an end at last.
One afternoon, when the customary champagne lunch was over, and they had
returned again to his quarters, Jerrymander, looking at her almost savagely,
said, "I tell you what, this can't go on."
Reala faced him steadily, and drank him in with her large melting saucer eyes.
"Can't, you guess?" he hissed, slowly. Then he groaned and tore his hair,
and rolled about the floor, in a paroxysm of uncontrollable emotion, knocking
over chairs and tables as he proceeded, and scattering pearls, pork chops,
diamonds, patent medicines, mechanical toys, and new potatoes in every direc-
tion in his progress. Reala got on a chair and watched nim.
"I guess," she said softly, to herself, "I had better get out of this." Then
she left him.
After this, she disappeared for several years; but one evening, when we had
invited a few dozen friends to meet the Bishop at a quiet little dinner, she sud-
denly turned up with the railway omnibus, and took us all by surprise. We
rushed at her in a body, gave her three cheers, and carried her up in triumph
to the drawing-room. She hounded from us, and came down with a heavy
pirouette upon the good old Bishop's toe. He started with the pain, and, rubbing
Lis glasses, said, "Why I bless me. if this isn't Reala I" "\ es, my Ixird," she
answered, chucking him, in her old familiar manner, playfully under the chin—
"and, what is more, I've come to stay for six months." She had—for she is with
us still—and how we shall ever get rid of her again—Goodness only knows!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LITTLE FLIRTS LETTER.
"There is no doubt about it. There is a distinct and steady
decline in the time-honoured office of a Chaperon; and, as far
as we can see, there is every prospect that this much-maligned,
long-suffering individual will soon cease to exist."—The Lady.
My dear Mr. Punch, I must shout Hip! Hurrah!
You really don't know how delighted we are,
To read there's a prospect, at no distant day,
Of ending the grim chaperonical sway:
When girls will be able to do at they please,
With no one to counsel, or worry, or tease.'—
When I may sit talking with Someone alone,
Unmindful of frowns from a prim Chaperon'!

If I'm at the Play, in the smartest of frocks.
And Bertie should chance to look in at our box:
(He's tall and extravagant, well-dressed and deal—
A poor younger son, who has nothing a year !)
I know why he comes, for he's bored with the play,
I see, by hts eyes, what he's longing to say—
Though forced to reply in my frigidest tone,
I wish I could strangle my stiff Chaperon I
'Tis hard that I always am under her thrall.
That I ne'er can escape at a rout or a ball;
She vows I shall dance with Sir Charles Clarrivere,
Because he's a banker with thousands a year!
He's fat, and he's gouty—;just look at his shoes—
If Algt should ask me, I'm bound to refuse!
Though none can valse better than he, I must own
Suoh partners are gall to my sharp Chaperon!
Her eye is a piercer, which few can evade—
I loathed her last Sunday at Prayer-Book Parade!
When innocent Hcghie. who tried to look good,
Found all his nice speeches were misunderstood.
She saw through my semblance of haughty disdain—
He spelled for an invite to luncheon in vain!
How I longed for some power to swiftly dethrone
And quite disestablish my strict Chaperon I
Thank goodness, the Chaperon's dynasty's past,
And there is some chance of enjoyment at last.'
Her dull, rigid reign let us try to forget,
The irksome restraint of her cold etiquette:
For we will decide what is quite comme ilfaut,
The men to be danced with, the people to know!
So, dear Mr. Punch, let it widely be known,
In future a girl is her own Chaperon!

DUE SOUTH.
Monte Carlo, February, 1889.
On my road to the Casino at Monte Carlo I meet Hodgrtns, Peterson, and
Flickmore. "How have you done?" I ask, as I am collecting all the informa-
tion I can about the country .so to speak, in whioh I am about to try my fortune.
"Pretty fair," answers Hodgkins. "Not bad," says Peterson. "Might
have been worse," observes Flickmore.
"Lost five hundred louis first day," says Hodgkins, looking sharply at his
two friends.
I smile sympathetically. Five hundred! Dear me, a large sum to lose. And
I bogan to think that I'd better reflect before I tempt the hazard of roulette.
We picked it up next day, though," puts in Peterson, also looking round
at his companions, and smiling.
"And the second day were two thousand to the good," says Flickmore.
"Not pounds—louis: but not bad business even in that."
Bad business, indeed! I wish it would happen to me even in francs—or
half francs, for the matter of that. I am eager to know the system.
"Well," answers Hodgkins, "you see it's a little difficult to explain and
to carry out, unless you 're really going in for it. Perhaps you'd hardly
understand it."
Well, I think my powers of comprehension are quite up to this; I mean that,
if these three chaps, who are mere flaneurs on the face of the earth (except when
they are in their business in the City) can master the system, I'm pretty sure
that / can.
'' Can't you give me an idea of it?" I ask, almost piteously.
"Well," says Flickmore, "it takes a day to carry out properly, even with
luck, and it requires three fellows to play it. We 're a Syndicate, and we bring
in live hundred apiece. Lose that, we stop."
Thank you. Much obliged. I needn't trouble them for their system, as I
am not "three single gentlemen rolled into one," and so can't be a Syndicate.
They are going in to the Casino, and pass me on the steps. Now what shall
I do? While I am meditating on my plan of campaign, Lord Arthur Stone-
broke, passing me hurriedly, cries, Halloa, old chap, going in to break the
Bank, eh?" I reply, as he halts for a second by the door, as carelessly as I
can, as if I hadn't quite decided whether 1 should let the Bank have another
day's grace or not,—"Well, I don't know." And then I pay him the com-
pliment of asking what he is going to do," as if to imply that my movements
shall be decided by his.
"Oh," says he, in an off-hand manner, "I'm just going in for a flutter
before dinner. Only taking in five hundred louis."
I nod to him pleasantly, and he passes in, and disappears. "Only five
hundred louis to play with before dinner!" I am debating with myself
whether I shall put on three five-franc pieces all at once, or extend the opera-
tion as they used to do the torture of the rack by doing it in three turns.
Shall I stop at three five-franc pieces, or shall I go on to six? Let me see—
five five-franc pieces are a sovereign, and therefore ten make two sovereigns.
I wish one could make two sovereigns—and that one be myself.
First Decision.—I settle that it is better to have the ten five-franc pieces in
my pocket, in case I want to play.
Second Decision.—The number of my coat is 200. I've often heard that a
man backing the number of his coat, or multiple of it, or some division of it,
makes a heap of money. Happy Thought. Try it. I ask Smithson, who has
been an habituS for years, how he would divide 200 so as to make it into playable
numbers. Smithson, with an air that inspires me with confidence, says offhand,
"Put on the six premiers—that includes the two—on the middle dozen, so does
that—on the pair, which includes the 20, and on zero, that's your game." And,
nodding knowingly to me, he walks away with the satisfied air of a man who
has done the best he can for a friend, and. who, throwing off the responsibility
there and then, leaves the friend to do the best he can for himself. I note it
down, and determine to act upon it. It is, one fiver—I mean one five-franc
piece—that is, four-and-twopenoe, only it sounds more sporting to speak of them
as " fivers "—one fiver on the first six numbers, another on the middle dozen,
another on " even," and another on zero. Good. Stay—that makes four all at
once, and I only intended to put on three. If I lose these, then on go four
more—that's eight—and I shall only have two left.
I deoide to change a third sovereign—just as well to have fifteen "fivers"
(silver fivers) in my pocket as ten.
I enter the room. Iwalk up to the Changers' bureau, and get my fifteen French
five-frano pieces in exchange for three beautiful golden English sovereigns.
It doesn't seem fair, to begin with. I look upon them as counters, and three
sovereigns seems a lot of money to pay for fifteen counters. I go to a roulette-
table in first room. Crowd. No getting near it. I see Peterson with a pile
of gold before him, looking very Berious; behind him stand Hodgklns and
Flickmore. Their eyes are on the table. They don't see me. Next moment
the croupier cries out something that I don't catch, and the effect of it is that
a lot of money is swept off one way, a lot another, and then Hodgkins and
Flickmore seem to breathe again as Peterson has notes and gold pushed
towards him with the croupier's rake. Somehow I don't like this table. I
leave it. I don't even visit the one opposite, and enter the middle room. Here
the table at the lower end has an attraction for me. Some one standing by
one of the croupiers just moves out, and leaves a momentary vacancy, which
fate seems to point out to me as the very place for me. It is almost opposite
pair, which just suits my plan, the only difficulty being to get at the other end
of the table, and deposit my five-frano piece on the middle dozen, and to get

it back again, with.the oompanion which it ought to win, from that
distance in safety. At the tables I have often heard of old French
women collaring what doesn't belong to them; and then, indignantly
protesting that the expostulating Englishman had tried to rob them.
This rather seta me against the middle dozen. Also somehow 1
don't fanoy zero. If I snub the middle dozen and zero, then I only
need risk two fivers each time, and this will give me more sport for
my money. And, after all, on the middle dozen you only get two to
one, and the odds against zero turning up are greater than against
anything else on the table. Besides, instead of losing four eaoh time,
I should only lose two. For all these excellent reasons I decide to
follow only half of my friend's advice, and I select the six premiers
and pair. When shall I begin? No time like the present. Now:
this next turn. I brace up my nerves, I give a nod that the Duke of
Wellington, at Waterloo, might have copied, when he shut up
his telescope with a snap and gave the word to charge, and producing
two five-franc pieces, I lean over the man in front, and with a polite
"Pardon, M'sieur!" I take his rake from him, ana push my piece on
to pair, nearly jobbing him in the eye with the handle as 1 draw the
instrument back again. Elderly Frenchman looks up angrily. I
feel hot and awkward: I foresee a duel, and so give him a smiling
apology to turn away his wrath (which it doesn't), and then catching
the croupier's eye^-not with the rake this time, but figuratively with
my eye—1 ask him to shove my other five-franc piece on to six
premiers, which he does with a careless air as if it didn't matter two-
pence to him (and it doesn't), or to anybody (no more it does except
to myself and family), what becomes of this absurd stake.
Then I draw back, fold my arms, try to appear utterly indifferent,
look round the table to see if I can spot a friend to nod to, fail, and
then I keep my eye on my pieces, and stoically await the issue.
"Rien ne va plus !"—clickf—it is over. Vingt-cinq—middle dozen
and uneven. Thank you—five-frano pieces, fare ye well!
Two more on the same. Same business of jobbing Frenchman's
eye with rake, catching croupier's eye, folding arms, awaiting ver-
dict—which .... nineteen!
Thank you. Exeunt second supply. Upon my word, I think I '11
try the whole lot at once. Six premiers—zero (hate zero)—pair—and
middle dozen. I do. Middleton comes up at the minute. "Doing
any good?" he asks. I shrug my shoulders. As I turn round, the
number is called—I don't see what it is—but whatever it was, I find
that it was neither zero, nor pair, nor middle dozen, nor six premiers,
and all my pretty chicks are gone at one fell swoop. No, I '11 limit
myself to two. It's quite enough to lose at a tame. And those two
shall be—stay .... shall I change my plan—evidently I'm not in
luck. Wish I hadn't asked Smith son how to divide 200. Also wish
I 'd never heard that some gamblers choose the number of the ticket
given them for their ooat, and have immense luck with it. Stupid
story: it's stories like this that lead one so astray.
My last two. I object to zero. The first six have played me false.
The middle dozen can no longer be trusted. Impair has once stood
my friend. Suddenly the number 19, which has nothing whatever
to do with my calculations, seems to stand out from the rest, and
invite me. ft absolutely seems to say, "Put five franoB on me, and
one on the red." My whole plans are deranged. Nineteen is staring
at me. "You'll regret not planking down on me," it says.
"Messieurs, faites le jeu!" "Faites! Fate it is. Once more
"pardon," and I job the irate Monsieur in the eye with the end of
the rake. On to the 19 plump, en plein. Already I see the croupier
preparing to pay me thirty-five times my stoke. Shall I put
another, the other—and the last—on something P If so, on what?
The ball is whizzling round! The second—shall I on zero? Smith-
son said zero—it was part of his original plan—as I catch the
croupier's eye—an inspiration. "Sir premiers, s'il vous plait"—
he pushes it on just where I would give any amount—another five
francs to recall it. The croupier opposite says, inexorably, "Rien
ne va plus!" and—click! zero!.' Ha! ha! and I was
within an ace of putting on zero. 0 Smithson! When I tell you
that, after asking your advice, I've not acted on it, yon will think
I've been making a fool of you—and of myself.
Shall I change another sovereign P And try another table? I
will. I go to the magioian who warily examines and changes the
fold into silver behind the pigeon-hole of the bureau, and get my
ve-frano pieces. Odd! this time as I slip them into my pocket, I
feel as if I'd won them from the man behind the pigeon-hole, and
somehow, I experience the pleasant sensation of having somehow or
another got the best of him in a bargain. To which table shall I
go? What plan shall I pursue? With Smithson's I can only play
once with four francs, and if I lose, then once with one. At this
moment up comes Byngleioh.

ALL IN PLAY.
Mr Dear Mr. Punch,
As the most recently produced piece at the Princess's will,
no doubt; sooner or later, find its way to the Provinces, I give you a
few particulars for the information of all England, Scotland, Ireland,
India, and the Colonies. It is "anew Romantic Drama, and also
"a Tale of the Turf;" it is called Now-a-Days, and is written by
Mr. Wilson Babkett (again to quote from the programme), "the
most popular actor of tie age." So far as inoident is concerned, it is

Now-a-Daya.
very like Flying Scud and The Odds—two sporting Dramas that
were exceedingly popular some ten or twenty years ago. There is
also a savour about it of the Run of Luck, which was produced a
little while back at Drury Lane. The dialogue is rather uneven—
some of it not very good; some of it very far from bad. The author
introduces us to a strange set, in which are included a "heavy
father," who makes an honest livelihood by gambling; a pathetic
bookmaker, who is the bosom friend of a country squire; a masher
jockey, who is joyfully accepted as the said squire's son-in-law; and
a wicked baronet, whose better nature comes well to the fore in the
last Aot. So far as I am aware, it is not a very correct realisation of
modern society. To go into details, the scenery is excellent, and the
acting quite as good as the piece deserves. Mr. Austin Melford
freatly distinguishes himself m the part of a low-class betting man.
t is a very clever sketch, and quite worth seeing. Mr. Wilson
Barrett (who reminded me not a little of Mr. Weedon Grossmtth),
appears in a character that I fancy is intended to be more comic than
tragio, but of this I will not be sure. Mr. George Barrett is the
pathetic bookmaker, and certainly the creation is an interesting one.
Still I think the two brothers might swop parts with advantage.
Miss Grace Hawthorne, "the sole lessee of the theatre," is also
included in the caste. I may add that the " most popular actor of
the age," although fairly amusing in the last scene (especially when
he condescended to show nothing but his legs kicking over a hoarding),
was more to my taste as the Silver King, or even in Samlet. I shall
not be surprised if Noio-a-Days is very well attended during Lent.
The Yeomen of the Guard is going merrily at the Savoy. The
music improves on acquaintance, and the acting is excellent all
round. Sir Arthur, I fancy, will not be required to supply any-
thing better to fill this popular house for a very long time to come.
Weather, as I write, Ditterly cold, consequently I shiver as I sign
myself, onoe more at home, The Critic from the Hearth.

Yes, loud March, I own I do not love you; _
But I'd brave your asthma and bronchitis
If you'd scatter— is the task above you P
Malice's mephitis.
Cant, and calumny, and mean mendacity,
Cloud our civic atmosphere—all know it.
If March winds can clear the foul opacity,
Blow it, Boreas, blow it!
VERY O. KD.-ACIOUS!
"Ho! Lictors, clear the way!" This is
just what the Lictors at the Oxford revival
of Julius Casar failed to do. They didn'teven
"clear" the Curtain, but got their "fasces"
mixed up with it in such a curious fascion
that the audience tittered. Probably they were
not aware that Lictors and "sticks" have
been connected from the earliest classical ages.
Then, weren't there too many women and
children about the stage? We confess not to
know much about these classical occasions, but
surely when a revolution was going on, all the
little Roman girls didn't appear in the streets?
Anyhow while Antony was making his funeral
oration they seemed superfluous.
Mr. Alma Tadema must have revelled in
that Scene of the Forum! He and Mr. Hall
between them have made an admirable thing
out of it. The Temple of Janus and the
Capitol in the background are picturesque,
and so is the "Rostra" in front—so-called,
we were told by an undergraduate who accom-
panied us, because it was the place where the
Roman "beaks" used to give judicial de-
cisions. Some old Roman wag had aotually
painted picturesof beaks on the pedestal! Very
disrespectful! Perhaps one of the classical
children before-mentioned as pervading the
performance did it.
As a whole, the play was good, and interest-
ing. Lovers of the Bard might have done
much worse than take a return-ticket to the
Isis to see it.

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SA.W.
EIGHTH EVENING.
"There is a Blind Man whom I know very well," the Moon told
Mr. Punch. "He has never seen me, but I have seen him for many
years now. All his dogs I have known, too—some of th^m really
ultimately, for most dogs are in the habit of telling me their private
affairs, when they are tied up alone and I am at leisure to listen to
their grievances. One dog of his was a particular friend of mine,
and it is about him that I am going to tell you this evening. He
was a terrier, with long bluish hair, and a face that somehow
always put me in mind of a pansy. His master had trained him
very well, and he was naturally intelligent. Every morning when
the Blind Man left his lodging, the dog would take him to a corner,
where the omnibus passed, and, when ne had seen him safely inside,
would run away across the Park, and wait for his master there ; and
when the omnibus arrived, and put him down, the dog's leash was
fastened on again, and he led the Blind Man to a certain passage
behind a church, where he sits all day and makes nets. I have seen
this myself on many a morning, when I have been up later than usual.
And the dog would lie by his side with a tin cup under his chin,
and, whenever a passer-by dropped a coin in the cup, the dog
would thump his thanks with nis tail on the pavement. He
was, of course, deeply attached to his master. One night, when
I came out as usual, and looked down into the deep narrow passage,
I found the Blind Man sitting all alone ; and for many nights after
that he sat there, netting by the light of a candle stuck in a lump
of clay, with no dog by his side. The fact was, that some thief (who
must have been more wicked than most thieves) had stolen the poor
man's dog. However, before very long, a kind-nearted person gave
him another—a great ugly lurcher this new dog was, who would not
wag his tail even for silver, and who growled, and showed his teeth,
if any stranger attempted to pat him. Still, he was honest and faith-
ful, in his way, and his master soon grew used, and even attached
to him.
"Well, and this is my real story:—One evening, long after this, I
saw another dog come hurrying down the passage, and I recognised
him instantly—it was the pansy-faced terrier, the one that had been
so cruelly stolen. He was greatly changed, and, I am glad to say,
for the better, since I had seen him last. Then he had been gaunt,
and his coat harsh, and uncared for; now he was sleek and smooth,
he wore a silver collar, and his hair was carefully parted all down
the middle of his back. But, for all that, he seemed overjoyed at
getting back again to his old master, and the leash, and the tin cup,
and lying still all day, and he danced round him, barking violently,
and leaping up frantically to fondle and caress him.
"The Blind Man sat there, puzzled. He could only recognise
objects by the touch; and this silky-coated, well-fed animal, did
not remind him in the least of his shaggy old servant—he imagined
it was some gentleman's pet, who had taken a sudden fancy to him.
I longed to tell him who it was; but a poor Moon can't do every-
thing, and I found I could not make him understand me.
"All at once the original dog saw his successor, and grasped the
situation in an instant. Before he could take his old place, he must
drive the intruder away—so, though he was no match for the lurcher,
he flew at him furiously.
"There was a terrible combat; the coppers flew out of the tin cup,
and went rolling' and chinking over the flagstones; the lurcher,
though hampered by his chain, fought savagely, and the pansy-
faced terrier was generally undermost, though that was, in some
ways, better for him, for then he escaped the heavy stick with
which the Blind Man laid about him in all directions.
"The fight could only end in one way; the luroher was so much
stronger, and the original dog seemed to get so much more than his
share of the stick. He fought on as long as he could, but at last he
saw that he was beaten, and must give it up. So he disengaged
himself, all torn and bleeding, crept up to his master's side, and
licked his hand once more, in token of forgiveness and farewell,
and then limped away, whining, into the darkness, while the
lurcher, still grumbling, coiled himself up, and, after licking his
wounds a little, went to sleep.
"I think," concluded the Moon, that the defeated dog went back
to his new owners, where he was certainly muoh better off, and he
has certainly never returned to the passage again. I am sorry for
him, nevertheless, and I wish he could have been allowed to stay."

acquired in Biarritz in honour of the Queen's visit. A shopkeeper
already hopes " to be a ritz person " before Her Majesty's departure.

BELGRAVTA V. BOHEMIA;
Or, Art and Advertisement.
Scene—A Studio. The Bohemian speaks .—
So Am pioture 's sold, and mine isn't!
Well, I own it is rather a Wow.
My coat is so painfully shabby,
And my friends are so painfully low.
They say that I keep in the background,
Don t put myself forward enough,
For these are the days of advertisement,
Paragraph, Posters, and Puff.
Well, no one can sav that of him.
No bushel hides his little light;
lie'» nobbled the Press pretty well,
And perhaps, after all, he is right-
There 's nothing he's kept from the Papers,
Nothing he'» ever conccal'd.
Except, p'raps, his talent for painting,
And that is—as yet—unreveal'd.
You may read of the servants he keeps
Of his butler, and coachman, and groom;
Of the size of the bed that he sleeps in,
And how many sleep in a room.
Of the lemony-pink of the doorway,
The hall with its luminous mauve;
And the duck-weedy green of the boudoir,
And the soft yellow-tinted alcove.
The lamp that's so quaint and artistio,
With its gentle and soft diffused light—
So soft that you can't see to read by it.
And certainly can't see to write,
You can read of the terrible quarrel
He had with his whilom dear friend
When one of them wanted to borrow
And t 'other dear friend wouldn't lerd.
You can read of the parties he giveB,
And the dresses the fine ladies wear, [them.
AVith the names of the firms who supplied
And a list of the "smart" people there.
Some two or three ladies of title,
Who really don't know why they go; [dear,
"But those artists you know, are so odd,
And quaint in their ways, don't-cher know."
Then forsooth he declaims about Art,
The Beautiful, Chaste, and Sublime;
How Art must be kept Pure and Holy;
A rt is not for now, but all lime ! .'
Faugh! why can't he try and be plainer,
A nd placard himself once for all
With sauces, and boots, and mix'd pickles,
On eVry street-hoarding and wall?
liut why should I bother about him,
It's no use to snarl and to whine;
1 f he chooses to crawl in the gutter,
It's surely no bus'ness of mine.
What reason have / got to grumble?
I'm not badly off as I am.
What I've earned, I have honestly earned,
And never by shoddy or sham.
1 've plenty of friends at my back,
Tho' you wouldn't describe them as " smart;"
But they've brains and, moreover, they've
what
Some " smart" people haven't—a heart.
So I think I '11 go quietly on
I ndependent and free while I can,
After aU, tho' my coat is so shabby,
There's something in being a Man!!
I wonder now if he remembers
The old student days long ago^-
There were four of us chumming together
In a little back-street in Soho—
now hungry we were in those days,
And how seldom we had any meat.
When we hadn't we eat baked potatoes
"AU hot," from a can in the street.
I wonder now if he would come
And sup with us three as of yore?
No! I don't think he'd like baked potatoes,
And beer from the public next door.
No! Farewell, my old student friend,
We can never recall the old days.
You stick to your new-found Belgravia,
And I to Bohemia's ways.

"By far the best thing Morley has done yet," said Whitbread
"He has discovered the secret of his certain success. Always
marvel to me that his platform speeches should be so effective, and
his House of Commons lectures so inadequate. What he had to do
when standing at table of House was, to imagine he was on the plat-
form at Newcastle. Did it to-night, and made a great hit."
Weighty words these. No one who has not lived in House of
Commons for twenty years knows how wise is Whitbread.
"Solomon in all his habiliments," as Lawson says, "was not half
as impressive as Whitbread's waistcoat."
Balfour brave to the last; his back to the wall. So far from being
depressed, he is defiant. Instead of retreating, sallies forth on encom-
passing array. Perfect the single stroke by which he smote O'Brien
and George Trevelyan. Tr.evf.lyan, he said, had gone so far as to
found upon the eloquence of O'Brien the argument that he ought to be
treated better than other people. "About the merits of Mr. O'Brien's
Btyle," Balfour went on to say, with a graceful obeisance to Tre-
velyan, "no man has a better right to judge than the Right Hon.
Baronet. Few have had fuller experience of it; " an awkward remi-
niscence of the days when Trevelyan sat in the place of Chief Secre-
tary, and the Irish pack, who now applaud, nightly howled at him.
Business done.—John Morley moved Amendment to Address.
Tuesday.—Only one subject of conversation in either House to-day.
Pigott first, the rest nowhere.
Debate on Address goes forward in
Commons, but all ears strained for
mention or reference to the, but yes-
terday, obscure scoundrel whose
name now echoes to uttermost ends
of earth. Tut Healy back, in high
spirits. Has suggestion to make to
First Commissioner of Works. On
walls in Octagon Hall is a vacant
space for a fresco. Long been ques-
tion what shall be done with it. Tim
has idea. Why not " The Parting of
Pigott ?" he says. Pigott making
off with a black bag, and in the back-
ground two "old friends" wringing
their hands in despair. Plunket
says he'll think about it; but really
so hard at all times to get any money
for Works purposes out of Chan-
cellor of Exchequer, that hardly
likes to broach the topic. Still, if
Tim will leave it in his hands—and
Tim does.
Comedy and tragedy take turn in
debate. Comedy, Saunderson, full of quips and cranks, keeping
the House in constant roar. Tragedy by John Dillon, pale-faced,
dark-haired, sad-voiced, denouncing a system of Government, whioh

he says "breeds Pigotts as corruption*breeds worms." Saunderson
brought down prodigious number of impromptus neatly written down
on note-paper. Waring takes charge of manuscript, as, sheet after
sheet, Saunderson flings it back on the bench. Also carries in hand
a tumbler containing refreshment. Hands it up at regular intervals,
occupying spare moments with collecting and rearranging the used-
up manuscript. A pretty, touching sight!
Business done.—More debate on Address.
Thursday.—Thought just now there would be bloodshed under
black shadow of gallery on left of Speaker. An outburst of angry
conversation; a sudden tussle; and O'Hanlon discovered on his legs
excitedly throwing his arms about.
_" I want this Gentleman to apologise," he said. "I '11 just give
him a minute to think, and if he doesn't apologise I will"
What O'Hanlon contemplated drowned in roar from shocked
House. "This Gentleman' evidently Havelock, who sat bolt
upright looking into space.
This was O'Hanlon's second inoursion into proceedings. A few
minutes earlier had interjected remark from one of the side-galleries
and been repressed by Speaker's stern cry of "Order!" Had
thereupon descended, entered from behind Speaker's chair, skirted
bench from which T. W. Russell was addressing House, and,
a propos de bottes, persuasively whispered in his ear the magio
word, "Pigott!" Preoisely what followed is a matter of conten-
tion. Havelock, called upon for explanation by Speaker, said
he "happened, by accident, to
come into contact with O'Han-
lon." O'Hanlon, on the con-
trary, shouted out, "The Hon.
and Gallant Gentleman, as I
suppose I am bound to call him,
comes over and throws himself
on me." However it was, here
was O'Hanlon angrily regarding
the clock, and narrowly limiting
Havelock's opportunity.
"I '11 not give him much time,"
he said. "Just a minute to
think."
What a position for a man who
had ridden into Cawnpore and
won the Victoria Cross! Only
sixty seconds and his blood would
dapple the walls of the House of
Commons! Chaplin, standing
at Bar, in Heavy-Father atti-
tude, held his breath.
Speaker attempted to bring
about strategic movement in
relief of gallant General. Called
on Russell to proceed. Russell
went on with his remarks; hadn't
got through many sentences when
O'Hanlon discovered once more
on his legs, waving his arms
semaphore fashion, blood-thirsti-
ness in his eye and a crumpled

"""Commons.

'He," the indomitable
Mr. Speaker!" he roared,
I beg your pardon again, but
he says I had better get out of this."
Havelock.
Speaker interposed with increased gravity, and Havelock, cast-
ing on O'Hanlon a glance that should have withered him, stalked
away with his still unorushed head defiantly upcast.
Business done.—Debate on Address.
Friday.—G. 0. M. resumed Debate to-night. Seems to have
renewed his life, like the eagle, in foreign parts. Voice come back
in all its force; bubbling over with high spirits, particularly tickled
by proximity of Chamberlain; goes through some high comedy
scenes with him, amid rapturous cheers from Pit and Gallery.
Parties in the Stalls a little glum. Been the usual lever de rideau,
in whieh Ministers called over the coals about alleged connection
with the departed Pigott. Tim Healy got his back up; cross-
examines Old Morality with pitiless persistency. Harcourt tries
to put an oar in; but not to be mentioned in same boat with Tim.
Just before midnight ended Debate, Parnell turns up. Enthu-
siastic reception; disposition to chant, "He's a Jolly Oood
Fellow" stopped by Speaker. Business done— John Morley's
Amendment to Address rejected by 339 votes against 260.
An Impkkfect Riddle.—When is a Joint Stock Compasy like a
watch ?—When it is wound up. Obviously. Only then the watch
will go, but the Company stops.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ON COMMISSION.
Tuesday, March 5.—The aristocracy becoming slightly .bored with
Law. Still a fair number daily tax the amiability of the ever-
courteous Secretary. Having
settled in our places, the Com-
missioners prepared to take the
armchairs, which had been
arranged beforehand for them at
an angle calculated to allow of
their entrance with a dignity
fitting to their exalted station.
There was the usual bow from
the Bench to the Bar, which,
alas! had no briefless brother-
hood (in the back rows) to
gratefully and gracefully return
it! Then Sir James Hannen
gave a decision about the admis-
sion of certain newspapers,
which, it was alleged, had oeen
used by the staff of the Land
League for disseminating disaf-
«w„ii . vj_:»v vi ii „ fection. That decision once
"Well supplied with noble known, Mr. Attorney was
™ ' called upon to read the para-
graphs complained of. It was then that I fully appreciated
how disastrous it would be were ladies ever admitted to the
Bar. I could not help feeling that had two aged females been
in the place of my learned friends, Sir Richard and Sir
Charles, there would have been any amount of squabbling and
loss of time. As it was, it is scarcely necessary to say that Mr.
Attoritei was ready on the instant to go on, and that he received
the greatest possible assistance from his learned friends on the other
side. The Commissioners could soarcely conceal the gratification
they evidently felt in presiding over so happy a family. It was a
pretty and touching sight to gaze upon Sir Richard as he turned to
his learned friends and asked, "Are you ready P" In a moment
any number of miscellaneous documents were handed to him—all,
no doubt, of the greatest possible value, if put in at the proper time.
Mr. Attorney's gratitude to "those associated with him" seemed to
be unbounded, and he constantly called for Mr. Soames, no doubt to
express to that learned gentleman his warmest acknowledgments for
the valuable assistance that was being so copiously extended to him.
Then came a few witnesses full of "information," as, no doubt, my
learned and laughter-leading friend Mr. Lockwood would say, as
they were informers— hence the smile-compelling pleasantry. The
last was seemingly a youth
of somewhat tender years;
and when my learned and
laughter-leading friend sug-
gested that Mr. Ronan
should wheel the witness
home (after re-examination)
in a perambulator, the Court
became quite Christmassy in
its merriment before adjourn-
ing to the morrow.
Wednesday. — Interest in
Law once more on the wane.
The perusing of extracts
continued at the rate (after
taking into consideration the
expense of the inquiry), of
I suppose, about a pound or
so a minute. However, this

Mr. Lockwood, Q.C., kindly assists
Mr. Ronan to act on Counsel's Advice.
rather costly exercise was of distinct value to my learned friend,
Mr. Asqctith, who had the benefit of a reading lesson, personally
conducted by Sir James Hannen. "May I ask you, kindly," said
the revered President of the Probate Division, courteously but firmly,
"to raise your voice, and hold your head ut,g" For a moment I
almost expected to hear his Lordship add, A 4 slap your right
leg with your cane, Sir, and wink" at the girls!' T hasten to say,
with heartfelt respect, that Sir James gave no_ sue > martial, but
entirely unlawyerlike direction. Moreover, it is only just to my
learned friend (whose services in the case have been of the greatest
value to his leader) to express my opinion that had he received such
an order he would have nesitated, and rightly hesitated, to have
carried it into execution; and this would nave been the more com-
mendable, as my learned friend has other than forensic claims to
the title of "Junior," and Beauty in the Court has never lacked
representatives. But it will be patent to everyone that it is no part
of a counsel's duty (even under direction of the Bench) to recognise
female comeliness by the sudden drooping and upraising of a wig-
surmounted eyelid. This reminds me that some of our forensic
perukes are far from perfect. Had I frequent occasion to renew

A Consultation.
my own, I should go to Mr. Fox (whose wigs at the Maske of
Flowers at Gray's Inn during the Jubilee were, so to speak, the
toast of the Bench and the Bar), who, I feel sure would always
fit me to my entire satisfaction. To return, the reproduction of the
speeches of eminent statesmen and others (declaimed in his most
brilliant style by my learned and energetic friend, Mr. Atkinson)
had certainly one advantage—it nearly cleared the Court. After
the midday adjournment, the proceedings (like "grey shirtings" on
certain interesting occasions in the City), became more "lively."
Thanks to the gallant conduct of my learned and fiery friend. Sir
Charles Russell, there were several little " scenes in Court" (sub-
sequently found of great benefit by
«*^X the gentlemen of the Press) and now
5VI and again there was quite a "sensa-
'• ^ ifc tion." I left before the adjournment,
oj and was surprised to hear a rumour
that, after my retirement, in spite of
the ample room in court for all pre-
sent, the President was reported to be
quietly sitting upon Sir Charles Rus-
sell with every sign of satisfaction.
Thursday. — A further falling off
in the attendance. Mr. Soames (the
most hard-working of solicitors) of
course was present, and if Mr.
George Lewis was less en Evidence, that learned gentleman left
matters in the able hands of a most efficient representative. It was a
very pleasing sight to see the principal conversing with his devoted
adherent. My learned and fiery friend Sir Charles Russell, however,
was instrumental in giving a distinct interest to the proceedings. With
evident disinclination (for he assured us that he was 1' singularly
averse" to interrupting anyone), he somehow contrived, to have quite
an exciting little altercation with the Bench by (so it seemed to me) the
introduction of contention-breeding interpolations. He also cross-
examined a witness with a verve and a go that may have recalled to
some of us the most respee ed memories of that grand old institution,
the Ancient Bailey. But when he accused my learned and apparently
rather depressed friend, Mr. Attorney, of making an " audacious
request," I reluctantly confess I could not enthusiastically follow on
the same side. However, we were so pleased when we learned that
Sir Richard expected to complete his case in the course of a day or
two, that Bench and Bar seemed prepared to forgive and forget every-
thing. As a matter of faot, when the Commissioners retired for the
week, they took their departure with an air of relief that conjured
up a vision in my mind of three of the best and ablest of our Judges
dancing with dignified joy in their own private apartments.
And now, as this seems to be a suitable time for explanation, per-
haps I may be permitted to make a personal statement on my own
account. I have reason to believe that there has been some surprise
expressed that I have not myself been "retained" either on one side
or the other in this very interesting case. I must admit that it is
certainly a fact that no brief has been delivered at Pump-handle
Court (up to date) desiring me to appear either "with me the
Attorney-General," or "with me Sir Charles Russell." How-
ever, on reflection, I commend the judgment of Messrs. Soames and
Lewis in making what at first sight may have appeared (to the
uninitiated) an omission. I venture to BUggest that it may have
ooou'rred to
certain emin- .vi&tlk«Aii» i II I

and Lincoln's

that perhaps,
if at any
future time l<
desired to

ment, I might
wish to join
that august
assembly un-
trammelled by
associations
which, al-
though abso-
lutely profes-
sional, to the
lay mind might be suggestive of Party predilections. And not having
been engaged in this matter, of course such bonds, so far as I am
concerned, are non-existent. For the rest I feel sure the Juniors asso-
ciated with Sir Charles Russell have got on very well without me;
and as for the case of the Times (especially that branoh of it that
engravers would scarcely term " proofs before letters "), I honestly do
not think any effort on my part could have materially improved it.

Dr. Robsox Roose has written an admirable article on
the Water Supply of London in the current Number of
the Fortnightly Review. Seemingly, we poor Cockneys
are fairly well off, if we take care to keep a filter in the
house. However, it is as well to see that it is not supplied
(like another philter) by some modern Dr. Dulcamara.
While thanking Dr. Robson Roose for his really valuable
contribution to the welfare of mankind, Mr. Punch, in
dealing with the subject, has a natural preference for a
rather more spirited policy—a policy which would include
in its scope lemon, nutmeg, alcohol in various forms, and
other pleasant ingredients. The water used in this mix-
ture should of course be heated to a suitable temperature.

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
NINTH EVENING.
"Not very long ago," said the Moon, "I shone down on the deck
of a large Emigrant Ship, which was just leaving its moorings. It
was crowded with people—men, women, and children, and many of
the faces I saw wore a very sad expression. They were leaving the
country of their birth, and the friends
and scenes they had grown up and lived
amongst, to begin life again in a strange
land; so it was not wonderful if they
were not in the best of spirits. Still they
bore up bravely, especially the men,
though some of the women wept a little
behind their shawls, and the children
cried too, for company and the strangeness
of it all. But they were sensible people
at heart, and they quite understood that
it was best for themselves, their country,
and everybody, that they should go.
They were strong, industrious, and sober,
but there was no room and no work for
them at home, the population was too
large already, and by going they were
making it better for the others who re-
mained. And in the New World, far
away, with their energy, industry, and
health, they would be sure to prosper and become a credit to the colony.
All that they knew—and yet, now the time had come to quit the old
country for ever, they could only feel how dear it was; and some of
them would have given all they had in the world just then to be
allowed to stay in their own land, even though they starved there.
"As the great ship began to move slowly, another vessel passed it

Moonshine.
quite close in the opposite direction. Its deck was as crowded as
the first, and the passengers on both thronged to the sides and looked
curiously at one another. I could not help noticing," said the Moon,
"what a difference there was between the two sets of passengers.
The first were peasants and artisans, sturdy, honest-looking, self-
reliant, pinched some of them by recent privations, but all belonging
to a class of which a great country might well be proud. Of the
others—those in the vessel that was arriving—as much could not be
said. They were undersized degraded-looking creatures, ignorant
and filthy, of whom their own land was only too glad to be rid.
They were coming to your shores with vague ideas of (jetting more
money and living better than at home. I Know what will happen to
them!" said the Moon, "for I have seen it many a time. They will
fall into the power of some of their own countrymen, only a little
less degraded than themselves, and they will become slaves, herding
together in horrible dens, and spreading disease and squalor and
general bestiality in the neighbourhood they dwell in.
"And as the English emigrants looked at these foreigners, I know
what the thought was whioh rose unbidden in all their mindB.
'If there is no room for us,' they were asking with their sad eyes,
'Why is there room for these T'
"And, upon my word," concluded the Moon, " although I suppose
your clever statesmen could answer the question satisfactorily, I have
not found it bo easy myself!"

DUE SOUTH.
The Battle op Flowers at Nice.
What I did with Byngleigh, who came up after I had lost my; little
all, and had changed some more gold into five-frano pieces, I will re-
count on a future occasion. At present a day must intervene, a fete
day, which removes me away from the tables, and takes me over to
Nice. Certainly, being at Monte Carlo, let us go to the second day
of the " Battle of Flowers." This is March the 4th, and the Battle
of Flowers does sound such a summery proceeding.
"Mrs. Grayling and her niece Mabel want to see it," says Mrs.
Grayling's brother-in-law, the generous Taplin, who, when out
for a holiday, likes to do the thing well; "and so, if you 'il come,"—
this to me,—" I '11 take the lot of you. One more or less makes no
difference."
Being delighted at hearing that my presence will make no differ-
ence, I embrace the offer.
The carriage is at the door. There are two baskets of flowers and
two bouquets. This looks like the First of May, old "Chimney-
sweepers Day." It may " look like" the First of May; but with a
km.
Burgundy, whereupon we brighten up still more, and beoome warm
and genial. We expand like the flowers, and by two o'clock, when
we get into the carriage again,—this time with the rugs concealed,
and only the flowers displayed,—we are all in full bloom. The North
wind has blown itself out,—at its own luncheon, perhaps,—at all
events, we don't feel it so much in the town, and the sun is shining.
Everybody is now en fete. Shops are closed, all business suspended
for the rest of the afternoon. It is the Flower Derby Day. All
sorts of Tom-fools among the populace in false noses, dominoes, as
Pierrots, and in a variety of shabby fancy costumes, the odds and
ends of costumiers' old clothes. A carriage comes along, being one
mass of flowers, wheels and all. It is Jack-in-the-Green on wheels.
These faded costumes, and ruddled cheeks, these clowns, and harle-
quins, and columbines, do certainly recall my boyish recollections of

cutting North wind, with just a touch of East in it, it feels like the
time of year it is; namely, the fourth day of Maroh, at Monte Carlo
and elsewhere. At"all events there is no fog, as there probably is in
London at this moment. The sky is clear, the Mediterranean is blue,
the sun is bright, the view is lovely; yet the wind is eutting. We take
rugs, wraps, and overcoats, but out of compliment to the appearance of
the place, with its hedges of geraniums, its red roses on the walls,
the spreading palm-trees, the cactuses, the olive-trees, and the
prickly pears, ' all a-growing" and looking tropical—(how they do
it is a wonder to me! I am inclined to think they 're most of them
sham, the deception being connived at by the authorities, and kept
up by the hotel-keepers and the Casino officials at an enormous cost)
—so, as I say. out of compliment to the tropical "scenery and pro-
perties," we decide on not having foot-warmers in the carriage.
Taplin, huddled up in rugs, with only the upper part of his head,
under a pot-hat, appearing above (so to speak) the bed-clothes,
exclaims, from time to time, "There's a beautiful view!"—nodding
at it, for he won't take his hands out from under the coverings,—
"Lovely, isn't it?" to which we all assent, the pair on the back seat
not turning their heads to look at it, for fear of getting a stiff neck
and being "struck so;" and then Taplin, wriggling down lower
than ever under his counterpane and blankets, murmurs, with con-
viction, "But, / say, it is cold!" And so say all of us, and all
snuggle down under the rugs. For all this, we are going to the
celebrated Battle of Flowers at Nice.
Nice.—We pull up at the Restaurant Francois. Descend. Nice
is en fete.^ Flower-baskets everywhere. Fans for sale. Ragged
urchins with baskets of flowers. Everybody moving about. For-
tunately we find one table unoccupied. We swoop down on it, and
occupy it bodily. We are here for the Battle of Flowers; so d la
guerre comme a la guerre!
Restaurant doing enormous business. Crowd too big for the small
room. Prices upprobably in consequence. It will be " breakfast at
the fork out." Head-waiter imposing personage, but with his wits
about him. Good breakfast and good wine. We begin to feel warm
and comfortable.
"Amusing scene," says Mrs. Grayling, patronisingly. Miss
Mabel is delighted with everything. Taplin says, '' I don't see
anything very Carnivalish about the place." Miss Mabel exclaims,
"Oh, don't you think so!" She is evidently afraid that if Uncle
Taplin begins to be disappointed with it, he may suddenly decide to
return without seeing any more. So she continues, "Wny, Uncle,
look at all the people! And then, you remember, we saw that figure
of King Carnival sitting in a ship as we drove in!" "Ah, yes, so
we did," replied Uncle Taplin, brightening up. Whereat we all
brighten up too, and Uncle Taplin insists on our having some old
_ great day for the Nicois 'Abby and 'Abriet. It is a great
day for everyone who has anything in the way of a fan or a bouquet
to sell. Any price. How much tor that fan f "Fifteen francs."
Bah!" Then now much will Monsieur give?" Monsieur will give a
third of the price. "Oh, impossible!" Monsieur passes on, and
purchases two fans (with whioh the ladies are to protect their faces),
for one franc each. "Let's have two good bouquets," Bays Uncle
Taplin, becoming enthusiastic; and the ladies exclaim, "Oh, yes,
do! Let's!" So Uncle Tap purchases two bouquets, and our coach-
man, being an ingenious oreature, and a bit of an artist in colour,—
having already decorated his horse's heads with small nosegays,—
now takes the carriage-lamps out of their sockets, deposits them in
a shop (I hope with a trusty friend), and in half a minute, the two
bouquets have replaced the lamps, and give quite a gay and festive
appearance to our equipage.
Basket after basket of flowers is offered to us. Ten francs, nine
francs, any francs, down to one franc, acoording to size. Here '■ a
good basket-full. How much Madame? Madame replies readily,
hazarding a likely price, "Monsieur shall have it for nine francs.
Monsieur, who is hard at a bargain this morning, won't hear of it.
What, then, will Monsieur give? Monsieur will give five francs.
"Tenez!" she exclaims, shoving it into my hands, "prenez-le,
prenez-le.'" She won't wait—the Dargain is concluded—she is afraid
I shall change my mind. I take the basket, and, my hands being
full, I ask Lncle Tap for the money. "Et encore un franc pour Is
corbeille!" shrieks the lady, who is a type of a Nicoise as an
outside-Covent-Garden market-woman.
"Hey, what's thatP" asks Uncle .Taplin, suspiciously, under
the impression that something has gone wrong with the bargain.
"One franc more for the basket," I say, carrying it on to the
ladies.
"All right!" says Uncle Tap, much relieved, and pays up
Boys surrounding us, begging to be taken as ra masseurs. Fortu-
nately some one has told me beforehand that a ramasseur, at two
francs for the afternoon, is ne-
cessary as a sort of running foot-
man, to 'pick up the nosegays,
and return them to the carnage.
I select a sickly - looking chap,
who really does seem in want of
a job. Five francs he wants.
No. Three. Very good, he'll
undertake it for three,— and
will Monsieur pay before-
hand? No, Monsieur won't.
This engagement being made,
our successful ramasseur shows
that he is not quite the sickly
creature he appears, by kicking
and cuffing all the smaller and
unsuccessful candidates for our
ramasseurship, and then he
mounts by the side of the coach-
man, and we are off to the Promenade des Anglais. _
At the entrance we are stopped, and a louis is demanded
"Halloa!" says Uncle Taplin, induced to resent the demand as
an imposition on confiding foreigners, "What's this for?" I
remember the Derby Day, and remind him that even in free England
we have to pay a guinea to take our place among the coaches on the
hill. "Ah, so we do! " says Uncle Taplin, and seeing the matter
in a different light, and rather pleased that this price of admission
should be an imitation of an English custom, he pays it with cheer-
ful alacrity, and the coachman receives a yellow ticket, while for one
franc more, our consumptive ramasseur has purchased a Carnival
fool's cap, which is the badge of his official connection with our
carriage, and so we enter the rank as combatants in the Battle of
Flowers.
The Drivels not crowded at first. It is railed in on both sides.
There are mounted gendarmes keeping the course, and, occasionally,
when tired of standing still, taking short sharp gallops from one

point to another, on the evident pretenoe of giving each other orders,
or delivering official messages. There are important personages,
stewards of the course, on foot, wearing red rosettes, who are very
ill-tempered, cross, and fussy. By the Motel de la Mediterranie the
crowd is really dense,—hut never at anyone point, or at any part all
along the course, does it ever exceed the crowd to he seen in Hyde
Park hy the Serpentine on a fine day at the first meet of the Four-
in-hand, or Coaching, Club. Here are the Tom-fools and clowns, and
other professional gentry going about just as the acrobats, and the
conjuror, and the strong man, and so forth, do on the Derby Day.
There are very few good turn-outs, and the presence of voituret,
hired traps, and vans, are rather suggestive (to the Englisher of
Cockney experience) of a "day out with the Foresters, 'Appy
'Ampton, or Odd Fellows. There is a hand playing somewhere,
which is to be heard occasionally.
"When is the battle going to begin?" asks Mrs. Grayling, who
is a trifle nervous.
"0 Aunt!" exclaims Mabel, "look—they 're throwing already."
And scarcely are the words out of her mouth than three small nose-
gays fall lightly into our carriage, and a fourth drops outside, which
is immediately picked up and given to us by our ramasteur, who
from this moment has his work cut out for him. A gaily-dressed
lady drives by, and throws a bouquet at Unole Taplin.
_ Ha!" he exclaims, his eyes sparkling with delight at the com-
pliment thus paid him by the fair stranger, and he discharges one
at her, which misses. Mrs. Grayling receives nice little nosegays
on her bonnet or her face, and returns them with a graceful sort
of movement, as if she were curtseying on her seat. _ Miss Mabel
becomes energetic, and goes in for rapid pelting, keeping the con-
sumptive ramasseur hard at work.
"Really," says Unole Taplin, chuckling, "this is capital fun."
Here comes at him a small bunch of violets, which he returns so
quickly that it gently hits his assailant—a very pretty woman—on
the corner of her ear. "Aha!" laughs Uncle Tap—"and all done
with such good-humour! Oh!" he cries, suddenly, "who the
deuce did that t" as a heavy-handled bouquet, bound with wire,
gives him a stinger on the cheek. I can't help laughing. "That
was a nasty one," I say, and. seeing a big man, in a white hat, pass,
I hurl the heavy bouquet at him. Bang goes his hat, and there is a
shout of laughter. It is too late to retaliate,—he has been driven off
one way, our carriage another.
"Capital!" I exclaim. I'm really getting quite warm with the
exertion of throwing. I select prominent personages, on coaoh
boxes, or sitting up at the backs of the carriages.
"Now look here," I say to Uncle Tap, "see me catch that chap
on Ha! conf ." A heavy blow, as if from a tennis-ball,
catches me behind the ear, another whack
in my eye, and a third bang on the cheek
—'1 en plein" — as we say at roulette.
Shouts of laughter from the bystanders.
My cheek is smarting painfully, and my
eye is watering. This is horse-play.
This is not good-humoured. That blow
on my ear—my, how it tingles!—was
vicious, distinctly vicious. I prepare a
heavy, well-wired bouquet. If I could
only catch the confounded fellow who
Ah! bang on my hat. I turn sharply
and discharge, savagely, my life-pre-
server bouquet,—'' as an olive-branch out
of a catapult,"—whack, on to the nearest
Tom-fool's head. He flinches and goes
down to avoid, whereupon, my life-
preserver bouquet catches an entirely
innocent person, standing just behind him. A laugh—and a whack
at me—right on the tip of my nose—which feels smashed in. Nose-
gay indeed! I feel my nose is anything but a nose-gay now. Shouts
of laughter, in which Uncle Taplin joins. This reminds me sud-
denly, that I must keep my temper, or at all events, keep up
appearances of being in the best possible humour; otherwise, ii the
crowd becomes nasty, vegetables might follow. So I take my
punishment smiling.
Mrs. Grayling and Mabel have recognised lots of friends, and
have been pelting and pelted right and left. Once Mabel gets rather a
nasty one, and retaliates with all her might and main. Mrs. Gray-
ling has her hat knocked on one side, which gives her a momentarily
dissipated appearance; but she only smiles, and tosses back upon her
fierce assailant a pretty little bouquet, making her usual half-curtsey
on the seat, and then puts her hat to-rights.
Happy Thought.—As our baskets of ammunition may be soon
exhausted, let us attract the fire of others upon ourselves by feigning
to be preparing to throw. This succeeds admirably, and in a few
minutes our baskets are choke full again.
_ Some one cries out, '' There's the Prince of Wales!" and in the
distance we hear the band playing our National Anthem, but I am
unable to catch sight of His Royal Highness, as, just when I am

raising my hat to salute him, I receive a' heavy bouquet full in the
face,—" en plein" again,—and oan't distinguish even the most dis-
tinguished persons for the next couple of minutes.
Having driven up and down the promenade three times, and
having, all of us, received " nasty ones," more or less, in the eyes,
nose, mouth, and ears, isn't the amusement becoming a trifle
monotonous? Isn't the fun a little forced Y Isn't it rather devoid
of "life" and "go"!' "Is there anything else to do or to see?"
I ask the driver when we get into a quiet part of the promenade
where there is only a single line of carriages. The coachman shrugs
his shoulders; no, this is all. "Tout ce qu'il y ad faire, ou d voir."
When does it finish? Well, about 4'30, the coachman says, naming
an early hour, as he probably is becoming tired of it, and wants to
get home to tea.
"It's not well arranged," says Uncle Taplin, with his hat smashed
in, and one side of his face as red as a rose from a recent violent blow.
"No," I reply, feeling very hot and very angry, because with a
swollen cheek, a burning ear, and a partially discoloured eye, I have
not been able to
be revenged on
"The Man who
struck O'Hara"
—(Oh, if I had
only been near
him with a thick
stick! I'd have
shown him what a

ought to be, and
be blowed to him
for a coward!).

had enough of it.
We are not vanquished. We do not retreat. No: we simply don't
want to play any more—and—ha!—a drop of rain! Rain it is! and
rain it will be, when it once begins. So hurry back, Coachman. Out
with the bouquets, in again with the lamps, lighted this time, for the
gloom is ooming on, all the forces are routed, and in full retreat we
drive along the road to Monte Carlo, arriving in time to vaseline our
wounds, and prepare for dinner.
It has been a glorious fight, this Battle of Flowers. Not quite so
lively as we expected, and yet a little too lively occasionally. We
all agree that it is a pretty sight. But Unole Taplin and myself are
of opinion that it is badly managed, and that the horse-play spoils it.
In excellent form for dinner. The very evening for a glass of real
good champagne. Now in France, as a rule, this is just what you
can't get, pay what you will for it. But, to the eternal praise of
Signor Zucchi (of our Hotel) be it recorded, that he is able to produce for
our benefit Pommery and Greno '80, and very soon we are all unanim-
ous in our expression of opinion that the Battle of Flowers at Nice is
well worth seeing, that we wouldn't have missed it for anything,
that all the pelting was most good-tempered, and that if there were,
now and then, a little horse-play, it must be expected from a crowd;
and—after all—didn't we join in it as heartily (and as fiercely) as
any one? Certainly. Another bottle of Pommery, '80 or 84, and
here's the health of the Battle of Flowers at Nice!
After the Battle.

"Force is no remedy"—that's true, of course.
Then why seek remedy in (verbal) Force?
"Dust Ho!"
'' A pair day's work, and a fair day's pay!" used to be considered
the modest ideal of male labourers. A day's labour of elevtn hours
knee-deep in a foul-smelling, disease-disseminating dust-heap, for
tenpence seems, according to recent Clerkenwell revelations, to be
the wretched reality amongst some of our modern women-workers.
If this is how our " Golden Dustmen " gather their gold, the ory will
be, not "Down with the dust!" but " Down with the Dustmen!"
Of the Turf Turfy.—The case against Messrs. Sanger, on
account of the accident to the "Baldwin Pony" was dismissed by
the Bench. "Quite right too," says little Plunger. "Betting
may be illegal—more or less—but it would be a pretty state of
things, by Jove, if a fellow were liable to be had up for the quite
too awfully common misfortune of 'dropping a Pony,' dontoher?"

masquerading. Any way, painter-
etchedness, as exemplified by the
Exhibition now open at the Royal
Water Colour Society's Rooms, is
in all respects likely to produce
joyous sensations. The Presi-
dent, Mr. Seymour Haden, con-
tributes over 140 examples, and
if we see more of his work than
anybody else's, he is doubtless
aidin' the success of the show by
contributing so largely to the col-
lection. Most of the exhibitors
seem to have "got the needle," and
haying got it, it is needless to say
they have used it with point and dexterity. There are over 350
examples on the walls, and in most of them the lines seem to have
fallen in pleasant places. It is strange that in so large an exhibition of
needlework there is but little that is So-so.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IN A NUTSHELL.
Our Policy, friends, may be briefly displayed:
Keep out Foreign Labour, keep in Native Trade!
Protection's our ticket, Free Trade is no go;
We have small faith iu Mill, but we've much in Monroe.
Of alien Cadgers we'd make a good clearance;
We won't interfere, and won't stand interference.
If 'twixt East and West seaboards we wish for a shorter way,
Uncle Sam, it is clear, must be boss of the water-way.
We won't trust for freedom to Franks ; what Lord BrRON meant
/mean—we will not have "hostile environment."
We are quite snug at home, and have no need to "collar."
But—well, you may just lay your bottomest dollar,
Otir continents Europe must not take a stand in;
We '11 want North and South—by-and-by—to expand in.
We '11 leave—for the present—the small states their freedom,
But Europe must kindly "hands off" till we need 'em.
We '11 respect foreign flags, in the spirit and letter,
If they '11 respect ours—and, by Jingo, they'd better!
We do not much mind "diplomatic adjustment,"
If we get the pull; if we don't, there's a dust meant. _
Our Surplus—well, that need not much rough your hair, if
We trim things a bit without touching the Tariff.
That's sacred, of course. If you don't make a bother,
You bet, we shall fix it up, somehow or other.
Protection we '11 back without making it bigger,
If " sections" you '11 drop, and—make use of the Nigger!
Civil Service Reform P That, of course; bless you, yes!
We shall tackle that job, with the usual success.
Party Service from office a man won't disqualify
(A principle that which a Cato might mollify),
But fraud or incompetence winked at by Me?
Snakes! What do you take me for? Fiddlededee!
I '11 do quite as much for Civilian Virtue
As Cleveland—and that, I suspect, will not hurt you.
That's all—save the usual rhetorical flourishes.
Oar Big Bird o' Freedom its noble youth nourishes
On—whatever comes in his way. While he carries on
This game, it's all right with that Fowl—and with Harrison!
New Classification.—The division of Society into the "Classes"
and the "Masses," though popular at present, is vague and inex-
haustive. Society is really made up of Toilers, Idlers, and Criminals;
which may be fitly called, respectively, the Working, Shirking,
and Lurking Classes.
A DOG'S TALEI-THE STORY OF STING!
[N.B.—Please to remember the poor Bow-Wows, who are in a sorry plight
at the Home for Lost and Starring Dogs, at Battersea. ]
Ah! Sting! my old friend, as you sit by the fire, and gaze so con-
tentedly into the coals.
Can I wonder when men have no need of their hearts, why it should

It is folly to say that you never have thought, when you turn from
your retrospect into the past
And leaving the vision of what might have been, you rest your dear
eyes on your mistress at last!
Ah! many's the mile, in this weary old world, we have jogged on

There was never a pain at my heart but you felt: there is never a
day of distress but you know;
When joy has been with me you've capered at heel, in days less
distressful, 'neath sunnier skies.
But the tears that in solitude wetted my cheeks, were mirrored, dear
Sting, in your faithful old eyes!

And see if we both can reflect and recall how I found oat my friend,

GOOD WOOD!
_ That delightful writer on Natural History, the Rev. J. G. Wood,
died the other day, to the regret of everyone who ever dipped into
his multitudinous books. Notwithstanding its unfailing industry
and perennial charm, his prolific pen was unable to make provision
for his sick widow and her six children. The Vicar of St. Peter's,
Rent, where Mr. Wood resided, has made an appeal to the public in
this case, which he says is very urgent," as it is sorely very
deserving. If every reader, boy or man, who owes any number of
happy hours to the author of so many charming works, were moved
to pay some minute portion of his debt by sending his mite to the
"J. G. Wood Fund," that Fund would speedily become a pretty
plump one. Mr. Punch gladly announces that the mites in question
—may they be many! —may be sent direct to the Rev. Alfred
Whitehead, Vioarage, St. Peter's, Kent, or to the "J. G. Wood
Fund," Messrs. Hammond & Co., Bankers, Queen Street, Ramsgate.
Now, boys!

You must be a babe o' grace,
A (let us hope) anachronistic rarity'.

At codifying sin, TCharity!
Your cardinal transgression wo uld be —
THE USE OF MICE IN POLITICS.
Ridicvlus Mus, who, according to the old
fable, once released the lion from a net, may
yet save the British Lion from the meshes of
female domination, which some deem to be
closing on him. _ A meeting of a Woman's
Suffrage League is said to have been hur-
riedly broken up by the scare created through
the sudden apparition of "a little mouse!
Fancy, strong - minded Blue - Stockingdom
beaten by the tiny household rodent! The
ladies were assembled "to appoint female
Candidates for Poor Law Guardians." To
them in solemn conclave gathered, enter
one little furry creature with sparkling eyes
and long tail, and lo! a hasty gathering of
skirts, and a flurried flight! Would-be
Women Guardians scattered by "the most
magnanimous mouse." Fancy a modern
Mock-Heroio on the " Battle or the Female
Suffragists and the—Mice!" The "Rat" has
long had his place in the Political World.
Now is the time for the Mouse. The story
has, of course, been denied, and perhaps is
too good to be true!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM THE DIAET OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, March 4.—Things delightfully dull to-night
after fervour of last week. At Question Time Irish Members tried
to get up little breeze about mysterious movements of Head Con-
stable Preston. Harcourt, incited by previous successes from below
Gangway, followed on same tack. Matthews blundering as usual;
but even that didn't succeed in bringing on a row.
"Must have a quiet night sometimes," Old Morality pleaded.
"Quiescence plays in daily life the part of nitrate on the exhausted
soil. It fructifies it; or, as I might say, it makes it fruitful."
Some promise of diversion from unexpected quarter. Anonymous
Gentleman rose from Bench behind Ministers; attempted to counter-
veil designedly awkward question by Harcourt as to vagaries of
Lieutenant in Command of Detachment of British Army at Church
at Clonmel on Sunday. Diligent inquiry made known fact that
anonymous person was Theobald, the Member for Romford. This
question his maiden speech; evidently prepared with great care.
But, whether owing to nervousness or bad writing, could not make
out contents of manuscript. Doggedly stuck at it; forged ahead,
mixing up alternate lines; talking about the "Commanding Priest"
and the " Reverend Officer." At last, Speaker interfered; suggested
notice had better be given of question. Theobald, looking up over
manuscript, affected not to see Speaker: stumbled on again; loud
cries of Order! Order!" Speaker and Theobald on their legs
together; Theobald only got two more folios to read: might do
them at a trot. Came another cropper; not quite clear whether the

priest was " publicly rebuked by said officer," or whether said officer
was publicly rebuked by priest.
"Order! Order!" cried Speaker, with increased sternness.
"Order! Order!" roared Irish Members.
Theobald, popping head again up over manuscript, looked round
the House with anguished expression, and sat down on his hat.
Irish Members, soothed by this little incident, subsided, and talking
went drowsily forward. Business done.—Still
harping on Address.
Tuesday.—X little froth left on top of Parlia-
mentary bottle. Wanting to know all kinds of ^\
things about secret interviews between emissaries
of the Times, and prisoners in cell. Emissaries
alleged to be Government officials. Cobb very
anxious to know how the Chevalier Le Carox
came to be introduced to Mr. Houston; whether
an official of Scotland Yard gave the Chevalier a
number of confidential documents, forming part
of correspondence that had come into Anderson's
possession in his official capacity. Matthews,
assuming early-morning attitude of Sphynx,
knows very little about anything. What little he
does know, declines to disclose. Balfoub equally
reticent. Irish Members pepper away. Haecoubt,
unable to resist temptation, plunges in, and
splashes round. Balfour and Matthews, stand-
ing back to back, face the crowd. After squabble,
lasting nearly an hour, attacking forces withdraw.
Balfoub reclines in graceful attitude on Bench;
Henry Matthews mops his forehead, and wonders
why he should have consented to be Home
Secbetabt.

Robertson makes lively attack on Old
Morality because he didn tmove expulsion
of Gent-Da vis. Accuses him of displayinj
indifference to the honour of the House, an<
violating one of its best and worthiest tradi-
tions. Old Mobality shocked at this lan-
guage. "The Hon. Member," he says.
asks me why, as Leader of the House, I
did not, upon publication of Mr. Justice
NoETn's strictures upon Mr. Gent-Davis,
at once bring the matter under the notice
of the House. I would reply by putting
another question. Does the lion. Member
for Dundee know why a poker (resting on a
fender) feels colder than the hearthrug which
is further off the fire? No?
^ . (Triumphantly.) Then I will tell
him. Because the poker is an
excellent conductor, and draws
heat from our hand much more
rapidly than the woollen hearth-
rug, which is a very bad con-
ductor; though both, therefore,
tire equally warm, the poker seems
to be the colder. That is my
answer to the Hon. Member, and
I am content after the explana-
„ , „ .„ tion I have given to leave the
Robertson, M.P. matter inthehandsof the House."
"Yah ! yah! yah !" roared Robebt Fowleb. Cheer taken up from
all the Ministerial Benches, and Smith resumed his seat suffused
with consciousness of virtue. Business done.—Debate on Address.
Wednesday. — A Conybcarc-cum-Cunninghame-Grahame sort of
day. Cunninohame speaking when Debate on Address adjourned
at midnight; comes up quite fresh this afternoon, and continues
speeoh for an hour. Then enter Conybeabe, and. exit the few
Members left by Cunninohame. Conybeabe growls and snarls for
space of an hour and a quarter. Subject, neglected condition of
Working Classes. Fenwick points out that a day has been secured
for regular, full discussion of subject on Motion by Bboadhubst. A
working-man himtelf, representative of a great constituency, Fen-
wick will have nothing to do with Conybeare-cum-Cunninghame-
Grahame. Rather hints that they are wasting time and spoiling
good cause. Old Morality moves Closure. Bradlaugh votes with
Government.
"Ha! ha!" said Pickeesgill, gloomily regarding Member for
Northampton. "The time will come when
Brother Beadlaugh, too, will join the
Gentlemen of England, and go out to dine
with Dukes."
Business done. — Address voted.
Thursday.—W. Redmond
wants to know whether it is
true that on night of his
arrest Dr. Tanner was
obliged to sit in a chair, the
Home Secketaby having
omitted to provide him with
a bed? Irish Members pre-
pared to be thrilled with
this fresh enormity. But
presently Redmond wishes
he hadn't spoke. Home
Secbetaby tells plain un-
varnished tale. Draws with
firm yet sympathetic hand
cosy picture of Tanner,
seated in only armchair
possessed by Scotland Yard,
specially drawn in for him,
with whiskey ad libitum,
Bandwiches ad infinitum,
and cigars of the best British make.
The O'Gobman Maiion listened with glistening eves. "Begorra!"
he says, smacking his lips, "if that's the way they're treated at
Scotland Yard I 'D get taken up meself. Go and see about it at
once." And he strode forth with his stately gait.
W. Redmond still takes tragic view of situation.
"Does the Home Secretary," he asked, "mean to say that cigars
and sandwiches are a sufficient substitute for a bed?"
"My Right Hon. friend,"
said Old Mobality, coming
to the table, "has asked me to
answer the question of the Hon.
Member. As we have all read
somewhere, the bearing of hU
observation lies in the appli-
cation of it. Are sandwiches
and cigars a sufficient substitute
for a bed ? he asks. I answer,
'That depends.' If you have
a sufficient quantity of sand-
wiches, and they are spread out
mattress-fashion, accommoda-
tion for a night's repose might
be obtained. I would point out
to the Hon. Member that if
choice is open to him, it would
be well to select beef as the
viand, being softer—I may say
more springy — than nam,
especially ham of American or
highly-salted brands. The
cigars, also presupposing that
they are furnished in suffi-
cient numbers, would, properly
treated, admirably serve the
purpose of a bolster. I have
now given the Hon. Gentleman
every information in my power,
and I sincerely trust that he
Uoing to see about it." will accept the explanation „
satisfactory, and that we shall be permitted to go forward with the
business of the House. Her Majesty's Government have nothing
to hide in the matter, their single object being to consult the con-
venience of the House, and perform their duty to the Queen and the
Country." Loud cheers greeted these few remarks, and the subject
dropped. Business done.—Lord Geobge Hamilton brought in
scheme for strengthening Navy.
Friday.—That subtle humorist, Jackson, prepared little surprise
for House to-night. Sort of double-cutting joke. Ministers and
Ministerialists thought they were going to have a good grind at
Supply, already in urgent state. Opposition had noticed Supply
not put down in first edition of Orders, and assumed it could not
come on. Notice absolutely necessary to dealing with Supply.
Nett consequence was, that it could not be taken, and sitting cheer-
fully wasted. By Ten o'Clock everything wound up, and surprised,
if not delighted Ministers, went home. Business done.—None,

ON COMMISSION.
Tuesdat/j March \2th.—Those who had come to see those eminent
Counsel, Sir Charles Russell and Mr. Lockwood, must have been
disappointed as neither of my learned friends put in an appearance,
during the whole day. However, my learned friends, laughter-
leading and fiery, were admirably represented by Mr. R. T. Reid, a
gentleman of infinite jest and judgment, and consequently the
appropriate spokesman in Parliament of the rollicking borough of
Dumfries. The artists of the illustrated papers were also in attend-
ance, ready to seize upon, for pictorial embellishment, such striking
incidents as "Mr. George Lewis drops his eyeglass," or "Mr.
Hardcastle, the accountant, examines the bankers' pass-book," or
| to give a carefully-finished sketch (that, if executed, would have a
distinct historical value) of "Mr. Cunningham, the Secretary,
attentively reads a letter asking for seats." By the way, it seems

a pity that the artists in question do not now and again depict
subjects a little more sensational. For instance, on this occasion, a
visitor appeared conspicuously on the Bench, whose identity no one
could ascertain. It was suggested that he might be a Judge.
"Not one of our lot," said an official of the Court.
"Nor an Irish Judge either," returned a gentleman of the Press,
who, from the purity of his accent, I imagine, must have been an
Englishman born in Dublin.
If the Bar for the defence was weak in members, the Times was
exceptionally well represented. All the leaders were present; and
it was a touching sight to see Mr. Attorney offering to assist Sir
Henry James to examine a Witness. My learned and right hon.
friend, the Ex-Home Seoretary, however, Beemed to me a. little
ungrateful when he asked the Senior Law Officer of the Crown to
elect to keep silence, or to examine the Witness all by himself. The
feature of the sitting was the^ committal of this very Witness to gaol
was rightly described as
"insolent" by Sir James
Hannen, and richly merited
his fate. Nothing could
have been more dignified
than tbe bearing of the
revered President when he
ordered the fellow to be
taken "to prison," which
sounded (especially as it
was followed by the man's
immediate removal by a
door under the bench) like
a command to "throw the
recreant into the deepest
dungeon beneath the castle's
moat." During the luncheon
interval the Court showed
their entire confidence in
the strength and determin-
ation of their ever-courteous
Secretary by leaving the
Witness (a person of power-
ful proportions) in his safe
oustody until their return.
The man, who was removed
Taking a littis Cofley. >7 an elderly official com-
plained as he went that
his was a ease of intimidation of the worst sort." The fellow's name
was Coffey—a fact that, I fancy, suggested a thought to Mr. Justice
Day (a thought that, if it ever existed, however, was never revealed)
that " Coffey, in prison, would be suited to a T!"
"Tednesday.—Unquestionably a great day for Ireland. In the
toi. xcn, n

first instance my learned and erudite friend, Mr. Murphy, Q..C'.,
had an opportunity of declaring to the world in general, and to Mr.
Attorney in particular, that the 17th of March was the date of
the fete of St. Patrick. Encouraged by this valuable assistance,
to be generous to others, Sir Richard, in his turn, once more
gave Sir Henry James the benefit of his support and advice,
when my right hon. friend the ex-Home Secretary had a Witness
under examination. It is needless to say that Sir Henry made
suitable acknowledgment of the kindness. The second time "Ould
Ireland" scored, was when Mr. Biqgar, representing himself (and
really no better representative could be possibly found for so difficult
a role) showed how much was lost to the Bar, and even the Bench,
by the Hon. "apparition in person" (if I may use such a term) not
having qualified for the Lord High Chancellorship. On two distinct
occasions, Mr. Biqgar was well to the fore, obtaining results
that must have filled him with (perhaps) surprise, and (no doubt)
sincere gratification. The rest of the morning was taken up with
the last of the Times Witnesses, tempered with the occasional appear-
ance of Mr. Soames, as a sort of forensic] Chorus, explaining
everything to everyone's entire satisfaction. I was glad to see
during the sitting my ever-courteous friend, Mr. Cunningham,
also Beizing an opportunity for personal distinction. It having
become necessary to produce a letter, the Secretary set to work
to hunt it up, and during the interesting prooess managed to
give quite a little entertainment. Mr. Cunningham, by his expression,
[while engaged in the search), contrived to suggest anxiety, doubt,
sorrow, hope, determination, despair, and ultimately triumph.
When the letter was at length run to cover (in a portfolio), Mr.
Cunningham produced it with the air of a conjuror, who, after
piquing curiosity by several simulated failures, finally draws from a
seemingly empty hat an unexpected bundle containing a loaf of
bread, a wig, a bird-cage, and a pair of infantine leggings.
It was not until after the midday adjournment that the case of the
Times concluded. Then it was that Sir Charles Russell (who had
been away during the morning, leaving my learned friends, Messrs.
Reid and Asquith, to represent the aocused during his absence),
rose to put several questions to the Bench. He asked would the
Commissioners make any interim report. "No," courteously ex-
plained the President, on behalf of himself and colleagues, "they
would not," on the prinoiple (so I understood), that it is baa in law
to make two bites at a cherry. Then Sir Charles explained the
great possibilities of expansion the inquiry possessed. He made a
calculation, which seemed to suggest that, under certain pleasing
and favourable circumstances, the Commissioners might be invited
to sit, "it might be for years, it might be for ever. He assured
their Lordships that he was well aware that, if necessary, they
would willingly assent to such an arrangement. No doubt he was
right in his assumption, but, as a matter of fact, the Commissioners
gazed into vacancy as they listened to this merited recognition of
their devotion to duty with a stare painfully eloquent of the
strongest emotion. My learned friends for the Times also looked

Bather a Ul.uk look-out.
rather blaok. Then Sir Charles held out a brighter prospect. If
they might adjourn until Tuesday fortnight, he fancied that he
would be able to so arrange the case for what he might term" the
defence, that a great portion of it might receive development by the
Easter Vacation. He (with the consent of his learned friends) would
be the only Counsel to open the case. He laid a stress upon the
word "counsel" no doubt with a view to leaving Mr. Biggar the
opportunity of making an oration, the eloquence of which might live
in the memories of generations yet to come. With a sigh of either
sorrow or relief (I cannot say which), the Commissioners immediately
assented, and the Court stood adjourned until the 2nd of April—the
morrow of a festival that to many present had possibly a certain
weird significance.
Thus my note ends. Whether I shall reopen it depends upun the
claims that my clients may advance to my time and attention, as I
(like the rest of the Bar) have made it a golden rule never to accept
retainers to be in two or more places at once.
Pump-handle Court. {Signed) A. Briefless, Junior.

no applause followed from his schoolfellows,
and as he made his way back to his seat
beside his parents, there was a distinct sound
of hissing. His father looked indignantly all
round him through his gold spectacles, and
his mother patted his hand, and admired the
binding of the volume, which had the school
arms on it in gold, but the boy did not seem
to care to open it, as he sat there with burning

cheeks, while a little girl, who was in a seat
some way behind, looked at him with pitying
and curious eyes. After the prize-giving
there were performances, and I saw them all
from beginning to end. The boys dressed up
like real actors, and acted scenes from plays
in Latin and Greek, at which their parents,
though they did not understand a single word,
were thoroughly delighted, for it showed that
their sons were receiving a really good edu-
cation and fitting themselves to succeed in
life. But the visitors whose sons were not
aoting thought the performance dull. The
last play was in English, and in this the
boy who had won the biggest prize took the
principal part. All the visitors were delighted
with him, for he looked very handsome and
gallant in his stage-dress, and spoke his lines
boldly and clearly; but his school-fellows
made a point of applauding everybody else,
and when he was called before the curtain,
there was hissing to be heard again from the
back benches. The little girl, who had asked
her brother the reason of this nnkindness,
was told in a whisper that it was suspected
in the school that the boy had won his prize
unfairly, and that was why they were
hissing.
"When it was all over and the visitors
were going away, I happened to look down
on the playground, ana there, by the fives'
courts, still wearing his gay dress, I saw the
prize-winner who had been hissed. And the
little girl most have seen him too and managed
to slip away, for, as I was looking, she came
out, looking rather shy and strange, and went
straight up to him. 'I just wanted to tell
you, I heard her say to him, 'not to mind a
bit what those horrid boys say. J don't
believe you cheated!'
"But he broke away without a word,
leaving her standing there puzzled and a
little offended—for he had cheated, and that
was the worst of it!"
"NOW, SIR!"
When a crass Sir Oracle
Vents his bumptious Big-Bow-Wow, Sir,
Everyone his class may tell
By his frequent use of " Now, Sir!"
When your platform Boanerges
Rants forth what he calls a " rouser,"
Every pointless " point" he urges
Starts with an emphatic "Now, Sir!"
When a fool " writes to the Papers,"
(" Anti-Humbco," "Visdkx," "Tow-
SBR "),
Volubly he struts and vapours,
AndfuV'noto" 's the frequent "Now, Sir:"
Was there ever pompons prig
Swelled a shirt-front, hitched a trouser,
But conceived it brave and big
To belard his bosh with " Now, Sir 1"?
Whilst a bumptious bore has breath,
Vanity finds vent, somehow, Sir,
And the Noodle's Shibboleth
Is the fierce thrasonic " Now, Sir!"

DUE SOUTH.
Still at Monte Carlo—After the Battle of Flowers—Return to
the Catino.
Btngleigh oomea up to me at the table. He is a small man with
a sharp shrewd manner, and a (flittering eye,—strictly speaking, two
glittering eyes. He is building a villa at Monte Carlo—that is, he

"Messieurs, faites le jeu!"
anee of an architect and
gangs of workmen, and from
being accustomed to deal, in
his London house of busi-
ness, with a large number
of employSs, to whom his
every word is law, and with
chiefs of various depart-
ments who do not attempt
even to discuss his sugges-
tions, he has acquired the
habit of excogitating com-
plicated problems of trade
in half a second, seeing all
the pros and cons of a scheme
at a glance like a First
Napoleon, and of giving his orders with the same promptitude and
decision that characterised the commands of the Iron Duke. His
word, nay, even his opinion, is as the very concentrated essence of
the spirit of the laws of the Medes and Persians. He stands behind
me and closely follows the progress of the game.
"Well," he says in his orisp chirrupy manner, with his head a
little on ene side, addressing me, while he never takes his eyes off
the board, "Well, what are you doing?" Now at this minute, I
am hesitating whether I shall put on the tix premiers or the sixteen
en plein. No good going on numbers," remarks Btngleigh,
curtly:" you won't do anything at that. Go on red." But I point
out to him that on red you can win only the amount you stake.
"Well, he returns, "if you do that often enough, "you '11 make a
good lot.
"No," I reply, with dogged determination, "I've made up my
mind to go on the first six."
"I shouldn't," he says, decisively. But I do. "Messieurs, faites
lejeu.' . . . Rien ne va plus!" and I've lost.
Told you so," says Btngleigh, with a dry laugh, and shrugging
his shoulders as much as to say, "if you will insist on running
contrary to my advice, you know what to expect."
I quote to him the authority of Smithson, an old hand. Smithson,
I remind him, advised me to put on the first six, the last dozen, and
zero. "Oh, Smithson doesn't know everything," retorts Btngleigh.
This I admit is true; but still, having trusted to Smithson, and
Smithson having been right,—and if I had only stuck to what he
told me, I should have been by now a richer and a gayer man,—
I am a little hurt to hear Smithson's advice so contemptuously
treated by Btngleigh. I can't help telling him that Smithson has
played here for years over and over again, and that—-
Here Btngleigh cuts me short by saying authoritatively,
"It's no use dodging about the table. You put on the red,—
that's the best game."
No, I beg his pardon, I will put on the 16 to 21 " transversal,"
and also back the middle dozen.
It turns up " three, red," which is neither in my transversal nor
in the middle dozen, and I lose on both. If I had stuck to my
"tix premiers" I should have won five times my stake, and only
lost the middle dozen one.
"But it was red," says Btngleioh, persistently.
Yes, it was; but I shall stick to the numbers. I like transversal.
I like the quatre premiers, which inoludes zero, for which you get,
as I explain to him, eight times your stake, and this time I shall go
four first and the middle dozen.
on the
"I wouldn't," says Btngleigh, shortly.
11 should go on the red."
I put my five-franc piece on the middle dozen, then, by an inspi
ration, on " impair^' and finally I am jnst saying to the croupier,
in my sweetest and politest manner,—nay, the words are actually
on the tip of my tongue—" Les quatre premiers, s'il vous plait,"
when Btngleigh jogs my elbow and draws my attention to a large
amount which somebody is putting on the red, and, by an other-
wise utterly unaccountable lapsus lingua, I suddenly say, "Six
premiers " instead of '' quatre," and, before I can correct the mistake,
the magic words, "Rien ne vavlus!" are uttered, click goes the
ball, and. "Zero " turns up! Zero counts for quatre premiers, but
not for»tr premiers, and I've lost again.
"Red's put in prison," says Btngleioh. I mentally wish that
he was sharing red's fate, that is while I am playing. It'll win,
you '11 see."
It has been red so often, that I feel confident it can't come off this
time. I tell Btngleigh it was his fault that I didn't win just
now, because he jogged my elbow, and distracted me just at the
critical moment.
"Oh nonsense!" he replies, with an irritating chuckle. "You go
on the red."
"No, I don't care about colour. I feel an inspiration to try the
middle dozen, and impair. It is 16 (red) which is in the first dozen.
Lost again!
"You would do it," says Btngleioh, shrugging his shoulders
with an air of supreme disgust at my inconceivable obstinacy. "It's
no use your going on numbers. Stick to a colour."
"Which? I ask, in despair.
"Ah," he replies, with another shrug, and a short cynical laugh—
I hate a short cynical laugh—"I haven't been watching, but I
should say black for choice.
Savagely I throw down one piece on black, and another I place en
transversal 16 to 21, and, just as I am doing it, I feel a strong
impulse to put it on 13—18. By_ a sudden impulse, and begging
somebody's pardon for rubbing his ear the wrong way as I lean
energetically over towards the croupier at the end of the table, I
place a piece on the last dozen. Messieurs! faites le jeu.' . . .
Rien ne va plus."'—it will soon be rien ne va plus with, me—and—
click!—up comes 14 red. Lost on all!
"Ah," says Btngleioh, smiling sardonically, "you oughtn't to
have gone on the black."
"But you said black," I retort, annoyed at his perversity.
"Oh," he replies, with the Bame irritating cut-and-dried laugh,
and the usual shrug, "you mustn't go by me."
"Look here," I say to him, in a manner which is described in the
"business" of an operatio libretto as "with concentrated emotion,"
—"look here, you bring me bad luck. I wish to goodness you'd go
away." I feel that this is childish superstition. But, if you begin
gambling, you '11 find yourself giving in to all sorts of superstitions,
—and you can't help it.
Btngleigh shrugs his shoulders again, and saunters off. I remain,
and go on losing. Then I stop playing, just to Bee if I should have had
any luck. I say to myself, This time I should have put a five-frano
piece on 13 and black. I stand calmly watching the table. No one
Euts on 13. "Messieurs," &c. Somebody suddenly stretches out his
and and puts a pile of gold coins on 13. "Rien ne va plus!'" 13 by
Jove!! I Now, that's worse luck than anything else. I turn away.
"Rien ne va plus!" I retire into a corner and reckon. Bane has gone
one hundred and seventy-five francs. "Rien ne va plus!"
It is just on eleven, and I stop at the last table. Btngleigh is
here. He shows me five pieces ne hasjust won. "I went only on
red," he says, smiling triumphantly. His manner implies that I am
an idiot for not having done the same as he has. "Now," he cries,
"look here!" and he chuckles in anticipation of good luck, as he
puts his money on red and even. It turns up black and uneven.
Bang have gone two out of his five. "The black's turn now," he
says, and reaching out his hand deposits his three pieces on black.
In a second it is raked up and disappears with all the other stakes,
the croupiers descend from their perches, the servants are covering
up the table, the players are dispersing, and Btngleigh is left
grabbing at the cloth, and exclaiming,
"Here! Hi! I hadn't any go for my money!"
But no one attends to him, the rules are inexorable, and Btng-
leigh has lost all his hard-earned gains, and a trifle more into the
bargain.
My dear fellow," I say, not so much to console him as to rebuke
him for having previously lectured me on my method of playing,
and for his irritating style to me in the hour of my adversity, "there
is no rule in this sort of thing. It is all luck."
"Yes," he mutters, bitterly, "and bad luck too."
"Let's go to 'Zero's,'" suggests Johnnie Spoffehd, coming up
in a great-coat and muffler, for it is uncommonly cold. We visit
"Ciro's "—popularly known as "Zero's," which is a small American-
English drinking-bar, where very soon some fifty persons crowd into
a small space calculated to accommodate, with careful adjustment,
about thirty-five. And here we are, on a balmy moonlight night,
balmy but freshish, within a stone's throw of the blue Mediter-
ranean (which we can't see), in the land of the Sunny South,
sitting in a small bar, drinking Scotch whiskey-and-water-hot,
gin-sling, "John Collins," stout-and-bitter, all of whioh beverages
are, as is well known, peculiarly characteristic of the Sunny South
of Europe.
Crop v. Crop.
A Crusade against Rooks? To the thought ere one yields,
One must see how the whole matter looks,
Bycomparing the " State of the Crops"—in the fields,
With the " State of the Crops "—in the rooks.
We thought our black friends deleterious vermin ate.
Pause ere the poet-loved birds you exterminate!
Let us be sure how the rooks fill their craws,
Nor silence the chorus of caws—without cause.

arrange a special performance with the assistance of Mr. D'Otxy
Carte, of this celebrated triumviretta, which would not have existed
but for John Maddison Morton at the Savoy Theatre. By the way,
Messrs. Ward and Lock have published a volume of Plays for

preface by J. M. Morton himself, and an interesting monograph by
Clement Scott. J. M. M. acknowledges his indebtedness to

Maddison Morton for a considerable amount of dramatic work,
which has contributed to his French material prosperity.

ECHOES OF THE STREET.
"On afternoons, in London streets.
The Winner is proclaimed by boys;
And ev'ry wretched lad one meets,
Flouts Losers with prodigious noise!"
The Saladmonger.
Wbten the day is nigh done,
And good folks have begun
To think they will homeward be strolling—
Comes a voice, does there not?
Through cab-clatter, I wot,
And busses eternally rolling;
It is piercing and
shrill,
And proclaimswith
a will
Much comfort for
toiler and spinner';
You know, without
doubt,
From the news-
vendor's shout,
That someone or
something 's a
"Winner!"
If times have been
bad,
And you 're sulky
or sad,
While little enough in your purse is,
If a victim to fate,
You can naught contemplate
But unbroken chains of reverses:
If you 're feeling put out.
Or you're threatened with gout,
(As trying to saint as to sinner),
You are apt to get riled,
For it makes you so wild.
To hear such a shouting of '' Winner!"
If you've just had to part
With the girl of your heart.
Who better loves some other fella;
If the rain-clouds descend,
And you find that your friend
Has taken your silken umbrella;
If you nail cabs in vain,
As you trudge through the rain,
While late, minutes thirty, for dinner—
How you'd like then to flay
Those young imps, by the way,
Who wildly ejaculate Winner!
When, in spite of the cram,
You ne'er pass your exam.,
When plays you've annexed are detected;
When your novel's a frost,
Your election is lost;
Or your wonderful picture rejected—
Still each urchin will yowl
O'er your downfall, and howl—
Like a fiend o'er your fate he's a grinner—
He will gaily rejoice
At the top of his voice,
And blithely vociferate, "Winner!"
The attempt of his Servian friends to get
M. Paschttch, the celebrated outlaw, whose
only fitness for the post is supplied by the
fact that he has been frequently chased across
country by gendarmes for acts of brigandage,
appointed Minister of Commerce and Agri-
culture, appears, as might have been ex-
pected, to have created a considerable hitch
in the recent settlement of affairs at Bel-
grade. It need hardly be added that the hitch
in question was supplied in the person of M.

Whilst other nations are stone-broke;
Absorbed in small economies,

For thy bare coasts feel scarce a care;

say, "Take Long
Odds if you'd wish
to be happy!" Pos-
sibly, from a sporting
point of view, this
maybe not altogether
correct; but from a
literary standpoint it
is an "absolute moral." Hawley Smart has
now contributed over a quarter of a hundred
stories for the delectation of the reading
public, and this one, his latest, shows no
diminution in his power as a novelist. Long
Odds, though in three volumes, oddly enough,
never seems long; it is full of dash and
sparkle, and thoroughly amusing from start
to finish.
"Pickwick and Principle, always be tho-
rough; Hie thee, boy, hie thee, away to the
Borough!" So sings Mr. Arthur Cecil in
the Dramatio Cantata at the Comedy Theatre,
and this might almost be adopted as the motto
of a most interesting and valuable volume,
entitled, The Lnm of Old Southwark. Both
Mr. William Rendle, with his pen, and Mr.
Philip Norman, with his pencil, have hied
them away to the Borough to some purpose,
and they have always been thorough. No
pains have been spared to be exact down to
the most minute details; and yet the terrible
statistical dryness which is the characteristic
of most books treating of antiquarian sub-
jects, is altogether absent. Mr. Rendle's
knowledge of Southwark, like Mr. Welter's
acquaintance with London, is "extensive and
peculiar." He had an intimate knowledge of

the old Inns in the old days, long before the
Demon Demolition had commenced what it
is fashionable to call " improvement;" he has
an excellent memory; he has an intimate
knowledge of " authorities; " and he is teem-
ing with lore concerning the old quarter and
its associations. In his work he has been
admirably seconded by Mr. Norman, who,
besides contributing some of the best pictures
in the volume, has superintended and
arranged the whole of the illustrations which
accompany the text.
THE LAY OF THE LADY CANVASSER.
A Study in Social Development.
Whew lovely Woman stoops to touting
For Party votes, her pleasant way
Is different from the male's mad shouting,
But still she has her little say.
She does not stand at
the street-oorner
And wave her arms
like semaphores,
Of " chuckers1' she is
no suborner;
By other little tricks
she scores.
She "takes a book"
(and well she
knows it),
And on her canvas sallies forth;
And by St. Jingo how she "goes it"
From East to West, from South to North!
Amongst the poorest of the Voters,
In humblest " diggings" she will pop;
She shrinks not from the smell of " bloaters,"
She shuns not the cheap barber's shop.
To her affairs of State are riddles.
Not hers to know or reason well,
But oh! the awful taradiddles,
The Lady Canvasser can tell!
She tells them with tremendous unotion,
She tells them with a smiling face;
You'd think bold lying was the function
Designed by Nature for her race.
She fibs not feebly; no small "cracker,"
No timid trifling with the true.
She outs with some colossal "whacker,"
And sticks to it till all is blue.
With open mouth the workmen's spouses
Listen to "proofs" of Gladstone's crimes;
The small shopkeeper's wife she rouses
With awful tales about the "Times."
"That rival Candidate," she gurgles
Into the Voter's ready ear,
"Is a bad man; 'tis thought he burgles,
'Tis known that he gets drunk—on beer I
"He beats his wife, he was a waiter,
He it an awful atheist,
To our good Queen at heart he's traitor!"
Such hideous " facts" who could resist?
As to insidious suggestions
Of nameless sins—with such she teems;
Her whispered and soul-withering questions
Haunt nonest Voters in their dreams.
And so, unscrupulous, seductive,
Our latest Siren proudly floats
On Party waves, with wiles obstructive
Of truth, but telling much on—Votes.
Development? Some social Darwtn
May show the genesis of her,
Meanwhile they who would Party war win,
Can't slight the Lady Canvasser.

MORE DISCLAIMERS.
Mr. Froude, having written to a Correspondent to say that
he had been recently converted to a belief in Home Rule, there
is no farther reason why the following: letters from other distin-
guished writers should not also be made public:—
Sir,—There is no truth whatever in the report that I have
determined to " give up Scienoe," and have enrolled myself as a
Member of the " Salvation Army." Whilst there are knaves in
the world, such statements will occasionally be made, and,
whilst there are fools extant, I suppose I shall be troubled by
being asked to contradict them. The further reports that you
mention—to the effect that I am about to publish a book, entitled
Genesis; an Answer to the Pseudo-scientific Attacks of Arrogant
Agnostics, that I contemplate entering a Monastery at Jerusalem,
and that I have adopted a hair-shirt next to the skin, by advice
of "General" Booth, are equally silly, and devoid of founda-
tion. You can make what use you like of this letter. It is the
last you will get from Yours crustily, T. H-IL-T.
To P. Pry, Esq., Coventry.
Bear Sir,—I suppose it is the distance from the centres of
information at which you reside that causes you to be so
strangely ignorant of my opinions on Home Rule and the
Parnell Commission. You may certainly contradict the rumour
which you say you have heard, that I am writing a magazine
article in defence of the Ministry, and of Sir Richard Webster
in particular; also that I am about to stand for Parliament in
the Conservative interest, and as an " out-and-out supporter of
the Unionist Government." It is true that my services to the
Gladstonjan party—of which you seem curiously unaware—
fully entitle me to election by some enlightened constituency;
but at present, and until that constituency turns up, I must
content myself with newspaper Philippics.
Yours positively, Frederic H-rr-s-n.
P.S.—Be careful about the spelling of " Frederic," if you
have this letter printed. The last tune that I saw a E added
to my Christian name I remained senseless for five hours.
S. Macpherson, Esq., The Hermitage, Mull.
Sir,—The shortest way of answering your silly letter is to
contradict each statement seriatim. 1 have not "in a fit of
tardy repentance ordered my booksellers to destroy all the his-
torical works I have ever written." I have not given up
"History," nor do I intend " devoting myself in future to the
production of cheap sensational fiction." I have not altered
all my opinions as to the unspeakable nature of Turks owing
to the decoration of the Thira Order of the Medjidie having
been conferred upon me. I have not been insulted by being
offered any such decoration, Yours categorically.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 11.—Stanhope made state-
ment on introducing Army Estimates. Able, clear, and succinct;
most cheering account all round; we've got the
men, we've got the guns, only want the money too.
A trifle over half a million in advance on last year's
estimates was what Stanhope asked for, a mere
nothing compared with state of perfection to which
Army being miraculously brought.
"Not very well up in Army matters," said Sir
W. Lawson, "but confess this puzzles me. Only
other day we heard from the Colonels that we
couldn't put an Army Corps in field under a month,
that our forts were ill-manned, badly gunned,
things generally gone to the dogs. Now Stan-
hope makes out that we're invulnerable and
irresistible. Like to hear Our Only General on the
subjeot."
GRandolph sitting in corner seat worrying his

day when George Hamilton brought in Navy

nervously rubbing his hands, turned from time to

old friend.

thirsting for Lord George Hamilton's blood, rudely brushed Joachjm
aside in springing on him.
But Grandolfh a great Parliamentary artist. Knows nothing so
depressing as monotony. If he had not smitten Hamilton hip and
thigh on Thursday, he might, to-night, have torn Stanhope to
tatters. Having appeared with success in one character on Thurs-
day, judged it best to select another for Monday. Accordingly,
bespattered Stanhope with praise. Declared he had never lis-
tened to a statement of the kind with more satisfaction; resumed
seat amid murmur of grateful applause from Treasury
Bench j whilst Opposition smiled a knowing smile.
Business done.—Army Estimates.
Tuesday.—Morning Sitting to discuss Army Estimates.
Proposition being nothing more important than to vote
£5,400,000 in shape of Army wage, attendance strictly
limited. No one anything particular to say, except, per-
haps, Picton and Cremer. These high military authorities
having gone into the matter, come to conclusion that
Stanhope's proposals are quite unnecessary. So far from
increasing Army forces, Picton would decrease number
of men; moved Amendment to that effect; Cremer of
same opinion. Stanhope, having also gone into matter,
stood by his propositions, and military men taking
Sart in Debate cruelly ignored Amendment before
ommittee.
Whilst Picton speaking, Colonel Hughes, of
Woolwich, performed original and striking strategic
movement. Picton talking disrespectfully of im-
proving the make of guns when the Woolwich
Infant appeared in doorway, which he temporarily

sequences, withheld match, and Opposition escaped. But demon-
stration equally effective and weighty. "A twenty-three-tonner,
at least," said Duff, admiringly gazing over hulging proportions of
the voiceless Infant. Vote for men carried only after Closure.
Old Morality quite apologetic in moving it. "I am under the
necessity," he said, "of moving that the Question be now put."
Very different from old times, when he used to be always on the
pounce. This carried vote for men; but Stanhope wanted money
too, and urged that the few moments
remaining might be utilised for passing
vote. This was enticing opportunity
for Curse of Camborne to rise.
Thrust hands deep in trousers' pockets,
as he has seen corner men do, and,
scowling darkly around, began speech
calculated to occupy rest of sitting, and
leave Government moneyless. But this
was only Conybeare's fun; didn't
really mean to do anything, but couldn't
resist opportunity of remarking that
"the Government is a discredited and
disgraced faction, who know that they
appear in the face of publio opinion
with a halter round their necks."
Lechmere, who had first place at
evening sitting for a motion with re-
spect to public hangman, showed dis-
position to regard this as personal ques-
tion. But he was kept out of the fray,
and vote agTeed to.

him; hair cropped short, it is true, but that was matter of precau-

SPRING'S DELIGHTS."
"Spring's delights are now returning "—and though they return
somewhat slowly, as far as genial weather, flowers, early vegetables,

rooms is that they are light, spacious, and airy, that there are
comfortable seats, and that every picture is hung where it can be

pictures. At the Institute we should not be, for there are very few
bad pictures in the collection. Among the notable contributions may
be mentioned those by the President. Messrs. Keelky Halswelle,
Fulleylove, W. L. Wyllie, W. L. Thomas, Severn, Orbock,
May, C. J. Lewis, Yeend King, Edwin Hayes, Charles Catter-

over eight hundred contributions, and the show is one of the best the
Institute has collected since they have been at their present gallery.
Spring's delights also return in considerable force and variety at
the French GaUery. Mr. Wallis has reared a very attractive col-
lection of exotics in his pleasant conservatory at Pall-Mali. Though
the collection is not large, it is choice, and the eye does not become
weary, or the brain fatigued. Here one can emulate Mrs. Blimber,

NOTES ON THE PLAY.
A Letter about " The Weaker Sex,"
My Own Dearest Angelina,
As you begged me to see Mr. and Mrs. Kendal in the new
drama at the Court Theatre, so that I might tell you all about it, I
outraged my feelings by going to the play without you and accom-
panying Jack Chappcts
instead. Need I say that
you were never absent from
my thoughts for a moment,
and that 1 did not enjoy
my dinner at the Epicurean
Club in the least? How
can I care for anything
when you are away from
me? However, as the piece
did not begin until 8'30,
Jack and I had plenty of
time for a smoke, a cup of
coffee, and a Kiimmcl be-
fore attending the perform-
ances. The JVtaker Sex is
by Mr. Plneeo, the clever
author of Sweet Lavender,
and many excellent plays.
For the old Court Theatre he wrote The Magistrate, and two
other capital three-act farces whioh made the fortunes of the
then lessees. As Mr. and Mrs. Kendal are playing in it, I need
scarcely say that The Weaker Sex is not a three-act farce,
although I have seen those admirable artists at their very best in
such pieces as A Scrap of Paper and the Queen's Shilling. But,
as Mr. and Mrs. Kendal, I regret to add, are shortly to leave
us for America, of course it was only appropriate that they should
bid us adieu in something sad, and The Weaker Sex is sad indeed.
The story can be told in a very few words. Rather a feeble person
is jilted by Mary (subsequently Lady Vivash), goes to America,
turns poet, changes his name, and comes back to England engaged
to Rhoda, Mary's daughter. But Mary has never forgotten him,
and tells him so. Then the rather feeble person who loves Rhoda
better than Mary, and his own comfort more than either, goes back
to America, and the Curtain falls upon his never-to-be wife and his

"Six of one and two of the other.'

H How happy could 1 be with neither."
found-to-be-impossible mother-in-law weeping in one another's
arms. I believe when the piece was played in the Provinces, the
rather feeble person (who must have been weak indeed to have pre-
ferred the daughter to the mother), married Rhoda and Mary paired
off with someone else. The new ending reminded me strongly of a
pathetic little one-act drama, in which the Kendals made their mark
at the Haymarket many years ago called Faded Flowers, wherein
the hero, finding his lost love married to his dearest friend, although
still attached to himself, nobly effaced himself by accepting expatri-
ation for ever. How good Mr. Kendal was in Faded Flowers! And
how good Mrs. Kendal is in The Weaker Sex! In fact, without her
never-to-be-sufficiently appreciated assistance, I question whether
the piece would have been successful. She could not possibly have
been better, and yet, somehow, her superb acting did not bring tears
to my eyes. This was not the fault of the actress, but the play, which
■when all is said and done, is not a pleasant one. Muoh as I like your
revered Mother (to whom kindly remember me), should anything
happen to you, I do not think it would be your latest wish that I
should lead her to the altar, and sorry as I felt for Mary and Rhoda,
and even the rather feeble person, who seemed to be passing his
entire existence in making melancholy trips to America, there was
something so essentially comic in the situation, that for the life of me
I could not cry. This was a great disappointment, as I like to be
touched. Jack Chappcts was equally indifferent, but then he is not
in the least intellectual, and yawns at everything except a Gaiety
burlesque. In real life I fancy Mary would have boxed Rhoda s
ears soundly, and sent her back to school for another twelve months.

For the rest, the satire upon "Woman's Rights (which more or less
made up the remainder ot the piece), although fairly amusing, did
not strike me as particularly novel.

the contending crews, strikes us as a
happy idea full of novelty, and only
requiring, as you say, a little deter-

successfully to carry it out. You
ought certainly by this means to
manage to get a capital view of the race; though, of course.'as you
suggest, if you cannot keep up the pace, and happen to get in the
way. it may be rather embarrassing to the competitors, and may
possibly involve you in some disagreeables. No, we would not advise
you to take the River Police into your confidence. Take care to be

THE EAT OF THE LAND.
Dear Me. Punch,
I see that an effort has been made by some misguided
persons to establish a service of " Smoking Omnibuses" in London,
which perhaps might, without impropriety, be called the "Service
of Man," considering that none but members of the male sex would
use such conveyances. Now, as I habitually ride in these cumbrous
but still undoubtedly useful vehicles, I should like to suggest various
reforms in them which are sorely needed, which is not the case with
"Smoking Busses." Sorely needed! Ah! Sir, that expression
recalls to my mind many a dreadful experience of an omnibus
interior, when there have been six on one side and half-a-dozen on
the other. I myself on such occasions have been " sorely kneaded"
by the elbows of other passengers; I happen to be thin, and,
perhaps, I feel the grievance (and the elbows) more on that account.
By some mysterious law of Nature, which no philosopher has yet
explained, the persons who use omnibuses at a time of day when
they are likely to be crowded are always stout. What is the result P
The result naturally is, that an annexation of space rightfully
belonging to us thin passengers follows; these elephantine individuals
either "push us from our seats," or deposit themselves and their
adipose tissue on our laps.
To remedy this all that is required is for the Omnibus Companies
to erect a neat and compact weighing-machine at the entrance to
their vehicles, so that the moment a passenger puts his foot on the
step his correct weight would be registered on a dial. If he (or espe-
cially she) scaled over a certain number of stones, it would be the
duty of the Conductor to inform him (or her), as politely as he could,
that the conveyance was already "full inside," or that it had a oase
of measles in it, or that its journey ended at the next street—or
whatever other excuse for non-admission his ingenuity and menda-
city might suggest. Then there might be special roomy omnibuses
constructed to meet these painful cases of corpulence, into which no
thin person might intrude. But, for the convenience of the public,
I would really suggest that the motto for ordinary busses should be,
"Abandon fat, all ye who enter here!"
I have a good many other reforms to mention, but perhaps the
above will be as much as your readers can digest at one sitting, so I
will for the present subscribe myself, dear Mr. Punch, as yours
devotedly, Eight-Stone-Six.
"When the Chevalier, Sir Vernon Haecouet, rode full tilt at the
A [tornr.y-0 enekal, he aimed a blow at him which was intended to
cut down his opponent's salary. Fortunately for Sir Richard, it
failed; but, at the moment, there was a thrill of excitement in the
Ladies' Gallery—the fans were agitated; and yet, in the absence of

That Eel he wunk, and arnsered, "Yah! you

The hefforts of the Elephant were huge,
Brave boys!
But they didn't, somehow, seem for to avail.
He trumpeted and snorted,
And he trampled and cavorted;
But he couldn't hold that wriggler, head or
tail,
Brave bovs!
He couldn't hold that wriggler, head or tail!
For he sinuously slithered, slopped and
slipped,
Brave boys!
Till the Elephant almost began to feel,
That although the Elephant
Is a ponderous giant.
He is scarce the sort of brute to cotch a Eel,
Brave boys!
He is scarce the sort of brute to cotch a Eel!
Then that Elephant he ups and says, says he,

But howe'er he twist and squirm"

"I shall cotch the wriggler yet—by means of
sand,"
Brave boys!
"You cannot hold a Eel, except with sand!"
So a basket of fine silver sand he gets,
Brave boys!
With a view to cotch that slithery Silver Eel.
Toes and trunk he then dips in it,
And, says he, "In half a minute

"I shall have you, Mister Eel; how do you

But, in spite of grab and clutch,
He finds ne can't do much,
With his Elephantine toes against a Eel,

With his Elephantine toes against a Eel!
A quick grab! a slick grab!! He's ours!!!

When—fwish! The thing's like lubricated

No sport could well be grander

But—he hasn t cotched that Eel,

No, he hasn't yet cotched that Eel.'
A SONG BEFORE SUNRISE.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

DUE SOUTH.
Last few Day at Monte Carl*.
Thb winning of one five-frano piece brightens existence. The
loss of sixty sours it. Such is life at Monte Carlo.
One more Attempt.—At first table on the left. "Good business,"
says Tom Whiffler, showing me a handful of notes, "just played
three coups. Two thousand francs. Not bad, in five minutes, eh?"
"What did you go on?" I inquire, earnestly.
"I went on the dozens. First dozen, then middle dozen. Middle
dozen," he adds, " was first-rate," which sounds as if he were talking
of oysters. And off he goes, the lucky chap, nodding airily to me,
and chortling in his joy."
Think I '11 try the middle dozen." Difficult to find a place, so
crowded. I notice several people
here, whom I had always under-
stood, were "anything but well-
off," playing with piles of notes
and heaps of gold. How do they
do it?
"Oh," Johitnte Spofferd ex-
plains, "they're playing with the
Bank's money." Yes, but how did
they get the Bank's money? 1
can t. On the contrary, the Bank
gets mine.
Squeezing myself in olose to a
croupier, I present him with two
five-franc pieces, and request him
in the sweetest possible tone,—all
novices address the croupiers in
the sweetest tone, possibly with
the idea of ingratiating them-
selves with them, and bo squaring
it somehow, as if being on speaking
terms with a croupier could assist
Cooks Tourists. you to win>_t8 put one on the "six
derniers," and the other on "douze premier." Fifteen turns up,
and I 've lost. Then I try 19 en plein, and the first Bix, and again
I lose, whereupon I change to a transversal which inoludes 19 (1 've
a fancy for 19), and impair. Trente-trois turns up. Out of it again.
Whereupon I give up my fanoy for 19 and leave it. Immediately up
it comes! and this happens also with trente-trois.
Lost sixty franos. Time to go and dress for dinner. Chilly air.
They cover up all the flowers and shrubs at 4 p. ic. So the beauty
of the place is artificially kept up. North-east wind. Queer sort of
sunset. Seen sunsets twice as good as this in England, when 1
hadn't lost sixty francs. Meet Dohdlt Tapp going to his hotel, "The
Paris," to dinner. How has he done to-day f Any good? No,
Dobdly lias lost.
"Beastly place," he says, "and so cold too, eh?
I remark that there is an odd sort of sunset.
"Ah!" replies Dordly, "that is a queer sunset. Rum colour. I
remember a sunset exactly like that the night before the earthquake.
1 shouldn't be in the least surprised if there wasn't a tremblement de
terre to-night. There's one comfort, this place felt it less last time
than any other on the Riviera. Still it's not pleasant. If I'd won,
I should be off to-night, but I must have another turn at the tables.
Ugh! Horribly cold! " and he shivers—he has a tremblement all
over him—and hurries off.
One more Attempt at the Tables, after Dinner.—Luok turns. I
say to Mrs. Wetherby (who has had wonderful luck and made
^ £1500), " Shall I put en plein on 32 P"
She replies quickly, "Yes!" It turns
up. 32! by all that's lucky t
"I told you I should bring you
luck," she says, as I receive thirty-
five times my stake, whioh was only
five francs—[ah, why didn't she tell
me to put on eight louis?]—and so
pocket one hundred and seventy-five
francs, that's seven pounds, in a second,
merely for risking four shillings and
twopence. This is exhilarating. This
is the air of Monaco. I ask Mrs.
Wethekbt, as she is so lucky, to stand
by me, and give me some more tips.
"An!" she replies, smiling, "I'm
afraid my luok has gone. I don't feel
as if I could advise you oorrectly
again."
"Shall I leave it on?" I ask, allud-
ing to my five-franc piece, which is still lying on the 32.
'1 think I should," Bhe answers. "You may as well leave it on."
But though her tone no longer inspires me with confidence, yet I
leave it on; but, rien ne va plus, and the croupier takes it off. I '11


take myself off. I '11 be satisfied with this for to-night. Let us
regale ourselves. Really nothing is so easy as winning. I meet
friends. I tell them, seriously, as if it were a feat of dexterity or a
well-calculated stroke of business, requiring great acumen and
shrew, sharp clear-headedness, how, without any system, I put en
plein on 32, and it turned up.
"Had you got the maximum on?" asks Doubly Tapp, who has
had a fair evening of it.
"No," I reply, carelessly; "no, I hadn't got the maximum on.
Only a small stake." I don't tell him it was merely a five-franc
piece. Probably my one bit of luck will be magnified into thousands,
as any one, who subsequently tells the story, may credit me with
having put on any stake that suits his fancy.
Eight louis in my purse, and a lot of five-franc cart-wheels in
my pocket. We regale. Dobdly has won, he says, a hundred.
Johnnie Spofferd at once decides that Dobdly shall stand treat.
"How about the earthquake?" I ask Dordly.
He has forgotten all about it. "Earthquake?" he asks, "What
earthquake?" I remind bim of the melancholy forecast he made
only a few hours since. "Oh!" he exclaims, there's not a chance
of one. I thought over it again, and now I remember it was quite
a different sunset when we had the last earthquake. Besides, with
such a lovely night! What stars! what a moon!"
We agree—Johnnie Spofferd, too, who has won a trifle—that
Monte Carlo is a beautiful place, and that the nights are magnificent.
"I like this place," says Johnnie Spofferd—"it's so foreign.
One couldn't do this sort of thing in London." It is half-past mid-
night, and Johnnie, wearing a soft felt hat, cocked very much on
one side, is perched on a high stool
in front of the bar,—not at "Zero's,"
but "chez Peters." He has just
finished a plate of devilled oysters, and
is now drinking stout, and enjoying a
pipe. No, certainly, we—when we come
abroad — manage these things better in
France, in the Sunny South. But why
travel all the way to Monte Carlo, in
order to sit on a high stool in a
publio-house, to eat devilled oysters,
to drink stout, and to smoke a pipe?
We discuss this walking baok to the
hotel (1 a.m.), and Johnnie Spofferd's „En lein »
opinion, freely expressed, is that " he's P •
blowed if he don't think that the nights at Monte Carlo are about
the best part of the amusement."
I find out that whenever Dordly Tapp has had a bad time at the
tables, he becomes an alarmist. I meet him next day with the
longest face possible. What's the matter?
Matter, my dear fellow? Haven't you heard?"
"No, I haven't. What is it?"
"My dear fellow, there's measles and scarlet fever all over the
place. We 're going to pack up and be off at once."
"Really? It's very sudden. How did you hear all about it?"
"Oh, everyone's talking of it. Two or three persons died yester-
day. And the place has no drainage. It's really too bad. I shall
be off. Good-bye."
I confess I can hardly believe it, but I can't help repeating to
several people what Dordly Tapp has told me. No; they've not
heard anything about it. but nothing is more likely. Johnnie
Spofferd remembers to have heard a whisper about it before he
arrived. Uncle Tamplin can't recall where he also has heard some
rumour of the sort. And so within an hour or so there will be a
scare sufficient to clear Monte Carlo.
"Well," I inform Uncle Tamplin, "Dordly Tapp and his wife
have paoked up and are going off." And this I subsequently hear
him repeating to his sister and niece, who at once commence the
study of Bradshaw, with a view to as speedy a return as possible.
Next afternoon, going down to the Casino, I meet Mr. and Mrs.
Dobdly Tapp. He and his wife are beaming with joy. "Halloa, not
gone!"
"Gone!" he cries, "No; why should I go? Bless you, I've just
been and won two thousand louis. Shall stay here any length of
time."
"Well," I say, "but the measles or scarlet fever "——
"Oh, yes," he returns, in an offhand manner, "I did hear some-
thing about it, but my wife inquired and found it wasn't true."
Mrs. Dordly confirms this statement with an emphatic nod. "Oh,"
continues Dordly, "it's all right. Monte Carlo's the healthiest place
in the world."
"But you said yesterday that there was no drainage?"
"Did I! Ah, yes, so I did."
"But I asked two Doctors," interposes Mrs. Dordly, coming to
her husband's relief, "and they both Bay that where there are smells
there is no danger, and there are lots of smells here; so it's all right.
They explained about the gases, but I don't understand it. And,"
she goes on, "wasn't 1 lucky, while Dordly was winning his two

thousand, I made a hundred louis, all out of a poor little five-franc
piece to start with! I do like Monte Carlo! Au retoir.'"
"Ta! Ta! au plaisir '. " says Dordly, jauntily, as they go into the
Grand, where they have a dinner-party.
I return to Uncle Tamplin and explain. The ladies call on Mrs.
Dordly Tapp, and hear from her the Doctors' account of the
salubrity of Monte Carlo, and in another hour or two the scare will
be heard of no more—that is, not until some one has lost heavily,
and is in a general way disgusted with everything and everybody.

To the Melancholy Memory op
The Metropolitan Board of Works.
It was an Unfortunate Institution.
Flushed, in the Earlier Years of its Existence,
with a Laudable Ambition
To Command the Respect and Admiration of the Ratepayers,
It Gave an Embankment to the Thames,
Drained London,
And suddenly showed the World
How Jobbery could be elevated to the Level of the
Fine Arts;
Then Fighting to the End, it was more anxious
To leave an Inheritance of Spite to its Successor,
Than to retire from the Scene of its Late Labours with
Dignity to itself.
Unwept, Unrepentant, yet Unhung,
It has Passed for Good and Ate to that Oblivion
From which it is Possible the More Thoughtful and
Philosophical Ratepayer
May Think it would have been as Well,
For the Interests of Municipal Honesty,
That it had Never Emeboed.
"No Love Lost!"
(At the Gaiety Theatre.)
Away flew Love! But, Love's wings clipped,
Back to England Love was shipped.

MR. PUNCH'S MODEL MUSIC-HALL SONGS.
No. I.—The Patriotic.
This stirring ditty—so thoroughly sound and practical under a
its sentiment—has been specially designed to harmonise with the
recently altered tone of Music-Hail audiences, in which a spirit ot
enlightened Radicalism is at last happily discernible. It is hoped
that, both in rhyme and metre, the verses will satisfy the require-
ments of this most elegant form of composition. The Song is intended
to be shouted through music in tie usual manner by a Singer in
evening dress, who should carry a small Union Jack carelessly thrust
inside his waistcoat. The title is short but taking:—
ON THE CHEAP!
Firtt Verte.
Of a Navy insufficient cowards croak, deah boys'
If our place among the nations we 're to keep.
But with British beef, and beer, and
hearts of oak, deah boys !—
(With enthusiasm.) We can make a shift
to do it—On the Cheap!
Chorus.
(With a common-sense air.) Let us
keep, deah boys! on the Cheap,
While Britannia is the boss upon
the deep.
She can wollop an invader, when he
comes in his Armader,
If she's let alone to do it—On the
Cheap!
Second Verse.
{Affectionately.) Johnny Bull is just as
plucky as he teas, deah boys!
(With a knowing wink.) And he's wide awake—no error!—not asleep;
But he won't stump up for ironclads—becoB, deah boys!
He don't see his way to get 'em—On the Cheap!
Chorus.
So keep, deah boys! On the Cheap,
(Gallantly.) And we '11 chance what may happen on the deep!
For we can't be the losers if we save the cost o' cruisers,
And contentedly continue—On the Cheap!
Third Verse.
The British Isles are not the Continong, deah boys!
(Scornfully.) Where the Johnnies on defences spend a heap.
No! we 're Britons, and we 're game to jog along, deah boys!
(With pathos.) In the old time-nonoured. fashion—On the Cheap!
Chorus.
(Imploringly.) Ah! keep, deah boys! On the Cheap;
For the prieewe 're asked to pay is pretty steep.
Let us all unite to dock it, keep the money in our pocket,
And we '11 conquer or we '11 perish—On the Cheap!
Fourth Verse.
If the Tories have the cheek to touch our purse, deah boysj!
Their reward at the elections let 'em reap 1
They will find a big Conservative reverse, deah boys!
If they can't defend the Country—On the Cheap!
Chorus.
They must keep, deah boys! On the Cheap,
Or the lot out of office we will sweep!
Bull gets rusty when you tax him, and his patriotic maxim
Is, " 1 '11 trouble you to govern—On the Cheap!"
Fifth Verse (this to be sung shrewdly).
If the Gover'ment ain't mugs they '11 take the tip, deah boys)!
J ust to look a bit ahead before they leap,
And instead of laying down an extry snip, deah boys!
They '11 cut down the whole caboodle—On the Cheap!
Chorus (with spirit and fervour).
And keep, deah boys! On the Cheap;
For we ain't like a bloomin' lot o' sheep.
When we want to "parry bellum,"*
[ Union Jack to be waved here.
You may bet yer boots we '11 tell 'em!
But we '11 have the " bellum" "parried "-On the Cheap!
This song, if sung with any spirit, should, Mr. Punch thinks,
cause a positive/i/rc/re in any truly patriotic gathering, and possibly
go some way towards influencing the decision of the country, and
consequently the fate of the Empire, in tie next General Elections.
In the meantime it is at the service of any Champion Music Hall
Comique who is capable of appreciating it.

LINES ON BASE-BALL.
{By an Aesthetic and Sentimental Young Lady.)
I FEEL THAT I COULD WATCH BASE-BALL If BUT THE PLAYERS WOULDN'T FALL
With interest, and even passion— In that extraordinary fashion I
THE BEWILDERED BUTLER.
Oh dear! This is getting too dreadful!
A decent old buffer like me.
With a heart full of care, and a head full
Of family business, you see,
Can not be expected to stand all this shine,
And yet do his duty, as I would do mine.
A noisier lot o'er the bottle
I never have seen in my life.
Each other they threaten to throttle,
There's nothing but shindy and strife!
And as for myself, I am always in dread
Of kicks on my shins and of boots at my
head.
I can't think it part of my duty
To serve as a cockshy all round.
That 'Arcourt—ah I he is a beauty 1
That Tanner—oh! ain't he a 'ound ?—
Are always, whatever I do, at full pelt,
Till my pitiful case e'en a Labby might melt.
The House is just getting too awful,
The guests seem eternally " screwed."
They always were jeory and jawful,
But now they 're so doosedly rude.
In vain I smile sweetly, in vain I speak fair,
Only twig my new necktie, just look at my
hair!
For an old and respectable Butler
To be lammed by a Labby's too bad.
Then Morley—his insults are subtler,
But make me feel equally mad.
E'en Gladstone, who ought to know better,
will try
To land me a cork in the eye, on the sly.
Confound it!—(I trust that's not swearing,
'Tis not Old Morality's line !)—
This treatment is getting past bearing,
I really shall have to resign.
My duty I feel is—by Jingo! there goes!
A boot in my back and a tray on my toes!
A more aggravatin' young fellar
Than Tim I declare I ne'er knew.
I'm proud of the famous old cellar,
I've no fault to find with the " screw;"
But they break half my bottles, the best in
the bin,
When they 're oockshying me. It's a shame
and a sin!
I'm a Butler of worth, fine-old-crusted,
Not one of your champagny sort.
But steady, and quite to be trusted,
As mellow and mild as old port.
But, dash it, I will not be greeted with hoots,
And pelted with bottles, and battered with
boots 1
I really shall have to give warning,
If this sort of shindy goes on.
I '11 give Master the tip in the morning;
I think they '11 regret when I'm gone.
I '11 stick to my dnty as long as I can,
But there's still some pride left in the Simple
Old Man.
And yet—well, I'm nuts upon Master,
At home with the bin and the tray.
'Tis the guests who bring row and disaster,
The Family beg me to Btay.
So I think I will pocket my temper, and
smile,
And hold on to my office—at least for awhile.
SONG OF THE BLA.CK SHEEP.
( Warbled by the Expostulating Peer.)
Tell me what is a " black Bheep "?
Does it mean a lack of nous f
On the Benches going to sleep P
Never entering the House f
Living p'raps beyond one's means?
Having lots of unpaid bills?
Going too much behmd the scenes?
Selling advertised Quack Pills P
Coming quite the City dab,
Speculating in a shop P
Starting a spry HanBom cab?
Singing at a Monday Pop P
Whist,— with cards hid up your sleeve?
"Getting at" a favourite none?
Settling day mere make believe,
Till you 're warned off every course?
Coming out with a decree
Granted in a oertain Court P
With umbrellas making free,
Doing things " you didn't ought!"
Piling up a sorry heap?
Is this being " a Black Sheep "?
Is so, the wool that's on my oack,
As yet is not precisely—black!
The Last of tile Barons was in a happy
vein when trying the breach of promise case,
Miss Smith v. Mr. Avery, the butler, who
looked uncommonly glum when the verdict
was £70 to Miss Smith, the laundress.
"Avery man in his humour!" the merry
Baron is reported to have said to himself—an
excellent audience—as he quitted the Bench.

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
February 8.—It does seem hard I cannot get good sausages for breakfast.
They are either full of bread or spice, or are as red as beef. Still anxious about
lie £20 I invested last week by Lupin's advice. However, Cummings has done
the same.
February 9.— Exactly a fortnight has passed, and I have neither seen, nor
heard from, Oowino respecting his extraordinary conduct in asking us round to
his house and then being out. In the evening Carrie
was engaged marking a half-dozen new collars I had
purchased. I '11 back Carrie's marking against any-
body's. While I was drying them at the fire and Carrie
was rebuking me for scorching them, Cummings came
in. He seemed quite well again, ana chaffed us about
marking the collars. I asked him if he had heard from
Oowino, and he replied that he had not. I said I should
not have believed that Gowing could not have acted in
such an ungentlemanly manner. Cummings said, "You
are mild in your description of him; I think he has acted
like a cad." The words were scarcely out of his mouth
^, <—znrJ^t*1] ~' when the door opened, and Gowing putting in his head
said, "May Icomeinf I said, "Certainly. Carrie said
very pointedly, "Well, you are a stranger." Gowing
said," Yes, I've been on ana off to Croydon during the last fortnight." I could
see Cummings was boiling over, and eventually he tackled Gowing very strongly
respecting his conduct last Saturday week. Gowing appeared surprised, ana
said, " Why, I posted a letter to you in the morning announcing that the party
was 'off, very much off'." I said, "I never got it." Gowing, turning to
Carrie, said, I suppose letters sometimes miscarry, don't they, Mrs. Carrie?"
Cummings Bharply said, "This is not a time for joking. I had no notice of the
party being put off." Gowing replied, "I told Footer in my note to tell you.
as I was in a hurry. However, I '11 inquire at the Post Office, and we must
meet again at my place." I added that I hoped he would be present at the
next meeting. Carrie roared at this, and even Cumminqs could not help
laughing.
February 10, Sunday.—Contrary to my wishes, Carrie allowed Lupin to
persuade her to take her for a drive in the afternoon in his trap. I quite
disapprove of driving on a Sunday, but I did not like to trust Carrie alone

with Lupin, so I offered to go too. Lupin said, "Now,
that is nice of you. Guv., but you won't mind sitting
on the back seat of the oart P" Lupin proceeded to put
on a bright blue coat that seemed miles too large for
him. Carrie said it wanted taking in considerably at
the baok. Lupin said, " Haven't you seen a box-coat
before? You can't drive in anything else." He may wear
what he likes in the future, for I shall never drive
with him again. His conduct was shocking. When
we passed Highgate Archway, he tried to pass everything
and everybody. He shouted to respectable people who
were walking quietly in the road to get out of the way;
he nicked at the horse of an old man who was riding,
causing it to rear; and, as I had to ride backwards, I
was compelled to face a gang of roughs in a donkey-
cart, whom Lupin had chaffed, and who turned and fol-
lowed us for nearly a mile, bellowing, indulging in
coarse jokes and laughter, to sav nothing of occasionally
pelting us with orange-peel. Lupin's excuse, that the
Prince of Wales would have to put up with the same sort
of thing if he drove to the Derby, was of little consolation
to either Carrie or myself. Frank Mutlar called in
the evening, and Lupin went out with him.
February 11th.—Feeling a little concerned about Lupin,
I mustered up courage to speak to Mr. Perkupp about
him. Mr. Perkupp has always been most kind to me,
so I told him everything, including yesterday's adven-
ture. Mr. Perkupp kindly replied, There is no neces-
sity for you to be anxious, Mr. Pooter. It would be
impossible for a son of such good parents to turn out
erroneously. Remember he is young, and will soon get
older. I wish we could find room for him in this firm."
The advice of this good man takes loads off my mind.
In the evening Lupin came in. After our little supper
he said—" My dear parents, I have some news, which
I fear will affect you considerably." I felt a qualm
come oyer me, and said nothing. Lupin then said, "It
may distress you—in fact, I'm sure it will—but this
afternoon I have given up my pony and trap for ever."
It may seem absurd, but I was so pleased, I imme-
diately opened a bottle of port. Gowing dropped in just
in time, bringing with him a large sheet, with a print of
a tail-less donkey, which he fastened against the wall.
He then produoed several separate tails, and we spent
the remainder of the evening trying blindfolded to pin
a tail on in the proper place. My sides positively ached
with laughter when I went to bed.
February 12.—In the evening I spoke to Lupin about
his engagement with Daisy Mutlar. I asked if he had
heard from her. He replied, "No; she promised that
old windbag of a father of hers that she would not com-
municate with me. I see Frank Mutlar, of course.
In fact he said he might call again this evening."
Frank called, but said he could not stop, as he had a
friend waiting outside for him, named Murray Posh,
adding, he was quite a swell. Carrie asked Frank to
bring him in. He was brought in, Gowtng entering at
the same time. Mr. Murray Posh was a tall fat young
man, and was evidently of a very nervous disposition, as
he subsequently confessed he would never go in a
Hansom cab, nor would he enter a four-wheeler until
the driver had first got on the box with his reins in
hands. On being introduced, Gowing, with his usual
want of tact, said, "Any relation to 'Posh's three-
shilling hats'?" Mr. Posh replied, "Yes; but please
understand, I don't try on hats myself. I take no active
part in the business." I replied, "I wish I had a
business like it." Mr. Posh seemed pleased, and gave a
long but most interesting history of the extraordinary
difficulties in the manufacture of cheap hats. Murray
Posh evidently knew Daisy Mutlar very intimately
from the way he was talking of her, and Frank said to
Lupin once laughingly, "If you don't look out, Posh
will cut you out." When they had all gone, I referred
to this flippant conversation, and Lupin said sarcasti-
cally, "A man who is jealous has no respect for himself.
A man who could be jealous of an elephant like Murray
Posh could only have a contempt for himself. _ I know
Daisy. She will wait ten years for me, as I said before.
In fact, if necessary, she would wait twenty years for me.'"
Radicals used to stigmatise their Conservative oppo-
nents as "bigoted Tones." At the present time the
Ministerial Bench maybe fairly described as " Pigotted
Tories."— Vide " Webster's Dictionary," New Edition.

It seems strange to "Co." that he should have to write

Fact or Fancy P—A meeting of persons oonnected
with the " corn and milling interests" was lately held at
the Corn Exchange Tavern, Mark Lane. This accounts
for the revival of Pugilism as evidenoed by the merry
little mill that came off quite pleasantly, without any
unpleasant police interference, ten days or so ago. But
how is "Corn" mixed up with itP Well, this may be
also in the interests of the Ring, that is, of some sort of
Rinfj. "The Milling Interest" would imply a revival of
Pugilism. To be sure, the ideas suggested, as above,
may seem to be somewhat mixed.

House of Commons, Monday, March 18.—
Cross-examination of Ministers recommenced to-
day. Home Secretary and Chiep Secretary
have high old time. Booing Balfour in Ireland
having been put down by the military, horse and
foot, baiting Balfour in Parliament goes on
merrily. Gladstone, Morley, and Harcourt
put questions from Front Bench. Harcourt's
long training at the Bar suggests to him desira-
bility of moving that all witnesses not under
examination shall leave the Court. Home
Secretary, he thinks, should withdraw whilst
Balfour is put to the question. On reflection
recognises inconvenience of the arrangement.
Would utterly foil those brilliant movements by
which, having drawn the admission from Balfour
that he approved Dr. Barr sending a letter to the
Times, he swoops down on Home Secretary
and asks him whether he reproved Dr. Barr for
publishing a letter corrected by Chief Secre-

resembling eaoh other, inasmuch as no progress made with Supply,
Jennings s gentle heart was touched. Postponed Amendment, and
saved up speech. Has got hold of a capital subject, and deserves
encouragement. Shall back him up myself on parallel lines. Mean
to take up the subject of the llat Catcher. Just handed in Notice of
Motion, which will appear on paper to-morrow.
"Tom-, M.P. To reduce the Vote for the Royal Palaces by the
sum of £18, being the salary and emoluments of the Rat Catchers at
the Royal Palaces of Buckingham and Windsor."
Buckingham Palace man nas £8 a year and residence; Windsor
Castle dignitary runs up to £10. These sums paid year after year
during present reign. Shall move for Return, going back to 1837,
showing how many rats have been caught per annum per Palace.
Not quite the breed for the business myself, but I know a friend
who occasionally indulges in the rat business, and who would, if he
could be induced to devote his attention to the affair for twelve
months, not leave a rodent on the premises. Why should British
taxpayer, in addition to other burdens, pay £18 a year for rat-
catchers, when there are thousands of unemployed dogs starving in
our streets? No desire to set class against class, but here is inde-
fensible incursion upon the rights of a not unimportant portion of
the community.
[These are quotations from my speech; look a little bald, perhaps,
as they stand, but shall work them up. Believe Habcourt's very
best impromptus don't look any better at first.]
Morning Sitting; spent it in discussing whether and when we
we shall take Vote on Aocount. Old Morality wants it on at
once, and done with. Opposition burning with desire to discuss it;
but, before they begin, want to know when they will be expected to
finish f On this, talk for four hours. Habcourt takes full share,
in spite of engagement at Lambeth Baths to-night to deliver set
oration. Meet him going out; condole with him; tell him his
health too precious to the country to be trifled with. He says
"Yes," but doesn't mind sacrificing himself for public weal.
"Besides, dear boy," he whispers in my ear, it suits me exactly.
Should like every day to make a speech or two in Commons, and
address at night publio meeting; say there all the things I cannot
say in House. Don't you see P" Business done.—Hardly any.
Thursday.—Occasionally words pass between Irish Members and
Balfoub. They boo him; he intimates state of feeling with respect
to them not altogether inspired by respect. But these only little
affectations of manner. Deep underneath runs stream of affection
binding Chief Secretary and Irish Members. They cannot bear him
out of their sight; grudge every moment that parts them. To-
night Balfoub a little late in taking seat. Irish Members looked
on vacant place with yearning eyes. Tim Hkalt, not usually
regarded as emotionable man, after long wrestling, breaks down.
Cried aloud in broken voice for Balfoub, and would not be com-
forted. Had question on paper addressed to him; declined to put
it to anyone else. Other Irish Members, who had hitherto dissembled
their love, blurted it all out when Tim gave way. In vain Solicitor-
General for Ireland proffered his services. Wouldn't have him.
Balfoub, only Balfoub!
"Send for him," said Old Morality,
himself not free from emotion. "There's
something good in these Irish Members,
after all. No one, to see them baiting Bal-
four, would imagine true state of their
feelings. But man is a compound organism;
here to-day, and gone to-morrow. Indeed
nothing is quite as it seems. Have heat
and cold any effect on the barometer? Cer-
tainly not of themselves; but as cold
weather is generally dry,
or accompanied with north-
east winds, therefore the
mercury rises in cold
weather: And as warm
weather is generally moist,
and accompanied by south-
west winds, therefore the
mercury sinks in warm
weather. So it is with
the Irish Members. 'Man's
inhumanity to man makes
countless thousands
mourn.'"
Scarcely a dry eye in
assembly, when, a little
later, Balfoub entered.
An Authority, V.C. Parnellites almost leaped
at him; oheered vociferously. Immediately after began banging
him about the head, pinching him, pulling his hair, and otherwise
maltreating him. But that's their way.
"They're like women," says Fbaseb, V.C, an authority on the


subject; "petulant, puling, but passionately devoted. Scratch your
face in the morning, and hang round your neck as the dusk of

torney-Genebal accommodated with seat

on reminiscences of occasional practice at

made up for omission by assuming his most
funereal manner. Draped himself in woe,

have been more severely self-righteous,
more deeply pained (for Pip), more ex-
cruciatingly humiliated (for Pip), or more

his own immensity of perfection. Looking
on, one almost expected to see him stretch
out hand across table and rumple Webster's
hair the wrong way, as Uncle Pumble-
chook used to rumple Pip's. But the
table too broad; so contented himself with
making suitable gesture indicating what
he would have done if he could only have
reached the culprit. Storm rose high whilst

RICHARD HIMSELF AGAIN.
(An Imaginary Interview.)
His Majesty Xing Richard (bowing profoundly). Sire, this visit
does me infinite honour.
His Majesty King Punch [graciously). Not at all. Pray be quite
at your ease. Royal meetings are just now the fashion. I am very
pleased to see you—the more especially as I want to ask you a few
questions.
Richard. Whioh it will be my delight "and privilege to answer.
Punch. Just so. And now King Dick, die mini, when it first
occurred to you to assume the Royal Dicknity. I imagine that at the
Lyceum you re-
presented two
1 gentlemen at once.
Richard. I did,
Sire. I subse-
quently became a
French Baron,
and a little later a
German Prince.
In the ordinary

tion, I have now
arrived at the
rank of a Mon-

Punch. Youare

you success. But

ThelShadelof Henry. Richard, I have a
vivid recollection of the performance of my talented friend, Henry
Irving, who also has some claim to the title of Duke of Gloucester,
has he not?
Richard. Undoubtedly,—at the Lyceum. I feel sure that Henry
Irving must have been greatly gratified at the success which attended
in so marked a degree the dual impersonation to. which you, Sire,
have so kindly referred.
Punch. Assuredly! I believe you have taken trouble to represent
Shaxspeare's great tragedy worthily in every detail. (Richard
bows.) This being so, will you kindly
inform' me why the two Bishops who
attend you immediately before your
interview with the Lord Mayor of
London, wear white tea-gowns?
Richard. To mark the eccentricity
of their characters. It is obvious that
they must be very quaint ecclesiastics
to spend their time in discussing
theology with hump-backed Dick.
Punch. I see! But did
the Bishop of Ely usually
go about in the gorgeous
but eccentric robes he wears
in the Counoil Chamber?
Richard. Yes, I think
so, and that gives the point
to my jest in sending him
in his magnificent get-up
to go and pick strawberries
in Holborn.
Punch. I perceive that
you have given the matter
most careful attention.
But why do the other
Members of the Council
huddle up in a corner
round a table where they
can be scarcely seen?

or Twopence coloured?'
Richard. Firstly, because they are afraid of me; and secondly,
because the stage is left more at liberty for the perambulations of
personages of greater dignity.
Punch. Thank you! Do you know whether America was discovered
before the Tudor period?
Richard. I fancy that Columbus landed on trans-Atlantic soil for
the first time in 1492. about seven years after the Battle of Bosworth.
Punch. That is also my impression. Then how comes it that
Stanley speaks with an accent that suggests that he must be a
citizen of the United States P
fill you then kindly suggest to him—among
i of which, when I have an nourortwo to spare.
Richard. It is a new reading, and triumphantly proves that Sblak-
SPEARE was not for an age, but for all time.
Punch. I am obliged to you 1 Will you teU me who stage-manages
the tragedy in which you so frequently take part?
Richard. A gentleman in whom I have the greatest possible con-
fidence—Mr. Richard Mansfield. I consider him my alter ego, the
Dr. Jekyll to my Mr. Hyde.
Punch. I see! Will
several other matters of
I could give you a list,—that if the rafters painted to resemble solid
timbers in the Council Chamber were not ^c«^
visibly stirred by every draught, the illu-
sion would be more complete and con-
vincing?
Richard. Certainly, Sire; but do you
really think while Rwhard is on the stage
there are eyes for aught else?
Punch. I really do. For instance, I can
imagine no better representative of dear
little Edward the Fifth—the Shakspearian
Little Lord Fauntleroy, just a size larger,
—than Miss Bessie Hatton. When she
was on the stage, I really quite lost sight
of Your Majesty. She is a young lady of
the greatest promise,—the clever child of
a clever father,—and is sure to rise in the
profession she has adopted. She bears
herself with dignity, tenderness, and grace,
and her elocution is irreproachable. Then
Miss Carlotta Leclercq as the Queen-
Mother is good,—but a little inclined to
overdo the keening (no, the Edmund- 1
Keaning you do not overdo),—and Mr.
Norman Forbes is most mirtli-provoking A Norman (Fortes) Knight,
as Catesby. why not «°g»ge him for
Richard. Is he not, Sire! Especially "ext ^•* Mayor's Show-
when he has to walk about in armour, » ""^'
giving forth quaint sounds in the last Act! Oh, he would be the
death of me, did I not die by the sword of Richmond.
Punch. Mr. Luigi Lablache, as the Breton Masher of the period,
Richmond, throws a new light on the character. And now, as to
yourself?
Richard. Ah, Sire, your conversation is indeed becoming
interesting. Have you anything to suggest?
Punch. Why, yes. In your dual part of Jekyll and Hyde you
were weirdly successful. Don't you think the Shakspearian play
would be even more attractive than it is, were you to double Richard
with Richmond, and arrange to fight single-handed?
Richard {ecstatically). A revelation! You will come to see
Richard again?
Punch. I will, when you give practical effect to my suggestion.
Till then, farewell. [Exit.
Richard. Adieu! (He ponders.) If I played Richmond too!
The idea is magnificent! Now, let me see,—if I do, 1 must, of course,

"IS CHIVALRY POSSIBLE?"
To the Editor.
Sib,—I should think it is! I went to a Matinee in my
capacity of Dramatic Critio to_ the First-floor Gazette,
and beheld a purely astonishing display of incompe-
tence. What I wrote in the journal by whioh I was
accredited is an enduring monument of critical chivalry.
The lady who was responsible for the show is young and
fair, and I did what any man with a spark of good
feeling should have done. Do you suppose I am going to
bring the flush of anger, or worse still, the tears of
wounded sensibility to the oheek of beauty? Not
quite. And the dear artiste believes all the good, and
resents all the censure, and my reward will be the airs
and graces of one more Fashionable Incompetent, and
the further debasement of the public taste whioh I am
pledged to educate and to edify.
Yours, remorselessly, Pennt Wiseman.
Deab Sib,—No! Emphatically it is not. When our
Smoking-carriages are systematically invaded by young
persons, apparently of the superior classes, who take the
company generally into their confidence by ignoring their
presence, and talking at the top of loud, hard, healthy
voices; who have all the assurance of their ill-mannered
brothers, and all the assumption of female Saviours of
Society off duty—when. Sir, such people swarm, as
they do in the fashionable suburb where I vainly seek
for culture and repose, it is time for the hollow romance
of chivalry to disappear. If they behave as men, treat
'em as men. So says,
Yours, indignantly, "Faib!" Plat.
Deab Mb. Pitnch,—At the last meeting of our General
Intelligence Society (Limited), the President related some
anecdotes of the powers of a tame donkey he once pos-
sessed, whioh, according to this President, could go fifty
miles without turning a hair: and, Sir, I once had a
tame hare which went all its life without turning a
donkey. Perhaps some other Correspondents could fur-
nish parallel instances of animal hardihood. This is not,
I fear, germane to the question, but it is much more
interesting to our Society.

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
ELEVENTH EVENING.
"I often see very curious sights," said the Moon, "and I am
seldom surprised now by anything that comes under my observation.
But I saw a scene a few nights ago which had certainly at the time
a rather extraordinary appearance. I was
looking down through the tops of some
tall windows into the bath-room of one of
your large Hospitals. Around the largest
bath, which had been filled quite up to the
brim, stood a number of persons, atten-
tively regarding the surface of the
water, to which bubbles were continually
rising. There were one or two doctors,
and some of the hospital nurses and medi-
cal students in the group, but most of the
spectators were patients who were well
enough to leave their wards. In deep
silence they gathered round, and kept
their eyes fixed on the bath with a placid
and solemn interest. I could not imagine
what it was all about at first," said the
Moon, "and I was not much the wiser
even when, on looking more carefully, I noticed that there was some-
thing in the bath—a strange creature which glittered and gleamed
through the greenish ripples, as it squatted, there at the bottom like
some huge frog. Presently I saw that it was a man. He crouched
there under water, on all fours, minute after minute, making no
sign, and still the spectators gazed, and the silence was unbroken,
except for a faint giggle now and then from one of the nurses. I
should have thought ne was drowned, if it had not been for the
composure of the onlookers, and the air-bubbles. At last, with a
splash that sent the water surging over on the floor, the man rose,
and I saw that he was dressed in a tight suit of silver spangles,
which was what had made the glitter under the water.

"For a little while he stood upright in the bath, smiling benig-
nantly all round him, his chest heaving with conscious pride, and his
face wearing the satisfied expression oi a person who has conferred a
public benefit, but who disclaims thanks in advance, and then, with
a little bow and another splash, he leaped nimbly out and made his
way to the door, amidst some applause from the medical students.
The patients, however, looked vaguely disappointed, as if they had
expected something different—though they did not seem very clear
what that was. I afterwards found," explained the Moon, "that
the man in the bath had been discharging an obligation by the only
means in his power. He was a performer who got his living by
exhibiting various feats in a glass tank, and (I suppose because he
could driuk wine and smoke cigars under water) was known as the
'Man- Fish.' He had been ill, poor fellow, and had been cured at
the Hospital—so, being a grateful Man-Fish, he had begged to be
allowed to give this exhibition to the staff and his fellow-patients, as
some return for all the kindness he had received. _ His entertainment
was, perhaps, a little monotonous—but this—considering that he had
nothing but a bath to perform in, was not the Man-Fish's fault. If
the bath had been a little bigger and the sides had been transparent,
he would undoubtedly have given more variety to the performance.
"As it was, he did all he could to prove his gratitude; and grati-
tude, I am afraid," concluded the Moon, "is not so common in
Hospital patients, that a much more conventional mode of expressing
it would not be in itself quite a remarkable circumstance."
The Headquarters of Journalism. — Count and Countess
Habtenau, alias Prince and Princess Alexander of Battcnbcrg,
are. we learnt from the Times last week, "shortly coming on a visit

news might be reasonably expected, it evidently would be that capital
of journalism yclept Pressburg.

doesn't turn up, you can congratulate
yourself on not having been such a fool as
to put on that particular number. This
can be repeated as long as you like, varying
from colour to number, and vice versa,
and visiting every table in the room.
You '11 have most of the fun, and none of
the risk. When friends and acquaintances
meet you and ask " how you 're doing?"
you can say, " You 're about as you were,"
or any other formula.
Second System.—If you like to hear
the jingle of the five-ffanc pieces, when
a you ve won them, in your pocket,—and it
« is fascinating, I admit—go to the bureau,
change a sovereign into five "cart-
wheels," and walk about jingling them,
g Visit the tables, act on the Imaginative
Players plan (First System), and when
your opinion is correct rattle your five-
franc pieces forcibly, and smile as if you'd
. won a big coup. When your opinion is
. \ n \> \\ ^xong,—don't rattle them, butpurse up
your lips, frown desperately and shake your head. When the
question is put to you, "Doing any good, eh ?" you can jingle your
coins, replying, "I've got a few left,"' and pass on.
Third System. How to reduce the Loss to a Minimum.—Put one
five-franc piece on pair and another on impair. Then your only
ohance of losing is when zero turns up. But, when this happens,
as your pieces are imprisoned for a second turn, depending upon
whioh colour comes up, you can then only lose one piece and must
gain on the other. This system includes a certain amount of excite-
ment, and leaves you quits at the end of the evening. Even with
this safest of safe Systems it is possible for you to lose both pieces;
that is, if dishonest persons are sitting near you, bold enough to
deolare that your five-frano pieces belong to them, and to pocket
them accordingly.
Last System. How not to Lose at all!—Don't play. This is too
evident to need explanation.
When you have resolved not to go into the Casino, the next best
thing is to stay outside, and watoh the Tpeople going in at any time
during the day, and coming out at eleven at night. The life and
soul of Monte Carlo is the Casino. The whole of Monte Carlo is
really the Casino. All its world is trente et quarante and roulette,
and, as Shaxspeare says, who was of course writing of Monte Carlo,
"All the men and women merely players."
They go in like lions, they come out like lambs; in many cases,
like shorn lambs.
It is midday or any time you please in the afternoon. Look at
the gamblers entering. They arrive by train, or by carriage, or 'in a
fiacre, or on foot, and up they go, like men of Dusiness bnstling
towards "the House" in Capel Court, or with that air of pre-
occupation whioh marks a new Member of Parliament who has
oome determined to catch the Speaker's eye, ascending the steps at
Westminster. A few among them saunter in, assuming listless-
ness, and a very few smartly-dressed men and women chatter and
laugh as they pause on the top step to finish their conversation,
evidently wishing to draw the line sharply between pleasure and
business. See them leaving between half-past ten and eleven, when
the Casino shuts for the night, not separately, but in groups. Some
ohatting, very few laughing, but all most decorously, as if they
were coming out of Church after a sermon, and their good name
depended on keeping up appearanoes.
After a time, whether winning or losing, life even at Monte Carlo
becomes monotonous, and, taking for granted that you have ex-
hausted all the usual excursions, your amusements are limited to
the following programme:—
1. The reading-room, where a couple of hours may be fully occu-
pied by waiting for the paper you particularly want to see. Here
also you can write letters.
2. Watching the pigeon-shooting from the terrace. This is gratis.
3. The Concert (admission free), every afternoon.
4. Watch the people entering and leaving the gambling-rooms.
5. Walking up and down the atrium, talking to friends and ac-
quaintances, and, once a day, trying to feign some curiosity as ;to
the contents of the latest telegram posted up in the hall.
6. See trains arrive; see them depart.
7. To walk down several times a day from your hotel to the Casino
with a view to consulting the clock over the portico, and then com-
paring its information with the two Railway clocks, and then with
that given by your Hotel clock: finally to regulate your own watch
a fair''
by striking i
8. Walk up to Monaco Gardens (lovely!) and back. Wonder at
the variety of smells. Try to arrive at a satisfactory solution as
to their cause, whether drainage, or harbour, or gasworks, or a com-
bination of any two or of all three.
Private Opinion of Monte Carlo in the Season.—For the robust,—
lovely, delightful. But beware the Mistral, the Wandering Mistral.
For the invalid,—lovely, seductive, treacherous I
Uncle Taplln's niece, Mabel, has been attacked by the Wandering
Mistral. She is temporarily disabled. Uncle Tap decides not to go
to Rome. Offers me his ticket there and back. 1 accept. Can I
refuse? if only to see St. Peter's? My holiday is finishing.
"You will zee," says our worthy Italian Hotel-keeper, "ze car-
nival. Do not go for ze confetti— no—forzeyjomp you in ze eye.
He 'urt." I promise him that having had quite enough of "jumping
in the eye" at the Battle of Flowers, I shall not go in for confetti-
throwing at Rome. I complain to him that last night it was actually
snowing. He reluctantly admits the incontrovertible fact; "but,
he goes on in his own peculiar English, for which he has a patent,
"ze snow," here a contemptuous shrug, "he was nozing,—he did
not lay on the floor." Beautiful expression this. But, whether the
snow lies on the floor" or not, off I go. To Rome! 0 Riviera!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The P. $■ O. Pocket Book. Why piano, when there is so much
strength about it P It is a mighty pleasant little book to read, it is
likewise brimming with useful information, therefore it would be
appropriate to call it The Pianoforte
Pocket Book, especially as there are
some notable performers who play
with great taste and expression
within its pages. For instance,
everyone will gladly listen to the
bourrie entitled "Le Canal de Suez."
by M. De Lesseps, the bright lively
gigue, "Japan," by Mr. H. W. Lucr,
the Suez Canal Sonata, by Mr.
Thomas Sutherland, the "China"
cantata, by Sir Thomas Wade (in-
valuable as a wade-mecum), and
other notable pieces by accomplished
executants. As for all the strictly
practical portion of the work, the
exact and various particulars with
regard to routes, vessels, cabins, and
outfits, it makes one desire to rush
round to Leadenhall Street at once
and immediately book places for the
"Ocean Cure." We might suggest a new motto for the Company—
"Cheva P. an' O. va sano."
The Macmillaneries continue their excellent series of revivals.
The latest is The Caged Lion by Charlotte M. Yonoe. Here it
is fresh and Yonge as ever. Also the first volume of Joror Green-
leap WHrrTiER's writings. Those who already possess a collection
of witty works, will be glad to add to it one Whittier.
The latest addition to Routledqe's Pocket Library, invaluable to
the globe-trotter, is the Third Series of The IngoUsby Legends
All who go down to the sea by the L. C. & D. Line should take with
them this little volume, containing the legend of The Brothers of
Birchington, and he will learn something about the mysterious
Re culver s, the origin of which has puzzled many besides
The Baron de Book Worms.
A Mystery.—What is "Verini's Patent Pipe?" There is no
inscription but this on its stem, and on application at more than one
tobacconist's no information could be obtained by our Private
Inquirer. Yet Mr. Punch, after three months' practical experience
of this pipe, which was mysteriously presented to him. has no hesi-
tation in affirming, or taking his oath, if necessary, that never has
he met with a pipe, not even a vocal or musical one, bo sweet and clear,
and one whioh renders the "pernicious weed" so innocuous, as does
this " Verini's Patent." In the interest of all smokers, if any pipe
ought to be puffed this should be, and so Mr. Punch gives it the
Puff direct. But whence it came, and where it is obtainable, many
besides Mr. Punch would be glad to know.

Mr. Punch Drinks Success to the Royal Aoricultural Jubilee
Show to be Held this Summer in Windsor Park.
COUNTY COUNCILDOM.
{By Our Own County Councillor.)
I fancy the proceedings of our new London Government must have
somewhat astonished the old fogies whom we have so recently super-
ceded. Why, we have laid down more grand democratic principles
for our future guidance, in the
last few weeks, than the Legis-
lature itself has ventured even
to discuss seriously in as many
years, and if some of my able
colleagues have their own way,
and they assuredly mean to try,
London will shortly be the Para-
dise of the Impecunious.
Everything that the Masses
require will be done for them,
and the whole expense'of so doing
will have to be borne by the
Classes. And as the former are
somewhat about four times the
number of the latter, the sub-
limity of the idea is at once
apparent. The poor of London
are to be re-housed, and a Medi-
cal Officer of Health is to be ap-
pointed to superintend their
sanitary condition, at a salary of
£1000 a year. He will probably earn it, despite the bold statement of
one of our most popular Members, that he had never yet met a man
worth more than £500 a year.
Our Deputy-Chairman blushed visibly at this striking assertion,
and why r
The question of properly furnishing the houses has been deferred
for the present, but we have decided that when we ask for tenders
to execute this rather extensive order, the parties tendering will be
required to show that the men they employ are paid such good wages,
and work such short hours, as are entirely satisfactory to the Trade I
No fear of the over-perspiring system prevailing under our fatherly
system.
All gates and bars in lordly Bloomsbury and elsewhere are to be at
onoe abolished, and the inclosed gardens in the many squares will
doubtless be made free to all.

In Mud-Salad Market.
And how are these glorious results to be obtained? Is it by such a
crushing weight of taxation as will greatly inconvenience the
wealthy? Certainly not. A mere trifle of thirteen pence in the
pound will suffice, for the present, to satisfy all our moderate
wants.
The mistake made by one of our'non-financial Members—caused
by thirteen pence being the tax upon coals that we mean at once to
abolish—that he much preferred paying thirteen pence in the ton
to thirteen pence in the pound, was kindly ex plained to him by our
Financial Editor. Those of us who are not eminent financiers were
as much surprised as delighted to learn that a mere trifle like this
thirteen pence in the pound, which we are about to levy on a gratified
Metropolis, will produce us a sum approaching one million nine
hundred thousand pounds, with which to commence our great work,
so anything like a cheeseparing economy would be as absurd as
unnecessary.
The verv natural remark made by one of the most jovial and good-
natured of our body was, thatwith such a sum to draw upon, why should
we not provide ourselves with needful refreshment? but the idea
was not generally approved—at any rate, not for the present; one
particularly crusty Member attributing it to the genius loci. I am
biding my time for an opportunity of proposing at onoe to abolish
the ancient nuisance of 'Mud Salad Market," and have but little
doubt of ultimate success.
From what I (father from those around me, I fancy everyone of
us has some special grievance that he intends giving his whole mind
to remedy, and, as there are some 137 of us, we shall certainly not
want for plenty of matter for discussion.
One noble idea is to constitute ourselves Commissioners for fixing
what we think to be a fair and reasonable rent to be paid for any
property, the ocoupier of which finds the present amount to press
inconveniently upon his somewhat limited resources, due account
being taken of the number of his family, and any othel circum-
stances of an interesting character; and the question is naturally
asked, Why should dissatisfied Ireland have so great an advantage
in this respect over the powerful and loyal Metropolis?
We all like our Chairman, and our Radical friends thoroughly
appreciate his preference of "Mr. Chairman" to "My Lord." As
one specially democratic Member observed, there are hundreds of
Lords, but only one Chairman of such a County Council.
Our Vice-Chairman seems scarcely fitted to control our somewhat
rude democracy, his instincts apparently lying in quite a different
direction.
Our Deputy Chairman sits trembling in the balance between
Glory and Lucre. Unpaid patriotism on the one hand, and £1500
per annum on, but not yet in, the other.
I expect to find our future proceedings interesting, important, and
even staggering.
"THE SQUEEZE OF 86."
[Mr. Francis Galton says that, "Out of 1,657 adult women of all
ages measured at the laboratory, the strongest could only exert a squeeze of
86 lb., or about that of a medium man."]
Maiden of the mighty musoles,
Then recorded, you would
be
Famous in all manly tussles,
And it's very clear to me,
That if in the aim hereafter
Any husband should play
tricks;
You would, with derisive
laughter,
Give a Squeeze of 86."
Husbands, be it Badly stated,
Have been known their wives to
whack;
You, unless you 're over-rated,
Could give such endearments
back.
Yours the task to try eorrection,
Till your husband and your
''chicks,"
Had a lively recollection
Of your " Squeeze of 86."
Light and Frivolous.—Our Other Musical Critio went to hear |
Mr. Dudley Buck's "Light of -4«wj."—He writes—" What a
beautiful name is Dudley Buok! The Light is not very bright. I
thought The Light of Asia would have been lighter than it is. My
mistake, not Deadly Buck's. 'Buck! Buck! How many fingers
do I hold up?' Well, I give him a hand as a stranger, and there-
fore 1 as a stranger bid him weloome'—which I think is a quotation
from' that oft-quoted author Shaxspbake-Passim. But, another time,
please send Classical chap to this sort of thing. Afterwards I looked
in at the Pavilion. Good show, Bessie Bellwood in great form,"
&c, &c—[Yes, another time, we will not send this one.—Ed.]
At the Opera Comique Theatre, a new J)lay, called The Panel

First Act. If this with all following upon the unwise proceeding were
omitted, it is not improbable that the result might be, or certainly
on Thursday last might have been, far more satisfactory.

No. We have not any ships ready wherewith to meet
the enemy, but we have the promise of a Fleet on paper
{dam Pair), locked up in a cupboard at the Admiralty.
Then, some of our ships are here, some are there (Id)?
Yes, some of our ships are everywhere {par tout), but
they are not here {pas ici).
Is this the little gun for the big ship?
No, this is the big ship without any gun at all {sans

Will the Admiralty send the big ship thus unarmed
into action '<
Yes, certainly; but they will order the Admiral in
Command to make a manifestation of defiance {danser le

It is a pity that the enemy's Fleet suddenly took posses-
sion of the Channel when sixteen of our Ironclads were
shut up in the dockyards for repairs, having something
done to their boilers.

Nobody saw the enemy arrive.
Will the Volunteer Artillery have to bring their guns

Yes, the Volunteer Artillery will have to bring their guns
into the battle without horses, but the Hussar Regiment
will have its deficiency of mounts supplied by the London
General Omnibus Company (Companie Ge'ni'rale).
Who, then, has the good gun?
The invader has the good gun, but we have the inferior

FRENCH ART WITH SAUCE HOLLANDAISB.
The collection of the works of the French and Dutch Romanticists
at the Dowdeswell Galleries, is well worth two or three visits, one of
which I've paid on account.—on your account and that of the public.
Why "Romanticists"? If the depicting of cows and sheep, and
poultry, "all alive 0!" of course, undressed, and au nature!, is to
make an Artist a Romanticist, then Dowdeswell's Dutchmen cer-
tainly take the first prize in this pictorial Cattle Show. Cows and
Figures, Figures ana Cows, Cows on the Heath, Cows in Water,
More Cows in more Water, Ditto with Trees, Sheep on Dowtis,
Lake with Cows, Man in a Punt and Woman with Cows, Cow-cher
de Soleil, Sheep under Trees, Landscape with Cowshed, Calf with
Cow-shedding tears, and so forth—without a single effort to depict
the Cow' jumping over the Moon, which would have been really
romantic and very effective,—for which titles consult the Catalogue—
or, as it should be called the Cattle-logue, and "when found, make
a note of." Quotation this from Captain Cuttle, quite suitable to a
Cuttle-log. There is one genuine Romanticist, but he is neither
Frenchman nor Dutchman, but of Italian extraction, as his name is
Monticelu. Pause, Visitor, before No. 10G, The Ravine, by Monti-
celli,—the Ravin' Mad, it suggests; and No. 109, The Fete Champetre,
in which there is a lady in the winning Cambridge colours, some-
what exhilarated after the Boat Race. Examine these well. Mar-
vellous colour, dabbed on anyhow, looking a trifle mouldy in places,
and a wonderful jumble of figures. I should call Monticelli The
Uncertaintist.
More in my next. But seriously, our clever young painters might
do worse than spend a few hours in these Galleries studying the
works of Millett, Corot, Meissonier, Daubigny, and Josef
Isbaels. Why "Romanticists?" Because they romantically
painted for the love of Art, and many of them, since dead, got
precious little for their pains and paintings.
In dealing with pictures, these French and these Dutch
Took, often, too little, when painting so much.
I am aware this doesn't by any means apply all round; but I've
been all round; I'm not an All-round Man, but among the Fre
and the Dutchesses I am yours,

UNREEFED CANVAS.
"March winds and April showers, bring forth Art-flowers."
True enough, and, as days lengthen, pictures become as plentiful as
crocuses in the garden, and hyacinths in the window. The Artful
Dodger goes about with his critical lantern,
as one of old did when searching for an
honest man—and enacts the part of a modern
Dodgernes, looking for a great work of Art.
As yet, he has not discovered it. Professor
G an dish would doubtless lament the absence
of 'igh hart from our exhibitions; and Mr.
John Hollingshead would tell you, with a
practical, and well-nigh aggravating blunt-
ness, that the only great work of Art was
"Niagara." Be that as it may, there are
plenty of pretty piotures at the Exhibition"
of Lady Artists at the Egyptian Hall.
Though they appear to somewnat neglect
face-painting, and penoil other things beside eyebrows, there are
many bright, honest contributions amid the collection. They have
held up the mirror to Nature, instead of devoting the looking-glass
to a more frivolous and unsatisfactory use. Among the best con-
tributions may be noted those of Mrs. Pebugini, the Misses Clara
and Hilda Montalba, Mrs. Marrable, Mrs. Joplinq, Misses H.
Macaulay, M. Naftel, Drew, M. H. Simpson, V. fl. Wyman,
R. Barton, R. F. Hensman, E. Partridge, A. E. Tuckeb, and
A. Manvllle Fenn. The Art-ful Dodger.

ESSENCE OE PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 25.—Attorney-General
again accommodated with seat in Dock.
Getting quite familiar with situation; on ex-
cellent terms with the Warders; declares he
hasn't slightest temptation to take off his
boot and throw it at head of Speaker. Can't
imagine how habitue's of the Dock occasionally
dispossess themselves of portions of their oloth-
ing, and disperse it about locality of Judge or
Magistrate. Charles Russell leads case for
Prosecution. Exceedingly severe on Prisoner.
Attorney-General, when under indictment
last Friday, gained temporary triumph by al-
leging that he had handed in a certain letter
to Russell. Now turns out that it was quite
another letter, in quite different circumstances,
handed in at quite distinct time. Original
statement made great sensation. Ministerial-
ists mad with delight. Opposition momen-
tarily checked. Attorney-General now Bays
must be mistake somewhere. If he had not
handed Russell Pigott's letter of Nov. 15,
he had given him Soames's of the 11th. Same
thing j or, if not, why not P Anvhow, "of no
material importance. Ministerialists cheered
again, almost as loud as, on Friday, they had
cheered when Attorney - General insisted
upon matter as one of primest importance.
"That's the best of the Tories," said Har-
coubt, sadly, "they always stand by their
own man. If he says a tiling's black they
cheer before the words are well out of his
mouth, and when he goes on to say 'I beg "My robust Friend."

your pardon, I meant to say it was white,' they cheer just the
Bame. Now, our fellows would as soon howl at their natural leaders
as not. Sometimes I envy Beach and Goschen. Wish I'd either
neen born into Toryism, or been able comfortably to take to it in
middle age."
Squabble went on till Nine o'clock. Little trifle of
21£ Millions to be talked about before voting. Must
needs stand over till personal question of Attobney-
Genebai settled. Then Members go off to dinner ; crowded
House melts away; about a dozen stay to talk about the
Vote. Not one per mi 11 inn sterling. Windbag Sexton as
usual on his legs. Had a finger in most people's pie at
Question Hour. Now interposes on Army Annual Bill,
Second Reading of which Stanhope proposes to take in
succession to abortive discussion on Navy scheme. Makes
speech, takes division; gives notice of Amendment in
Committee. "Sexton," I say, to Maclube, "is like the
poor. We have him always with us."
"Yes." said my robust friend, hair and
moustache curling with indignation, "and we
always shall whilst he is Lord Mayor of
Dublin. As long as Speaker, Balfoub, Old
Mobality, and other respectable Authorities
are, by virtue of his office, bound to refer to
him as the 'Right Honourable Gentleman,'
so long will Sexton continue to pop up through

Determined to
put a stop to it;
came down to-
day with ques-
tion, addressed to
Febgusson, ask-
ing what Her
Majesty's Go-
vernment are
goi ng to do with
respect to this
scandal? Fer-
gusson intimates,
in diplomatic
pnrase, that, on
the whole, Her
Majesty's Go-
vernment are
going to do no-
thing; are, in-
deed, not quite
sure whether all
the stories about
Monte Carlo that
come from Nice
are true. Gban-
dolfh, not long
back from Monte
Carlo, winks
across at Hart-
ington, who tries
to look as if he
had never been
there. Old Mo-
rality, who got through a visit to Monte Carlo quite safely, finds
opportunity, later, of meeting Samuel behind Speaker's chair.
"Know you spoke with best intentions," he said, "but are you
quite sure of your facts? Ever been to Monte Carlo? Place to spend
a happy day in, I can tell you. Most interesting proceedings in Ca-
sino. Not that I ever played, of oourse. Left that for Grandolph and
Hartington. But I looked on, and saw a thing or two. Nothing in
the world so easy as to make pot of money. Great secret is get it on
and leave it on; make a thousand pounds in a thousand minutes."
"Ah!" said Samuel, growing interested, " but how do you doit?"
"That's it," said Old Moealitt. "Nothing easier when you
know it, but, as they say in choirs and places where they sing,
you've got to know it fust. Now look here." (Samuel "looks
here" ; on back of copy of Orders where Old Moralitt rapidly
traces diagram.) Every beam of light is composed of three ooloured
rays, blue, yellow, and red. As the beam passes through the atmos-
phere A, these are separated from each other, the blue being drawn
most down, the yellow next, and the red least. As the earth with
its clouds and atmosphere turns round the pole P. in the direotion
A.C.D., any given cloud would pass first under the blue rays at B.,
then the yellow rays at Y., and then the red rays at R.; and, be
tinged by their respective colours. An observer, placed at E., just
as ne was turning into darkness towards C, would see the clouds
tinged red at It., resting upon the western horizon. You follow me?
Well it's just the same with the tables. No need to shoot yourself,
or anyone else."
Samuel walks away, pondering over these things. "Very
curious," he says; "Old Morality not flighty kind of man.
Intense air of respectability about him. A thousand pounds in a
thousand minutes! What a lot of good one could do with it. Won-
der if Grandolph and Habtington would join syndicate to try Old
Mobalitt's plan? Let me see: 'As the earth with its clouds and
atmosphere turns round the pole P.'; exactly. That seems indis-
putable. Think I'11 run over to Monte Carlo, and see with my own
eyes how things are." Business done.—Committee of Supply.
Thursday.—Government very nearly defeated to-night. All about
Constitution Hill. Those two desperate Revolutionists, Novab, and
the Grand Young Gabdneb. determined to make stand against
exclusiveness of this thoroughfare. Runs nearly parallel between
two of busiest thoroughfares of, Metropolis. A short cut from the
teeming East by Charing Cross to the fertile West. Fine broad,
tree-planted Avenue. Yet, whilst Piccadilly is blocked. Constitution
Hill left undisturbed for the solitary horseman or the occasional
brougham. Early in week Grand Young Gabdneb scribbling
message, written with his own blood, on back of envelope, summoned
Novae to midnight meeting. Novab arrived armed with Claymore;
swore solemn oath they would free Constitution Hill, or die. Come
down to-night prepared for worst. Novab led off attack. Moved to
reduce Vote for Parks and Pleasure Gardens with reference to Con-
stitution Hill. "It's restriction," said Novab, "an absurdity, and
a relic of the past."
Grand Young Gabdneb backed him up; Committee deeply moved;
Shaw Lefevbe, momentarily forgetting
absorbing attraction of his new Dead
House, flung himself into fray. Sage
of Queen Anne's Gate much cheered
by this movement on part of younger
generation. Amid enthusiastic cheers
Cavendish Bentinck declared against
Constitution Hill. Even De Lisle,
putting both feet down, was for open-
mg the thoroughfare. Plunket stood
by the Constitution and the Hill, but
was visibly alarmed. House cleared
for Division; figures read out amid
breathless excitement. For keeping
thoroughfare closed, 80; for opening it,
78. Ministerial majority reducea to
Two!
The two conspirators shook hands.
Novab overcome with emotion. Grand
Young Gabdneb still capable of articu-
lation.
"Let us," he said, "devote our lives
to this great object. Let us swear a
great oath that till Constitution Hill is
open to the people we will neither shave
nor have our hair cut. Swear!"
"Dammy!" said Novab.
Business done.—The shackles shaken
on Constitution Hill. "Putting both Feet down."
Friday Night.—This is John Bright's Day. House crowded in
every part, all drawn to do honour to the great Englishman. None
so rich or so great as not to do him reverence. Old Mobalitt
speaks first in tones of homely eloquence, well suited to occasion,
Then Gladstone rises on highest pinions of matchless eloquence,
extolling the dead orator and "his Bplendid eloquence, the loftiest
that has sounded within the walls of the House of Commons within
the present generation." Hartington lamented the departure of
one who had been to him, in peculiar degree, guide, philosopher, and
friend. Justice McCarthy, as the envoy of Ireland, brought her
mourning wreath to lay on the tomb: and Chamberlain mourned
"the Member for Birmingham." Ail admirably done, disp_layin|
the House of Commons in one of its worthiest moods, and
moments. Business done.—Lament for John Bbight.

SHOULDER TO SHOULDER, AND HEART TO ART.
On Monday, the 25th of March, the Prince and Princess of Wales
opened the new Drill Hall of that

gallant body of citizen soldiers,
Volunteers. The ceremony was
a pretty one, especially that part
of it wherein (to quote the pro-
gramme) "The Princess of
Wales and her daughters were
presented with bouquets," &c. Oi
the entertainments, it may be said
that a glimpse of their Royal
Highnesses proved a most at-
tractive item. However, there
were other features, to wit, songs
by Lieutenant Matbbick (Artists
R.V.), in full uniform, and
Mr. Edward Lloyd ; and recita-
tions by Private Brandon Tho-
mas and Mr. Lionel Brouoh,
Thomas and Maybrick. ^I^" Madam6 ^a;]
ette Stirling sang, and so did
Mr. Charles Collktte (late Lieutenant 3rd Dragoon Guards). The
card of invitation was embellished with a clever sketoh by Mr. Hobsley,
and the Drill Hall itself suggested a happy compromise between St.
Paul's Cathedral and the London Terminus of the Midland Railway. A
paper handed to the Press contained, amongst other valuable informa-
tion, the facts that the hon. architect was the Colonel of the Regiment
Commanding, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries; that
Messrs. &c, &c, were responsible for the plumbers' work, and that
the wrought-iron gas-fittings, "from the architect's design," had
been made by Messrs. &c, &o. Hon. Colonel Sir Frederick Leigh-
ton, Bart, P.R.A., was present in mufti, and a reference made in
the speech of the Prince of Wales to the advance of the corps in
prosperity during that gallant and accomplished officer's period of I
command., was received with well-merited enthusiasm. This was as
it should be. Honour to whom honour is due: and may the Artistio
Volunteers long live and prosper!

ON COMMISSION.
April 2, 3, 4.—The working days of the week have been devoted to
paying the closest possible attention to an admirable Abridgment of the
History of Ireland, by my learned friend, Sir Charles Russell. And
here let me say, in all sober seriousness, that it was comprised in a
speech that was worthy of the man and the theme—a speech that, by
itself, was sufficient to hand down the name of the Counsel for the
Defence to posterity, as one of the ablest lawyers and one of the most
eloquent orators that has ever graced the English Bar. As the great
speech has already been reported in detail in other quarters, it is
superfluous to repeat it word for word in these columns. If it were,
it might possibly occupy more space than is put, and I may say
rightly put, at my disposal. So I will content myself with repro-
ducing the manner of Sir Charles in a dramatic form, adopting
for the purpose a well-known popular oration that in the past was
left unfortunately imperfect. I do this so that those who are to
follow in the footsteps of my learned friend, and myself, at the Bar
may have the benefit of what I may perhaps be permitted to describe
as a lesson in impressively-posturing elocution.

hand outstretched, forefinger pointing to someone in the well of the
Court) married (with immense force)—married the Barber! (Long
pause, during which the Orator looks slowly and gravely round at
audience. Then, in a more conversational tone.) And there were
present the Pioinninies (Mr. Asquith touches him, he turns round,
listens, and bows thanks), and the Joblilies, and the Garyulies, and
the Grand Panjandrum himself (puts up pince-nez, and reads scrap of
paper just passed to him),—and—yes—as my learned friend, Mr.
Asquith reminds me (clasping his hands persuasively), with the little
round button at top. (Produces linen handkerchief, gazes at it,
and returns it to pocket. Considers. Then with ever-increasing
energy.) And they all fell to playing the game (right arm raised in
gesture of disgust) of catch as catch can, till (very distinctly, and
with his left hand raised to his ear and then brought down sharply)—
till the (very loud) Gunpowder!!! (long pause, and then, in a voice
broken with deep emotion, which almost sinks into a whisper at the
last word) ran out at the heels of their (very softly) boots! (Tears
and suppressed sobs in Court.)
As to the matter of Sir Charles's speech, it does not become me
to offer an opinion at this stage of the inquiry. I have already
expressed the genuine admiration I feel for my learned friend.

reported to have said,—" My Corporation proposes to take a large

Lordship also remarked, that his "Corporation was going to creep
from several centres." Whereupon Mr. Will, Q.C., M.P., asked
him "from how many centres the Corporation proposed to creep P"
(Laughter.) Where there's a Will, there's always a way of getting
a laugh with a good audience. But why wasn't Mr. Lockwood, Q..C.
(Quizzing Counsel), present to illustrate it?

THE BEASTS, THE BIRDS, AKD THE BAT.
A Modern Confabulation Concerning an Ancient Fable.
Senex. This picture, my son, illustratos an ancient Fable.
Juvenis. Ana how does dear old elisor make the story
go, Sir P
Senex (reading). "Once upon a time there was a fierce
tear waged between the Birds and the Beasts. For a
long while the issue of the battle was uncertain, and the
Bat, talcing advantage of his ambiguous nature, kept
aloof, and remained neutral."
Juvenis. Ambiguous nature. Ah! Neither Beast nor
Bird, but a little bit of both.
Senex (resuming). "At length when the Beasts seemed
to prevail, the Bat joined their forces, and appeared active
in the fight; but a rally being made by the Birds, which
proved successful, he was found at the end of the day
among the ranks of the winning party. A peace being
speedily concluded, the Bat's conduct was condemned alike
by both parties, and being acknowledged by neither, and so
excluded from the terms of the truce, he was obliged to
skulk off as best he could, and has ever since lived in holes
and corners, never daring to show his face except in
the duskiness of twilight."
Juvenis. Oh, that was the Bat's fate, was it?—accord-
ing to the Fable! "Well, no doubt it's a bit dangerous
to Keep "on the hover" too long. And yet somehow the
particular Bat in the picture doesn't quite look like a con-
finned Troglodyte, or destined dweller in a perpetual
Cave of Adullam Looks sharp enough, anyhow, and
does not look as if "the duskiness of twilight" would
suit it long. He's playing a risky game, no doubt; but
whether he's as blind as nis proverbial type, is just the
question, my dear Senex.
Senex (severely). If he is not blind he is base, and if
he is not base he is blind.
Juvenis. Ah! that' sneatly, not to say "nastily " put,
and a deuced awkward dilemma—in theory—for the Bat.
He's making a lot of enemies, no doubt, on both sides,
especially among the ambitious non-effectives, and the
disappointed would-be cocks o' the walk. But perhaps if
the Bat could unbosom himself frankly (which I fancy
he's not likely to do) as the Lion did to the Man in
another Fable, he might say a thing or two which would
throw a fresh light on the subject. '' The bearings of it,"
ob Jack Bunsby says, "lie in the application;" and maybe
the modern form of the ancient Fable may carry an "ap-
plication" of which the original Msor did not dream.

ff i sible after this curious comedy at the Vonderful
Vaudeville. Mr. Thomas Thorne is the Cupid redivi-
vus, and when I looked at him,—he being about as
unlike the little god of love as, for example, the Home
Secretary or the Chancellor of the Exchequer
would be,—I could not help saving to myself, "Tell

wings P Truth to tell, though the public have,
, I suppose, taken kindly to the piece,—other-
wise this unromantic, rheumatic Dr. Cupid
could not have run till now and be still running,
— Chevalier Buchanan's play is a nondescript
affair, neither comedy, nor tragedy, nor farce,
nor melodrama, nor good extravaganza, but a
hotch-potch of all these ingredients served up
in the first dish that could hold the mess to-
gether. Dr. Cupid himself is a supernatural

ville, 1889. The piece begins with real good comedy, then
suddenly we are taken into the domain of melodrama, where there
is thunder and lightning, a darkened stage, breaking a magician's
phial, lurid light, and all the old mysterious noises that used to herald
the advent of the marvellous Mr. Geokgk Conquest in a Pantomime

at the Grecian. There is something more Grecian than Latin about
this appearance of Eros at the Vaudeville, only that had Mr. Geohqe
Conquest been the Cupid, we should not have seen him complaining
of age, rheumatism, and cramp, but should have watched him bounding
upwards and flying off in chase of some butterfly that reminded him
of his long-lost Psyche. Who can believe in a Cupid with a cramp,
except in an extravaganza P And, by the way, Mr. Tom Thorne may
remember a certain overgrown Cupid, in the burlesque of Paris,
so funnily played by Mr. Turner, who issued from a damp rose,
limped with rheumatic pains, and noticed with sorrow that his wings
were moulting.
When Mr. Buchanan hit on this idea, he threw away the material
for a capital opera-bouffe, and spoilt a good comedy. Just at the
end, after the serio-comic Demon Cupid had uttered sentiments
worthy of a Christian divine, and made his last appearance as a Con-
verted Cupid, the melodramatic effects of Aot the First were repeated,
and I fully expected that advantage would be taken of this in order
to bring us all back again safe and sound to young Backers rooms
at Cambridge, where with lights full on, we should find that all his
experience with Dr. Cupid had been a dream. I do not say that,
had this been so, I should have been one whit better pleased: but
such an explanation, old-fashioned though it be, would have been
dramatically satisfactory.
The piece is capitally played by all, though I should not think
Dr. Cupid would remain in Mr. Tom Thorne's repertoire as one of
his best parts. Miss Annie Irish is delightful as the honest,
frolicsome Kate; Mr. Fred Thorne first-rate in the very conven-
tional part of an irascible gouty old uncle; Mr. Gim.mork gallant
and gay as Harry Racket; and Mr. Cyril Maude uncommonly good
in the difficult part of "Charles his friend,—with a stutter;" and
Miss Marion Lea, as the giddv widow, irresistible. Miss Dolores
Drummond as the vinegar-faced but subsequently vivacious house-
keeper, and Miss F. Robertson as the amorous spinster, both excellent.

PORTRAIT OF THE CHAIRMAN THE MORNING AFTER
A LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL MEETING.
Lord Rs-b-ry. "Oh, what a Head I've got! Oh, for One Hour
in the House of Lords ! I"
COUNTY COUNCILDOM.
(By Our Own County Councillor.)
We are really getting on splendidly. We think nothing of sitting
for six hours or more, without a pause for refreshment. What a
lesson for other public bodies who shall be nameless! It is suggested
by one probably dyspeptic Member, that we should rise at 6'30 for
dinner, and resume business at 8. And this arrangement is said to
be very highly approved of by the proprietor of an adjacent Tavern.
But then, the very natural question arises, if we resume work at
8 o'clock, like giants refreshed, who can possibly calculate at what
unearthly hour we should adjourn. So we are to continue as before.
It certainly has this most beneficial result, it undoubtedly much
shortens the speeches. The glorious consequence is that we have
passed more noble and I may say staggering resolutions in the few
weeks we have been sitting, than our unhappy predecessors in as
many years. And what resolutions they are!
We demand, and shall, of course receive, full power in every
respect over the thirty Theatres and the three hundred Musio Hall's
of our giant Metropolis, and, under our beneficial rule, nothing that
tends in the slightest degree to deprave or degrade public morality
will be permitted within those whitewashed and purified walls.
Having a great taste for theatricals myself, I have arranged with a
colleague that he shall try to get me on the Theatres and Musio
Halls Committee on the earliest opportunity.
Free Libraries, Publio Baths, and Wash-Houses, are to be
scattered over the whole Metropolis with a liberality undreamt of
by the wildest enthusiast of past days. The statement that a noto-
rious Soap firm has offered to supply all the soap required, without
charge, requires confirmation. We Tesolved, with fight hearts, to
oppose some half-dozen Bills now before Parliament that interfered
somewhat with portions of the Metropolis.
Some of the more fastidious of our Members have under considera-
tion the banishing altogether from our morally purified Metropolis
all noxious or disagreeable trades, so that its five million inhabitants,
in addition to being well and comfortably housed at ridiculously low
rents, if considered from the grasping landlord's point of view, and
washed and instructed at a merely nominal oharge, and doctored
and sanitarised at no charge at all, shall be able to spend their
abundant leisure in promenading the improved streets of the
Metropolis without their greatly refined senses being shocked with
such terrible sights as Butchers' Shops, or their delicate olfactory
nerves offended with the' perfumes of fried fish, sausages, or onions.
The exact proportion of the somewhat increased rates of the
Metropolis that we shall impose upon idle and wealthy landlords, to
the relief of hard-working and comparatively impecunious occupiers,
stands over for full consideration, but it will certainly be one-half.
This grand change alone should make us, and no doubt will make us,
the most popular rating body of modern times—among occupiers.
The idea that property, as represented by landlords, should pay all
rates and taxes, is not by any means generally held among us, but
he is a wise man, indeed, who can foresee to what our glorious
Council may some day come.
We were somewhat surprised to hear that our popular Chairman
had been asked to dine with the principal Committee of the Corpora-
tion, and had accepted the invitation. We hear too, though without
surprise, that he made himself so agreeable there, that some of us
are hoping that similar invitations may be extended to others of the
Council. A little social intercourse of this kind would make a nice
change to what the Member for the Strand rightly denominated as
our very thirsty proceedings.
DUE SOUTH.
From Monte Carlo to Rome, via Vintimille, Genoa, and Pita.
First nuisance,—-change of time from French to Roman time.
Second nuisance,—examination of baggage at the frontier, which I
am bound to say, Italian officials make as easy as possible. It
may be exceptional; I hope not. We are not in a particularly good
humour,—I forgot to men-
tion that Johnnie Spofferd
is my travelling companion,
in consequence of the tables
having turned against him,
which makes him fancy that
a little change will do him
good, — and therefore, any
railway rudeness would jar
upon us.
The eighteen-hour journey
is pleasant enough; and
then we both exclaim, "Now
we are approaching Rome ! I
The City of the CaesarB and
the Popes!!" We approach J
it very slowly, through a
dreary, low, marshy country.
"Is that the Tiber If" I
ask, on catching sight of a
muddy stream.
"S'pose so," replies John-
nie. 11 Beastly dirty, isn't
it? Worse than the Thames.
"p'raps it's the Rubicon. Where was the Rubicon P
I can't exactly say. "C^sab crossed it," I observe.
"Oh, I know that! " replies Johnnie, pettishly. He is not in a
good humour.
Nothing of Rome can I see from the windows. It is raining
heavily, and all is fog and vapour in the distance. Some peasants

"But." says Johnnie, grumbling, "not a single Roman nose

an air of the deepest disgust, throwing himself baok in his seat, "I
believe the whole thing's a swindle. P'raps there's no such place
as Rome after all."
The other day in the Times I saw advertised a book entitled Some

MUSICAL NOTE OF ADMIRATION.
Benoit's Lucifer at Albert Hall, striking-,
of course, not matchless. Words ought to have
been from the Works of Congreve. M. Hensleb
was unavoidably prevented from being present,
but in his absence his part was taken — how
few are the friends who will take your part in
your absence!—by one M. Constantly De Bom.
Brayvo Bom! The Lucifer was applied, Bom
flew out of the BoM-shell, and made a decided
hit. How powerfully he would have come out
in a " canon quartette"! Itwas, indeed, lucky
to have a Bom in, able to do it; for if he had
been hoarse, out of time or tune, how a-Bom-
in-ably bad he would have been. Madame
Lemmens re-appeared, as sweet as Lemmens in
the 8outh. The works of Dickens are being
overhauled by librettists and composers. "S. &
B.'s " Pickwick has inspired Messrs. Wingfield
and Reeve to do a scene from Nicholas Nickleby;
and it is said that Mr. Barn ht sees a great
opportunity for ohoruses in another Dickensian
work which he will call Barnby Rudge. This
information comes from, Yours truly,
Ben Trovatobe.
PROBABLE NEW AND iNnStESTING Wobk.—
The Can- Can and How to dance it, or Some
Reminiscences of Mabille. By Mr. Justice
Field.
[" We are men of the world. We have all seen it
—at least, I have seen it at the Mahille."—Timet'
report of Mr. Justice Field's observations in Barnes v.
ledger.]
I have been informed, the best-drained Hotel in Rome. Our room,
a double one, for the hotel is full, is large and, we hope, comfortable.
There is no prospect from the window, which "gives" on to a
narrow, noisy street. This, after the beautiful view and the quiet
of our Monte Carlo home, is most depressing. It is raining canes
felesque—(" Must be classio in Rome," says Johnnie, trying to cheer
up a bit)—which does not tend to enliven us. We descend to the
Restaurant Department. Considered as a Restaurant, it is the
dreariest room possible.
GLEANINGS FROM GALLERIES.
What a place!" exclaims Johnnie. "Why, the commercial room
of an old-established provincial hotel in England is quite Parisian in
its gaiety compared with this. City of the Ciesars! I should think
this place was started when Caligula was on the throne. Ugh!"
At the Royal Society of British Artists, lovers of striking originality
and thrilling sensation may whistle for Whistles, and sigh for
WrLLiAM-STOTTOFOLDHAM. There is no sign of the former but
the yellow velarium, and the daring, sparsely clothed nymphs of the
latter no longer disport themselves on the walls. The disciples of the
Prophet of the White Lock are conspicuous by their absence:
symphonies and nocturnes are no longer played in the gallery, and
"arrangements" are disarranged altogether. The rule is no longer
cabalistic, but Baylisstic. The even tenor of our way is no longer
startled by a Boanergian basso-profondo, or the shrill shriek of a
fanciful falsetto. There is a soothing, pleasant, domestic tone about
the pictorial music, undisturbed f>y daring discords, or Wagnerian
waggeries. Notwithstanding this, there are not a few piotures
which are mighty pleasant to behold, which give evidence of close
study of Nature, earnest out-of-door work, and great manipulative
dexterity. Among these may be noted, the works by Messrs.
Hayllar, G. 8. Hunter, Yeend King, Basil Bradley, Edwin
Ellis, Yglesias, G. S. Walters, Halfxnight, D. Hardt, Catter-
mole, Davidson, W. S. Jay, Fitzgerald, W. H. Pike, A. W.
Strutt, N. Dawson, H. R. Cauty, and others. There are also some
clever portrait statuettes by Mr. Owen Hale.
I am too depressed to contradict him. Let us breakfast. Let us
have a Roman breakfast. Not a Roman dish on the menu .' We
order a good French dejeuner. "At all events," I say, brightening
up a bit, "we can have some Italian wine."
"Let's have some Montepulciano," says Johnnie, regarding the
waiter severely, as though warning him beforehand not to attempt
passing off any Italian wine of an inferior quality upon him.
The waiter, in perfect English (I having addressed him in French,
and Johnnie in Italian), wishes to know what wine it was the gen-
tleman demanded?
"Montepulciano," Johnnie repeats, only this time in a less certain
tone, being evidently a trifle distrustful of his pronunciation, and his
eye falters before the waiter's calm, but not unsympathetic, gaze.
The waiter has never heard of it. "What!" exclaims Johnnie,
One of the very best Art Shows now to be seen in London is the
Loan Exhibition of Portrait Miniatures at the Burlington Fine Arts
Club. Both for quality and quantity it is extraordinary, and any
one who is fortunate enough to get an invitation to inspeot it should
by no means neglect the opportunity. Since the introduction of
photography, the art of Miniature painting has languished—indeed
it has well-nigh gone out altogether. It is Bincerely to be hoped this
exhibition will be a means of the revival of the charming art.
Nothing is more wearying to the eye than a collection of photo-
graphic portraits, but of these exquisite miniatures one never gets
weary—one can visit the exhibition again and again. What to do
with your Catalogue when you emerge from a picture-show is a
problem that has never yet been solved. The managers of this exhi-
bition meet the difficulty in most satisfactory fashion. They lend you
a Cataloguex which you return to the attendant on leaving. Let other
galleries imitate this noble example! The Abt-ful Dodger.
"never heard of Montepulciano? Why, in Horace's time "But
the waiter was not here in Hobace's time.
"Wasn't that Falernian ?" I ask, rather siding with the waiter,
who, as an Italian, at least so I suppose, ought to know.
"Well," returns Johnnie, ceding the point, "let's have Faler-
nian." No ; we cannot have Falerian; we can have some chianti,
which the waiter can highly recommend, or some Barolo, of which,
he tells us, they have a remarkably fine specimen.
We decide on chianti. It is some time before Johnnie can get
over the waiter's never having heard of Montepulciano.
"Of course," he says to me, "you've heard of it." Yes, I fancy
I have; but, trying to recall it, I cannot quote my authority unless
it 'b somewhere in the Bon Gualtier Ballads. The line, I fancy, is
"Regal Montepulciano drained beneath its native rock." This is
unsatisfactory to Johnnie, who is just beginning to express his
doubt as to whether Montepulciano is in Italy or Spain, when the
breakfast arrives, and we cheer up a bit.
"With a Yeo, my Boys, Yeo, ho!"—Chabies Santley sailed for
Melbourne last Friday. Solo, unaccompanied. But we hope en route
that he '11 find a grand p-an'-o passage muoh to his liking. Bon
voyage! and many happy returns.
A Rase Leader of Men.—General Boulangeb has made him-
self scarce.

ping criminals. It will, of course, be retrospective in its operations.

THE PHARISEE'S SUNDAY.
"To hedge people round with petty restriction!
instead of teaching them nobility of conduct and a
worthy use of liberty, is the perennial resource of
•hallow and incompetent reformers ... A depraved
and servile human nature, cribbed, cabined, and
onfined by an infinity of minute regulations en-
forced by the polioeman, is their reading of the
social problem. It follows from their miserable ideal
that they are entirely careless of the fetters they
may place upon rational freedom ... A small
minority occasionally injure themselves with bad
liquor on Sundav, and these reformers can think of
nothing better than to forbid the entire community
to drink on 8undays at all."—The " Timet," on Mr.
Stivenson's Sunday Closing Bill.
Oct on our paltering pedants, petty fry
Of ants who'd eat the core of Liberty 1
Oh, for a Milton's virile voice to wake [shake
The cant-drugged manhood in our midst, and
High Prigdom's dull despotic Dagon down.
Ana with one breath of freedom bless the town!
Smcgbt's a great Reformer! 8mcgby's soul
Pants with perennial zeal toward one goal.
"As / am," Smcgbt shouts, "should all
men be,
Where slavery's bliss, 'tis folly to be free;
And I, am I not blissful P Rapture fills
My swelling breast, shines in my rosy gills,
Irradiates my calm complacent face.
Let me but set my yoke upon the race
Marshal its manhood meekly in my train
And badge it to my taste—how great the gain!
Freedom's a snare, and liberty's a lure,
Complex Compulsion is your only cure.
Restraint's far-reaching regimen alone,
Straitness of garb, rigidity of zone,
The ordered movement ana the measured pace
Will bring emancipation to the race!"
And what is Smcgbt? A fanatic fool,
Enthusiast of fad, and slave of rule,
Whose spindly Ego, drawn to sickly growth
By mental darkness, is exceeding loth
To let in light or trust to the fresh air
Of manly freedom lest they should impair
His spurious ideal. Who but he
8hines as the full-blown Modern Pharisee?
Anise, and mint, and cumin, these indeed
He measures with the most punctilious heed,
The broad phylactery suits his narrow soul,
The ordering of the platter and the bowl
For all mankind he deems his function fit,
To lasso Life's Leviathan, and bit
The social Behemoth would be his pride.
Humanity as his hobby-horse he'd ride,
To wither? Shuobt, howsoe'er he glose
Knows not; he never sees beyond his nose.
See Smtjobt's Sabbath! Siiuobt knows
not ease [please.
Whilst free-men shape their Sunday as they
He, petty special providence of man, [his plan.
Would make him breathe, eat, drink, upon
Some men are sots. Shall oooksure Smcgbt
shrink drink.'
From despot logic? No! Aro man shall
That's Smtjobt's ultimatum, and his cure
For drunkenness—and freedom. Drink's a
lure
To the enfeebled few; to enslave the strong,
And spare the slaves temptation, can't bo wrong
According to mechanic morals. No! [low
Because some things called men have sunk so
That opportunity breeds base excess
In their base nature, place restriction's stress
On sturdier manhood; the fanatic craves
One blessed boon ; that all men shall be slaves,
Those to their lusts, and these to tyrant law.
So Freedom's slain; and by an Ass's jaw!
Pharisee Sunday! Smcgbt, sleek and fat
Club-guest, look on this picture, and on that!
The sot sits free—at home in peace to tope,
The honest sober toiler must not hope
For innocent refreshment on his way;
His Sunday meal, his Sabbath holiday
Must both be marred and hampered by re-
straints,
Which may mean little to our full-fed saints,
With handy clubs and cellars, but to him
Mean harmless pleasure spoiled by priggish
whim.
Smug by sees only grossly, in the gross;
The myriad forms of hardship and of loss,
Which only thoughtful sympathy may feel,
The maimed rites of the simple mid-day meal;
The morning walk robbed of its welcome rest
In sanded parlour, and the blameless zest
Of wholesome ale-draught, savouring bread-
and-cheese,
These, and a thousand petty wrongs like these,
Smcgbt is blind to; callous to all claims
That seem to cross his own fanatic aims.
Rather than his preposterous schemes should
fail,
He'd banish Liberty with Cakes and Ale,
And on slaves, sober but emasculate,
Build up his fleeting figment of a State.
The siokly, servile, small ideal, haunts
Smcgbt's fanatic soul; he loudly vaunts
Provisional advance, or snatched success.
But will his senseless schemes abide the
stress
Of the world's virile conflict,—the old fight
For manly freedom blent with willing right?
Nay; the invertebrate vain egotists
Will never conquer in Life's open lists.
Shut up the Publicans? No; if you please.
Punch will" shut up" the Modern Pharisees!

MR. R. MANSFIELD AS RICHARD THE THIRD AT THE GLOBE.
A SONG AFTER LAMPLIGHT.
(Ai sung by the Suririburnian Oas-shareholder on reading a
report of the inquiry now being held as to the working of
the Electric Lighting Acts of 1882—1885.)
The end has come of all our fume and fretting,
As, darkness deep'ning round us, 0 my brothers,
We watch this sun of ours sink to its setting
To herald an uprisen light to others.
No more the stream from poisoning meter seething
Shall stay and stint the stifling air around us,
Till it with breath of death, in this our breathing,
Through sense of cheating choke and gasp confound us.
No more! For spite the living load of blunder
That crushes life from every golden measure,
The "main" at length is riven—rent in sunder,
And scattered to the winds its hoarded treasure!
So hail, to fair Electric Installation I
No fear that it will find us mute to meet it.
Invaded, we will yield it habitation
And grovel in our gratitude to greet it.
Hail to its shares! and what, then, of those others?
"Qas will go down." Nay, class me not with jokers,
When I advise you, strongly, 0 my brothers!
To wire that one word'' sell" straight to your brokers.
Important Eurofean Questions.—A telegram last
week informed us that "The Hereditary Prince of
Nassau, who has been at Loo, has gone to the Hague."
Did the Hereditary win or lose at Loo? Did he take
"Miss"? If the Prince has given up Loo, what, at
present, is his little game?
The Mysterious Pipe.—Another puff. Mr. Verini
writes to say that his Pipe will soon be out. It is his
own patent, not yet made for the trade, and so Mr. Punch
will not anticipate the interesting disclosure. Once
known, the pipe, and its praises, will be in every
smokers mouth.
"Whichever you like, my little Dear," &c.—
The admirers of Mr. Mansfield as Richard the Third
consider him " Very Dick." The non-admirers speak of
his performance as Very Dicky."
'AERY ON CHIVALRY.
Dear Charlie,—Tour letter 'as reached me, and give me a reglar'good laugh.
Me engaged to be married? Who tipped you that kibosh, or is it your chaff r
The world's awful given to Pigotting, Charlie, jest now, and no kid;
But you didn't suck that in, now did yer P You wos a fair mug if you did.
Not percisely, my pippin. No, thanky; I know a game wuth two o' that.
I am not a Buchananite, Charlie, so don't write me down for a flat.
Head your dear D. T. lately, no doubt, my dear boy? Well, then, wot do you
_ think
Of this " Chivalry " question, whioh Robert has got in no end of a kink?
I ain't much up in histry, myself, it seems dismally dry tommy-rot,
Fur as ever yours truly looked into it, a regular rummy old lot
Our ancestors seem to have bin; blooming geesers all round, big and small;
And, like Labby, I think it's a pity we ever 'ad any at all.
Wot this Chivalry wos, mate, fust off, BobBuchanan may know—or he mayn't—
But if it meant making the Woman a speeches of gingerbread Saint,
And a bobbin' around her with billy-doos, big battle-naxes, and such,
Like a lot of tin-kettles with trimmings, it won't work to-day, mate, not muoh.
Buchanan's a poet, they tell me, and poets don't nick me, nohow,
Kind o' long-winded loonatics, mostly, dead-nuts on the biggest bow-wow;
Sort of gushing G. 0. M.'s in metre; and Chivalry, if you arsk me,
Seems a stror-stuffed poetical " property," all bloomin'fiddle-de-dee.
Knights be jolly well jiggered, I say, 'cept the turtle-fed City Swell sort,
Like Sir Robert, the Parnell-boohooer; now he is a plucky old Sport;
But you don't ketch him planking on Chivalry; no, it's as much out o' date
As Don (Juickshot's old orook, Rosy Nanty, would be in a race for a Plate.
But Woman! Well, Woman's all right enough, not arf a bad sort of thing
When a fellow is young and permiskus. And when he has 'ad his fair fling,
And wants quiet diggings or nussing, she do come in 'andy no doubt;
In faok, taking Woman all round, she's good goods the world carn't do without.
But washup 'er, Charlie P Wot bunkum !—as Mrs. Lynn Linton remarks.
To watch her wire into 'er sex like Jemimer, old man, is rare larks.
She do let 'em 'ave it to-rights. 'Ow I larf as she lays on the lash!
It must rile 'er to know she's a She, but I do like 'er devil and dash.
Robert's down on the Modern Young Man, who's a 'Arry sez he Cang his
cheek!)
With a H.! Now that give me the needle, old man. I ain't mealy or meek,
Nor yet one of yer rhyme-pumping milksops wot look on a gal as a saint,
But I do know the petticoats, yus, and I'm fly to palaver and paint.
I'm a Modern Young Man, if there is one, a "Cynick" right down to the
ground;
Wich means that I am not a juggins, nor yet to be copped on the bound.
Pap's passy, old pal; pooty sentiment's fairly played out; no one 'ooks
Yours truly with patter of "fame and fair women, and beautiful books."
Yah! Sech hantydeluvian kibosh may cosset up kittens or kids,
But Chivalry ain't in the 'unt when it's matched agen Class and the quids.
Your Magdalen muck will not wash, nor we don't want it washed, wich is more,
In Bohemia p'raps it might work, in the Strand sech soft soap is a bore.
Bob Buchanan may lather his 'ardest, may scrub and blow bubbles like steam,
But his moral Spring-clean won't come off, it's a quill-driving laundress's dream.
Old miwies are too fond of sluicing and tidying-up like all round;
Let Chivalry's charwomen chatter; they won't mop me up, I '11 be bound.
The Modern Young Man? Wy, that's Me, Charlie! 'Arry 's the model and
type,
But no more like Buchanan's stuffed dummy than prime pully sowty's like tripe.
At the Pubs or the Clubs it's ail one: it is me sets the fashion, old pal;
And we 're all of a mind to a hinch about togs, lotion, larks, or a gal.
This here Chivalry ain't in our maynoo; we ain't sech blind mugs as all that.
The Modern Young Man must be wide-oh! He's never a spoon or a flat;
Takes nothink on trust, don't " part" easy, is orkurd to nobble or spoof ■
And there's only three things he believes in—hisself, a prime lark, and the oof.
There you 'ave it, Buchanan, my buffer, put neat in a nutshell, old man.
We don't dream, or kotow to the petticoats; no, Sir, that isn't our plan;
And you arsk wot we 're coming to f Well, you may arsk ancf arsk on till
all's blue,
But one thing we ain't coming to, Bob, that's to learn of a poet—like you!
If /wrote a Young Man's Confessions, like Mr. George Moore, as you say—
Don't know him myself, but he seems to be fly to the right time o' day.
I should make you sit up jest a mossel; and this I can promise, old chap,
You '11 find no tinpot "Chivalry " there, nor no moonstruck poetical pap.
I can fake it myself, dontcher know—
With a jolly clear heye to wot's wot, and a sense of the true quid for quo—
But be a mere moke to the Feminines, mugged up to kneel, fetch, and carry?
That may do for Chivalry-BoB, but I'm Mowed if it will for
Yours,
'Arry.

ONE GOOD TURN," &c.
City Man (to one of his Clerks he finds fishing in his Ornamental Water). "Look herf, Smitherr, I've ko objection to giving Ton
a Day now and then 'to attend your Aunt's Funeral'—but I think you might send some of the Fish up to the House!"
WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
TWELFTH EVENING.
"There is a small boy I know very well," said the Moon. "He
is quite a philosopher in Mb way, but last Christmas he was in great
perplexity. It is the time of year when it is usual to present many
people, and particularly small boys, with pieces of bright new money.
as perhaps you are aware?
(Mr. Punch owned that he
was not unacquainted with
the custom, and the Moon
proceeded:) "Well, this boy
had a large circle or friends,
and as most of them had
given him a coin of some
kind, both the pockets of
his knickerbockers were so
full that he could not run
about with any comfort. At
first he bad been very
pleased with the jingle he
produced, and exhibited his
treasures to everybody he
met—not as a hint to follow
the example, which I am afraid is sometimes the motive for these
artless displays—but in the simple pride of his heart. Soon, however,
this pride had waned, which was largely due to the persecution he
underwent from his family. They all told him that he was very
young indeed to have so much money—which was true enough, but
then be could not grow up any faster than he was doing I Next they
wanted to be told what he intended to do with it all, and he had not
the smallest idea, which made it embarrassing.
'' But the worst came when they began to suggest various ways in
which he ought to employ his wealth. His Father said that, if he was a
really wise boy, he should lay it oat on some useful books which he
would learn to value more the older he grew. His Mother thought
that, as he had worn out so many boots lately, he ought to treat him-

self to a nice strong pair of new ones. His Unole described how,
when he was much younger than his nephew, he had begun steadily
saving up all his money to buy himself a gold watch and chain by the
time he was a young man, and how, on the very day he came of age, he
was able—thanks to his self-denial and foresight—to carry out his
ambition. He did not mention that both watch and chain had been
stolen as he was walking home from the jeweller's shop, because that
would have spoilt all the moraL But the little boy was not attracted
by the idea, lor he had a handsome sixpenny watch already, which
looked just like gold. Then an Aunt (who had not given him any-
thing) said that there were plenty of little boys and girls who had
nothing to eat, and no warm clothes; but that, the Uncle said, was
all stuff, and if he gave away the money in charity he would only
be imposed upon, and do more harm than good. However, they all
agreed that he was a very fortunate boy, and ought to be exceedingly
careful what he did with his riches.
By-and-by, after he had listened for most of the afternoon to these
exhortations, I saw him come out without his cap into the winter
dusk, and walk thoughtfully down the garden-path, with both fists
thrust deep in his pockets. His little face looked grave and care-
ridden, and I could see that his responsibilities were already weighing
heavily on his mind. He took out all his money, and looked at it as
it lay in a heap in his joined hands—how they shone, all those bright
new florins and shillings and sixpences, as my rays fell on them f I
thought he had come out to count them and gloat over them like a
miser, as he stood there at the bottom of the garden, which was sepa-
rated from an adjoining canal by a low wall. Suddenly, as if he had
at last made up his mind after careful deliberation, he tossed both
handfuls over the wall. I saw the coins flash for a moment in the
air, and then make little grey spurts in the blackish water before
vanishing for ever. He searched both pockets to see if he had any
more, and found a sixpence in a corner he had overlooked. That
followed the rest; and then, quite light-hearted and relieved again,
he ran back into the house, and informed his family of the manner
in which he had disposed of his wealth. They were all very angry
with him—especially the Aunt—and called him a very foolish and
naughty little boy; but I am not so sure," said the Moon, reflec-
tively, that he was really so foolish after all!"

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAEY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, April 1.—Was Father
Fabrell inebriated, with Windbag-Sexton's verbosity, or other
effluent F This a supplementary question suggested by Johnston
of Ballykilbeg. Story altogether a little mixed. Corbet says,
Father F. went to police barracks in Arklow to surrender himself to
the police; Constable Sackville, apparently
not approving the procedure, seized him by the
throat: whereupon, other constables, not to be
behindhand in activity, batoned people, wound-
ing eight men, against whom it was not even
alleged they had booed for Bal-
four. These more or less plain
facts Corbet wants to submit
to Balfour; when up jumps
Johnston of Ballykilbeg, and
(in Parliamentary sense of
course) seizes him by throat and
says Father F. was drunk.
Uproar on Irish Benches; cries
of "Shame!" Clancy de-
nounces statement as "gross
and cowardly calumny"; John-
ston begins to wish he was back
at Ballykilbeg; Colonel Laurie
sits up, expecting scrimmage.
Then Johnston explains. It
was true he had said Father F.
was drunk. It was denied by
his friends. But, Johnston
asks triumphantly, Is it not a
fact that the barrack-gate was
open when Father F. rang the
bell, and if so, why did he ring
Sits up." the bell? q. jj. ft.
No getting over that. The influence of logic too strong in Irish
breasts to justify resistance to this proposition. The clear mind of
Johnston of Ballykilbeg, piercing the mists of prejudice, had seen
it all; the open gate; the dangling bell-rope; Father F. pulling at it
to arrest attention of hall-porter, whereas he might have walked in
without pulling the bell at all. Argal, Father F. was drunk. After
this MacNeill, with potato, larger and hotter than usual, in his
mouth, insisting upon Knowing why certain telegram had been mis-
directed, fell a little flat. Telegram, sent by Father M'Fadden from
Derry Gaol, addressed to MacN'eill at House of Commons, delivered
at Dublin Castle, a place MacNeill never tenanted. Head out tele-
gram in tempestuous way. Sentences punctuated by the unmanage-
able potato. Balfour hinted that telegram had been withheld be-
cause of its vituperativeness. MacNeill put it to the House, really
desiring to be informed, wherein was message vituperative? All it
had said was, the "bold mendacity of Balfour has become unbear-
able." If prisoners were not to offer to distant friends casual obser-
vations like this, what were we coming to? After this the House
got into Committee on Naval Scheme, talked till midnight, when
Old Morality pounced.
Business done.—Increased Expenditure on Navy agreed to.
Tuesday.—Morning Sitting. Chief talk about restoration of
Westminster Hall, nearly finished now. Cost £43,000; some nice
rooms added in wing where old Law Courts stood; meant for Grand
Committees; woula make charming dining-rooms. Objection chiefly
taken to staircases built in Hall to approach these chambers.
Cavendish Bentinck says, Architect probably one of Mr. Spur-
oeon's Congregation; has sat and stared at Tabernacle Pulpit and
its stairways till he's got tbem on the brain, and reproduces them
in Westminster Hall.
George Campbell seizes opportunity to pass off little joke on
House. Introduces himself as "a modest man," also "a sober
man." House taken in at first, but recognised his voice, and
booed.
Plunket stood on staircase, resolutely defending it. Assault
beaten off; staircase remained.
Evening Sitting. _ Bro adht/rst moved Resolution calling attention
to condition of Poor in large towns.
Sydney Gk.dgf. pooh-poohed the whole business. Whatever
measure of evil might exist, all due, he says, to people who pander
to the poor. What with free education, free meals, eheaper houses,
Peabody's Buildings, and the rest, poor people attracted to towns,
and so the evil grew.
"Gedge has hit nail on head," said Wilfrid Lawson. "His
ideas, if oarried out, would soon put end to crowding in towns.
Make the people live in pigstyes, shut up the schools, stamp out the
soup-kitchens, and make things otherwise hot for them, and they '11
stop away. If they don't, let s have a cordon round the Metropolis;

as if he 'd booed for Balfour, or cheered for O'Brien's breeches.
Gedge the man for my money; goes to the root of things."
Business done.—Committee of Supply.
Thursday.—In Lords, Mtlltown arrived with what he recom
mended to the House as " Bill of extremely simple character." Pro-
poses that if Bill Sikes be found in another gentleman's house with
burglarious intent

firearms, Bill shall

doubtful about the
Bill. Feeling in
the country (more
especially in the
neighbourhood
where Bill Sikes
lives), very strong
against flogging.
But the House,
including M arxiss,
backed it up, and
on Division, carried
by 37 votes to 9.
Bill Sires him-

Left his dawg at
home; disguised
himself as under-
taker, that being
his notion of per-
fection of respect-
ability. No diffi-
culty in getting order; sat out debate with keen and intelligent
interest. Once attention called off by spectacle of Mace in possession
of stout little gentleman, with large head and wig to match, who sat
on Woolsack. "Could double him up quick," said Bill, reflectively,
"and bolt with the swag. Wonder how it would melt up? Pr'aps
it's only gilt." William's attention called back by stout little
gentleman rising from Woolsack to support Bill—not Sikes, but
Milltown's measure.
"I don't like this 'ere letting the cat out of the bag," Baid Bill,
moodily, as, business of sitting completed, he walked out.
In Commons, Naval Defence Resolution again under discussion,
Childers moved Amendment raising constitutional question of
arrangement providing necessary funds. Nothing could exceed
importance of question. Millions in it, besides the constitutional
issue at stake. That being so, Members with one accord hurried off
when Childers began. By time he had proved his case less than a
score present.
"Capital fellow, Childers," said Sage of Queen Anne's Gate.
"Full of information; brimming over with facts; possesses acute
and logical mind. Can't understand why House won't Temain to
listen to him. Have come out myself to see where Members can
be. Probably find them in the smoke-room. Shall go and see."
Much more excitement about horseflesh Bill when it came on.
Windbag Sexton, who hadn't spoken for at least ten minutes—not
since Merchant Shipping Tonnage Bill disposed of—interposed;
moved to omit clause which confined operation of measure to
England. Why should Ireland be left unprotected?
Then Johnston of Ballykilbeg rushed in and scored one off
ancient enemies. Would certainly support Amendment, he said.
If there was Free-trade in horseflesh in Ireland, there was every
probability of the dish being introduced at Lord Mayor's Banquet in
Dublin. Windbag Sexton couldn't see this joke. House did, and
laughed consumedly.
Business done.—Committee on Naval Defence Resolutions.
Friday.—Spent really pleasant and interesting evening discussing
Small-pox and Vaccination. Picton introduced subject. Stansfkld
naturally attracted to Front Opposition Bench, otherwise, save for
presenoe of Lyon Playfair, empty. Fa rquharson triumphantly
vindicated Scotch Nation from idle charge of lack of humour.
Picton moved for appointment of Royal Commission with avowed
object of bringing about repeal of law establishing Compulsory
Vaooination. Farquhabson seconded Amendment, thus securing
opportunity for delivering speech that entirely destoyed Picton's
case. Ritchie granted Commission, not beoause he had slightest
doubt of efficacy of Vaooination. but as probably best means of
opening dull eyes, and comfounding fanaticism. Thus, everyone
pleased all round; celebrated occasion by Counting Out House.

backed, as it is " Money makes the Mater to go."
MR. PUNCH'S MODEL MUSIC-HALL SONGS.
No. II.—The Topical-Political.
In most respects, no doubt, the present example can boast no
superiority to ditties in the same style now commanding the ear
of the Public. One merit, however, its author does claim for it.
Though it deals with most of the burning questions of the hour, it
can be sung anywhere with absolute security. This is due to a
simple but ingenious method by which the political sentiment has
been arranged on the reversible principle. A little alteration here
and there will put the singer in close touch with an audience of almost
any shade of politics. Should it happen that the title has been
already anticipated, Mr. Punch begs to explain that the remainder
of this sparkling composition is entirely original; any similarity with
previous works must De put down entirely to " literary coincidence."
Whether the title is new or not, it is a very nice one, viz :—
BETWEEN YOU AND ME-AND THE POST!
(To be sung in a raucous voice, and with a confidential air.)
I've dropped in to whisper some secrets I've heard.
Between you and me and the Post!
Picked up on the wing by a 'cute little bird.
We are gentlemen 'ere—so the caution's absurd,
Still, you '11 please to remember that every word
Is between you and me and the Post!
Chorus (to which the Singer should dance).
Between you and me and the Post! An 'int is sufficient at most.
I'd very much rarther this didn't go farther, than 'tween you and
me and the Post!
At Lord Sorlsburt's table there's sech a to-do.
Between you and me and the Post I
When he first ketches sight of his dinner menoo,
And sees he's set down to good old Irish stoo—
Whioh he's sick of by this time—now, tell me, ain't you t
Between you and me and the Post!
(This happy and pointed allusion to the Irish Question ts sure to
provoke loud laughter from an audience of Radical sympathies.
For Unionists, the words "Lord Sorlsburt's" can be altered
by our patent reversible method into " the G. 0. M.'s," without
at all impairing the satire.) Chorus, as before.
The G. 0. M.'s hiding a card up his sleeve.
Between you and me and the Post!
Any ground he has lost he is going to retrieve,
And what his little game is, he '11 let us perceive,
And he '11 pip the whole lot of 'em, so I believe,
Between you and me and the Post! (Chorus.)
(The hit will be made quite as palpably for the other side by substitu
ting " Lord Sorlsburt's," Sfc, at the beginning of the first line,
should the majority of the audience be found to hold Conservative
views.)
Balfour isn't touched by a patriot's woes.
Between you and me and the Post!
The 'ero O'Brien in prison he throws.
But the martyr sits there with his thumb to his nose,
For he's got back the principal part of his close,
\M.-H. rhyme for "clothes."
Between you and me and the Post 1 (Chorus.)
(This verse will need no alteration, being delicately adjusted to either
extreme. A pause should always be allowed after every proper
name for cheers, hisses, and counter-cheers.
Little Randolph won't long be left out in the cold.
Between you and me and the Post!
If they '11 let him inside the Conservative fold,
He has promised no longer he '11 swagger and scold,
But to be a good boy, and to do as he a told,
Between you and me and the Post! (Chorus.)
(The mere mention of Lord Randolph's name is sufficient to ensure
the success of any song.)
Joet Chamberlain's orchid's a bit overblown,
Between you and me and the Post!
(This is rather subtle, perhaps, but an M.-H. audience will see a joke
in it somewhere, and laugh.)
'Ow to square a Round Table I'm sure he has shown.
(Same observation applies here.)
But of late he's been leaving his old friends alone,
And I fancy he's grinding an axe of his own.
Between you and me and the Post! {Chorus.)
(We now pass on to Topics of the Say, which we treat in a light but
trenchant fashion.)
Boulanoer to Brussels has jest done a guy:
Between you and me and the Post!
And all his supporters are wondering why.
But Boulanoer's as artful a bird as he's shy—
I've a notion he '11 turn up agen by and by,
Between you and me and the Post! (Chorus.)
From some letters I've read I am getting to doubt,
Between you and me and the Post!
Whether Chivalry isn't a fashion gone out;
For they say with the Ladies each man is a lout.
But I don't think they know what they're torking about,
Between you and me and the Post! (Chorus.)
Any drink on a Sunday will soon be denied,
Between you and me and the Post!
Unless you are out on a walk or a ride.
But I year there's a method of getting supplied,
If you just tell the barman it's all " bona fide"—
Between you and me and the Post! (Chorus.)
On the noo County Councils they've too many nobs,
Between you and me and the Post!
For the Swells stick together, and sneer at the mobs;
And it's always the rich man the poor one who robs.
We shall 'ave the old business—all jabber and jobs!
Between you and mo and the Post! (Chorus.)
There's a new rule for ladies presented at Court,
Between you and me and the Post!
High necks are allowed, so no colds will be cort.
But I went to the Droring-Room lately, and thort
Some old wimmen had dressed quite as iow as they art!
Between you and me and the Post! (Chorus.)
By f ussy Alarmists we 're too much annoyed.
Between yon and me and the Post!
If we don't want our neighbours to think we 're afroid,
[M.-H. rhyme,
Spending dibs on defence we had better avoid.
And give 'em instead to the pore Unemployed.
[M.-H. political economy
Between you and me and the Post! (Chora*.)
This style of perlitical singing ain't hard,
Between you and me and the Post!
Asa" Mammoth Comique " on the bills I am starred,
And, so long as I'm called, and angcored, and hurrar'd,
I can rattle off rubbish like this by the yard.
Between you and me and the Post!
[Chorus, and dance off to sing the same Song—with or withou
alterations—in another place.
A Happt Return.—Welcome back to town, The Don, not Doi
Tools of Tooledo, but our Lon-Don Toole,—at his own Theatre oi

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CONCERNING A RECENT ENGINEERING FEAT.
The Very First Lord of the Admiralty is interviewed by Mr. Punch.
Mr. Punch (bowing politely). Perhaps, my Lord, you could (rive
me a little information. I hear that your Engineer-in-Chief, Mr.
Richard Bennett, has sent in his resignation, having joined the
well-known firm of Matjdslay, Sons and Field. Is this the ease?
The Very First Lord [pleasantly). Yes, Mr. Punch; you have
been correctly informed. It is. You see, it is the humorous custom of
this Department to undervalue the services of first-class scientific
experts, and to offer them accordingly inadequate remuneration. As
Mr. Richard Bennett was, when in our service, at the head of the
largest Steam Navy in the world, we naturally endeavoured to out
down his salary to as low a figure as possible, and fired it, therefore,
at £1000 a year. As any engineering firm in the kingdom will pay a
far handsomer stipend than this, even to the head of a single Depart-
ment, he, oddly enough, perhaps being deficient in a sense of humour,
on the first opportunity presenting itself, actually threw up the post
and left us.
Mr. Punch. Quito so. But do you find so economical—ahem!—a
system of doing business answer?
The Very First Lord (considering). Well,—um—perhaps not. In
fact, rather the contrary • for we cannot command the services even
of our own able men. Indeed, all the leading posts in high-class
Engineering Firms are, it is of course satisfactory to know, at the
present moment, filled by scientific experts who have taken honours
at the Royal Naval College itself.
Mr. Punch (severely). Certainly, that is very satisfactory. Some
people would consider the information rather startling. May I ask,
my Lord, what you intend to do?
The Very First Lord (jovially). Well, to be quite frank with you,
Mr. Punch, I don't know what our intentions may be, but I can
confidently tell you what we shall do, and that will be—Just nothing.'
[Left smiling amiably as interview terminates.
A SONG OF THE NEW SHIPS.
Piped in the Cock pit by Lord Ch-rl-s B-r-sf-rd.
White, my boy, take my congratulation
That you haven't by fads been misled,
But have studied the wants of the Nation
Till you've hit the right nail on the head.
For that each one his own hobby runs, Sir,
Is a fact that you've palpably seen.
And in measuring armour and guns. Sir,
You've adroitly just touched on the mean.
And your critics you've one and all scattered,
First and foremost among them old Reed,
For his fads you've undoubtedly shattered,
And have stuck to your guns about "speed."
Just as if our tars led into action,
When they found themselves safe from attack,
From that fact would derive satisfaction
If they couldn't Bend double shot back I
"Why," they 'dsay, "let the darned Mounseer sink us,
Anyways, if we ' ain't fit to swim! J
Why! a precious fine crew he will think us,
If we ends this without sinking him!"
But you've steered clear of that, and provided
Just the ships that the country most needs;
And for that simple fact I've decided
You 're worth just twenty critioal Reeds!
And although some slight drawbacks may fetter
Your plain scheme; and some judges perverse
With a sneer say it might have been better,
I avow, Sir, it might have been worse!
Original Stock.—Last Saturday the Paris Correspondent of the
Time*, M. de Bl-w-tz as usual we suppose, gave some valuable
information with regard to M Dillon, the Boulangist. "Hisfather,"
wrote M. de B., "was a M. Pierre Dillon, of Paris, but it is pro-
bable that he was remotely of Irish extraction." Probable P Most
improbable; why M. de B. will be saying next that the families of
Mc-Ma ii ox and 0 Donnell were originally Celtic; and maybe he won't
stop at that, but he '11 be after asserting that O'Dwier, O'Brien,
O'Connt.ll are " remotely of Irish extraction." Then, vice versa, he
might trace Mr. Biggar back to the old French family of " Be oar."
Pro and Con.

something in the 'Cademy from this artistio cuss that' 11 give 'em all

brawny gent from town has just hooked a fush, and the Laird's
Gillie is down on him. "Hoot awa! as the Scotch owl said," says
the Gillie, "ye '11 just come out o' this landscape. Ye've nae beesniss

From Our Own Inspector.—The Ex-President of B. A. tells me he
has three line pictures:—(1) Baytiss and the Butterfly, a harmony
in Suffolk Street; (2) Fancy Portrait of the Artist by himself, entitled
White Lock on the Understanding; (3) Lady Janr Grey, seen through
the mist of history. The question is, What will he do with them?
Mr. Poynter was out, but I was informed by a confidential friend,
that the title of his chief picture is The End of the Sybarite. You
will naturally ask, "Wnich end?" Both, as he is lying at full
length on marble floor prostrated by indigestion. The heads of
various slaves, some of whom have met their fate for having failed in
ringing the dinner-bell punctually, and others in not having brought
the pancakes at the very moment of frizzling, are strewn about the
palace. The Court physician is carrying off the last remnant of a large
cucumber for analysis. The Period is that of the 1st Gulpus.
From Colin Hunter, A.li. A.—-Dear Mr. Editor.—Something quite
new. Public is fond of variety. Fishing-boats going out, or coming
in, whichever the little dear of a purchaser likes. He pays his money
and takes his picture. Does it matter what the boats are doing as
long as the coin is coming in and the pictures going out? I like

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [April 20, 1889.
A MODEST MAHARAJAH.
The Maharajah Dhoxeep Sinqh informs onr gracious Queen that
he does not think it is any (food asking for his kingdom haok again;
so he is going to take it. He apparently does think that it is some use
asking for the Koh-i-Noor, as he does not, in his recent letter to the
Empress of India, announce any intention of laying violent hands
on the "Monntain-of-Light" He even proposes to purchase that
trinket for current Koh-i-n-ore of the realm. We shall not judge
'' the deeply-wronged legitimate Sovereign of the Sikhs" too severely
if, by fair foroe of arms, ne recovers his kingdom. It will only be a
of Sikhs of one and half-a-dozen of the other. But the errant
Maharajah, the Wandering Jew in quest of a wandering jewel, has
profited by his experience of Western civilisation to such an extent,
that he publishes his " correspondence" with Her Majesti before
there is any answer. The reply, however, Mr. Punch happens to
know, is an inquiry, couched in the most courteous official terms, as to
whether Dhtjleep Singh will have the Koh-i-Noor now, or await its
receipt in due course. The Lion of the Punjab is understood to
Srefer the more immediate realisation of his modest proposal,
[eanwhile his entourage are becoming anxious. They fear that, like
Mr. Winkle in the affair of the hackney-coachman, the uncrowned
King of the Jekyll-and-Hide and Sikhs, is going to begin, and
Du-look before Dhtjxeep is the constant burden of their Singh-song
in consequence.
DUE SOUTH.
Rome—No Smoke—Dark Ages—Jupiter Pluvius—Morning Call—Si. Peter't.
Breakfast restores us to fairly good spirits. If it were not muggy
and close indoors, and raining and generally filthy outside, we
should be rollicking. "However," says Johnnie, leaning baok and
pulling out his cigar-oase, as the waiter brings in the ooffee, "the
great charm of a foreign hotel is that you can smoke your cigar
immediately you've finished, without leaving the table." And he
strikes a light. "Beg pardon, Sir," interposes the civil Waiter,
"but smoking is not allowed here. Only in the smoking-room."
"What!" exclaims Johnnie, in a voice of thunder. The Waiter
shrugs his shoulders; suoh is the case; he, the Waiter, personally
would wish it otherwise, but Monsieur the gentleman will under-
stand that he, as only Waiter, is not responsible for it. "But—"
Johnnie restrains himself, and, with suppressed fury, requests to
be shown to the smoking-room. The Waiter, ooffee in nand., motions
us to follow him. "Of all the, &c," I hear Johnnie muttering as he
walks along, anathemas not loud but deep, and I perfectly agree with
him. We enter a small room, commanding a view of the Piazza,
which is something, but in all other respects a mere repetition of any
old-fashioned smoking-room in the hotel of an old-world English
cathedral town, with the usual "writing-materials," consisting of
half a sheet of measly-looking blotting-paper, a small oheap ink-
stand, with very little ink in it, and a steel pen that looks as if it
had been used as a pipe-picker, the inevitable Bradshaw of a date
long past, one or two advertising books on the table, and some adver-
tising pictures on the walls. "And this," exclaims Johnnie, "is
civilisation in Home! I Not smoke in the Restaurant after dinner!!
Bah! I've got a precious good mind to chuck the whole thing up,
and go straight back to Monte Carlo." And so great is the upset to his
habits and ideas of social enjoyment, that, but for my undertaking
to interview the landlord on the subject and obtain some concession,
he would, as he expresses it, chuck up the whole bag of tricks,
which includes St. Peter's, the Vatican, the Coliseum and all that
makes Rome Rome, and go back Ate etnunc to Monte Carlo, "Where,"
as he says, "at all events a fellow is in a civilised place, and can
smoke at his own
table, in his own
hotel, and take his
ease at his inn."
I promise fur
ther, on condition
of his remaining,
to undertake all
the oioeroning
trouble, and to per-
sonally conduct nim
everywhere. "And
first of all," I say,
"as it 's raining,
let's drive to St.
Peter's, where we
can spend the afternoon." Agreed. Is this Rome, as seen from
the Roman Car, under a hood, on a pouring wet day t If it is, the
streets are scarcely wider than Chancery Lane, and the slush and
mud are far worse. _ But for the prospect of seeing St. Peter's, we
—both of us being in the same sweet humour—would paok up our
things and return to Monte Carlo.

First View of Borne from Triumphal Roman Car.

_ En route it occurs to me that I have to leave a card on a dis-
tinguished Monsignore dwelling within the precincts of St. Peter's.
As Johnnie speaks Italian, limited, but
apparently intelligible, I propose that he
shall aocompany me. He will with plea-
sure. We ascend the steps on the Vatican
side. We are challenged by one of the
Swiss Guards. The Merry Swiss Boy,
in canary-coloured uniform with zebra
stripes over it, is six foot two and very
courteous. He indicates where we may
find the Monsignore'9 door. Ascending
the stairs, we encounter a gorgeous
officer in a mediceval costume. Johnnie
is of opinion that he is a " noble guard."
The "Nobil Signor"—(I remember this
from the Page s Song in Oli Uguonotti
—" didicitie ftdeliter Italianas Operas"
—making "Opera" feminine—is evi-
dently of some use to a stranger in
Rome)—the Nobil Signor cannot be too
courteous. The Monsignore, he informs „ w0vji sir,™ 1»
us, lives on the "primo piano"—'
sounds as if he were a music - teacher — and thither we go.
We are admitted by Monsignore's concierge, a little snuffy man
in threadbare black, like a second-rate lawyer's clerk, into a com-
paratively unfurnished apartment, where he is keeping himself
warm with snuff and a small charcoal fire in a bratero,—at least,
suoh Johnnie tells me is the name of the large frying-pan without a
handle, filled with charcoal at a white heat. I intrust the letter for
Monsignore to him, and am rather relieved at being informed that
Monsignore is not at home. We leave the primo piano, and descend
the steps. After passing with great politeness the last of the Merry
Swiss Guards, we once more breathe freely, and, having so far done
our duty, we turn towards St. Peter's. Grand! Then we mount
the steps. Then timidly and cautiously we push at a door, and in
another second we are in St. Peter's. For a minute or so we can only
look about us, dazed, then we regard each other, curiously, as if we
had expected some transformation of our personal appearance. No;
here we are, the same that we were outside—and yet . . . well . . .
awestruck is the word. Overpowering! I had been told I should
be disappointed. Disappointed! If it were only to have oome here
for this one short visit that I had travelled from London, I should
have been more than repaid by the coup (Tail on first entering this

churohwardenism of suburban gentility finds no echo on the walls
of the New English Art Club at the Egyptian Hall. A daring unoon-
ventionality in selection of subject ana in treatment is the main
characteristic of the pictures here exhibited. A bold, original,
impudent lot are these New Englanders, but they are notwithstanding
wonderfully refreshing. Sometimes their spirits are too much for
their strength, and they oome tremendous " croppers." It has been
well said that a strikingly original writer occasionally writes absolute
nonsense, and by the same rule an artist, who turns aside from the
well-swept, carefully watered,,
mathematically paved aca-
demic high-road, must not in-
frequently paint absolute non-
sense ; but he thinks for him-
self, he does not view Nature
through the spectacles of others,
and in nine cases out of ten he
is likely to produce works that
will be successful in the long
run. A great feature in this
exhibition is the ability to make
pictures out of the most com-
monplace subject. Among the
more notable contributors may
be mentioned: —John S. Sar-
jeant, Solomon J. Solomon,
Whistler, B. Sickert, Tuke,
Edward Stott, A. Roche, N.
Garstin, G. Koussell, Sidney
Starr, F. Brown, A. Mann, H.
Vos, W. J. Laidlaw, and J. E.
Christie. Though there are
some pictures among the col-
lection will make the casual
visitor jump, there are not a
few will make him think.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.


Ain't-i-Bealioui!
DAY-DREAM. OR NIGHTMARE P
ohfortably seated in his easy-
chair, Mr. Punch was reading
the proceedings of the London
County Counoil, when his eyes
gradually closed, and, for a brief
moment, he seemed to lose con-
sciousness. But only for a brief
moment, as almost immediately
he found himself in a large
oiroular ohamber of imposing
proportions, which he knew
intuitively was situated some-
where in the City., This apart-
ment was filled with a number
of exceedingly strange - looking
individuals. Amongst them, here
and there, Mr. Punch recognised
a face he knew, but, take them as
a body, they fostered the impres-
sion that they were decidedly like fish out of water. The strange-
looking individuals seemed to be holding a meeting.
"My Lord!" shouted one of the Oddities.
"You must not say that," interrupted a youthful, rosy-cheeked,
clean-shaved and generally prosperous-
looking gentleman, who appeared to be
presiding. "If you want to address me.
please call me 'Sir';—I am not 'My Lord
at all while I am in this Chair."
"Well, Sir, or Mister, or Boss, or"what-
ever you like, look here. I have a Reso-
lution to move."
"It will be better to move it when we have
disposed of the business before us—the
adoption of the Report of the Sub-com-
mittee."
"But then it will be too late," argued the speaker, "I've a friend
who ought to have been on this very Committee. For why f Because
he lives close to Victoria Park."
"Nonsense; bosh; shut up!" observed a gentleman, who it was
understood was the great originator of the whole
affair, and who seemed to be very angry.
"I won't shut up. For why? He should be."
"Wot's 'is name?" asked a representative of
the British Workman.
"Jones." Then came a laugh, but
the Oddity, who was not to be discon-
certed, continued, "Yes, Jones, and a
very good name too, as you would jolly
soon find out if my friend was here,
and hadn't gone to India."
"Nonsense; bosh; shut up!" again
put in the great originator of the whole
affair, angrier than ever.
"Order, order!" observed the Chair-
man, "we really had better get on
with the matter before the Counoil, and adopt the Sub-committee's
Report."
Not a bit of it," shouted another Oddity. "Look here, you all
know my friend Brown, who lives close to the Militia Barracks, near
the London Fields. What, you don't? Then you ought to. Well,
he's the man for this very Sub-com-
mittee, because (d'ye see r) he knows
the locality. What I move is, put
him into it."
"But where is 'e?" asked the
representative of labour amongst the
paving stones.
"In China," was the reply. There-
upon followed laughter, and again
the great originator of the whole
affair expressed a hostile opinion
forcibly.

the Chairman, "the busi-

Thus apostrophised, a portly presence put in an appearance. But
scarcely a word could be spoken, there

interruptions.
"Surely we can now

the distracted Chairman.

"'Ear, 'ear!" exclaimed the representatives of beer and labour.
"But it won't be legal." remonstrated the Chairman, and appealing
to the Solioitor of the body, he added, "Now, will itP"
The man of law shook his head.
"Nonsense; bosh; shut up!" put in the great originator of the
whole affair, seemingly with a view to keeping up the average
number of his remarks. As he made these inspiriting observations,
a neighbour asked, with a sigh, "Why ever did 1 give up the
Kensington Parliament?"
Then as the Chairman looked about him distractedly, there were
shouts of "Jones!" and "Brown!" and "Nuts, oranges, and ginger-
beer !" and even " Police!" Then—after a long pause—all was silent.
• • • m • •
"Dear me," said Mr. Punch, "I suppose I must have been
asleep I" He picked up the paper that had fallen from his hands
and read, "Meeting of the London County Counoil!" He paused,
considered, and added, " Humph! wonder if my dream was anything
like it!"'
Then rising from his chair, he observed, with a smile, " Lively for

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON COMMISSION.
April 9, 10, 11, and 12.—With commendable self-sacrifice, Sir
Charles Russell, having; completed his excellent Abridgment of the
History of Ireland, set himself to the task of examining the evidence
produced before the Commission
have shirked so dry a subject,
preferring to rest his defence
of the clients whose interests
he had in charge upon his elo-
quent rivalry of the feats of
MACAULAY, LlNGARD, PlNNOCK,
and (place aux dames!) Mrs.
Markham. But this did not
satisfy the ex-Attomey-Gene-
ral • so for many days we have
had an exhaustive analysis of
the savings of the witness-box,
that is calculated to assuage
the thirst for information of
the most exigeant devourer of
Irish testimony. Taking ad-
vantage of this (to him) welcome
lull in the proceedings, the
ticket - dispensing and
A lawyer of less discretion might

courteous Secretary has had quite a little holiday. It is true that
on the Friday, when Sir Charles was at his very best (and how
good that best was only those present can ever know), the Court
was crowded in every part, and then he certainly had his work cut
out for him. At other times he has been almost at rest.
To return to the feature of the sitting—in one part of his admirable
speech, Sir Charles asked "was there not Boycotting at the
Bar P and assuredly the fact that a certain humble individual,
is not Lord Chancellor, suggests that possibly the answer should
be in the affirmative. But, as that is a personal matter, let it
pass. However, 1 think it only right, in support of my learned
friend's contention, to confess that, had I been in the place of (say)
the Attorney-General during the early references to the conduct
of this very case, my bearing would have been distinctly different.
On the first day I notioed that Sir Richard left the Court. Now
I humbly submit that it would have been better had he remained
and comported himself in the following fashion. He should have
talked with well-assumed jocularity in an inaudible undertone to
Sir Henry James, watching for the appearance of Sir Charles's
snuff-box. The moment the refreshment-affording exhibit was pro-
duced, he should have asked for " a pinch," as a proof that, in spite
of some provocation, he bore no ill-feeling to his opponent. Having
secured the "rappee" he should have inhaled the invigorating pre-
paration of tobacco in the customary fashion. If a gigantic sneeze
had thereupon followed (even in the most impressive part of Sir
Charles's eloquent address), a smile on the faces of all present
would, no doubt, have been the well-merited reward of the mirth-
provoking manoeuvre. Supposing that the orator had shown signs
of pardonable annoyance, Sir Richard might have good-naturedly
pretended that it was the fault of Mr. Locxwood, whose fame as an
accomplished farceur requires no acknowledgment. Thereafter, pro-
mising to be quiet for the future, he might have gently slumbered
until awakened by the bustle consequent on the mid-day adjourn-
ment, I can only add that, should my engagements permit the sacri-
fice, I will willingly hold the Attorney-General's next brief for
him, so that he may have an opportunity of studying from the well
of the Court, the method that has my recommendation.
Once more returning to the event of the fortnight, I can only
declare that Sir Charles's peroration was in sober seriousness
magnificent, and made the deepest impression. During its delivery
(thanks to a quaint fancy of Mr. Ccninohame) I was occupying,
a place amongst the Plaintiffs, and I candidly confess I was
deeply moved—nay, unmanned—by my learned friend's noble
eloquence. I felt conscious that at that moment I must have looked
like a maudlin Timet witness in a condition of tearful repentance.
Still I think it is only right to say (much as I regret to have to
make such an observation), that had the task of addressing the
Court fallen to me, I should have made a very, very different oration.
And, I venture to add, I do not believe that even my learned friend
himself will question the probable truth of such an assertion.

The Hazard of the Dye.
[It appears from an article in the Daily Telegraph, entitled, "Dyeing to
Lire," that grey-headed toilers find it ulmost impossible to earn a living
without dyeing their hair.]

To have become more terrible and trying.

MEATHROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS.
_" Somehow, I fancied that London was suoh an ugly Capital," said
Sir Titus Macduff, ex-Premier of the South-West Windward Isles,
as he stood, in company with an intelligent Cicerone, on the site of
what was once Smithneld Market. As far as eye could reach nothing
was to be seen but waving greenery, verdant lawns, and sheep peace-
fully browsing by the side of purling brooks.
'' You must have been away from England a long time P " suggested
his companion.
"For thirty years," replied the distinguished Colonist.
'' Ah, then perhaps you never heard of an article in the Nineteenth
Century for April, 1889, written by Lord Meath, advocating Open
Spaces, Boulevards, Pure Water, Covered Streets, and Publio Bands,
for the Metropolis?"
'' Never!" replied Sir Titus: 1' and do you mean that this Park is
a result of that single article?
"Not only this Park, which stretches from the Thames, at Black-
friars Bridge to King's Cross, but the general transformation of
London into a City where life is a pleasure for all classes, is due to
the initiative of Lord Meath, and the energetic action of the London
County Council, which came into existence the very year that the
article I have mentioned was written."
"Dear me!" said the Colonist. "I hardly know where I am.
Take, me to some plaoe I can remember. Take me to Regent Street."
They set off on toot, and soon were pacing along a broad thorough-
fare running westward, planted with trees on either side, and orna-
mented here and there with tasteful kiosques, where light refresh-
ments and still lighter literature were on sale at an extremely
reasonable price. Whenever they felt tired they could sit down on
elegant and comfortable seats, under glass awnings, and at frequent
intervals bands of native musicians were discoursing excellent music
on stringed instruments,
"These bands, now," said the Colonial visitor, "who pays for
them P _ Is it some philanthropic Society?"
"It is Society in general, Sir," his companion rejoined, "whioh
has unquestionably become of late very philanthropic. This and
other public improvements have been provided for partly out of the
rates, but still more out of an extremely moderate and equitable tax
placed on Metropolitan Ground-Landlords, and representing a very
small part of the enhanced value whioh their property gains during
every year that London continues to exist and grow bigger."
"Dear me!" said the Antipodean Statesman, regretfully: "I
wish I had thought of that plan in the South-West Windward
Islands. Pay for Improvements out of the pockets of Ratepayers
and Ground-Landlords; a case of ground landlords and ground
tenants, in fact. An excellent notion! By the bye, what is the
name of this street—or rather this avenue P"
"Holborn, Sir."
"Holborn! What! That narrow, dirty, ill-conditioned"
"No other, Sir, I assure you," replied his conductor, coolly. The
ex-Premier was too surprised to say anything, and continued silent
till they reached a broad open space where fountains and operatic
bands were both playing, and from which four magnificent roads
diverged.
"What is that noble Arcade like street covered over with glass,
and adorned with evergreen shrubs and the electric light P" asked
the dazed Colonist.
"That, Sir? Surely you have not forgotten Regent Street P"
"Regent 8treet turned into an Arcade!"
"Yes. The whole of London is more or less Arcadian," rejoined
the satellite.
"You must be very grateful to Lord Meath for all this," said
Sir Trrus, thoughtfully.
"Grateful is not the word, Sir. A new and much finer West-
minster Abbey has recently been erected, solely out of penny contri-
butions from the working-classes, to which the remains of Lord
Meath, the Editor of the Nineteenth Century, and the Chairman of
the London County Council, will all be consigned, when those great
benefactors of their race are unhappily no more."
"Dear me!" exclaimed the _ Colonist. "And you—you talk
remarkably well for a person hired by the day to escort visitors
about. Where were you educated P"
"Where everybody who desires to make the most of his oppor-
tunities receives his education nowadays," replied the Cicerone,
proudly. "At a Polytechnic"
'' Polyteohnio! What in the name of wonder is that P"
"Nobody but a Polynesian oould ask the question. Sir;" and
receiving his modest remuneration, the Cicerone retired for two
hours' private reading into the nearest Free Library, while Sir Trrus
Macduff stood in a state of bewilderment gazing on the beauties of
regenerated London.

[Hardly a week passe* without oar hearing of one
or more dangerous accidents at foot-ball.]
A manly frame it is, I think,
Although in private be it spoken,

shrink
That hones
may be too
often broken.
I snapped my
clavicle last
week.

rib of an um-
brella;
And sprained
my ankle, not

Of something
wrong with

Last season, too, my leg I broke,
And lay at home an idle dreamer,
It's not considered quite a joke
To contemplate a broken femur.
And when, despite the doctor's hints,
Again at foot- ball I had tussles,
I found myself once more in splints.
With damaged gastronemio muscles.
Some three times every week my head,
Is cut, contused, or sorely shaken;
My friends expect me brought home dead,
But up to now I 're saved my bacon.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Accordino to statistics, the state of the
children of the State is hardly as satisfactory
as it might be. Therefore the re-issue of
Miss Davkntort-Hill's book, edited by Miss
Fanny Fowke, is especially welcome. The
new edition of Children of the State has been
so enlarged, so re-arranged, and so entirely
brought up to date, that it is practically a
new book. In a closely printed volume of over
three hundred pages, there is scarcely any
point in this great question that is not dis-
cussed. Boarding-out in England, Ireland,
and Scotland, the workhouse, as home and
school, State and individual help, State chil-
dren in foreign lands and emigration, are
treated with a thoroughness and an earnest-
ness which is the key-note of the entire
volume. Notwithstanding all the great diffi-
culties attending a rapidly increasing popu-
lation, the Editor takes a somewhat nopeful
view of the subject, and does " not believe that
our great Empire has yet touched the limit
of her resources, or that she will ever become
unable to support her vast yet growing family,
if only she will bring up its members to be
capable and self-dependent." This volume
is emphatically one to be read and re-read.

DRINKING.
Nkw Sabbatarian Version.
Solitary Sot singeth:—
'Midst mirk and smoke I sit and soak
My clay in fiery liquor
From morn till night; find I get tight
In this way all the quicker.
With solemn pate let wisdom prate
Of freedom; to my thinking
Wisdom's an ass. _ I'm free—to pass
My day in drinking, drinking I
The Pubs are shut, but I've my butt—
Leastways a bulky bottle,
From which I swill my blooming fill
With an insatiate throttle.
My wife's asleep, my children creep
From dad's fierce anger shrinking.
J've comfort true the Sabbath through,
In drinking, drinking, drinking!
Then come what may, in Wilfrid's way,
Of shutting Pubs on Sunday,
What odds '< I choose at home to booze
From Saturday till Monday.
Don't care a rush whilst I've the lush,
And o'er my bottle blinking,
Can sit alone, till Sunday's gone,
Still drinking, drinking, drinking!
Nomenclature.—Rude Radicals persist in
calling Mr. Chambeblaln "Judas," The
reason is obvious if inadequate. Judas
"carried the bag," and the Gladstonians
want to give Joseph "the sack."

smoking-room was always overcrowded. Grans Young Gardner
made similar complaint as to condition of tea-room. Never a chair
to be had. Sage, always eager to act as mediator, suggested
that tea-room should be made into smoking-room, smoking-room
into tea-room. More about the gas and the electric light: then

thought he was going to get a few Votes, too much for trained
equanimity. Bursts upon Cresler like tornado.
"People," he says, turn away from proceedings of House with
weariness and disgust."
"Oh! oh!" shouted the shocked Radicals below the Gangway.
Fancy being disgusted with Cremkk re-delivering speech calculated
to raise him in estimation of the 'orny-'anded! First speech a
success; why shouldn't he have encore, especially as he had verse or
two forgotten at first essay P Plunket blushed, minimised and
apologised. When he had said public turned away wearied and
disgusted, had only meant that they were not so profoundly inter-
ested as they should be.
Got his Vote for Maintenance of Public Buildings; fresh discussion
on Motion to cut off £500 from cost of Embassy at Rome. This
brought up George Campbell, who created some surprise by
supporting full expenditure. Let out that he had been lately in
Rome; had lunohed with Ambassador. "Ah, ah! "shouted Radi-
cals, louder even than they had cried " Oh, oh!" at Plunket.
Incident suggested to Sage one of those interesting reminiscences
of his diplomatic career, with whioh he occasionally favours listening
Senate. When he was in Diplomatic Service, Ministers were always
bothered with persons calling with notes of introduction from Foreign
Offioe. These they called soup-tickets because they generally led to
provision of luncheon or dinner. Found worth Minister's while;
otherwise be trouble in the House of Commons. George Campbell
evidently had one of those tickets when he called on Minister at Rome,
and now, contrary to habit, felt bound to oppose Motion to reduce Vote.
Committee delighted with, this picture of austere uncompromising
Kiroaldy seduced by free luncheon. Business done.—Very little.
Thursday.—Letterkenny battering-ram at it again. John Moblky
first dragged it in with its clanking chains. Windbag Sexton,
groping around after his manner, gleaning in other people's fields
opportunities of eliciting from Ministerial Bench the dearly-loved
reference to "Right Hon. Gentleman," brought it in to-night. But
MacNetll did best of all.
"As this bathering-ram has been bought out of public funds," he
saidj dexterously shifting hot potato to other side of his mouth,
"will the Right Hon. Gentleman lay a model of it on the table?"
House laughed, but Balfour so struck with idea, sat silent.

BALFOUR ON HIS BATTERING-RAM.
A HA8TIE JUDGMENT.
By a Vindictive Victim of the Lam's
Delay.
[Mr. Hastie, at the April meeting
of the Incorporated Law Society, is
reported to have said that the con-
fidence of the public in the members
of his profession had been "greatly
shaken/']
Greatly shaken? Not a bit!
"l is a statement of the oddest.
Hastie must be slow of wit,
And he's very muoh too modest.
"Confidence," a Statesman said,
"Is a plant of growth most
tardy."
But when once established
'Tis perennial, and hardy.
Confidence in Lawyers? Pooh!
That tree ne'er firm root has
taken.
And a tree that never grew,
Surely, surelycan'tbe"shaken."
Superstition at St. Stephen's.
—Is it the duty of the Govern-
ment to keep a House on Friday
night? This question has pro-
bably been raised by some repre-
sentative of an onlightened con-
stituency who believes Friday to
be an unlucky day.
Free—but not Easy.
Free Schools may be a blessing
to the Nation,
But in these days of fads and
fiddle-de-dee,
Punch fancies that the best "Free
Eduoation"
Is that which teaches Britons
to be free.
A-RANTING AVE WILL GO.
Political Humtino Song foe tub Sbason.
(A long way after Henry Fielding.)
Air—" A-Hunting we will go."
The dusky night begins to fly,
And brighter grows the morn;
The Party wants a winning Cry.
To help exalt its horn.
So a-ranting we will go-o-o,
A-ranting we will go!
It is the mode, to Party owed
And a-ranting we will go.
Cool sense the Spouter may oppose,
Sweet Spring may beg his stay:
"Good Sir, the early primrose blows.
You will not rant to-day?"
But a-ranting he will go, &c.
Listeners to rant in yonder hall
Secure to find we '11 seek;
For why, they shouted, great and small,
At the same rant last week.
So a-ranting we will go, &c.
Away he goes, before the rout,
Whose ears for tickling itch.
He throws them in, he throws them out;
He leaves them in the ditch.
But a-ranting they will go, &c.
At length his twaddle, threadbare worn,
He stops. They yell delight.
He bows, and swears—with secret scorn—
He '11 spout another night.
For a-ranting he must go-o-o,
A-ranting he must go.
In all the mode, to Party owed,
And a-ranting he must go.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
No book sells better than the volume of
short stories, or the collection of essays and
descriptive papers, and yet for years past pub-
lishers have refused
to let us have them,
and have dosed us
with three volumes
of twaddle or unread-
able polemical no-
vels. It is a satis-
faction to find the
providers of literary
food are beginning
to see the error of
their ways, and to be
convinced that the
British Publio must,
before anything else, be amused. They will
get plenty of amusement out of Mr. William
Henderson's Clues, which consists of nine
stories derived from a Chief Constable's note-
book. The author ought to know something
of his subject, seeing he is now Chief Constable
of Edinburgh, that he occupied a similar
post at Leeds, and was formerly Chief In-
spector of the Detective Department at Man-
chester and Glasgow. Each story is, in the
main, a reproduction of facts, and they
have that reality and interest which facts
alone can give. The Chief Constable of
Edinburgh has arrested our attention; we are
unable to move on, for we have found lis-
tening to his entertaining recitals anything
but hard labour.
That none but an Irishman can write Irish
songs is pretty generally accepted. This axiom
receives further proof—if proof were needed—
in Mr. Alfred Percival Graves' Father
O' Flynn and other Irish Lyrics. This book
which consists of a choice selection of the
author's previous volumes printed in a cheap
and handy form, cannot fail to be popular. It
contains well-nigh sixty poems full of grace
and endless in variety, and above all a " go,"
a spirit and a National flavour that none
but an Irish bard could accomplish.
Those who are in search of a weird and grue-
some tale dramatically told cannot do better
than turn to Marion Crawford's latest effort,
Griefenstein. I can confidently recommend
it. It is a grim but very powerful bit of work.
Those who know Zola only from such
works as La Terre, Nana, and so forth, should
take the trouble to read his Le Reve. The
trouble after the first few chapters will soon
be a pleasure, and the pleasure will soon be
increased and intensified as progress is made
with the story. The style of the descriptions
throughout, though at first sight as tedious
as those of Walter Scott's to a modern
go-a-head novel-reader, will gradually force
even the most knowing skipper to retrace his
steps, and go over the ground deliberately.
The author's characteristic insistence on
details would be blameable did it tend to
diminish the interest which he has created in
the central figures; but, as it does not do so,
it is masterly. Altogether the work is a
beautiful study of a lovelv life, as far exalted
above ordinary types as, let us hope, some of
the lives in his other works are exceptionally
below them. The last scene of all is a grand
conception, sweet in harmony, rioh in tone,
powerful in design and execution. C'est
magnifique, mais ce n'est pa* La Terre, says,
The Baron de Book-Worms.

A RUMINATION.
Br a Loafer of Nature.
How vainly men with toil themselves amaze
To justify their scanty holidays.
Far happier he who, when he will, can range
And find a holiday in every change.
'Tis early spring, and, weary of the town,
Where tricks and mortar keep their wintry
frown,
I seek the waking woods, the meadows fair
Where countless larkB are taking boundless
air.
The creaking waggon half a mile away
Sounds through the stillness of the hazy day.
And cocks clear-crowing from the dwindled
stack
Recall the legends of the House of Jack.
Like living boulders, in the sweet thick turf,
Where daisies break the green in soundless
surf,
Whisking with lazy tails the flies away,
The kine enjoy their livelong holiday.
Along the sloping field the shining share
Turns the rich earth to the rejoicing air;
The smallest fretting of each pcncill'd spray
Shows clear against sun-saturated grey,
Which waits, light-laden, till a breeze comes
To spul the sunlight all about the sky.
Like blotting-paper of serener spheres
Earth soaks the sunshine as the heaven clears,
And in the clean new light the dazzling ducks
Quack glad Amens to April's Fiat Lux.'
At early dawn's unseasonable hour
The legion-sparrow tests his vocal pow'r,
Pierces with myriad chirp the sleeping ear,
And scares his breakfast, if First Worms
could hear.
Strange that the rural sun should rise so long
Before the kettle tunes its matin song;
Yet I forgive the choristers in brown.
And revel in the thought, "I'm out of town!''
Now the maturer day the mind invites
To ponder pleasantly on past delights.
Here is the loft, where spite of heave and
choke.
On wet half-holidays we used to smoke.
There is the pond, with downy willows girt,
Wherein we often fell and took no hurt;
There on still nights a paper fleet would float,
An end of candle burning in each boat;
Then flew the pebbles from the threaten'd
shore,
Till the frail navy sunk to rise no more.
Then in each brook and tree for miles around
Playmates in feathers or in fur we found,
Studied their ways; and, braving broken
bones, [stones;
Bore off the eggs, and stock'd the nests with
8et the brisk terrier on the bright-eyed rat,
And hurled the javelin at the flying cat,
Caught in brick traps the warblers of the
wood, [them good.
Cooked them impromptu, and pronounced
Oh, vivid joys of youth! Maturer age
Sighs at the ashes of that noble rage,
Leans on the gate, and hears the fragrant
kine [dine.
Breathe frequent grace, while they unceasing
While long-legged lambs their patient mothers
tease,
Or crop the grass devoutly on their knees.
Though now a song can close at hand be heard,
Nor raise a frantic wish to catch the bird,
Grant sun and shade, and 'tis enough for me,
Like the unharass'd kine to browse, and be!

THERE AND BACK. (ON THE CHEAP.)
Sir,—I trust you will not think that I am trespassing too much on your valuable space
when I tell you that I am at present engaged on a scheme whereby, in conjunction with a
Committee of earnest and active Philanthropists, I hope to be able to furnish an opportunity
to a large number of unemployed East-end Loafers, Ticket-of-Leave Men, Lunatio Paupers,
and others whose circumstances would not admit of their finding funds themselves for the
purpose, of paying a fortnight's visit to Paris, and of witnessing the Exhibition and all the
other famed sights which have made the Frenoh capital the very centre and focus of all
intellectual and recreative pleasure. We calculate that there will be some fourteen or
fifteen thousand of these worthy fellows anxious to avail themselves of the chance we
propose to offer them, and we are at the present moment in ths process of preliminary
negotiation with the various ltailway Companies, Hotel Proprietors, and other official inter-
mediaries, with a view to providing for their transit and accommodation, and for those other
little extra privileges upon which we calculate to make the trip a thoroughly enjoyable affair.
Our final programme is not yet fully drawn out, but, roughly speaking, it may be taken
to be much as follows:—The oharge per head will be £1 5*. For this sum we hope to
Erovide First-class Railway and Boat journey to Paris and back; superior accommodation in
andsomely-furnished apartments, including breakfast, luncheon and dinner at the table
d'hote at either the Qrand or Continental Hotels, or at some equally unexceptionable and
thoroughly high-class establishment; an invitation to a State Banquet at the British
Embassy, with entry each night to a fauteuil d'orchestre in one of the leading theatres,
use of a two-horse voiture de remise, and free admission to the Exhibition, including a
champagne luncheon on the top of the Eiffel Tower. We also mean to throw in a forty-
franc dinner (exclusive of wine) at Big nun's, or at some other first-class Restaurant, in the
belief that the experience will be found useful as a means of throwing some light on the
social problems which will naturally present themselves for solution to the casual tourist
who, it may be supposed, is probably visiting Paris for the first time, and is probably a
stranger to this phase of French social existence.
We have not yet absolutely concluded any of the above arrangements, but we trust to
your kindness to give the scheme publicity in your columns. An East End Incubus.

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
THIRTEENTH EVENING.
I 8aw a small country village in a great state of excitement the
other afternoon," said the Moon. "I should think there were as
many as twenty people in the main street—all talking at once. A
monkey belonging to some travelling! Italians had broken loose, and
caused a universal panic.
It had bitten the plumber's
baby, and tried to bite the
Sostmistress's leg; it had
own through back gardens
and over cottage roofs,
screeching and gibbering
like some malevolent imp-
no one felt Bafe. One old
maid, with great presence of
mind had shut up her oat
and kitten in the Dest par-
lour, and hidden herself
upstairs under the bed; the
only policeman had been
*" sent for in a hurry. And
the cause of all'this commotion had escaped to a small knoll of
gorse-covered common above the village, where several of the bolder
spirits had pursued it. Some of them were armed with fire-irons,
and one of them carried a large cotton umbrella as a shield, and
they came cautiously on, while the monkey (which was quite a small
one, and almost as much frightened. as they were) ran on a little
ahead, stopping occasionally to look back and chatter its teeth at
them—when they stopped too. The village carpenter, who was
famous as a local wag, had brought his saw, and every now and
then would prance at the animal, and brandish his saw in comic
defiance. One'of the Italians, an old woman, did not understand
that he was only pretending, and went on her knees to him, clasping
her hands and imploring him in her voluble tongue not to cut off the
monkey's head. And when she did this, the carpenter only pranced
the more, while the village people, looking on in safety from the road
below, guffawed heartily, and declared that' Tommy was better nor
play-acting—darn them, if he weren't 1' Then the monkey ran off
into the wood, and I lost sight of it. But, later in that evening, I
saw a sad little procession going down the "street. First came the
village constable, looking very stern and majestic, for he had never
had a case of this importance to deal with before, with his hand on
the shoulder of the monkey's master, an elderly Italian, who seemed
to expect nothing less than instant execution. Behind came the old
woman, weeping and gesticulating and protesting all at once, and,
after her, a tail of jeering boys, who kept at a safe distance, for fear
the monkey—which had come back obediently on hearing its master's
voice—should break loose again. The only quite unconcerned person
in the party was the monkey itself, which was huddled, snug and
contented, inside the Italian s coat, where it seemed very thankful
to be back again. I do hope they were not separated, for it was not
a savage animal naturally—only the children had been teasing it so
all day. But it happened to be cloudy that evening, and for many
evenings after that, said the Moon, "so I never knew what was
actually done to the unfortunate monkey."
a couple of giants. I can scarcely believe my eyes, but so it is,
and Johnnie and myself are never tired of walking up to these
deceptive full-grown cherubs, coming on them unexpectedly as it
were, and patting them on the hands and arms to ascertain whether
they are playing us any trick, and whether
they are the Anakim they seem. _ Yes,
there is a deception; it is the deception of
perfect proportion. Every day we go into
St. Peter's, but these happy-looking baby-
giants exercise an unaccountable^fascina-
tion over us, and on our last visit we are
quite sad at the idea of leaving
behind, but being unable to take them
with us, we pat the backs of these chubby
Brobdingnagians, and bid them affection-
ately good-bye. And the last souvenir of
St. Peter's that will remain indelibly in
my memory, is the sweet-tempered smile
on the faces of the two giant-babies—the
oly-" water Babies"—nearest our door of |
DUE SOUTH.


St. Peter's — Solvilur Ambulando — Masonry — Ways and Means —

The size of St. Peter's! I mentally compare it with everything
big I have ever seen. Johnnie, having partially recovered his self-
possession and the use of his voice, says, "Look here, I 'U step it. I
measured my back drawing-room for a billiard table by stepping it,
and so I can easily get an idea of its size." He at once sets to work
in order to give praotical effect to his theory of measurement, and he
sets about it with as much care, caution, and "strict attention to
business," as if he were giving an imitation of a man walking on a
tight-rope without a balancing-pole. After three attempts, eaoh of
which signally fails, on account of his inability to preserve a straight
line, when he, as it were, topples off his imaginary rope, comes to the
ground, and loses his reckoning up to that point, he gives it up,
shakes his head solemnly, and says, "Oh. it's enormous! "Why,
St. Paul's is nowhere compared with this!" I recall to mind the
monumental effigies in St. Paul's, any one of which is a doll by the
side of any one of the figures in St. Peter's. And then the London
grubbiness of St. Paul's, its dinginess, its lecture-room benches
crowding the centre, and its chilly dreariness; whereas here all is
space, colour, light and life. Glorious! Everyone knows, by hearsay
at all events, about the size of those chubby "little boys who support
the holy-water Btoups at the entrance. Come up close, and though
you are perfectly prepared for a surprise, yet your astonishment is
not a whit the less at finding the stoups baths, and the little boys
exit craning towards us. Baying as plainly

Pouring rain. The streets of London not "in it" with those of
Rome for slosh and mud. Here in this museum of antiquities, the
home of classic Art and ancient frescoes, the principal mural decora-
tion that catches my eye at almost every turn is that charming
picture of a fine and fascinating decoUet&e female, with yellow hair
streaming down her back,—the fair one with the golden locks,—
so well known to all Londoners as the pictorial advertisement of
Mrs. Somebody's Hair Restorer. This, apparently, is the most
striking fresoo in the City of the Popes and Cfesars, but, as the
Coesars are defunot, they oan't interfere;
and, as the Pope's daily constitutional is
unconstitutionally limited to the Vatican
grounds, His Holiness possibly, is not
aware how the city is being vulgarised.
Yet the obtrusive presence of this leering
woman representing Mrs. Somebody's
Hair Restorer on the walls of the Eternal
City, does recaU to my mind a proverbial
saying which seems peculiarly applicable
in this instance; namely, "See Rome and
dye."
The truth of another proverb, that
"Rome was not built in a day," is
borne in upon us with irresistible force
at every turn. "Rome built in a day!"
cries Johnnie. "Why, they're at it
now!" Balbus and Caius, who were Balbus and Caius, a.d. 188tf.
always building walls, by way of Latin
exercise, in our youth, are still at it, still building Rome in
a.u.c. 2640. They 're making quite a new Rome—a Haussmannish
Rome—of it. In another ten years Rome will possess splendid street*
(at least I am inartistic enough to hope so), and ample pavement
'also my sincere wish), and in its main thoroughfares it will be as
like Paris as the Balbi and Caii, carrying out their orders and
contracts, can make it.
"'Masonry' is condemned at Rome," Bays Johnnie, "and so it
ought to be, until the streets are widened, and pavement-makers
have been set to work."
"It's wonderfully picturesque, though," I say, referring to the
old'gate, old streets, old walls, and old houses.
"Very," returns Johnnie, coming cautiously out of a dark hole in
a wall where a small Roman greengrocer carries on his trade, and
in which JonNNiE has taken refuge from the dangerous proximity
of a recklessly-driven cab; "only I do object to there being no
pavement for foot-passengers."
As to the environs, on a pouring day like this, we might as well
be walking in a ploughed field. Fortunately we don't attempt it,
and having hired a Roman car with a hood and apron, we are driven
to "St. Paul's outside the "Walls,"—("I thought it couldn't be
'without the "Walls,"' says Johnnie, "or how on earth could it
stand up P ")—which is almost as great a wonder as St. Peter's.
During our short stay, we Bee everything that is possible to be
seen in the time; but Johnnie is thoroughly upset by the fact of
not being permitted to smoke after breakfast ana dinner in the res-
taurant of the hotel, and what with the heat of our bed-room, which
is next to the kitchen chimney, the noise of the street at night, and
the almost incessant rain, he is dissatisfied with everything—except a
dinner at the Caffi di Roma, and the chianti in a magnum flask—and
anxious to return as soon as possible to Monte Carlo, and so home.
We take a walk on the Pincio, and delight in the view. In il

constitutional. I suppose if one of these Roman students is out
without his academicals, there is no Roman Proctor and Bulldogs to
stop him and ask him for his name and college, and then fine him
six-and-eightpence.
Cabs are wonderfully cheap in Rome. In order to compete with
the recently-introduced omnibuses and tram-cars, the cab-pro-
prietors have reduced their tariff to half-a-franc for a course,'' but,"
says Johnnie, cheering up a bit, "no one gives less than a franc as
a matter of course." No pour-boire is expected, and if given, it is
received with gratitude. The price for diving about is two francs
the hoar, their pace is generally good, and if the thoroughfare be
crowded, with pedestrians and the street more
than usually dirty and narrow, then you may
rely upon his going at full Bpeed merely for
the humour of the thing, and you'll nave
plenty of excitement for your money.
On our last morning we go to see the pic-
tures and the statuary in the Vatican. We
have no catalogue.
"Don't want one," says Johnnie. "All
the names are on the things/.and I can'make
mems as I go along."
So, with big note-book and pencil, he walks
through the galleries, as if the Pope had been
sold up, and he, Johnnie Spofferd, were
the man in possession taking an inventory of
the plate, ornaments, and fixtures. "Look here!" he says,
suddenly drawing my attention to a small bust in the Hall of
Philosophers land Muses. "Fancy this being Socrates!" Yes,
fancy! "And yet," says Johnnie, "I seem to know the face.
Yes. It's uncommonly like the bust of Darwin in one of the
Kensington Museums."
In the Sistine Chapel we see several tourists lying supinely at full
length on the seats. "So irreverent, in a chapel, too! Just as if
they were resting after'a Turkish bath," says Johnnie. "Though,"
he adds, as he glances round, "it isn't much like a chapel to look at."
No it is not. More like a decorated Concert Hall. We gradually
become aware of the fact that the sprawling tourists are only deeply
interested in the work of Michael Angelo on the ceiling, and have
discovered that
the only way of
studying it satis-
factorily is on
their backs.
Johnnie is tired,
and pines for
Monte Carlo. I
rather think that
a telegram whicli
he receives on re-
entering our hotel
is a bogus one,
only intended to
give him a fair
excuse for saying
he must return at
once "on busi-
ness." As I must
make the best of
my way to Lon-
don, I decide to
accompany him,
hoping for another

"Bock agen!"
opportunity of seeing Rome at my leisure, and having a month to
do it in. We start.
Monte Carlo Revisited.—'' Great attraction!! For one night only!!!"
That is as far as I am concerned, only a day and a half and one
night. Lovely weather. Beautiful N.E. wind. Johnnie, who has
recovered his spirits, says jocosely, "Rather have had N.E. other
wind. But better than Rome. One can breathe here," and he
disappears into that unhealthy hot-house the Casino. At dinner,
he tells me he has met a man who has been awfully lucky playing
only on the thirties. That's his system. Meeting subsequently at
Zero's, Johnnie is looking weary and wom. Anything the'matter?
Yes, his system is upset. He wishes he had never met the man
who told him about the "thirties." He will leave Monte Carlo
. with me to-morrow morning. After all, no place like London.
London.—Black Fog. Certainly no place like London. We lose
sight of each other in the fog. Johnnie goes due East. I due South
more, only not farther than South Kent Coast. End of holiday.
IN THE NAME OF THE PROFIT—POSTERS!
(A Story of the next Budget.)
There had been roars of laughter in the House when the .Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer had referred to the proposed tax. "It
was utterly ridiculous, it would never increase the revenue by a
single penny." So said the greatest financiers of the day, but the
Right Hon. Gentleman merely smiled and held his peace.
On the morning following the annual statement, a business-
like individual stood in front of the Chancellor's table, extracting
drawings from a large carpet-bag for the Right Hon. Gentleman's
edification.
"I think Sir," said the businesslike individual, "that this should
prove attractive."
And then he unfolded an elaborate design, showing a belle of the
last century (with a white wig and black patches) dancing a minuet
with a beau in the costume of the same period.
"Is it bold enough?" asked.the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
gazing earnestly at the picture.
"For a commencement certainly," replied his visitor, "you see
we shall call attention to our svicialile in large letters underneath."
"As it is intended for the hoardings," observed the Chancellor,
"I fancy it would have been wiser to have secured a design from
the studio of Sir John Millais."
"You may be right," returned the other. "And now, Right Hon.
Sir, I must say farewell, as these pictures must be distributed
through the length and breadth of the land at once."
"I can rely upon you?" asked the Chancellor, earnestly.
"Until death!" was the answer—delivered from the nail, as the
businesslike individual was already quickly taking his departure.
The next day the financier of the Government perambulated the
streets stopping now and again to admire a magnificent picture of a
minuet as danced in the last century. Then he caught cold and was
ordered to the South of France for the sake of his health. He
selected Monaco as his resting-place. Partly because of the extreme
beauty of the locality, and partly because he had some business of
a private character to transact in Monte Carlo. This private business
at first engrossed his whole time, but after suffering a severe
pecuniary reverse, he had leisure to attend to other things. It was
then that he began to dip into the London papers and monthly
magazines, that had followed him into his retirement. He found
the picture of the minuet in many of them. Then he noticed
another design. A well-known Judge had evidently had an accident
while engaged in shaving. The engraving, however, was of a com-
forting character, for in it it was seen that the learned occupant of
the Bench had applied to the cut a piece of adhesive plaster.
"This looks like business," murmured the Chancellor.
Having received a remittance sufficient in amount to defray the
expenses of his passage home, the Right Hon. Gentleman was soon
again in London. For the remainder of the year his financial
duties detained him in Town, and during this period he was con-
stantly passing and repassing the hoardings of the Metropolis.
"That is very good," he observed on one occasion, as he noticed a
clever representation of Harold dying on the field of Hastings;
while the shade of a gontleman in the garb of the Nineteenth
Century sorrowfully hovered over him as he regretfully held up a
large box labelled invaluable for wounds." It is striking and
original! I really think my daring scheme will succeed."
Then his friends told him that they had also seen this touching
tableau in foreign parts. One had met it in Italy, another on the
Pyramids, a third in the Arctio Cirole. And the time passed quiokly.
and once again the day arrived for the delivery of the Annual
Financial Statement.
At the appointed hour the Right Hon. Gentleman was in his place.
He rose from his seat with a smile of triumph on his lips.
"Sir," said he, addressing the Speaker of the House of Commons,
'' I know that I am required to find Millions to defray the expense
attendant upon the entire rebuilding of London, the purchase m»ney
oi panperdom, the funds requisite for creating a fleet ten times as
powerful as that we now possess, and many other matters of minor
importance. Well, Sir — without adding a single penny to the
present taxation—I can produce the cash. I have an ample surplus,
sufficient to meet all requirements. And that surplus has been
obtained by the slight impost I put twelve months ago upon sticking-
plaster."
"Sticking-plaster!" cried the House of Commons en masse.
"Sticking-plaster! How was it made so productive?"
The Right Hon. Gentleman smiled, and then in a voice trembling
with patriotic emotion exclaimed, "Sticking-plaster has been puffed
into its present satisfactory position by the energy of ambitious
advertising 1"
Then followed a mighty shout of exultation, as the House realised
that England had once more been saved, and Britannia would
again rule the waves without adding anything extra to the Income

TELEPHONIC TALK;
Or, What We may Expect.
How delightful of the Authorities to have
opened telephonic communication to the pub-
lic, and to have installed a bureau for con-
versational purposes at every Post-office in
the United Kingdom.
It is so immensely convenient, and saves
one such infinite time and trouble, to be able
just to step across the way and communicate
directly with one's doctor, lawyer, man of
business, or any friend at a minute's notice.
Dear me, the office seems to me to be some-
what inconveniently crowded. This old lady
assures me that she has been waiting three
hours and a half but hasn't yet been "switched
on" to her solicitor.
At last I have secured an instrument! and
have explained what I want to my house agent.
I do wish the invalid old gentleman next
to me, who is communicating with his doctor,
would not bawl out all his symptoms at the
topof his voice.
Why, what is this? There surely must be
some mistake. It can't be my house agent
who is telling me just "to keep where I am,"
and he '11 soon "driveover in a four-wheeler
and do for me with a red-hot poker." This
must certainly be the reply from the escaped
lunatic of whom that middle-aged (jentle-

PROSPECT AND RETROSPECT.
A Surrey Cricketer's April Song.
Once more the wintry fogs take wing and pass,
Once more spring sunshine greens the sprouting grass;
The cricket-bag is taken from the wall,
The hopeful smiter eyes his well-kept ball,
And his prophetic fancy fondly fixes
On leather-flogging "fours" and spanking " sixes."
Ghack once again for practice rears the stumps,
Carefully " places," muscularly thumps.
Young willow-wielders in the sporting news bury
Their noses, seeking " notes " on Read and Shrewsbury,
The prospects of respective cricket " pots,"
The rival hopes of Surrey and of Notts.
But on the Surrey turf no more Bhall stand,
With nrm-jplaoed feet, keen eye, and steady hand,
Sturdy " \oung Stonewall." Chief of Surrey's joys,
Long since, one of the much praised " Surrey boys,"
Ere Surrey's star had risen as of late,
He has succumbed to the decree of fate.
No more with stolid care to " take his block,"
No more loose bowling o'er the field to knock;
No more, with Humphrey, to run up the score
With safety to a " century " or more
Ere the first parting eame, and " Tom " or " Harry"
To the pavilion back his bat would carry.
Lovers of " Good Old Surrey," when you crowd
Next to our dear old Oval, and are loud
In praise of " Walteh's" skill or Abel's "go,"
Or tireless Lohmann's scattering of the foe;
Cast back a kindly thought o'er twenty years;
Think of the time when the wide circle's cheers
Rose as the score-board showed " Two hundred up"
With One-Two-Six, not out, to—Harry Jupp!
A Popular Concert.—That between the Conservative
and Liberal Unionists at Birmingham.

A MERE HOMOEOPATHIC DOSE.
Mister Beer. "I say, Lord Champagne, here's something nasty Dr. Gos-
CHEN '8 GIVEN ME TO TAKE !—AND IT's OUT OF Dr. GLADSTONE'S OLD PRESCRIP-
TION. I REMEMBER IT. UoH I"
Lord Champagne. "My dear Sir, that's nothing. Dr. Goschkn pre-
scribed for my Consumption last year, and my Fizzical condition has
improved wonderfully. You'll hardly know you've taken it, and the
results will be highly satisfactory, I'm sure."
THE CHAUNT OF THE CHANCELLOR.
Mr. Ooschen sings:—
'Tis hard indeed for the Exchequer
To keep up its financial pecker,
When so much to its loss and hurt is meant
By tricks of trade and loud Advertisement.
They've found, for instance—dodge unholy!
Tobacco that will smoke more slowly
Than do old " Birdseyes," and old"
And that depletes my Money Bags.
Smokers, in your cheap opiate heaven, you
Forget how you pull down the Revenue.
Fast-smoking Baccys now men can't sell, or
Will not, so Pity a poor Chancellor!
I trust, my dear " consuming classes,"
You like slow whiffs, but you are asses.
If possible you fondly judge it
To smoke cheap and not spoil my Budget.
Coffee again! Confound the berry!
Coffee uont move! Ah, you are merry,
But J don't feel like " Lika Joko."
It's all along of puffed-up Cocoa,
And Advertising arts sensational;
I call the rascals anti-national.
"Gratefuland comforting?" Fiddle-de-dee!
It is not comforting to me '.
"Coffee is dull." Why don't the roasters
Go in for big and flaming posters P
But no, that's not to be expected.
The berry's foolishly neglected
It's berry sad! (Excuse the pun, I
Must make finance a little funny
Just to keep up my reputation
As the first joker in the nation.)
Then tea again is disappointing
My Budget plans still more disjointing.
Those who like strong tea, and are stingy,
Go in for the cheap brands from " Ingy.
In plaoe of Souchong and of Pekoe.
My tax on Pommery and Clicquot
Has answered—tribute to my nous.'—and
Realised eight and thirty thousand
More than the estimate 1 Still nathless
It doesn't leave the Exchequer scathless.
If people, in a style provoking
Will nave cheap drinking and slow smoking,
A Chancellor will be more puzzled
Than when they freely puffed and guzzled;
And they must give him what he axes
In little compensating Taxes.
LAWCOURT-ESY.
Sir,—The treatment which Jurors reoeive
in this so-called enlightened country is even
worse than your Correspondent " Locked Up
for Two'Days" represents. His experience'of
ten years ago is, no doubt, interesting to
the public, however painful it may have been
to himself. But I can supplement it with an
account of the really barbarous ill-usage to
which I and eleven other respectable citizens
were subjected only last week. At lunch-time
we were conducted to an apartment where we
were actually invited to regale ourselves with
a repast consisting of chops and potatoes (the
latter half-boiled), bread and cheese, and beer!
No champagne! No side-dishes! Even whis-
key and water was declared by the attendant
(whose demeanour when I asked for that
beverage was quite offensive) to be "not
allowed by their Lordships." Comment is
needless. I can only say that I refused to
attend to a word of the summing-up, and
deliberately convicted a prisoner, who I have
every reason to believe was as innocent as
Yours indignantly, A British Slave.
Sir,—I should like to say that, as a Jury-
man, I don't see the use of Judges. They
make trials much longer, by their summings-
up, and simply confuse us. Then I think that
counsel on both sides could advantageously be
dispensed with. What is the good of sum-
moning a Jury and then not giving them full
powers? Just leave us alone with Plaintiff
and Defendant, and the matter in dispute
will soon be settled; I may say, squared.
Yours, Man of Business.
Sir,—Jurors are the greatest idiots in the
world. I always tried to keep them out of
my Court: and when they were forced upon
me, I used to show them what I thought of
them. They fortunately were unable to reta-
liate by explaining what they thought of me.
I have the satisfaction of remembering that
a Foreman who once asked a Judge to "cut his
remarks short," had to pay a fine of Five
Pounds for his lack of appreciation of the
Judge's judicial abilities. Your Honour.

and robbing the Brewers.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FKOM THE DIABT OP TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, April 15.—Man a ourious
mixture. Here's Howard Vincent, who goes in for Protection
wherever British goods are concerned, dead
( against Protection when London thorough-
> fares are in question. Before County Council
was, Howard Vincent started agitation
against relics of feudalism in form of chains,
gates, and watch-towers in so-called private
thoroughfares situate in heart of Metropolis.
\, Up to-night with question about Birdcage
"Walk. Why should this broad convenient
thoroughfare, made with publio money, be
closed to bulk of traffio, driving it into
already overcrowded Victoria Street?
Pluniet protests arrangement cannot be
altered. Suppose road were thrown open,
what is to become of Beadle in uniform, in
little box at Queen Anne's Gate, who pops
out and stops vehicles whose colour he
doesn't like, or whose horse doesn't meet
with his approval? Spirit of revolu-
tion abroad; must be stopped some-
where; Birdcage Walk good place to
make a stand; so Plunket folds his
arms and warns off Howard Vincent.
Jemmt Lowtheb much pleased.
"Glad to see there's some pluck left
in this Ministry, after all. They
swamp us with Local Government Bill,
and to-night Goschen fetches in Radi-
cal Budget, raiding on landed property,
. Ji they had given up Birdcage Walt,
Constitution Hill would have gone next, and there would be hardly
any barrier left between East and West."
Gosceen's Budget suspiciously cheered from Opposition Benches.
Conservatives sat glum, only Truthful James opening his lips to
grant moral of the approval. A small House, Members making
oliday before the sun shone. Gladstone set example by posting
off to Hawarden. Another Grand Old Man in Peers' Gallery listen-
ing to his sixty-third Budget Soeeoh.
Going already?" I asked him, as he passed out after Goschen
had been under weigh an hour.
"Yes," said Lord Cottesloe, "think this will do me to be going
on with. Getting up in years, you know; ninety-two this year—
Gladstone a mere chicken."
"But you 're looking pretty well. How do you manage it F"
"Budgets, Toby, dear boy, Budgets," he whispered in my ear.
"Man and boy, I ye lived on 'em for sixty year. Tell you the
infallible secret of life: begin early on Budgets; always be in your
place in Commons when Budget comes on;_ stands to reason that if
you do this for sixty-three years in succession you 're bound to live
to pretty old age. Medical nostrums all very well, but the elixir of
life is a Budget Speeoh." Business done.—Budget explained.
Tuesday.—House met to-day to adjourn for Easter Recess. Sage
of Queen Anne's Gate, who manages these things, got us two extra
days' holiday. Last Thursday,
in interview with Akebs-
Douglas, undertook that if
holidays were extended to 29th
inst., votes in Class I. of Civil
Service Estimates should be
agreed to. A kerb - Douglas
mentioned matter to Old Mo-
rality. Old Morality
showed disposition to bargain;
Said two or three votes in
Class II. should be thrown in.
Sage shook his head; couldn't
be done; Votes very scarce to-
day: had really offered as
much as could be fairly ex-
pected. Old Morality at last
gave way; votes in Class I.
agreed to right off, and an-
nouncement made that holi-
days would be extended.
That's the way we do business "I thmk I'U go home!
in House of Commons. Find nothing about this in Parliamentary
Reports; but it's literally true.
Might fancy boys be in nigh spirits on eve of holiday. But never
know where you have them. Here's Wilfrid Lawbon with his
knuckles in his eyes trying to squeeze out tear,

"Please, Sir," he whimpers, "can't we see the
during the holidays?"
Speaker looks at Balfour. Balfour not sure. Wouldn't like
to answer important question like that off hand. So at six o'clock,
when still full hour to work at Votes in Supply, progress is moved,
the battering-ram brought in, and the boys joyfully swarmed round
it. Time for talk strictly limited; but Windbag Sexton bags
three-fifths of it. Towards close of oration discovers Chief Secretary
yawning; terribly angry; fumes and frets, holds him up to execra-
tion of mankind.
"If a man mayn't yawn when Windbag Sexton comes up to
occupy very last moments of a sitting," said C. P. Villi ers, "free-
dom is a mockery. I think I'll go nome." He.went; and so, at
seven o'clock, did all of us.
Business done.—House adjourned till 29th April.

POSTERITY ON THE PIPES.
{By Our Anti-Scotch Seer.)
[It is said that the strains of the bagpipe are being preserved by the
phonograph for the benefit of posterity.]
Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
Preserved the 1 drone"—what fiendish fun!—
In that foe of music, the phonograph,
That Posterity, pleased, might listen and laugh.
Posterity came, in its time, and heard . ^
The gruesome row as it groaned and ghir-r-r-ed;
And it rose in wrath, and it fiercely smote
That phonograph, that never a note
Coula oome from the box, or little or big:
For Posterity, said, "'Tis the squeak of the Pig
That Tom the Piper's son stole in his time,
As told in the ancient nursery rhyme.
Tom was whipt for the theft, and it served him right;
But our verdiot is that the sin was slight
Of stealing that pig with the curly tail,
Compared with the orime of preserving his wail!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TALES OF A TRAVELLER.
Obedient to your orders, I interviewed hi
Lordship. In reply to my first question, "Where
have you been all this long time?" the distin-
guished traveller replied. Everywhere. South
Pole, North Pole, East and West pole. In leaving
the North Foreland — I mean the Dorogovki
Straits, first turning to the left after leaving
Pubb'8 Island.—I steered a straight oourse in my
oaravan, whioh for convenience I had fitted up
so as to use it as a sailing boat, rowing, or Bteam
boat, or in faot, anything. It
at midday and we registered (I
had a registrar with me for births,
deaths, and marriages) sixty-four
degrees below zero, which was
good for the Bank, but bad for
the players who had gone the
maximum en plein. At night it
was lower again, and they all got
so low that most of my party re-
fused to play any more. Along
the road we counted five thousand
dead Indians, who had, I suppose,
committed suicide, in consequence
of zero turning up so often.
Otherwise. I can't account for it."
I asked him, "Did he feel warm
himself?"
His Lordship replied, "Never
better. Had a high old time of
it. We left Jamrackia hurriedly,
being pursued by raving - mad
wild beasts; and, to save our lives,
we had to swim across a river,
the water of which, strange as it
may sound, had risen so much
during the recent floods, that it
rose considerably higher _ than
Niagara, and we had to swim up
with the tide, as it came with a
mighty impetus below to reach its
own level, which was now just
two miles and a-half above."
I could not help remarking that
this must have given him consider-
able trouble.
"Indeed it did," he replied,
intensely cold

with a smile. "What'with holding my bag in one hand,
my gun in the other, my knife in my mouth, and having
to keep my pockets closed for fear anything should drop
out, I had enough to do, I can tell you; and I may add, I
really should not care about going through the performance
again. However, when we had arrived safely on shore,
the climate of the hitherto undiscovered oountry was per-
fect, we were soon dry and chattering with the natives,
many of whose faces I was almost certain I recognised as
having seen frequently in London."
"Really!" I exclaimed.
"Yes," said his Lordship rising, "I have made the
grand discovery of the age. The North Pole is as easy of
— access to a Londoner as is London
to a Northpoler. They have pos-
sessed the secret of the passage
for years past, and they are often
over here and among us. They
are acquainted with everything
that is going on in London, speak
our language perfectly, and
indeed no other. They have no
leading man of energy among
them to work a company and
make the intercommunication as
simple and as big a commercial
success as the Club Train ought to
be which starts at 4'30 from
Victoria and lands its passengers
at 11 r.M. in Paris, the baggage
being examined, and the dinner
eaten en route. Will you put
your name down for 100 shares in
the London and North Pole Club
Train?"
But while his Lordship was
finding the prospectus, I suddenly
remembered that I was due at
your office within five minutes,
and so I left without disturbing
his Lordship, who, I hear, is going
to add to his title and appear as
Earl of Longtale and Munchausen.

H.M.S. "CALLIOPE."
A DUhyrambic to the "Deus ex Machina" of
to-day.
"A remarkable incident of the hurricane at
Samoa is related this week. Captain Kane, com-
manding the Calliope, finding his vessel in danger,
turned her head to the storm, and endeavoured to
steam out of the harbour of Apia In the teeth of the
hurricane. For a few minutes it seemed as if Nature
must win, but the engines were good, and the
engineers daring, and inch by inch the Calliope
made way. As she passed the great American cor-
vette Trenton, her crew of four hundred, who knew
their vessel was drifting on the reef, and were
momentarily expecting death, recognised Captain
Rank's daring seamanship, and with true profes-
sional, and, we may add, American feeling, gave
the Calliope a vigorous cheer. Enough has not been
•aid of the Calliope'i engines. It was their quality
and condition which enabled the commander of the
Calliope to adopt a plan from which both German
and American, with older engines, necessarily
shrank."— The Spectator.
Who flouts our "mechanical age," and with
pessimist babble declares
That machinery masters our manhood, and
dulls down the spirit that dares?
Let him turn to the tale of Samoa, the story of
stout Captain Kane,
And that tiff tit with the storm of the Engines
he trusted—nor trusted in vain.
A new subject for song, and a strange one, the
languid lute-thrummers may sneer.
Fancy seeking a bard's inspiration in Engine,
and Boiler, and Gear!
Fancy Pindar be-praising a Piston, Catullus
be-chanting a Crank!
Well, why not a battle-ship's "sorew," Sir,
as well as a battle-steed's shank?
He who rhymed of the " Good News from
Ghent." he who sang " The Black War-
rigal Horse,"
Might thrill English" hearts with the tale of
the gallant Calliope's course.
In the teeth of that terrible gale, when the
best that the brave and the bold
Could do were of little avail should those
Engines perchance fail to hold!
But the Engines were big, Rennie's best, firm
to stand the fierce shock and the
strain
Of the thundering Typhoon's assaults, and he
knew it, that stout Captain Kan f.;
And just as a well-mounted rider will set his
good steed at a leap,
Which a man on a cripple must shirk, whence
a man on a cocktail will creep.
So Kane set his ship in the face oi the storm,
slipped his cables, and stood
For the broad open sea he might reach—yes,
if Rennie's great Engines proved
good.
And now was the time for such test as the
measured-mile trials knew not,
Such strain as will find the least flaw, and such
pressure as proves the weak spot.
Bad now if a draughtsman has bungled, bad
now if a workman has scamped T
Picture now that Bwart first Engineer, as they
circled, and thudded, and champed,
Those shafts, and those rods, and those wheels,
which he knows to a nut and a tooth.
If those Titan-arm "throws" are forged fair, if
those slides run with smoothness and
truth,
Who knows? They may ride out the gale,
though the Grant and the Nipsic ashore
Lie wrecked on a reef, and the Trenton scarce
faces the hurricane's roar.
'' Huzza!" That's a cheer from the Trenton;
brave hearts have those Yankees whohail,
The Calliope's plucky attempt, from the midst
of a peril to pale
The cheeks of Columbus himself, "Hail
Columbia!" the sound of that cheer
Will follow us, gallant four hundred, this
many and many a year.
The loud-throbbing engines toil on through
the fierce billow-scourging wild blast,
And—hurrah! thanks to Kane and ti> Rennie,
they 're out of the sea-gate at last!
The reef's in their rear, and sore pressed by
the gale, but to battle it free,
With machinery firm and unflawed, the
Calliope stands out to sea.
If a jockey has joy in his mount, if a sailor
exults in his yacht,
If Ormonde gets kudos all round, and the
Volunteer's held a big pot,
Pray why should not Captain and Maker be
proud of such Engines as these f
So in drinking Kane's jolly good health,
Punch will drink Rennie's too, if you
please.

AN EXHIBITION MATCH
Between thk Brummaofm Bruiser and the Paddutgton Pet.

BOUND THE FIRST.
A Fragment from Contemporary Fistiana.
Much interest has of late been excited in sportive circles, and
especially among Corinthian amateurs of the fistio art, by the doings
and sayings,—especially the latter—of the two lads above named.
Two more promising scrappers" have, perhaps, not appeared in
the pugilistio arena for a considerable period, than the "Brummagem
Bruiser" and the " Paddington Pet."
When the "Cracks" peeled, considerable disparity in their size
was observable, yet by the knowing ones it was thought that the
superior " beef" of the Bruiser might be more than compensated for
by what, in semi-Byronic phraseology, may be designated the
"dancing devilry " of the indomitable " Pet."
As they shook hands it was seen that the Brum stood well over his
man, looked longer in the reach, and gave promise of greater pro-
pelling power in the proper quarter. The cheers for his game little
opponent however were vociferous, to an extent indeed which seemed
somewhat to nettle the "Bruiser," who at once let fly with his right,
but was out of distance, and nearly fell with the force of his own
blow. At any rate he appeared to do so, though thus early in the
fight, whispers of "barney," "kibosh," "a put up job," &c, went
surreptitiously round the ring.

JUVENILE VAGRANCY."
Having bead in the Times, on this subject, that the Chief Commissioner of Police is acting in concert with the
Society fob the Pbevention of Cbuelty to Childben, &c, &c., and that "the qbbatest kindness that can be shown to a
Beooino Child is to set this Machinery in motion, by oivino him ob heb in chabqe under 'The Vagrant Act,'" Mb. Wig-
gins., the Philanthropist, does so !—but—TABLEAU !—bathes wishes he had let it alone.
Recovering himself, Joe weaved into distance, and presently let oat
a nasty one of a somewhat doubtful character perhaps, at which
there were cries of " foul" from the partisans of the Pet," whose
numbers seemed greatly to preponderate. The Referee ordered the
lads to fight on, and there was a grin on Random's mug which the
suspicious took due note of. Pulling himself together, he let fly
right and left, and rattled into the Brum in fine style, being " all
oyer his man in a brace of shakes, and delivering a series of well-
planted spanks, which, if not given open-handed (as some declared
they were), must have made Master Joe feel all abroad. The Brum,
however, did not seem much to mind (another suspicious sign in the
eyes of some), his dexter orb was closed (whether owing to a whack
or a wink seemed doubtful), he broke ground and retreated very
iudgmatically with a sweet smile on his rather cold-cut phiz, which
looked scarcely at home there somehow, and when the round came to
an end, and the Cracks dropped into their cane-bottomed chairs, it
was difficult for those not in the know" to determine which of
them had really got the best of it.
Only, it was fancied by some that the amount of puffing and pant-
ing, rubbing down, and silk-handkerchief-waving, which followed
was just a teeth out of proportion to the absolute necessity of the
case; on the actual ding-dong wear and tear of suck a round with
pugilistic marvels in the pink of condition like the Brummagem
Bruiser and the Paddington Pet.

MR. PUNCH'S MODEL MUSIC-HALL SONGS.
No. III.—A Democratic Ditty.
The following example, although it gives a not wholly inadequate
expression to what are understood to be the loftier aspirations of the
most advanced and earnest section of the New Democracy, should
not be attempted, as yet, before a West-End audience. In South or
East London, the sentiment and philosophy of the song may possibly
excite rapturous enthusiasm; in the West-End, though the tone is
daily improving, they are not educated quite up to so exalted a level
at present. Still, as an experiment in proselytism, it might be worth
risking, even there. The title it bears is :—
GIVEN AW AY-WITH A POUND OF TEA!
Verse I.—{Introductory.)
S»mb Grocers have taken to keeping a stock
Of ornaments—such as a vase, or a clock—
With a ticket on each where the words you may see:
"To be given away—with a Pound of Tea!"
Chorus (in waltz time).
"Given away!"
That's what they say.
Gratis—a present it's offered you free.
Given away,
With nothing to pay,
"Given away—{tenderly)— with a Pound of Tea!"
Verse II.—{Containing the moral reflection.)
Now, the sight of those tickets gave me an idear.
What it set me a-thinking you re going to 'ear:
I thought there were things that would possibly be
Better given away—with a Pound of Tea!
Chorus—liGiven away." So much as to say, &c.
Verse III.—This, as being rather personal than general in its appli-
cation, may need some apology. It is really put as a graceful
concession to the taste of an average Music-Hall audience, who
like to be assured that the Artists who amuse them are as unfor-
tunate as they are erratic in their domestic relations.)
Now, there's my old Missus who sits up at 'ome,—
And when I sneak up-stairs my 'air she will comb,—
I don't think I'd call it bad business if she
Could be given away—with a Pound of Tea!
Chorus—" Given away!" That's what they say, &c.
[Mutatis mutandis.
Verse IV.—(Frying at higher game. The social satire here is per-
haps almost Too good-natured, seeing what intolerable pests all
Peers are to the truly Democratic mind. But we must walk
before we can run. Good-humoured contempt will do very well,
for the present.)
Fair Americans snap up the pick of our Lords.
It's a practice a sensible Briton applords.
[This will check any groaning at the mention of Aristocrats.
Far from grudging our Dooks to the pretty Yan-kee,—
(Magnanimously) Why, we'd give em away—with a Pound
of Tea!
Chorus— Give 'em away! So we all say, &c.
Verse V.— (More frankly Democratic still.)
To-wards a Republic we 're getting on fast;
Many old Institootions are things of the past.
(Philosophically) Soon the Crown'11 go, too, as an a-noma-lee,
And be given away—with a Pound of Tea!
Chorus—" Given away!" Some future day, &c.
Verse VI.—(Which expresses the peaceful proclivities of the popu-
lace with equal eloquence and wisdom. A welcome contrast to
the era when Britons had a bellicose and immoral belief in the
possibility of being called upon to defend themselves at some time !)
We've made up our minds—though the Jingoes may jor—
Under no provocation to drift into war!
So the best thing to do with our costly Na-vee
Is—Give each ship away, with a Pound of Tea!
Chorus—Give 'em away, &c.
Verse VII. — (We cannot well avoid some reference to the Irish
Question in a Music-hall ditty, but observe the logical and states-
manlike method of treating it here. The argument—if crudely
stated—is borrowed from some advanced by our foremost
politicians.)
We've also discovered at last that it's crule
To deny the poor Irish their right to 'Ome Rule!
So to give 'em a Parlyment let us agree—
(Rationally) Or they may blow us up with a Pound of their
"Tea"! [A euphemism which may possibly be remem-
bered ana understood.
Chorus—Give it away, &o.
Verse VIII. (in which we strike a Socialistic Note).
The career of the School Board we '11 cut pretty short:—
(Pathetically) Why should we 'ave to pay for our kids being
tort?
Education at Eton, without any fee.l
We '11 give every urchin, along with his tea t
Chorus—" Given away!" There they shall Btay. Go up to College
and get a degree.
The best Educay-Shon given away. "Given away, with a Pound of
Tea!"
Verse IX. (culminating in a glorious prophetic burst of the Coming
Dawn).
Iniquitous burdens and rates we'll relax:
For each " h" that's pronounced we will clap on a tax!
[A very popular measure.
And a nouse in Belgraveyer, with furniture tree,
Shall each Soshalist sit in, a taking his tea!
Chorus, and dance off.—Given away! Ippipooray! Gratia we '11
get it, for nothing and free!
Given away! Not a penny to pay! Given away! With a Pound
of Tea!
If this Democratic Dream does not appeal favourably to the imagi-
nation of the humblest citizen, the popular tone must nave been mis-
represented by many who claim to act as its chosen interpreters—a
supposition Mr. Punch must decline to entertain for a single moment.
The Triumphal Car-man,—The bold Carman who, last Satur-
day morning in the City, courageously stopped the runaway horses
which no policeman could arrest without a warrant, or without their
being formally given in charge, deserves a piece of plate, with plenty
on it. A Musical Entertainment might be given in his honour, and
his daring act sung to the Toreador air appropriately selected from
Carmen.
Monte Carlo, Junior.—During the Exhibition time there are to
be tables at St Germain's. What a chance for Mr. Smith and a few
more M.P.'s, whose ory is, "Delenda est Monte Carlo!" to take the
Club Train on Saturday afternoon, and—ahem!—make a quiet excur-
sion to St. Germain's on Sunday. Quite a little Sabbath Day's
Journey.

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
February 18.—Carrie has several times recently called attention
U> the thinness of my hair at the top of my head, and recommended
me to get it seen to. I was this morning trying to look at it by the
aid of a small hand-glass, when somehow my elbow caught against
the edge of the chest of drawers and knocked the glass out of my
hand and smashed it. Carrie was in an awful way about it, as she
is rather absurdly superstitious. To make matters worse, my large
photograph in the drawing-room fell during the night, and the glass
is cracked. Carrie said, "Mark my words, Charles, some mis-
fortune is about to happen." I said, "Nonsense, dear." In the
evening Lupin arrived home early, ana seemed a little agitated. I
said, "AVhat's up, my boy?" He hesitated a good deal, and then
said, "You know those Parachikka Chlorates I advised you to
invest £20 in?" I replied, "Yes—they are all right I trust?" He
replied, "Well, no! To the surprise of everybody they have utterly
collapsed." My breath was so completely taken away, I could
say nothing. Carrie looked atme and said, What did I tell you 'i"
Lupin after a while said, "However, you are Bpeoially fortunate. I
reoeived an early tip, and sold out yours immediately, and was for-
tunate to get £2 for them. So you get something after all." I gave
a sigh of relief. I said, "I was not so sanguine as to suppose, as
you predicted, that I should get six or eight times the amount of my
investment, still a profit of £2 is a good per-centage for such a short
time." Lupin said, quite irritably, "You don't understand. I sold
your £20 shares for £2—you therefore lose £18 on the transaction,
whereby Cumminos and Gowtno will lose the whole of theirs."
February 19.—Lupin before going to town said, "I am very sorry
abont those Parachikka Chlorates. It would not have happened if
the Boss, Jon Cleanands, had been in town. Between ourselves,
you must not be surprised if something goes wrong at our office. Jon
Cleanands has not been seen the last few days, and it strikes me
several people do want to see him very particularly." In the evening
Lupin was just on the point of going out to avoid a collision with
Cowing and Cumminos, when the former entered the room without
knocking, but with his usual trick of saying, " May I come in?"
He entered, and to the surprise of Lupin and myself, seemed to be in
the very best of spirits. Neither Lufin nor I broached the subject
to him, but he did so of his own accord. He said, " I say those
Parachikka Chlorates have gone an awful smash—you're a nice one,
Master Lupin. How much do you lose?" Lupin, to my utter
astonishment said, "Oh, I had nothing in them. There was some
informality in my application—I forgot to enclose the cheque, or
something, and I didn't get any. The Guv. loses £18." I said, "I
quite understood you were in it, or nothing would have induced me
to speculate." Lupin replied, "Well, it can't be helped; you must
go double on the next tip." Before I could reply, Gowino said,
Well, I lose nothing, fortunately. From what I heard, I did not
quite believe in them, so I persuaded Cumminos to take my £15
worth, as he had more faith in thera than I had." Lupin burst out
laughing, and in the most unseemly manner said, "Alas, poor Cum-
minos! He '11 lose £35." At that moment there was a ring at the
bell. Lupin said, "I don't want to meet Cumminos." If he had
gone out of the door he would have met him in the passage, bo as
quickly as possible, Lupin opened the parlour window and got out.
Gowino jumped up suddenly, exclaiming, "I don't want to see him
either!" and, before I could say a word, ho followed Lupin' out of
the window. For my own part, I was horrified to think my own son
and one of my most intimate friends should depart from the house
like a couple of interrupted burglars. Poor Cumminos was very
upset, and of course was naturally very angry both with Lupin and
Gowino. I pressed him to have a little whiskey, and he replied that
he had given up whiskey, but would like a little " Unsweetened,"
as he was advised it was the most healthy spirit. I had none in the
house, but sent Carrie round to Locrwood's for some.
Ftbruary 20.—The first thing that caught my eye on opening the
Standard was " Great Failure of Stook and Share Dealers. Mr. Job
Cleanands absconded." I handed it to Carrie, and she replied,
"Oh, perhaps it's for Lupin's good. I never did think it an advisable
situation for him." I thought the whole affair very shocking. Lupin
came down to breakfast, and seeing he looked painfully distressed,
I said, "We know the news, my dear boy, and feel very sorry for
vou." Lupln said, "How did you know—who told you ? _' I handed
him the Standard. He threw the paper down, and said, "Oh, I
don't care a button for that. I expected that, but I did not expect
this." He then read a letter from Frank Mutlar, announcing m a
cool manner that Daisy Mutlar is to be married next month to
Murray Posh. I exclaimed, "Murray Posh ?—is not that the very
man Frank had the impudence to bring here last Tuesday week?
Lupln said, " Yes—The ^ Poth's-three-shitting-hats' ehap.' We all
then eat our breakfast in dead silence. When Lupln rose to go I
noticed a malicious smile creep over his face. I asked him what it
meant. He replied, "Oh, only a little consolation—still it m a con-

OUR OWN HARE.
Incongruity is the essence of humour, and a mischievously in-
clined humorous spirit must have been in the air when the honoured
name of "Shaftesbury" having been bestowed on the new street
and open Bpace, the locality was imme-
diately pounced upon by theatrical
speculators as the very place of all
others best suited for the ereotion of
Thespian Temples dedicated to the cult
of Thalia and Melpomene. Then and
there, the title should have been
changed to "Shakspeare Avenue."
Even now the substitution of a few
letters will effeot the transformation.
Whatever theatres have yet been
erected, or are yet to be built, the
architect will have to be a remark-
ably clever and subtly-designing
person to beat the new Garrick
Theatre, which Mr. John Hare
has just opened with such signal
success, for which he is secon-
darily indebted to the aforesaid
designer, but primarily to that
eminent Dramatic Constructor,
Mr. Pinero, who, after past-
master Boucicauxt, is the best
stage - craftsman since Tom
Robertson. Give him the box
of bricks, and you '11 see what a
house Mr. Pinero can build,
and, which is more important to
house he
in the
dialogue of a serious play like
The Profligate, lies in his tendency to make his strongly-individu-
alised characters occasionally talk as such characters off the stage
and in real life never would have talked, even occasionally. I hope
to find another opportunity to say something more of this play; at
present, I can only recommend everyone to see it. It is so admirably
built up that, until the climax of the Third Act is reached, you do
not realise how excellent is its dramatic construction. Mr. Hart:
has so little to do or say in it that he is only "The Hare Apparent.'

Suffice it that Mr.

to meet with their
due reward at the
hands of a discri-

who, following the
Hare, will, I
hope, nave a good

money.

THOUGHTS IN A GARDEN.
The air with sunlight ia alive,
The sappy boughs are supple,
And every seat that's meant for live
Can only hold a oouple.
The soft wind warbles like a dream,
The supple boughs are sappy,
And all the scatter'd couples seem
Mysteriously happy.
His mate the mellow mavis greets,
Sappy the supple boughs are,
And all the pairs on all the seats
Exchanging silent vows are.
Mute eloquence of lowly love!
Sweet void, by words unreliable!
Convention's fetters far above,
They need not breathe a syllable!
She contemplates her o'er-teemed gloves,
Her boots' conspicuous newness;
While he the circumambient loves
Surveys through smoke-wreaths' bluenesp.
Ah, would that I and Geraldine,
Each a Supreme Caucasian,
Could walk like them upon the green,
Unvex'd by conversation.
But I and plighted Geraldine,
When forth we fare together,
First do full justice to the scene,
And then discuss the weather.
The weather! I whose spirit bold
Feels every Btar-beat tingle, •
Gathers the moonlight's broken gold
From the foam-curdled shingle;
Throbs strangely when the new leaves shoot,
As though too tightly bodied,
And waves a courteous salute
When breezy trees have nodded!
0 tyrant custom! Happy they
Who heed not, nor obey it;
Who, having nothing left to say,
Simply sit still and say it.
They lounge at ease beneath the trees,
Or pace the paths together,
And let the well-contented breeze
Whisper about the weather.

The Manager ventures to suggest that the
General should assume the notnme de theatre
of the "Music-Hall Napoleon," in place of
the St.Arnaud du Caft Concert, as more likely
to be understood.

a general feeling ex-
pressed that one of the
oldest representatives of
Art should preside over

of "King Henry the
Thted (1206 — 1272),
sculptured in 1291 by
William Tobel," was
unanimously voted into
the Chair, and forthwith
opened the proceedings.
On rising, and after
briefly acknowledging
the compliment paid him
by his Mother effigies,
he said: He thought he
need not dwell on the
circumstances that had
called them together at
this small hour in the
morning. The manner
in which they were
housed was a public
scandal. ("Hear,
hear.'") But not only
were they caged np in
a building that was not
even water - tight

buried away down here,
in the far ,fEast End,"

tenths of the sight-see-
ing classes. {Cries of
"Shame."') As to the
water ocming in. per-
sonally that did not
affect him, as he was
merely an electrotype
from his original bronze
in Westminster Abbey.
{Laughter.) Still he
could enter into the feel-
in gs of those brother
effigies who had no
originals to fall back
upon. He sincerely
sympathised with them. He would be glad to hear what they had to
say on the matter.
''Geobge Mobley, D.D., Bishop of Winchester (1597—1684),
drawn in coloured chalk* on grey paper by E. Luttrbel," then rose.
He said, that he for one was dreadfully afraid of the damp. It
had only to get into his back to take all the colour out of him, and he
was quite sure that if he was not soon deposited in tome more
suitable habitation than that provided by these leaky structures, he
should soon, to make use of a vulgar figure of speech, be found
walking his chalks altogether. (Roars of laughter.)
"H.R.H. Edward Duke of Kent, K.G. (1767—1820), an oval
Medallion, modelled in wax in 1786 by Thomas Enoleheabt," said,
that not only did the Boilers let in the cold in winter, but in summer
they attracted the sun's heat until their temperature rivalled that of
an oven, and it had often occurred to him to ask himself, when he
saw some of his oil-painted friends literally cracking with the
warmth, whether he could stand much more of it without melting
away altogether. Really he ought to have been presented to
Madame Tcssavd's. (Laughter.) Indeed he thought that they
would all agree with him that if some commercial concern, and not
the Nation, had got hold of them, they would long ago have found
themselves in far better quarters. (" Hear, hear.' )

they, a respectable
party of all the greatest
men the country has
produced, should be go-

"John, Lord Somebs
(1630 — 1716), painted
by Sir Godfbey Knel-
leb," wanted to know
what was the good of
exhibiting him to the
British working-man at
Bethnal Green. None
of them ever knew who
he was, or, he believed,
had ever even heard of
him I Because he wore
a long pale grey wig, he
was sometimes taken
for the Young Pre-
tender, but he felt con-
vinced that the large
majority of the spec-
tators who took any
notice of him what-
ever simply associated
him with an advertise-
ment of a popular
"Hair Restorer."
(Laughter.)
"William Shakks-
PEABE (1564 — 1616),
attributed to Richard
Bubbage," who _ on
rising, wag received
with loud cheering,
said: He could fully
enter into the feelings
of disgust, experienced
by comparatively un-
known personages, like the last speaker, at finding themselves rele-
gated to the class of visitors likely to patronise their Collection while
located in such an out-of-the-way East End Slum as Bethnal Green.
For hialown part, he thought he might regard his reputation as inde-
pendent even of the National Portrait Gallery. ( Hear, hear .' ")
Still, while he formed one of the National Collection, he owned he
would like to see it decently located. He firmly believed if his friend
Mr. Augustus Hakhis of Drury Lane were to take it in hand, he
would soon show the Authorities how to make a respectable institu-
tion of it. What was wanted was the firm hand of a practical man
of business, and not the irresponsible, shilly-shallying of a do-
nothing officialism, which has brought about what Sir John Millais
very justly designates a "scandal outright." ("Hear, hear.'")
Still, he thought the Public seemed fairly aroused about the matter
at last, and that something would be done. {Cheers.)
Several other effigies were about to address the meeting when the
Chairman, noting from a distant cock-crow the ;approach of dawn,
announced its adjournment.
A hurried vote of thanks to their able and indefatigable custodian
having then been proposed and carried by acclamation, the phantom
figures noiselessly withdrew to their respective frames, and as the
night watchman entered the building on his early round, the pro-
ceedings silently terminated.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Common, Monday, April 29.—Back after Ea6ter holi-
days; that is, some of us are; not nearly suoh rush to get back as
there was to get off. Old Morality early in his place. "Punc-
tuality," he says, turning over his list of new copy-book
headings collected during the Recess, "punctuality is the thief of
time. That is one of the maxims, dear Toby, that have piloted me
through the rocks and shoals of this wicked world, and led me into
the high position, the attainment of which, as I mentioned at the
dinner they gave me in the City
the other day, is a perpetual mys-
tery to me. You may, in the course
of your reading, have come across
an episode in the history of one
of the predecessors of our Gracious
Sovereign. His title was, I may
mention, George the Third.
Observing an apple-dumpling in
the tenement-house of a neigh-
bouring cottager, the mind of His
Majesty was much exeroised as to
the nature of the process by which
the fruit was inducted within the
folds of the pastry. 'Dumpling!
Dumpling!' said His Good Gra-
cious. 'Um—um—What Y what P
what? But how did the apple get
there, Ma'am?' A somewhat simi-
lar inquiry occasionally presents
itself to my mind. How did 1 get
here? But being here, I can assure
you that I shall spare no effort to
do my duty to the House and to
the Country, and in all things not
incompatible with the interests of
public business I shall endeavour
to consult the convenience of Hon.
Gentlemen in all parts of the
House."
Old Morality muoh enjoyed
delivery of theso few remarks;
so did I, in degree; glad to find
him in better health and bubbling spirits; fact is, I hear, things
are looking better with Irish Government, and brighter prospects
reflected on genial countenance of Old Morality. Balfour saved
his trump card till the last: did pretty well in arranging for tem-
porary withdrawal of Dr. Tanner; but to lay Conybeare by the
heels, and open up prospect for however brief a period of delivering
House from his company, irresistible. The usual griding at Ques-
tion Time and badgering over Votes, but no heart in it. Balfour's

faction. Business done.—In Supply.

mast. Finding thore is no mast to nail it to, steers straight for
mouth of Thames, and is caught by River Police trying to blow up
Houses of Parliament by a cleverly-aimed "Whitehead." Placed
in manacles and the Tower.
March.—Admiral Parnell in person leads an Invincible Armada
from the North Wall, Dublin, in direction of Glasgow. In conse-
quence of several English ironclads having to watch these operations,
English Navy rather badly beaten off Yarmouth by combined Rus-

Gladstone (now rather infirm) says he is always glad to welcome
excursionists, but " he really hardly expected this sort of thing when
he passed Home Rule." Admiral Parnell says, "Neither did he."
Is very sorry, but "will be obliged to carry off the G. 0. M. to Ire-
land, unless heavy ransom offered." Lord Gladstone suggests thai
"perhaps a better ransom could be obtained by capturing Duke of
Westminster, who lives near." Admiral Parnell tells this to the
Irish Marines. A move made for Eaton Hall. Capture of the place,
defeat of local Volunteers, and collapse of British Empire.

He demonstrates that it may have its advantages as a trotting-ground.
The present volume shows he has trotted to considerable purpose,
and though his distances may have been long and his pace rapid, he
certainly did not wear blinkers. Whether he is staying at Hong-
Kong, exploring Peking, describing the Great Wall, discoursing of
Tokio, picturing Manila, or the Sooloo Archipelago, he rarely fails to
be amusing. Especially interesting are the two chapters on play-
going in China and Japan. A bright, graphic ohronicle of travel,

veller's trivialities. The Baron de Book-Worms & Co.

THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF PAINTERS IN WATER-COLOURS.
There has been a good deal of painting in water-colours during
the last few months in London. The result has been the spoiling of
a great many hats and the splashing of an infinity of garments. A
much pleasanter form of water-colour painting do we find in that
Gallery on " the sweet sunny side of Pall Mall, where Sir John Gil-
bert presides. It is undoubtedly situated on the pleasantest side of
the street, and the tone of the salon is emphatically sunny. There is
just enough to see and not too much. Now the weather is beginning
to improve, and the trees are getting green, the opening of this
gallery is very acceptable. If you wish to have a sniff of the briny,
or a peep into the country without the trouble, expense, or waste
of time, you have only to pay your shilling, and you will be per-
sonally conduoted, with the smallest amount of fatigue, to all sorts
of delightful places. Among your most notable and accomplished

April 30, May 1, 2, and 3.—I may safely say that both Bench
and Bar are all the better for the Easter Recess. Mr. Justice Day,
■whose exertions and successful exertions to keep awake during the
tedious proceedings, in whioh he takes so aotive a part, quite
warranted a period of recreation, has (I
understand) found that period at East-
bourne, and my learned and laughter-
leading friend Mr. Lockwood, who also
seemed, a little out of spirits, has got
"quite a colour" by a short sojourn (I
believe), at Folkestone. Even that vener-
able mystery the wig of Sir Henry
James, seems fresher wan it did a fort-
night ago. Monday was not very eventful.
Mr. Parnell was put in the box and
examined by my friend the future Lord
Chancellor Asquith. The chief item of
interest in the evidence was the witness's
pronunciation of his own name. We
now have it on the authority of the
Home-Rule leader himself, that he should
In-wig-orating breeze at the be called " Parnell "—the stress on the
Law Courts. first syllable—not on the second. The
"uncrowned king" gave his opinion anent the characters of several
of his colleagues, and had generally a fine time of it. A good
deal of latitude was certainly permitted in Mr. Pabnell's examina-
tion-in-chief; but it is only just to say that he did not oritioise, nor
seek to oritioise, Miss Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth, and was
equally reticent as to his ideas about the management of the London
General Omnibus Company (Limited).
On Wednesday the Court was crowded, and the Lord Chief
Justice occupied a plaoe on the Bench. I noticed that the L. C. J.
was telling stories to his neighbours, and regretted that I had not
the advantage of hearing what I felt must be the most amusing and
kind-hearted of narratives. The examination-in-chief over. Mr.
Attorney took Mr. Parnell in hand. Of course, it would be
impossible for me at this stage of the proceedings to write anything
about the witness's evidence qua evidence, but I may hint that he
once described what may have seemed to some in Court a discrepancy
by the words, "Electioneering exaggeration;" and spoke of another
variation from the truth as "probably a piece of bounce." Like
other witnesses in this extraordinary inquiry, Mr, Parnell does not
appear always to have a very good memory. His cross-examination
might be given in a dramatic form as follows; but I beg to say
that (of course) what I subjoin is not in the least like the real thing
—let that be clearly understood—not in the least.
Mr. Attorney-General. Now, Sir, I wish to read all your speeches
Bince 1879 out of Hansard.
The President [mildly remonstrating). Is this absolutely necessary P
Mr. A.-G. Of course, I pay the greatest respect to your Lordship's
expression of opinion, but I fear it is necessary.
The President {with a deep sigh of resignation). Very well.
Mr. A.-G. Now I will begin.
Sir Charles Russell. Date, please. [Mr. A.-G. resents interruption.
Mr. A.-G. (reads long speech). And now, Mr. Parnell, what do
you say to that?
Witness. I have no recollection of making that speech. However,
if it is in Hansard, it is highly probable that I did make it.
Mr. A.-G. I beg your pardon, Mr. Parnell, but I must "press
you for an answer. Didyou, or did you not?
Witness {earnestly). When the fair land of Erin is ploughed by
the hoof of the ruthless invader who threatens, when might
Mr. A.-G. (interrupting). Yes, I know; but please keep to the
subject. Bid you, or did you not, make those speeches?
Witness (with emotion). The man who lays his hand upon a
woman, save in the way of kindness, is unworthy of
Mr. A.-G. (testily). Yes, yes, Mr. Parnell, I know all that;
but please answer my question.
Sir Charles Russell (with warmth). Really I must complain of my
learned friend's mode of conducting the witness's cross-examination.
Mr. A.-G. Really, Sir Charles, you must let me judge of my
own actions (with a glance at the Bench). I have done nothing re-
quiring, I trust, their Lordships' interposition P
The President (answering his appeal). Certainly not. (Seeing Sir
Charles about to speak.) But when I say that, I do not wish to
reflect upon either of you. You both are right—quite right—every-
body is right! Pray let us grease the wheels and get on!
And now, may I be allowed to earnestly thank the correspondent
who dates from Hanwell, and says, that it is a thousand pities I am
not in the case myself. I am very grateful to him for his kind
reference to my abilities, but I must confess, I do not quite under-
stand the allusion to the Emperor of China eating pigeon-pies made
of pine-apples, with which his letter closes.
Pump-handle Court. (Signed) A. Briefless, Jitniob.
WHAT "WILL THEY DO WITH THEM?
Sir,—What on earth does Sir John Millais mean by alluding to
the present provision for the housing of the Portraits of the National
Collection as a " scandal outright! The phrase is a most misleading
one, for the shelter of the pictures in not only comfortably, but even
luxuriously, provided for. As to temperature the difference between
the extreme cold of the winter and the heat of the summer months
does not (I have measured it myself on my own self-registering ther-
mometer),—exceed eighty-five degrees, and such dripping as niters
through from accumulated snow is readily kept off by the ordinary
use of a common umbrella. The dampness of the piotures themselves
is easily seen to. Surely it is not too muoh to expect the attendant
to remove this, as occasion may require, from their surfaces with a
good serviceable kitchen house-mop? I will yield to none, Sir, in
my devotion to these priceless treasures of National Art, and in
the regard I think that a jealous and appreciative Public should pay
to their legitimate guardianship and protection, and I am convinced
that here, with a good brick-wall behind them and a more or less
leaky glass and iron roof above them, they may be held, on the whole,
to be in excellent keeping. As to the talk of moving from their pre-
sent quarters to the West End,—this is preposterous. The humanising
and refining influence they have have had on the unemployed loafers
and the dregs of the river-side population, which form the majority
of visitors to them in their present habitation, must be seen to be
appreciated.
I do not write, Sir, as an enthusiast, but as one who trusts he
tempers a warm solicitude for the memory of the greatest men the
country has produced, with that sober common sense which should
be always available, and brought to bear on the handling of all ques-
tions of National importance. I am. Sir, your obedient servant,
A Commercial Road Mecxnas.
Sib,—May I ask how long this state of things is to last P Here
am I, and my five daughters, all of us deeply interested in historical
research, that we can only prosecute satisfactorily by virtually living
surrounded by the portraits of the National Collection from morning
till night, absolutely paralysed, with our labours at a complete stand-
still, owing to our inability to face the hazards of a daily journey to
Bethnal Green. We attempted it once, but lost our way, and then
could find no first-class Hotel in the neighbourhood where they serve
a five-shilling luncheon at separate tables! Surely, Sir, Parliament,
or someone, will interfere, and come to the assistance of your
distressed Correspondent, A Famished Student.
Sib,—I opine that the Government should bestir itself with a view
to taking some steps towards the more commodious housing of me
and my Drother portraits, who, I may add, after taking counsel with
me, have unanimously expressed themselves in agreement with this
sentiment. I am informed that some one—surely an ill-conditioned
person Y—has proposed that we should take up our temporary abode
in the Westminster Penitentiary at Millbank. I know not what fate
may be in store for us, but that we should be relegated to the chambers
recently tenanted by convicts seems to me to bo a suggestion full of
vast inconvenience, from which a general sense of the fitness of
things Bhould surely deliver us. In such a crisis, cannot the Arts
assist usP Surely my brothers of the Royal Academy might be
regarded and relied on as our natural and most proper helpers in
this our difficulty. Waiting to hear from them, I am, Sir, your
somewhat anxious and troubled shade, Joshua Reynolds.
Sib,—Let a short Bill be brought into the House, and let the
matter be settled forthwith. No great amount of money is required.
The site is the chief thing, but that surely can be found in one of
the new streets, or even on the Embankment. Isn't there a fine
vacant place just South of Whitef riars P or is the site of the original
Opera House still available? Anyhow a site can be found.
Meantime, let Parliament take the matter in hand, and put an end
to a palpably " outright scandal." At least so says.
Common Sense.
AT THE ACADEMY BANQUET.
H.R.H.'s speech was a model of brevity, and his allusion to the
late Frank Holl graceful and touching. Bishop Maoek began
jocosely, but, feeling the eye of Cardinal Manning upon him, he
dropped into seriousness. Admiral Hood opened fire bravely on
"So-called experts," but sank to depths of dulness under the weight
of his own big guns. Salisbury's Merry Markis stated that he
knew a party prepared to build a Home for the Houseless National
Portraits. The name of the party the Mysterious but Merry Markis
was not at liberty to divulge. It couldn't be the Markis's own
Party, as the offer came, evidently, from a thorough Liberal. Ere
this appears, the name will have transpired, but, at first, most
persons thought that it might be Walker. The only fault in the
President's speeches was their perfection. His phrases were most
happy, and so were his audience.

TWO CENTENARIES.
[Celebrations of the Centenaries of the Inauguration of
Washington as President of the American Republic, and of
the French Revolution, are almost contemporaneous.]
La Liberie loquitur :—
Look on this picture 1 Yes, I love to look.
Washington 1 There's a soul that never shook,
King-scared, or Mob-affrighted, in his free
And unforced loyalty to Liberty.
O si sic omnes! At my altar bend
A thousand foes who ape the guise of friend.
They pose and perorate, my fulsome Franks,
And J>lay preposterous pseudo-Roman pranks,
Are Brutuses pour rire, who'd lift the knife
Of revolution against Caesar's life,
The petty Ctesar of their private hate,
And in my name dishonoured wreck the State.
This man was bold against my foes, but built
As well as razed: was glorious without guilt.
Where are my Washingtons in France to-day?
Liberty's war they level to a fray
Of little spites and low ambitions; plumed
With purchased decorations, they are doomed
To failure and dishonour. How they hiss,
These angry geese of faction, whose chief bliss
Seems mimicking that Roman flock. 'Tis brave!
But, though their cackle stirs, it cannot save.
"A hundred years," they babble, "since it fell,
Tyranny's fortress, Power's private hell,
The infamous Bastille!" A hundred years!
Yon Titan Tower may shake with the wild cheers
Of mustered myriads celebrating—what?
The modern Despotism of Dry-Rot!
The canker of Corruption, and the curse
Of rancorous rivalry work ravage worse
Than that which Revolution's red-dyed hand
Essayed to stay, a century since.
0 grand
And pure-soul'd patriot whose picture here
Fronts me with eyes as constant and as clear
As when they faced the King-fooled British host,
I would my Frenchmen—whom I love—could boast
So leal a Leader and so brave a Chief
To take his country's perils, like the sheaf
Of spears that smote brave Winkelried of old,
To his own bosom. Hero pure as bold,
Yonder across the loud Atlantic flood
Stands the great work you founded. Lo, 'tis good!
Whilst here? The modern Babel rears its height,
And "brave" Boulangerswaggers and—takes flight!
Liberty! Loud lip-service greets me still.
When will my Franks of rhetoric have their fill?
A century of rhapsody and rant
My altar firmly here has failed to plant.
They treat me as a mistress, not a friend.
And fight for my sole favours; to what end?
My love is common as the Sun's warm ray
That round the budding globe leads on the May
In general benediction. Washington!
On thee in pure unclouded light it shone,
And shall in splendour deck brave France's brow
When she gives me a lover true as thou!
IMPERIAL DEFENCE.
(Forecast of a Week of it—after a great Kaval Defeat.)
Monday.—The Channel Fleet having been destroyed
by that of the Allies, Major Walkeb's system of Coast
Defence by " disappearing batteries" is hurriedly extem-
porised in all directions. The enemies' cruisers com-
manding the seas cut off the entire food-supply of the
United Kingdom.
Tuesday. — Portsmouth, Plymouth, Liverpool, and
other exposed commercial centres supplied with big
runs, and put in a position of adequate defence.
Rumours afloat of an expected scarcity of flour. The
fourpenny loaf goes up to two-and-ninepence.
Wednesday. — Spirited organisation of land forces
continues. The Duke of Cambridge reviews 300,000
Volunteers of all arms, who are told off, amidst great
enthusiasm, to man the Coast Defences of the country.
Famine commences. Three well-known Millionnaires
buy up all the available tinned meats and choeolate-

THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE!
New Customer. "By the way, isn't your Name Flaxman?"
Tailor. "Yes, Sir."
Neio Customer. "Any Descendant of the great Flaxman?"
Tailor. "Most likely, Sir,—as all our Family have been in the
Tailoring line I"
drops, and conceal them in their London coal-cellars. Serious riot in the House
of Lords of famished Peers for the possession of a shoulder of mutton brought
there by an agricultural Duke on his way home.
Thursday.—Ten million people said to be starving in the North. The Lord
Mayor distributes marmalade to a furious mob on the steps of the Mansion
House. The Military Authorities report that though the "disappearing
batteries" are well manned, the enemy awaiting the capitulation of the oountry
by famine, declines apparently to attack them. The volunteers are, however,
said to be in fairly good spirits, though hungry; though, having eaten their
boots and belts, they are not in danger of any immediate collapse from the
general soarcity of provisions.
Friday.—Revolution in London. Gangs of famished roughs in possession
of everything. The last omnibus horse taken from its harness and eaten in
the Bayswater Road. Members of the War Ministry seized and lynched on
separate lamp-posts in Parliament Street. Provisional Government "to make
peace on any terms" installed at Whitehall.
Saturday.—Provisional Ministry meet the Allied Admirals at the Nore, and
arrange terms of capitulation. England to pay twenty milliards, cede India,
Gibraltar, Malta, Canada and all her colonial possessions, agree not to keep a
fleet of more than five battle-ships in the future, and resume ner place in Europe
as an acknowledged third-class Power. _ Food re-admitted and famine checked,
on a feu dejoie to celebrate the peace being fired by the guns of the "disappear-
ing batteries," some of them blow up. General condemnation of Major Walker's
system of "National Defence."
"Let lie Like a Soldier Fall \"
Lord Wolseley discusses in The Fortnightly the question "Is a Soldier's
Life Worth Living?" Our Only General grows quite rhapsodical about the
rapturous joy of onset, the "intense, maddening delight, to which intoxi-
cating, if somewhat barbaric, ecstasy he seems to think that human experience
furnishes no equal. The " fierce joy" of the Warrior in full fight is the most
exquisite of mortal joys. Of course it is often the case that "these violent
delights have violent ends." But what of that P The Soldier's life, it would
seem, is so particularly well worth living mainly because the Soldier's death
is so delightfully worth dying.

[Mat 11, 1889.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 29.—Met to-day after Easter
Recess. Some doubt at first whether House would be made. Barely
forty Members on view when Speaker took Chair. But others
dropped in. Jackson, sitting on Treasury Bench, beamed with
delight.
"Nothing I like to see so much," he said, "as a small House
when we want to get Votes in Committee of Supply. The fewer
Members the less speeches,
and the more Votes. Fancy
we shall clear out Class 3 to-
night, especially if Sage stops
quietly at home at Queen
Anne's Gate."
Brow darkened when, pre-
sently, Sage gently entered
with copy of Votes under his
arm. Joseph Gnxis also
bustling about in suspicious
manner. Joseph been occu-
pied so much of late with
keeping the Judges straight
in Commission work, almost
forsaken us. Comes back to-
night with the Mace and other
Paraphernalia of Parliament.
More careful in his dress
than formerly. No longer
wears that imitation sealskin
waistcoat, which, bared to
Parliamentary breeze, was
wont to curdle the blood of
poor Forster, and contributed
appreciably to grizzling the
hair of Treveltan. Dressed
now in decorous black; only
Joseph Guha. flashesoflightabouthimbeing
the beam of his eagle eye, and the gleam of his great gold watch-chain.
As soon as House gets into Committee, Sage proposes to reduce Salary
of Chancellor of the Exchequer by £3000 a-year. Goschen objects.
Joseph blandly points out to him how desirable it is he should fall
in with suggestion. Most persuasive his eloquence; irresistible his
argument; impressive the quiet dignity of his manner. Goschen
moves uneasily on the Bench, intellect and conscience alike awakened.
It seems for a moment almost certain that he will rise; thank
Joseph Glllis for pointing out the path of duty; fling down the odd
£3000 a-year on the floor of the House where Burke once hurled the
dagger. But emotion only temporary. Sticks to his £5000 intact;
and Joey B., his head drooping, and his heart sad, goes out lamenting
the hardness of human heart, and the insensibility of some men to
impulses of finer natures.
Business done.—Two Votes taken in Supply after eight hours'talk.
Tuesday Night.—Sam Smith, fresh back from Monte Carlo,
effected more than Grand Old Man has yet been able to accomplish.
To-night he defeated the Government I Fight arose around Liquor
Traffic in India. Samuel moved Resolution condemning fiscal system
as tending to foster drinking habits. Caine seconded Motion. That
wily strategist, Wilfrid Lawson, kept in background till engage-
ment proceeded through some hours. Then brought up reserves;
things beginning to look alarming. Everyone expected a Count Out.
Akers Douglas couldn't get his men back from dinner. "Shan't be
wanted," they said, "Sam Smith sure to get House Counted Out."
But Samuel's eloquence prevailed. Held at least thirty Members
enthralled. Lethbridge moved Count. No go. Temperance
Members, excited with extra cup of tea, rushed in, filled House.
Harcourt, scenting mischief for Government, hurried back from
hasty dinner. Suffered profound disappointment previous night.
Had occupied. Easter Recess in preparing sparkling speech explosive
with impromptus about iniquity of Home Secretary in condoning
offence of Anderson of Home Office in connection with the Spy, Le
Caron. Speech intended to go off in Committee of Supply on Vote
for Home Secretary. Harcourt, believing Vote would not be
reached on Monday, still tarried in New Forest, parleying with the
primroses, dallying with the daffodils. Vote came up on Monday
and passed. Sparkling speech left on his hands. Must get it off some-
time, and certainly will. Meantime, consoled himself with making
speech on Smith's Resolution.
Midnight approaching ; Division inevitable; House began to fill;
Akers Douglas's scouts out in the highways and byeways; vainly
attempt to compel Ministerialists to come in and save the Govern-
ment. Dick Temple—the Taj—put up to distract attention, and by
his blandishments win recruits from forces of austere Samuel.
Temple surpasses himself. Quotes from native poets in proof that

Saint Arnold.
the mythological gods of ancient Ind enjoyed their pint of stout.
That ought to have settled matter. Gorst for one wild moment
hoped it would. But Samuel prevailed, Resolution carried by 113
Votes against 103.
This a private enterprise; no special effort made by regular Oppo-
sition Whips. But as Arnold Morley
walked out after announcement of figures,
with air of sweet resignation on his face,
Akers-Douglas looking up, thought he
detected something like an aureole encir-
cling his youthful nead.
Business done.—Government defeated.
Thursday. — Fresh hitch about Bir-
mingham Election. Bristled with diffi-
culties from first; sent GRandolph into
temporary retirement, and covered Cham-
berlain with contumely. Now John
Albert Bright, duly elected, comes to
take his seat. Hands in Return to Writ;
clerk discovers the person returned is
"Albert John" Bright.
'' Are you Albert John Bright f" he
asks new Member.
"No. I'm John Albert^
"Very well then," says incorruptible
clerk, "we can't let you in. Must wait
till Albert John turns up."
Speaker consulted on dilemma; always
ready to meet emergencies; suggests that
someone shall swear to identity of new
Member. Wolmer volunteers; does it
with admirable effect. No one imagined
how profound was the crisis till they saw
the Viscount standing bolt upright with
eyes tremulously fixed on Speaker, and
heard solemn, conviction-compelling tones,
in which he said: "I can certify from my
personal knowledge, that the gentleman returned for Central
Birmingham, is Mr. John Albert Bright."
"Splendidly done!" murmured Anstruther, standing at Bar,
anxiously watching his colleague in the whipping of the Third
Party. Wolmer might, if it comes to the worst, get a living as
professional witness. Reminds me of that fellow in Great Expecta-
tions, doncherknow; forget his name;
comes to Jaggers's offioe on Police Court
business; ready to go into witness-box
and swear to several alternative pro-
posals."
Nothing more to be said after Wolmer
sat down. Settled the business right off.
Nobody cared a brass farden whether it
was "John Albert" or "Albert John."
The son and successor of John Bright
took his seat amid a hurricane of Tory
cheers. "A strange mad world," said
the G. O. M., thinking of far-off days,
when John Albert's (or is it Albert
John ?) father used to be angrily roared
at from same quarter, whilst he stood
implacable, relentless, lashing them with
pitiless tongue.
Jokeim growing a little bashful about
his Budget. Gladstone insists upon
applauding it, because, as he says, it
establishes principle of graduated taxation
on property. No suon thing, Jokeim
laboriously explains. But Opposition
insists upon being pleased, and as Minis-
terialists can't very well oppose, Resolu-
tions pass without division. Jokeim
looking grotesquely uncomfortable at his
own success. Business done.—Budget
Resolutions agreed to.
Friday.—Sam Smith on the war-path
again. Once tasted blood of the Ministry
nothing will satisfy him," Wilfrid Law-
son says, "but to 'have some more in
a moog.'" On Tuesday routed them on
Question of Sale of Liquor in India; to-night attacks them on
Opium Question in China. Insists upon their stopping the sale oi
opium. Some difference of opinion as to its effects. Smith and J.
Pease say it's undermining vitality of Chinese Empire. Fahqu-
harson (who once had some practice in medicine), says, on contrary,
an occasional small dose highly beneficial. "Why!" he exclaimed,
"Wilberforce before making one of his speeches in this Hr-

1 Dear me! How verr
interesting."

always took a small opium pill." "Dear me." said E. N. Buxton,
looking in upon assembly he once adorned. How very interesting.
When I was in House often seemed to me that the opium had been
distributed among the audience."
Business done.—Sam Smith repulsed with great slaughter.
THE CHILDREN'S FANCY DRESS BALL AT THE MANSION HOUSE.
One of them werry rare peeps into Paradise, as I heard a werry
old Genelman call it, but which is ushally called Children's Fanoy
Dress Balls, took place at the Manshun House on "Wensday larst.
Ah! that was sumthink like a site that was!
the likes of which was most likely never seen
afore or since.
I don't, in coarse, know who sleoted the
warious karacters, but whoever did it did it
splendidly; and as fur as I coud gather from
the remarks of the werry thirsty cupples as
kep pretty constantly a cumming in for re-
freshments, the leading cupple, as was most
propper, bore off the Bell. I was kep so busy
with my own pertiokler work that I didn't
see the Bell myself, but I have no dowt it was
a regler buty. I had the lucky cupple pinted
out to me arterwarda, when they oum for sum
lemonade, and a nice hansum cupple they was,
as any fond Ma oood wish to nave. I was
told as they represented Lord and Lady Maress
Fiz-All wine—probably frenoh for Shampane—who was the werry
fust "of their 700 followers. Fiz-Allwinjs's blaok beard was a reel
staggerer, considerin as he coudn't have been more than 14 years old.
It snows what warmth and persewerence can do in a short time.
It's strange how reddily ewen children falls into bad habits, if so
be as they happens to fit 'em nicely. I noticed that Charles the
Second was partickler attentif to two or three werry pretty gals, and
brort them in to have sum lemonade, and a werry yung Irishman
had got his hat terribly nocked about, and I didn't at all wonder at
it when I saw the way in which he kept on drinking out of a pint
whisky bottel as he carried in his pocket. But such is life, weather
it bees werry old kings or werry young common counsilmen. We
didn't have no Chinc Chang, the great Chineese Giant as we had
wunce, but we had a much greater Gent in the sillybrated Kernel
Goobo, I think is his name, who, I am told, can bottle up any
little speech or little song as you chooses to sing or speak to him,
and can bring it out again years arterwards and when you are
thowsands of miles away, and repeat it to your estonished frends!
I herd him say that one of our grate Poets resited one of his best
poems into the magic box, but broke down in the middle, and
shouted tout, "I'm jiggered if I can remember another word," and,
strange to say, the wunderful box said the werry same thing, to
the grate emusement of everyboddy.
I was much shokt to see so many of the little deers a suffring so
sadly. Sum of the werry yungest on 'em wore specktacles on their
poor little noses, while one little chap of about six had grown quite
gray with cares and trubbles, I spose, but his Mar didn't seem to
care nothink about it. I was jest a leetle estonished to see how the
numerus Nuns and Sisters of Charity danced away, and a little sur-
prised at the curious dresses as sum of the Ladies wore. Sum had
large sheets of Callico at the backs of their heds, and others had their
Ats all on one side, as if about to fall off, but they didn't seem to
know it. It was nearly one, hay hem, before I sort my nupshal
couch arter a fatiging but most xciting heavening. Robert.
r
THE OVERTURE.
"Sound the trumpets, beat the drums," for the opening of the
Opera, May 15, at Covent Garden. Dbubiolanus is first in the
field, with his gallant musical band, among whom is Lord Charles
Bebesfobd, whose professional knowledge will be invaluable in a
revival of L'Africaine when the entire Operatic Company must be
at Sea. Also there is Mr. H. Chaplin, who will show them how to
clash the cymbals together in a bi-metallio manner, and all the other
distinguished dramatis persona; who were on the Italian Organising
Committee last year, and whom Mr. Punch had the pleasure of con-
gratulating on their success.
"A Puzzled Phtlosopheb" sends us this query:—If "All
the world's a stage," where's the audience? The gods? Are we
always, then, doing what Sir James Hannen warned Mr. Attobnet
against—that is, "playing to the gallery?"
"Ladt-Gutdbs" will, no doubt, become popular, in spite of the
danger of their being described by their feminine enemies as " Miss-
PLAY-TIME.
At One-Tree Bill, Bat/market, and at the 'Ave-a-New Burlesque Theatre.
Wealth at the Haymarket, but "no money in it" I

There is
should say. The entire piece in four Acts' might be boiled down into a
recital" for Mr. Beebbohm Tbee. Among the men in the piece
there is no other part worth mentioning as
a character, except that of a little modern
masher cad, capitally played, though here
and there exaggerated beyond the require-
ments of the Stage, by Mr. Weedon Gbos-
ssiiTH. Had this part been developed and
contrasted with Mr. Tree's, and the play
been re-named The Miser and the Masher,
it might have achieved a triumph, and little
Percy Palfreyman, in Mr. Weedon Gbos-
smith's hands, might in its own line have
repeated the wonderful success of Lord Dun-
dreary. When his Lordship commenced, that
part was very little bigger than this of Percy Palfreyman, but it
suited Sothebn ; he developed it, and it made him. The piece split
up; Jeitebson going his way with his version as the original hero
of the piece. The American Cousin, himself, and Sothebn going off
in another direction with his version, which to all intents was Lord
Dundreary, and the rest, even though Mr. Buckstone played Asa
Trenchard, nowhere.
If Mr. Henrt Authob Jones has not a soul above investing his
Wealth so as to bring him in something like fifty per cent., he should
take this hint, reduce Ruddock by one-half, and develop little
Palfreyman. To do this, he needn't lop and prune the Tree of One-
Tree-Hill,—which appellation the Haymarket Management is striving
to earn for its theatre,—but; when the run is over, he can re-write
the piece, so that its best friends and worst enemies won't know it
again.
The play begins well; the First Act is the best. The dialogue-
always excepting the dialogue solos d la Daddy Hardacre and Les
Cloches de Corneville—ia terse and natural enough in every situa-
tion, with bright'patches here and there, as in the simple Robert-
sonian love-scene in the Last Act, well played by Mr. Edmund
Maurice and Miss Nobbets, who is, thank goodness, a trifle less
obtrusively ingenuous than usual, and not having too much to do,
or any nonsensical theatrical sentimentalism to utter, she plays
simply, prettily, and effectively.
The other parts are as colourless as Mr. Brookeield's face, who
appears as the bad young man with the willainous whiskers. I have
heard of a " beetle-browed man," but to Mr. Broo k field must belong
the credit of introducing to the stage "the Black-beetle-whiskered
Young Willin'." How could he ever expect Miss Edith to love him
with such weird things on his cheeks?
Mr. Kemble, as the doctor, has another sort of whisker, so well put
on as to present the appearance of a parasitical growth, and though
at first inclined to carp at them, I actually found them growing on
me as the play proceeded, until at, last, when finally there was no
rivalry from the wicked whiskers—Mr. Brookfield having taken
himself off, and probably his whiskers, too—they exercised a fasci-
nation over me which certainly distracted my attention from the
details of Matthew Ruddock's moribunderings. Matthew Ruddock
died quietly about 11 p.m. the night I was there. A happy release!
Launcelot the Lovely, the Avenue Burlesque, has got some funny
notions in it, if you only exercise a little patience. The Stonehenge
Scene in Act the Second for a practical stage-joke is the best.
Arthur Robebts has one good Bong, a parody on the plantation
song " Who's that a callin' so sweet t" which he sings in his most
humorous style. The duet between Mile. Vanoni and A. Robebts
is not as good as the "Tzig-a-Tzig" in Nadgy, and he has not a
single chance equal to that in the Opera Bouffe which preceded
Nadgy, I forget its name, in whioh he played that inimitable soene
of the Bar-masher with Phyllis Bboushton, as the fascinating
Bar-maiden. Launcelot of Camelot is a Rummy lot, and if he was
a little awkward at starting, [he may yet be running six months
hence and come in a winner Tby a head. Whose head? Well either
the Author's or the Arthur's Jacx-in-the-Box.
P.S.—Mem. To go and see the Balloon at the Strand. I hear it
is " going up" nightly, as a balloon ought to do. It is under good
management, consisting of a first-rate aeronaut, Charles Wind'em.
and one Duck, who evidently is not a goose. Being an experienced
Manager—it is the Duck who took care of Our Boys—he is probably
an old bird not to be caught with chaff.
In Globo.
First Globe Trotter (a Mansfieldian). I like his Richard the Third.
He seems to get, as the French say, "into the skin of the character."
Second Globe Trotter. Ah! pity he's going away in the hot
weather, just when the skin has a chance of acting better.

the Profi ssor means, in this power-
ful picture, to expose and de-
nounce some hitherto unsuspected
abuse of the Charter - House

own private single rail. There are
some pictures within easy reach that
ought to have policemen on duty to
protect them; and there are others
so judiciously hung as to be quite
above criticism and out of harm's
way. To the powerful influence of
Mr. J. C. HOR8LEY, K.A , may be
traced—if tracing is permitted—the
number of unadorned female figures,
all of them of course representing
models of propriety. AlmaTadema

has painted "The Young Duke,"
and there can be no doubt about
the quality. Didn't Disraeli write
The Young Duke? If so, this may

THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.
March 20.—To-day being the day on which Daisy Mutlar and
Mr. Murray Posh are to be married, Lupin has gone with a friend
to spend the day at Gravesend. Lupin has been much cut-up-
over the affair, although he declares that
he is glad it is off. 1 wish he would not
go to so many Music Halls, but one dare
not say anything to him about it. At the
present moment he irritates me by singing
all over the house, some nonsense about
"What's the matter with Gladstone? He's
all right 1 What's the matter with Lupin?
He'sail right!" i" don't think either of
them is. In the evening, Gowino called,
and the chief topic of conversation was
Daisy's marriage to Murray Posh. I said,
"I was glad the matter was at an end, as
Daisy would only have made a fool of Lupin." Gowino, with his
usual good taste, said, "Oh, Master Lupin can make a fool of him-
self without any assistance." Carrie very properly resented this,
and Gowino had sufficient sense to say he was sorry.
March 21.—To-day I shall conclude my diary, for it is one of the
happiest days of my life. My great dream of the last few weeks—in
fact, of many years—has been realised. This morning came a letter
from Mr. Perkupp, asking me to take Lupin down to the office with
me. I went to Lupin's room; poor fellow, he seemed very pale, and
said he had a bad headache. He had come back yesterday from
Gravesend, where he spent part of the day in a small boat on the
water, having been mad enough to neglect to take his overcoat with
him. I showed him Mr. Pebkupp's letter, and he got up as quickly
as possible. I begged of him not to put on his fast-coloured clothes
ana ties, but to dress in something black or quiet-looking. Carrie
was all of a tremble when she read the letter, and all she could keep
on saying was, "Oh, I do hope it will be all right." For myself, I
could scarcely eat any breakfast. Lupin came down dressed quietly
and looking a perfect gentleman, except that his face was rather
yellow. Carrie, by way of encouragement, said, "You do look
nice, Lupin." Lupin replied, "Yes, it's a good make-up, isn't it?
A regular - downright - respectable - funereal - first - class - City - firm -
Junior-Clerk." He laughed rather ironically.
In the hall I heard a great noise, and also Lupin shouting to Sarah
to fetch down his old hat. I went into the passage, and found Lupin
in a fury, kicking and smashing a new tall hat. I said, "Lupin,
my boy, what are you doing? How wicked of "you! Some poor
fellow would be glad to have it." Lupin replied, " I would not insult
any poor fellow by giving it to him." When he had gone outside, I
picked up the battered hat and saw inside "Posh's Patent." Poor
Lupin! I can forgive him. It seemed hours before we reached the
offioe. Mr. Perkupp sent for Lupin, who was with him nearly an
hour. He returned, as I thought, crestfallen in appearance. I said,
"Well. Lupin, how about Mr. Perkupp?" Lutin commenced his
son^, "What's the matter with Perkupp? He's all right!" I felt
instinctively my boy was engaged. I went to Mr. Perkupp, but I
could not speak. He said, "Well, Mr. Pooter, what is it?" I
must have looked a fool, for all I could say was, "Mr. Perkupp. you
are a good man." He laughed at me for a moment and said, No,
Mr. Pooter, you are the good man; and we '11 see if we cannot get
your son to follow such an exoellent example." I said, "Mr.
Perkupp, may I go home? I cannot work any more to-day." My
good Master shook my hand warmly, as he nodded his head. It was
as much as I could do to prevent myself from crying in the 'bus, in
fact, I should have done so had my thoughts not been interrupted by
Lupin, who was having a quarrel with a fat man in the 'bus, whom
he accused of taking up too much room. In the evening Carrie
sent round for dear old friend Cummtnos and his wife, and also to
Gowino. We all sat round the fire, and in a bottle of "Jackson
Freres," which Sarah fetched from the grocers, drank Lupin's
health. I lay awake for hours, thinking of the future. My boy in
the same office as myself—we can go down together by the 'bus,
come home together, and who knows but in the course of time he
may take great interest in our little home. That he may help me to
put a nail in here or a nail in there, or help his dear mother to hang
a picture. In the summer he may help us in our little garden with
the flowers, and assist us to paint the stands and pots. (By the bye, I
must get in some more Enamel paint.) All this I thought over and
over again, and a thousand happy thoughts beside. I heard the clock
strike four, and soon after fell asleep only to dream of three happy
people, Lupin, dear Carrie, and myself.

"WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
FOURTEENTH EVENING.
"Early one Summer evening last year," said the Moon, "I was
looking down on some Public Pleasure Grounds, where a * Grand
Gala and Fete,' as 1h<>y call it, was going on. The boys from some
Training Ship or School had been
invited to attend, and had come in
their white and blue uniforms, looking
so sturdy, and healthy, and happy, as
they performed various gymnastic
exercises with clubs, dumb-bells, and
cutlasses, in the grounds, while their
band, who were all boys too, played
lively airs. When they were dis-
missed, the spectators found them-
selves provided with a rival attraction,
though on a smaller scale. Here, too,
the performers were quite young and
dressed like sailors, but there were
only a few of them, and they differed,
too, in other respects. For one thing,
the second body were not so smart and
healthy-looking, nor nearly so well set
up as the real sailor-boys; for another,
they were commanded—not by grown-
up officers, but by a little person dressed as nearly as possible to
resemble your famous Admiral, Lord Nelson. The crowd gathered
round, greatly amused, as the miniature commander halted his
force. Some would have it that he was a boy, but I thought that a
boy would have looked sheepish and awkward dressed up like that,
and I was certain from the first that the little Admiral must be a girl.
"I can see her now, in her quaint hat and white wig, her gold-
laced coat and white knee-breeches, as Bhe strutted up and down,
pretending to take snuff, and inspect the boys drawn up in line
through a small spy-glass she carried. She was rather a pretty
child, though she would have appeared to more advantage on a

lighted stage than there, for it was still broad daylight, and her face
looked pallid and unhealthy under the rouge some one had put on
her cheeks.
"But no one could have been happier or more perfectly pleased
with herself than Bhe was. Everyone was looking on and openly
admiring her gallant bearing, while she paced the path like a
quarter-deck, and bullied any boy who had not put his feet at
exactly the right angle. The boys, who, like herself, had been
engaged in the neighbourhood for the occasion, submitted with sulky
glowering faces, for they felt mortified to be seen being ordered
about like that by a mere girl. And I noticed that the pride and
self-satisfaction of the small Nelson seemed to increase visibly every
instant. The manager—a big, coarse-looking man, with a thick
gold chain and a dyed moustache—had come out into the grounds,
and she made her way up to his side at once, and began to converse
affably and easily, as with an equal, giving him her views, with
little explanatory waves of her hand, upon the most suitable place
for marshalling her company. She was quite aware that all eyes
were upon her, and that even the boys under her authority were
secretly impressed with her coolness. The Manager, who happened
to be in a good humour just then, addressed her as ' my dear,' and
smiled indulgently; perhaps he was amused by her presumption,
and the wonderful airs she gave herself. Presently he told her to put
her company through their manoeuvres:
"Ana then—I don't know how it was, whether Nelson lost her
head and forgot the proper word of command, or whether the boys
turned mutinous ana made mistakes on purpose—but everything
went wrong somehow; there was nothing but blundering and con-
fusion. The Admiral grew less and less confident, until her face
was so red that she no longer needed rouge, the bystanders began to
titter and make rude remarks, and the Manager left off smiling. _
"At last he called up the incompetent Commander, and publicly
rebuked her—so loudly, that everyone could hear what he said. And
the poor little Nelson, thoroughly humbled and frightened by his
rough sarcasm, hung her head, and burst into tears of very unheroio
mortification before the whole company! Then," said the Moon, "I
hid my face behind a convenient cloud, for I really could not bear to
look on any longer."

Times for being away at one of the earliest of the meetings of the
Council, a perfect pattern
of punctuality, is in his
place to the moment. He
anxiously glances round
the chamber, and then
seems greatly relieved.
Many of the boys have not
returned from the Easter
holidays. The girls are
more zealous. Lady Sand-
hurst and Miss Alder-
spinster Cons are sitting
together, and possibly
discussing the ownership
of the Royal Victoria Music
Hall (late Royal Coburg
Theatre) in which the latter
takes much interest.
Young Master Lawson has
returned rosy-cheeked from
the country. The Patriot
Burns is on excellent terms
with un-bloated aristocrat
Common—quite a pretty
sight to see the Working
Man talking amiably to a
Lord-bv-courtesy. For a moment, I fancy I recognise my dear
and valued friend Contbeaee, and am disappointed to discover
that his place is supplied (but in all fairness I must add,
efficiently supplied) by Lord Monkswkll. I am rather new to the
spot, so cannot swear to everyone. However, I fancy I have Been
a gentleman in a red tie who I am told is an architect (or was it a
Volunteer?—I forget which) somewhere before. Other faces I
recognise as being familiar to me in and about the neighbourhood
of the refreshment department at the Law Courts. Another individual
is pointed out to me as the sharp marksman of the Financial News.
The Entire CHarrington is also here ready d propos of the Music
Halls to bring blushes into the cheeks of young persons unaccustomed
to publio speaking. He has a willing supporter in Alderman the
Reverend Fleming Williams, who it is to be hoped will never go to
the theatre'when Shakspeare's masterpiece is being performed for
fear that he may be induced in recognition of the fitness of things,
to play for the rest of his life the Ghost
of Hamlet's Father. He would make an
admirable ghost—I feel sure of it. And
I fancy there are many present who
would like to see him, one. Be ales the
Chorus is also in attendance ready to shout
"Divide!" or " Vote |» "The originator
of the whole affair" is most useful when
he confines himself to these utterances.
Bottomley Firth, as usual, is combining
the activity of the office messenger with
the gravity of the country village clerk.
Arthur Arnold and Lieutenant-Colonel
Howard Vincent, M.F., commanding the
Queen's Westminster Rifle Volunteers,
and other persons of lesser note, are also
present.
"Mister" Rosebebt is quite oheerful as
he knocks on the table in front of him.
He calls out the various numbers in the
Agenda, and for some minutes there are
cries of "Agreed!" But there is a rook
ahead. We oome to the Report of the
Theatres and Musio Halls, and then Mr.
Fabdell rises and explains that there is
a recommendation and an " alternative."
The recommendation is, that the licensing
of the Music Halls shall be entrusted to a
Committee; and the "alternative" is,
that that Committee should report to the
Council. Mr. Fabdell sits down, and then Captain Vebnet moves
an amendment which is seemingly calculated to cut out Mr. Augustus
Harris (absent) from being a member of the Licensing Committee.
Then the Entire Chabbinoton tells some rather risqui stories of
a Music Hall, wherein seemingly the audience are better pleased
with champagne than beer; and "Mister" Rosebery (no doubt
in the interest of the Alderspinster Cons) calls him to order. Then
comes a battle-royal, for by this time the Chamber is nearly full.

1 From this time Firth for
evermore.'
At length the Chairman rises, and suggests that as the motions
and amendments have got into a condition of hopeless confusion,
perhaps it would be as well to put certain questions to the Council,
and get the sense—" if any," said evidently the Chairman to himself,
judging by the twinkle in his eye,—of the meeting upon each of them.
This proposal is received with (applause, possibly all the heartier
because the hour sacred to dinner is rapidly approaching. Then we
have votes and divisions, and excursions into the corridor, and all
sorts of peculiar countings. On one occasion "Mister" Rosebery
appoints a couple of double tellers to get the votes of either party,
and discovers, when the totals are ascertained, that three tellers
went one way and a solitary teller the other! In fact the meeting
partakes of the charaoter of a roaring farce. However, some sort of a
decision is at length reached, when someone doubts the legality of the
whole proceedings, and asks for counsel's opinion thereon!
And now I have been listening and laughing for nearly three
hours, and about an eighth of the suggested work of the sitting
has been accomplished, and I calculate that at the present rate of
progress the work will not be finished until the small hours of the
coming day. So I beat a retreat (imitating the Member for the
Western Division of St. Pancras, who, for the moment, is a lost
Raphael), and learn on referring to the papers of the next morning,
that " after some further business, the meeting adjourned." What
that business was, I do not in the least know, and from the silence
of the Press, I fancy that the reporters must have equally shared
my ignorance.
OUR IN-SUBORDINATES.
[The Paris schoolmasters have "struck work"; Tommy who is now at
Wnippingham Academy for Young Gentlemen—hopes the English ones will
do the same. This will be his diary, if they do.]
Monday.—Have enjoyed a perfectly delightful day! The first
nice one since I came to old Swisher's ''Academy." Swisher
himself of course can't teach a little bit: he's too much of a muif.
So the other Masters (there are three of them) do all that, while
Swisher comes in now and then, and superintends, and inflicts
what he calls "corporal punishment"—the old beast!—when he's
Sot nothing better to do. This morning we heard that the three
[asters had struck work! Swisher had gone off to remonstrate
with them, and we were left to ourselves. Steebpobth (he's the
captain of our eleven), said it would be good fun to make an effigy
of Swisher, by stuffing a sack full of old oopy-books. We did it, and
set fire to it out in the playground. Such larks! Hope Swisheb
and the three Masters won't come back for a jolly long time.
Tuesday.—Swisher has come back, but is ill from anxiety," the
Matron says. Hurrah! And the three Masters are still out on strike.
Never knew before what a jolly thing a strike was. Steerforth
(who knows about everything), says that Swisheb will have to raise
Masters' salaries. Or, if he doesn t do that, he can "lock them out."
Yes, but if he locks us in, we shan't have any half-holidays! Grab
better to-day; Steerforth believes Swishebib frightened. Generally
we only get pudding on alternate Thursdays; but to-day we had a
jolly one, though it s only Tuesday. Oh, what fun a strike is!
Wednesday.—We'vepainted most of the school-room pea-green!
Steekforth bought us the colours and brushes, and then fagged us to
dab it all over the walls; but we liked doing it. Then young
Blogoins, who is such a cure, did a picture of Swisheb with a pipe
in his mouth, in vermilion, on the wet paint, and it really isn't half
bad. Steebforth will get some gunpowder. No lessons again to-day! |
Thursday.—Steerforth says the three Masters have formed a
Trades' Union. Don't know what a Trades' Union is a bit, but if it
means that Masters aren't coming back, and that it will be all holi-
days, I think it's a splendid institution. Had a paper-chase all over
Swisher's flower-beds. Tried who could throw stones best over the
house—only broke four windows. Matron very angry, but we don't
mind her. She says old Swisheb is getting better. Sorry to hear it
Friday.—Masters still away! Steerforth tells us what to do with
the gunpowder. Puts half a barrel in tool-shed up against house,
and then lays a train, which we are to set fire to. He says it's like
conspirators, and that " it'U amuse old Swisher." Funny of Steer-
forth to send his boxes off to station beforehand. Looks as.if he
were going on strike, too. We all hope not. As we daren't disobey
Steekforth, we do fire the train. Result not bo funny as we
expected. Knocks us all down, makes big hole in wall of house,
blows tool-shed to smithereens, and brings old Swisher downstairs
with a cane! Swisher oertainly is much better—the beast! Never
had such a licking before! Bed.
Saturday.—Strike over. Masters back. And Steerforth, it
seems, was leaving, and has gone away, leaving us to bear brunt of
old Swisher's anger. We all think Steebforth must have been
suddenly sent for, or he would never have deserted us in this way.
Swisheb and Masters all in bad temper. No holidays next week!
Swisher himself on the strike—with the cane!

STEAMING AT HIGH PRESSURE.
Being a further Blow-off a la Blovntz.
I am naturally a modest man, but I am not disposed to underrate
my calling of journalist, which, take it as a whole, is about the most
exalted position in this world that any man of distinction and intel-
ligence can be called upon to occupy. And I am, par excellence, the
journalist of journalists. I do not boast
of this, I merely state a simple fact,
and when I condescend to button-hole
an Emperor or distinguished diploma-
tist, they know well enough which of
us two the world regards as honoured
by the interview. But let that pass.
Suffice it to say that, hearing there
was to be a European Congress at
Berlin, it struck me it would be a
unique feat in journalism to publish
the text of the treaty in extenso in the
columns of the paper I represented the
day before it was finally settled by the
Congress itself. I saw that this would
surprise somebody, and I was right.
However, I knew that I had only to
will to do it, to carry it out, and, as
a preliminary step, I hurried to St. Petersburg to see the Czar.
Letting myself into the Winter Palace with my own latchkey, I soon
found myself in the private apartments, and, entering without
knocking, as is my wont, discovered His Majesty seated in his study
in his dressing-gown partaking of a light luncheon.
"Come in, Gorrz, my boy!" he said, greeting me effusively,
and pouring me out a glass of viski, and offering me a cigarette.
"And what may be your best news? You know your visits are
always a most delightful experience to me."
"Quito so," I replied, smiling. "But look here, your Majesty—"
And then I detailed the scheme of my proposed journalistic feat in a
few well-chosen words to him, and he was all attention.
"Certainly," he said, after listening courteously to what I had to
say; "I see exactly what you want, and will unquestionably help
you in any way I can. How, by the way, would you like to attend
the Congress instead of Kortakoff, who can easily have a bad cold P
In his clothes, with a little disguise, you could make up like him.
Shall I drop him a line?"
"So do, Sire," I replied, slapping the Czar on the back j "you
are a trump. And if there is anything I can do for your Majesty in
Central Asia, or Poland, or elsewhere, I added, "you have only got
to let me know."
The interview ended after this, and I returned to Berlin with the
Czar's autograph letter sewn for safety into the back of my coat.
After this it was all plain sailing. I called on Kortakoff and
gave him the Czar's letter. He nodded as he read it. "Very well,"
he said, "I am quite game. I'll come to your hotel. We will
ohange clothes, and you shall look me up in your room, every day,
till you come back."
So our programme was carried out. I attended the Congress, and
though the Turkish Representative, who had met Kortakoff at
St. Petersburg, stared hard at me, and said I had "grown so fat,"
he should hardly have known me, yet I managed to pass muster
fairly, though I noticed the Chancellor several times had his eye on
me. And as matters turned out, I found I had not imposed on him,
for after the second sitting, he touched me on the shoulder, and with
a significant wink, said, I say, Prince, a word with you in private."
As soon as he had shut the door of the retiring room to which we
had adjourned, he burst out into a loud guffaw, and continued,
"Well, Gorrz, my boy! what on earth does this mean? You
didn't think you could do me, did you? Why, I spotted you, the
moment you opened your mouth. Well, what's your little game, eh?"
I explained the situation forthwith to him. and solicited his
assistance. He promised me this in the most nattering and com-
plimentary terms. "Well, Gorrz, my boy," he said, "if it had
been anybody else than you, I don't think I should care to connive
at the business, but as you are in yourself such an important
European factor, and have got the German Empire, and I may add, I
myself, out of so many scrapes,—well, you certainly oan count on me
to keep my counsel and see you through with it."
And Prince Bismarck kept his worn. And so aoting for liussia, I
drew up the concluding articles of the Treaty and worded the pre-
amble, which had been sent on to me that very afternoon from
Printing House Square, where it was already set up in type, and so
it came about that I was enabled to publish in the Times of Friday,
the text of the Treaty that was not definitely settled by the Congress
till Saturday, thereby accomplishing a feat in journalism which I
apprehend it will take the record some time to beat. I flatter myself,
by doing this, I rather astonished the whole civilised world. But as
I hinted at the beginning of this article, I am a very remarkable man.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Cheap Butcher's Meat.—It was certainly a happy idea of yours
to dispense with the Middleman by making that arrangement with
the Dorsetshire farmer you mention, to send you up a live bullock to
divide with your three friends every fortnight; but the arrival of the
beast at your house while you were giving a small dinner-party,
coupled with the fact that owing to the refusal of the railway people
to call again with it in the morning it had to be left in the front hall
and pass the night in your study, must, as you say, have occasioned
you considerable inconvenience. There are, of course, several ways
of killing the creature, and if you think you can manage it, we should
advise you by all means to pole-axe it. Failing this, you had perhaps
better fall back on the revolver, or, as you seem rather inclined to
it, you might try an overdose of chloroform as you suggest. But
you are certainly not bound, as far as we can see, to dispose of the
creature yourself. Yes, by all means, plaoe it on the top of a four-
wheeler, and take it in turn to the houses of your three friends, and
see whether you cannot arrange for its slaughter and division at one
or other of their premises. If the worst comes to the worst, you can
but show a bold front, pay the cabman and leave it. This may
possibly lead to some disagreeables; perhaps, to a summons and some
further legal expenses, but still you can satisfy yourself that you
have at least got rid of the exorbitant profits realised by your butcher.
We shall be glad to hear from you when the whole matter is satis-
factorily concluded, and you have settled the bill of your lawyers,
how much you reckon that the meat has cost you per pound.
Utilising a Funereal Prize.—We are not surprised to hear
that you have been at some doubts as to the best way of turning to
account the hearse which you mention that you have lately won in
a raffle; but we think that your idea of taking the top off, cutting
it down, painting it a bright emerald green, and letting it out as a
pleasure van, is certainly worthy of consideration. We are only
afraid that even after undergoing this gala transformation its shape
might still be somewhat suggestive of its previous use, and possibly
cast a gloom on a party of thoughtful merry-makers, which would,
of course, be a decided drawbaok to its utilisation for such a purpose.
But why not get a pot of Aspinall's Red Enamel, give it a ooat,
and offer it to the Authorities for the conveyance service of the
Parcels Post? Your alternative fancy for keeping it as it is, and
letting it be quietly known among your friends that in the event
of the decease of any of them, you will only be too happy to place
it at their disposal, shows a considerate and kindly spirit, but we
cannot but think that the offer would be misunderstood and resented.
Probably only the eye of an undertaker would detect the vehicle in
its new disguise; and the matter, if only regarded in the light of
an interesting experiment, certainly seems worth a trial. Send it to
your coach-builder's, and have it put in hand at once.

S. G. O.
{Lord Sydney Qodolphin Osborne, Died, May 9, Aged 81.)
Another long-heard voice at last is stilled!
Warm heart, which to all tales of suffering thrilled.
Sound head, which social problems loved to face,
Yon will be missed from your peculiar place,
Held long ere Bitter Cries found echoes free,
And aid of rhetoric, if not remedy;
When not all men were Socialists, and not
All eyes were open to each bane and blot
Found in the body-politic. E'en then
That sympathetic eye, that potent pen
Were dedicate to service of your kind,
To true benevolence, ardent, yet not blind,
And bettering of the village and the town.
Now, many wandering voices woo renown
As Social Oracles. But Punch looks back
With praise upon his honourable track
Of useful days who thirty years ago
Was known, and loved, by him as S. G. 0.
THE HARMLESS NECESSARY "CAT."
Me. Pouch has small sympathy with what he deems
the false sentiment which denounces the use of the lash
—upon brutes—as brntalising. Means must be adapted
to ends. The burglar and the ruffianly wife-beater
would seem to have something in common with the
immortal lady who didn't mind death but couldn't stand
pinching. They don't seem, effectively, to mind the
risks of their calling or the prospect of imprisonment, but
they "oannot stand" whipping. Whipping, therefore,
sharp and painful without being physically injurious,
would seem to be a promising deterrent, and, indeed,
has proved so, in the opinion of good judges. Now it is
complained that the '"Cat" is oruel, because it often
seriously injures as well as pains. Very well, let that be
amended. To lash a brute so violently that you have
afterwards to cosset him up in hospital oannot be either
true humanity or sound policy. By all means dock the
Cat of certain of its nine tails if necessary, and lay on
the remainder with valour, but also with discretion, both
as regards selection of the spot for their application and
the amount and energy of the application itself. Descend
ye Nine! or six, or three, as the case may be; but
descend, though manfully, yet with measure.
THINGS ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE LEFT UNSAID.

ALL-A-BLOWING!
A Spring-Plea from the Suburbs.
All-a-blowing! In the May-time there is playtime e'en for toil,
For the breath of Spring sets fanoy wild a-wing;
There is something in the Season even stucco scarce can spoil,
The cacophonous street-hawker seems to sing.
All-a-blowing I He is going with his barrow down the street;
There's a flowering shrub tucked under either arm,
And the echoes of his shrill stentorian cry sound almost sweet.
Ay. in May e'en clamorous costers have their charm;
For die morn has brought a sun-burst and the very asphalte smiles
With a radiant recognition of the boon.
There 'a a glow upon the chimneys, and a glory on the tiles,
Where the cockney sparrows chirp and fight, and "spoon."
Rus in urbe has its meaning on this sunny morn of May,
Though surburban streets are not Arcadian quite.
For the tiniest square of garden dons a verdurous array,
And the roads are vistas green of glowing light.
Over wall and gate and lamp-post bursts the leafy emerald screen.
Of the sycamore, the lilac, and the lime,
Even slums look fax less sordid when they show a speck of green,
Not yet dulled to dingy grey by grit and grime.
And the blossoms—ah! the blossoms of the apple and the pear!
Their lovely lavish largess on the town,
Falls like a floral garment, veiling all that's black and bare.
It might wake poetic impulse in a down.
But to watch it, and to think of the tender white and pink;
Of the purple of the plumy lilac spires.
From the dull suburban window you may thrust your head and drink
Of that fragrance of the Spring which never tires.
All-a-blowing! Pipe up, coster, for your cry is just the voice
Of all Nature, though your hoarseness mars the air.
E'en in Doldrum Street, 8.W., the drudges must rejoice,
And sad Cockneys feel some lightening of their care.
The Philistines who dwell in yon Villas coldly " Swell,"
Look more human with May blossoms in their
There's the Season's first white waistcoat! Clear and mellow as
The blackbird fluteth forth his first Spring notes [a bell,
From yon tall acacia-top, he trills on and does not stop
For the chattering lawn-mower which hard by
A baggy-legged old buffer with a head like a grey mop
Is grinding at with slow stolidity.
All-a-blowing! Farther West Art is putting forth her best
At the Burlington, the Grosvenor, and the New;
But in this suburban Gath we have no aesthetic test;
Art-flowers among the Philistines are few.
In Bond Street they are all a-blowing floridlv, hut here
Labour leaves men little leisure to be floral.
Burne-Jones in Bethnal Green, so they say, finds fitting sphere,
Here we 're mournful and monotonous, though moral.
And the Jerry Builder menaces our little bits of green
And the little bursts of blossom more and more.
The dull mechanio round and the conquering machine
Are the pitiless twin despots of the poor.
Brick-and-mortardom prevails; weighed in Capital 'a cold scales,
Leaves and grass are just the merest waste of space.
Felled trees and dwindling garden-patches tell their own sad tales;
Even Spring-time cannot come in green-robed grace
To a stucco-faced Sahara such as spreads, and spreads, and spreads
O'er the old suburban semi-rural scene.
All a-blowing! Leave us something more than flags, and slates, and
"leads;"
Let sweet Spring in London's outskirts still show green!
A Vert Lame Joke.—Horse Show at Olympia commences to-day.
The name of the place is ominous for a horse show, unless it wete
going to be an exhibition of lame ones, as the 'bus conductors gene-
rally call it out, "All-limp'ere!"
Musical Note.—A more-or-less biblical subject ought not to be
parodied. Yet how has Judith been treated, and who did it?
Seriously, Parrt did; and very well Parry did it.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commontj Monday Night, May 6.—Curse of Cam-
borne turned up to-night quite unexpected; took me rather aback.
"How d'you do?" I said, shaking hands. (Always say, "How
d' you do P " and shake hands when 1 don't know what else to say or
do. Used at first to strike me as oddest thing that people among
whom I live should, when they meet, each hold out hand, get hold of
other fellow's and wag it up and down. Might just as well rub the
soles of their feet together
— quite as easy after a
little practice; or might
gently rub baoks of their
heads. Very odd thing is
man.) Think of this as
I shake hands with the
Cubse.
"Hum—er," I said, not
thinking of anything else,
and wanting to say some-
thing pleasant, "thought
you were in prison."
"Oh, dear, no," said he,
little nervously; "that's
only Balfoub's fun.
Doesn't really mean to
put me in prison; do you
think he does P Besides,
he dare not do it. The
people are Roused; the
Great Heart of the Nation
beats tumultuously. There
are twenty thousand Cor-
nishmen who will know
the reason why. Don't
vou think the people are
Roused?"
Ashmead. Curse seems a little
nervous. Try to cheer him up. "Yes, I think they are," I say;
"or if not, they will Rouse by-and-by. If you 're waking Rouse
me early, don't you know. Don't trouble yourself: it's all very
well for Balfour to say he '11 shut you up; but, as we know in
the House, that's not easily done."
Quite a lively Debate on affair at Falcarragh. The Curse took
prominent part, making one speech on his feet and several more from
his place on Bench. Speaker constantly calling hira to order; House
howled at him; Old Morality once interposed with string of moral
reflections designed to show inconvenience of discussing case sub
judice; House once on the howling tack turned upon 0. M. with such
startling vigour that he gratefully resumed his seat and said no more.
Harcoubt wondered why evervbody laughed when he accused
Balfour of "blustering;"
Edward Clarke calls Har-
coubt "most insolent; " Bal-
four at bay ; the Curse pop-
ping up and down trying to
get off another little speech,
but always laid by his heels by
watchful Speaker.
After this scarcely time or
inclination left for Debate on
Naval Defences Bill. Sage
of Queen Anne's Gate moves
rejection; Government getting
frightened at attack, sent for
Ashmead - Bartlett; Asir-
kead, nobly forgetful of
former slights, arrives post
haste, breaks the silence of
many years, consenting to
Joketm8 hard terms that he
shall forego a quarter's salary.
"Couldn't afford todo it of ten,"
says Ashmead; "butthe Go-
vernment being, as the Mab-
kiss remarks, impecunious,
oan't refuse occasionally to
fall in with their plans."
Business done.—Debate on
Naval Defences Bill.
Tuesday.—Everyone wanting to


Whizzing past,
know who is the mysterious
person who has offered to give money for National Portrait Gallery
Plunket assailed with questions, but nothing to be got out of him,
"Donor," he said, just now in response to persistent questions,
"Dono. Various names mentioned. Or.n Mobality at one time
favourite; Members looked kindly on him as he sat on the Treasury
Bench; just the sort of thing he would do. Then someone remembers
that M Ait kiss, in making announcement at Academy dinner, observed
that he had never before heard the name of mysterious benefactor.
Couldn't say that of Smith of course; so Old Morality theory
regretfully abandoned. Spencer Balfour deolares he knows all
about it. Met him just now in the lobby, or rather Baw him spinning
past. Curious rotary motion;
sort of understudy of a peg-top.
Can't imagine how he does it.
"Found him out!" he shouts
breathlessly, as he spins past.
"It's Joseph Gnxis f!"
Wonder if this can be true?
Not at all improbable. Joseph
known to be what is called
'1 warm "; probably been a boom
in bacon; ham on the hop; mar-
kets firm; Joseph having cut in
at low prices gets out at a rise.
"What shall I do with the
surplus P" he says, to himself.
"Take noble revenge on the
Saxon. Nation can't afford to
build Portrait Gallery; I'll do
it for 'em." That seems reason-
able enough. Shall go and look
up Joey B. ; Bee if he's easier
to pump than Plunket,
Whizzing noise in the distance
comes nearer and nearer. It't
Spencer Balfour again; been
to end of corridor; whizzing
more rapidly than ever. Only
just catch his assurance as he
flies past, "Yes. It's Joseph
Gilus!"
Business done. — Naval De-
fences Bill read Second Time.
Thursday.—House of Lords been wilderness since it met after
Recess. Every afternoon solitary and graceful figure seen advancing
towards Woolsack; sits there for five or ten minutes; declares one
or two Bills advanced a stage; and then, with sweeping stride and
inimitable dignity, disappears. This the Lord Chancellor, earning
his insufficient £4,000 a year as Speaker of Lords. To-night a sudden
change. House filled on both sides.
Three rows of Bishops in nice white
gowns seated below Ministers.
"Some mischief in contemplation,"
said Wilfrid Lawson looking in,
"Wonder what it is? Bet a bottle of
lemonade it's either Land or the Church
— Money or Religion. Fancy from pre-
sence oi the Bishops that the Church is
in some manner in danger."
So it was, indirectly. Deceased Wife's
Sister Bill on for Second Reading.
"Why BillP" Lord Meath asks,
gazing at animated scene from space by
steps of Throne. "Deceased Wife's
Sister Jane, Mary, or even Sue I could
understand. But Sister Bill seems an
anomaly, unless, indeed, she was chris-
tened Wllhelmina. Must look into
this matter."
Earl Percy has looked into it, and
finds it won't do. This stalwart border
knight, this flower of Northumbrian
chivalry, this heir to the renown of
Douglas's doughty foe at Chevy Chase,
moved rejection of Bill. Selborne on
same side; Argyll and Primate—Mo-
rality and Piety—bringing up the rear.
In vain Grimthorpe submitted to mer-
ciless dissection the tootling of the mas-
sive Percy; without effect Hebschell
urged that you oan't pick and choose
out of Leviticus. If you take one of
its edicts as a rule of social order you
must take the lot. All in vain; Bishops won the day, Bill being
thrown out by a majority of 27 in House of 267 Peers.
Commons spent long night in Committee of Supply. Actually
passed a few Votes. Earlier in Sitting W. Redmond attempted to
create diversion by mentioning case of King Ja-Ja. Ja-Ja, whose
descent from early Kings of Connaught can be infallibly traced, now

ON COMMISSION.

Mayl, 8, 9, and 10.—While Mr. Pabnell has been in the box
the Court has been crowded with a large amount of "rank, beauty,
and intellect," and on his disappearance from that coign of vantage
the place has resumed its normal appearance. Even the examination
and cross-examination of His Grace
the Archbishop of Dublin attracted a
comparatively small audience. And
here I may perhaps give a sketch of
the proceedings .connected with those
latter inquiries in a dramatic form, on
the understanding—on the clear un-
derstanding—that what I am about to
write is not in the least likejhe real
thing:—
Mr. lli-id (.after arranging a mass
of documents). I believe your Grace is
Archbishop of Dublin?
His Grace. I am. I was, &c, &c, &c.
[ Gives an interesting sketch of his
ecclesiastical appointments.
Mr. Reid. Quite so. Will your Grace
be so good as to give the History of
Ireland.
His Grace. With pleasure. Irish-
men in every part of the world were descended from Adam, or as we
should now call him O'Dam and
The President {courteously interrupting). Do you not think Mr.
Reid that we might make this a little shorter?
Mr. Reid (with plaintive politeness). I wish to do my best, my Lord,
to carry out the wishes of the Court, although I am anxious to get
this matter (which is new matter) on the notes. (Turning to Witness.)
Probably your Grace could kindly commence the History of Ireland
at a little later date.
His Grace (smiling amiably). Certainly. After the flood Noah
was succeeded by Shem, Ham, and O'Japhet.
Mr. Reid (conscious of his nationality, and his duty to his Dum-
fries constituents). May I suggest (I am told that it is so) that the
name of the latter gentleman was MacJapiiet.
Hit Grace (shakes his head smilingly, but repeats). O'JArHET. I
think you will find I am right—O'Japhet.
Mr. Reid (partly conceding the point). Well, O'Japhet or Mac-
Japhet. Yes, your Grace?
The President (who has consulted with his colleagues, mildly).
Really, Mr. Reid I do not see that His Grace has any special infor-
mation—that he could not obtain in common with all men of
intelligence and education—on this matter.
Mr. Justice Smith (persuasively). You see, it is not before us as
an issue to be tried.
Mr. Reid (distressed but yielding, smiles sorrowfully at the Bench
and turns to Witness). Then we will come at once toil879. As Arch-
bishop of Dublin, it was your Grace's duty to know everything?
His Grace. Certainly.
Mr, Reid. Will you be so good as to tell us all you know.
His Grace (searching a black bag and producing documents). The
principles of electricity are
The President (again interrupting more in sorrow than in anger).
I have no doubt, that a lecture upon electricity from his Grace,
would be of the deepest interest to all of us, but
Mr. Big gar (suddenly popping up from the welt of the Court).
May I say a word, my Lord. If this evidence is not received, tell
me now why is the evidence of hirelings of the Government received
—tell me that now P
The President (to Mr. Biggab). Your observation has not assisted
the Court, Sir. (Mr. Biggab smilingly subsides.) I would add that
unless it can be shown that His Grace has special knowledge of the
facts, we do not see how this line of examination can be pursued.
Mr. Reid (in deep distress). I must urge upon your Lordships
that this matter is of vital importance to us. I would suggest that
we propose multiplying his Grace's evidence.
The President (in a tone of the greatest regret). Alluring as the
prospect is to Mr. Justice Day, and in fact all of us, of having about
ten thousand additional witnessess introduced in this matter (possibly
inclusive of the Pope, the Archbishop of Cantebbubt, and the
Reverend C. H. Spurgeon), we do not quite see our way to acceding
to your request.
Mr, Reid (almost in tears). Then, my Lord, I must respectfully
ask for an adjournment to reconsider my position.
And certainly the Court did adjourn earlier than usual on Wed-
nesday. On Thursday my ever lively and learned friend, Mr. At-
kinson, cross-examined His Grace, and the rest of the time of the
Commission during the week was occupied in hearing some very
amusing evidence from parish priests and others whose nationality
could not for a moment be doubtful.
And now, before I conclude, I must answer a question that has
been put to me by a Correspondent signing himself "One who has
spent Fifty Sleepless Nights in painful perplexity." This
gentleman asks "how it comes that although Messrs. Arthur
O'Connor and T. Habbington seem both to be Defendants, they
also apparently are appearing as Counsel?" To the lay mind no
doubt this problem may perhaps be a little confusing. A possible
explanation, however, is as simple as A B C. It is my opinion that
Mr. T. Habbington appears to represent Mr. Abthub 0 Connob, a
gentleman who is very probably specially retained to represent
Mr. T. Habbington. I may perhaps be permitted to add, that I feel
convinced that, if this be so, the interests of both are quite safe in
the hands of either. (Signed) A. Briefless, Junior.
Pump-handle Court.'
WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
FIFTEENTH EVENING.
"I will tell you another story about a little girl," began the
Moon. "She is quite a small girl still, but she has been most care-
fully brought up, and generally her manners are irreproachable.
The other day, she was taken by
her mother to have afternoon tea
with a couple of very precise old
maiden ladies. I saw her driving to
their house, and heard the mother
impressing upon her daughter that
she must be most particular what she
said or did, and it struck me that the
little girl was rather offended at being
thought to require such instruction.
'It's not quite the first time I've been
out to tea, you know, Mummy !' she
protested, and probably her mother
felt that she might spare herself any
further anxiety, for she smiled very
proudly and fondly as she patted the
child's cheek. A little later, I looked
through the windows of the room
where they were all at tea—a pretty
old drawing-room, full of old-fashioned furniture and quaint china.
The little girl was certainly behaving very nicely: The elder of the
two ladies had graciously informed her that she was the first person
to hold her in her arms as a baby when she came home from India,
and the ohild had replied, ' But I suppose you were quite young then f'
"After that she said very little, being engaged m calmly enjoying
the good things which were pressed upon her, and which had a
much more tempting appearance than ner ordinary nursery fare.
By and by one of the old ladies complimented the proud mother
upon her daughter's pretty looks and manners. 'So very kind of
you to tell me so,' the mother answered, beaming, 'but indeed, I
must say, that my Olive has been very carefully' Here she
stopped short with a gasp. She had glanced at her Olive as she
spoke, and, to her horror, this carefully brought-up little maiden
was just then deliberately and demurely pocketing one of the pieces
of bread-and-butter! It was a tempting piece of bread-and-butter,
out as thin as a wafer and daintily rolled up, but that was no possible
excuse for such a glaring breach of etiquette. 'Olive!' the poor
mother could only cry, faintly,' how dreadful of you! . . . She's not
at all a greedy child, as a rule. I cannot understand it,' she tried to
explain. But Olive, who meanwhile had been wrapping up the
bread-and-butter in her handkerchief, was perfectly unabashed.
'I'm not greedy now,' she explained, a little haughtily, 'I don't
pocket things to eat. That would be very unladylike. I only
thought I might take just one piece of this nice bread-and -butter
home—as a pattern for my nurse, you know.' And the two old ladies
seemed less shocked than might have been expected."

THE NEGLECTED EOUNDLING.
Mr. Punch to Mr. Bull .—
Friend Bull, a word ■with you! My sharpest
strictures,
You know, are always moved by hearty
loyalty.
Well, at this pleasant time of Spring,—and
Piotures,—
When Art and Nature vie in radiant
royalty;
When the May blossoms and May Exhibitions
Open in genial rivalry together,
And all men's talk is of the fair conditions
Of broadening Art and of the brightening
weather;
When Springtide's "flowery bursts" are
emulated
By flowery Sir Frederick's oratory,
There's a Btern fact or two that should be
stated,
Whioh rather tend to dim the Season's
glory.
You look complacent, John. I'm bent on
shocking
A mood whose sweetness should not be un-
mingled.
My metier is not mere cynic mocking,
But can it be your pulses have not tingled
With something more like shame than satis-
faction
At Somebody's performance of a duty
Which was your own! A very noble action!
There's nothing on that side to mar its
beauty.
A citizen's munificence, a modest
And opportunely patriot inspiration!
But its necessity strikes one of the oddest
As coming in a proud and long-pursed
nation.
Provided for P Yes, handsomely, no doubt of it.
But was not that provision your affair,
John?
And if successfully you've wriggled out of it,
Is it enough to toss your cap in air, John,
And shout out, "Bravo — Somebody?"?
You 're blushing ■
I see it, Mr. Bull; it does you credit.
If a sharp word bring forth that manly
flushing,
Punch will be very glad that he has said it.
National Art's a nation's true-born child,
John,
Not to be classed amongst Neglected
Foundlings.
Salisbury's smug announcement made me
wild, John.
Though it might gratify the sordid ground-
lings.
Pertinent thoughts these be for you to ponder.

squander; [Babel,

Not to another's hands to be deputed.
You'll see that, if you shake off faction's
dizziness,
And purblind stinginess, so little suited
To the inheritor of so great treasures.
The man with such a splendid patrimony.
You are a busy bee 1 Well, then take
measures
To find a proper hive for your Art-honey.
You cannot say, with the Apothecary, [ Johk.
Your poverty, but not your will, consents,

Exchequers do not care for Art's intents,
John.
You must be master here, and your volition
Make visible to Treasuries short-sighted.
No, John; I would not chill the exhibition
Of citizen munificence. Delighted.
To see, and to applaud, good deeds uncottrted.
Hope that such instances may not be lonely;
But would you see your fair Art-child sup-
ported

HINTS FOR THE PARK.
If your Hack is in rather Light Condition, it's advisable to use a Breast-plate.
SUBURBAN LOVE-SONG.
The blacks float down with a lazy grace,
Hey, how the twirtle-birds twitter!
And softly settle on hands and face;
And the shards in the rockery glitter.
The boughs are black and the buds are green—
Hey, how the twitter-birds twirtle!
And Cicely over the trellis-screen
Is bleaching her summer kirtle.
The mustard and cress (can they grow'apart—
Those twin-souls, cress and mustard r)
Are springing apace; they have made such a
start
That the pattern is rather fluster'd:
For I made a device in the moist dark mould,
In tho shape of A's and S's,
In capital letters, firm and bold,
I sow'd my mustard and cresses.
And I traced a heart and a true-love knot
In a geometrical pattern,
And it seems to have run to I can't tell what,
For Flora has proved a slattern.
Or the sparrows, whose chirpings at daybreak
shrill,
Like the voice of a riant Cicala,
Of most of the letters nave had their will,
In a vegetarian gala.
Here comes no nymph where the blue waves
lisp
On the white sands' gleaming level,
Where the sharp light strikes on the laurel
orisp,
And flowers in the cool shade revel.
Bat the garden shrubs are as fair to me
As pine and arbutus and myrtle
That grow by the shores of the Grecian sea,
Where deathless nightingales twirtle.
And the little house, with its suites complete,
And the manifold anti-macassar,
And the chalet cage, whenoe he greets the

Are fairer than'aught that the sun is above
In the world as much as I'vo seen of it;
For the little house is the realm of love,
And my sweet little girl is the queen of it.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Figaro Exposition (English Edition
and therefore why not " Exhibition P") ought
to have a valuable collection, judging from the
first part just published. The illustrations
are charming, and there are several cuts of
the Eiffel Tower, the one showing the top-
light being curiously effective. The "Second
Storey " or the Eiffel is, apparently, a very
popular storey, as it is crowded.
The latest number of Messrs. Valeey and
Engel's Our Celebrities, the autobiography of
Professor Huxley being unusually sprightly.
The likeness of Ellen Tebry is as unlike any
other one of her as she herself is unlike any-
body else. I haven't made up my mind to
being pleased with it. However, there she
is between Professor Huxley, who comes first,
and Henry Irving, who is last, but not least,
attending to neither, reading a book, and
apparently ignoring the Heal on one side and
the Ideal on t 'other.
Woman's Suffrage and National Danger,
is a work that should have the attention of
all those who look forward to a House of
Ladies, and long for the time when M.P.'s
in petticoats will rule the Nation. The author
says:—" Since the time of Adam, when manly
wisdom has been put aside to please the weaker
vessel, and the stronger has renounced' his
rights in gentle dalliance with the fair, has
aught but disaster and decline ensued?"
The writer of these words, Mr. Hebeb L.
Hart, is a bold man. If any of the more
strong-minded of the Weaker Vessels come
across him, it would not surprise us to find
across him, it would not surprise us to find'' the
Hart bowed down through weight of woe."
No one, whatever may be his political
opinions, will fail to thoroughly enjoy The
Green above the Bed, by Mr. C. L. Graves.
The author has a singular facility for versi-
fication. The rollicking humour and lilt of
his songs, which was so conspicuous in the
Blarney Ballads, is a special characteristic of
his latest volume. Mr. Graves, while his
arrow is sharp, never forgets the gay feather
that decorates the shaft. The volume con-
tains some admirable piotures by Mr. Linley
Sambourne, who further lends his aid in the
production of a very humorous cover.
A False Scent, hath a pleasant savour.
Mrs. Alexander keeps her secret almost up
to the last page, and thus the interest is well
sustained till the close of the story. What
the secret is, it would be scarcely fair to
divulge. Cleverly and brightly written say
The Baron de Book-Worms & Co.

And in the midst of horror breathe the balm

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
COUNTY-COUNCILDOM.
(From the Note- Book of Mr. Punch'$ Young Man.)
May 7.—"Mister" Rosebert as punctual as usual. The first
business is the acceptance of a design for a seal for the Council.
The one chosen objected to by Mr. Marsland, on the score that the
idea is "too medieval," ana although the Chairman declares that
the central figure in the sketch is supposed to be a working-man of
the nineteenth century, this
explanation does not seem
to remove the " Hon. Coun-
cillor's" scruples. By the
way, all the members are
described as "Hon." which
is (as Hon. and Patriotic
Counsellor Burns might say)
"A out above what they do
in the Vestries." Then a
gentleman who I am told is
called Mr. Ubbard, raised a
short debate upon what he
no donbt correctly describes
as the " alf-penny rate." It
is a most interesting debate,
and would indeed be fault-
less were it not that the rate
has oeased to exist. Upon
learning this the Council re-
luctantly (I say "reluo-
tantly," for one of its mem-
bers — I think it is that
amusing rattle, Lord Hob-
house—insists, in a supple-
mentary speech, upon slay-
ing the slain) turns its
attention to something else.
But what a "something
else!" The Standing Com-
mittee have actually recom-
mended that the Deputy-
Chairman shall receive two
thousand pounds sterling a
year! Every eye is turned
towards Mr. Bottomlet
Firth, whose invariably
florid complexion conceals
his blushes. The Vice-Chair-
man, Sir John Ldhbock,
neatly recommends the re-
commendation suggesting
that his colleague combines
the clerical industry of the
bee with the legal knowledge
of the ant—at least, that is
the impression Sir John's
speech conveys to my mind.
Somebody seconds the reso-
lution, and then comes the
tug of war. The gallant
warrior, whose eloquence,
rightly or wrongly, is often
called "Rotten/' leads the
attack. _ He loves Bottomlet like a
strange in this, as every subsequent speaker scarcely with an excep
tion echoes the sentiment—but he does not want him to have a
salary. There are a number of " Hon. Councillors" of the same
way of thinking. For instance. Alderman Arthur Arnold does
not like the idea at all. The Alderman considers Bottomlet his
oldest friend—if I understood him rightly he laid the foundation of
Mr. Firth's fortune, by introducing him to Beale the Chorus—
what a sweet boon!—but he must not be paid. Then another Alder-
man objects, no less a person than the Ohott of Hamlet't Father
as I mutt call him) the Reverend Fleming "Williams. The Hon.
and Ecclesiastical Councillor looks gayer than he did last week.
He wears a buttonhole, and is altogether more cheerful. And this
reminds me that there are a number of flowers about, inclusive of
a large bunch of white lilies on the Chairman's table, which are
no doubt waiting for the moment when "Mister" Rosebert poses
as a model for the central figure in a church-window. The Ghott of
Hamlet't Father on this occasion, reminds me of another 8hakspearian
character—Shylock in a play called The Merchant of Venice.
And now there is a diversion. That gallant old warrior Colonel
Hughes (who I assume from his military title, must have the art of
war at his fingers' end) compbvos of surprise." Why were not
the Council told three days in advance that this strange matter

was coming on? How did the Standing Committee come to think
of such a olever thing? Such is the brave Colonel's complaint. He
is immediately answered by a lawyer (I can fancy how the tough
old warrior must fume at the notion of a solicitor correcting an
"offioer and a gentleman"), Mr. Habrison, who takes a different
view of the subject. Then Captain Vernet (who is every square-
inch a sailor as Colonel Hughes is every cubic-foot a soldier)
interposes, and wants to know what has been done in the matter of
Counsel's opinion about the proceedings of last week. The Deputy-
Chairman springs forward
and gives the required infor-
mation with a courtesy and
a promptitude that suggests
and pleasantly suggests, "in
this style, two thousand a-
year." But this agreeable
demeanour does not convert
the Naval Representative of
the United Service—he still
objects to a salary attached
to the office. Then we have
a Refreshment contractor,
whose name is not familiar
to me, and whose remarks
are of no great importance,
and then the Patriot Burns
rises to represent the work-
ing-man. The Hon. Coun-
cillor is a member of the
Standing Committee, and
from my own observation, a
friend of the noblest of his
colleagues. He speaks with
a silvery eloquence that wins
all hearts. Every word is
pronounced with exquisite
purity—no dropping of aspi-
rates, no saying "pied " for
"paid," or anything of that
sort. Personally, he thinks
£1,500 a-year enough, and
that Bottomlet should have
no more, and cease to be an
M.P., but he does not insist
on the latter suggestion. He
wants, however, Mr. Firth
to earn his money—on pain
of getting the sack. It would
he difficult to describe the
delightful delicacy with
which these proposals are
made. I can only murmur,
"Exquisite, beautiful, how
refined!" And now the
matter has been debated for
nearly three hours, and we
have got no further. Then
"Mister" Rosebert inter-
poses, as is his wont, and we
have much voting.
In the end, the Deputy-
Chairman is given his £2,000
a-year salary, and from
brother—but there is nothing 1 little anecdote he introduces in returning'thanks, adroitly suggests
that he intends to keep it until he joins the great majority.

OUR SPECIAL MUSICAL CRITIC.
The Great Musical event of the week, has, of course, been" the
production at the Footleton Festival of the much-talked-of Cantata
"Whitsuntide," by Dr. Jacques Stbauss Castle, by whom it was
personally conducted. The hall was crowded
with a highly fashionable, cultivated and
critical audience who were enthusiastic in
- the extreme, and bestowed nattering recep-
tions on the local Lawyer, Medical Man,
Town-clerk, and Postmistress, as each entered
the hall. Subsequently, during one of the
most interesting numbers, the Medical Man
was called out; but we ascertained, on good
authority, that his unexpected summons had
not been previously arranged by him. The
audience rose en masse when the gifted com-
poser appeared, and Dr. Jacques Stbauss
Castle looked more than gratified at the
ovation accorded him. Mr. Bancollides'
poem of Whittuntide is too well-known to
need a detailed description here, but the
opening stanzas, " Our feet are on our native
Heath," was most beautifully set, and effectively rendered by the
choir. The first great success, however, was the trio'', between the
three swains, " Thomas, Richard, and Henry," The chief motif is
commenced by Thomas, and is as follows:—

5=
This is responded to immediately by Richard (tenor), in C :—
Henry then joins them with this quaint phrase in three-four time:
-m-
This number became instantly popular with the audience, and
there was soarcely a man in the cheap parts of the hall who did not
commence whistling the above phrases. The next number was a
masterpiece of scoring. It was the grand chorus of Gay Muleteers,
and we quote the refrain, in the originality of which the gifted com-
poser has surpassed himself:—

think we'd urge them? Yes 1 Yes!! Yes ! 11
We venture to think, however, that the Composer might have
dispensed with the trick of accompanying the final "Yes! Yes!!
Yes!!!" with a banging of sticks at the back of the orchestra.
Tricks of this sort have been introduced before, but the practice,
except in Pantomimes, is not to be commended. The song by
Harriet (first Soprano), "Arm in Arm with Henry," received the
honour of a double encore, and nothing could have been more
idyllic than the description of Thomas, Richard, and Henry, deco-
rating their hats with wreaths. The swains and their sweethearts
are supposed to witness a strolling performance of effigies. The
music that accompanied the performance was marvellously orches-
trated. The theme was in C, and the kettledrum tuned purposely
to B flat. The effect was quite characteristic.
Piccolo.
I chorus was also excellent. The sweethearts and swains
) in couples, the latter holding a musical instrument in
their hands, with 'which they accompany their chant, according to
the custom of the people. Dr. Jacques Strauss Castle, in his
orohestration, has quite caught the spirit of this beautiful, homely,
German instrument.

BRICKS AND MORTARFICATTON.
Receive a note from my Vestry telling me that, in accordance
with the recent " Leaseholds Enfranchisement Act," I can, if I like,
acquire the freehold of my dwelling by "serving a notice on my
Landlord." "What larks! Always wanted to pay my Landlord out,
for his rapacity about those fixtures of his when I entered: also for
his refusal to whitewash and paper various rooms, a refusal which
he coupled with a most ungenerous reference to the terms of my
lease," whereby, it appears, all repairs are thrown on me!
Curious how calmly Landlord has taken my notice about pur-
chasing freehold. Suppose he sees there's no good in protesting.
Price to be settled by Official Arbitrator, on basis of so many years'
rent.
It is settled. Price seems simply enormous. Arbitrator had to 50
by rent, and rent absurdly high. Landlord seems to have told Arbi-
trator that "he couldn't find a better built 'ouse, not if he searched
all Lunnon over," and Arbitrator—who must be a simpleton—actually
believed him!
Result. I am a freeholder. Proud position—only, in order to
raise money, have robbed myself of all the capital I possessed, and
had to execute a mortgage as well. Try to realise how much better
it is for my self-respect to be owner than merely tenant. Try to
feel that I ve really and truly a home now, out of which nobody
(Query — except mortgagee ?) can turn me. Don't experience as
much satisfaction out of these reflections as I ought to.
Day after sale, Landlord calls. Ostensible object, to "see how
I'm getting on." Real one is to tell me—as he does, chuck 1 in?—
what a splendid bargain he has made. Says " he always did want
to get this 'ere 'ouse off his hands," and now "Parliament's done it
for him." Points out to me with fiendish glee all the defects of the
building of which I am now the happy possessor. Warns me not to
press too heavily against wall of study, or "it may come down with
a run." Adds, that whole house is a "shocking bad 'un."
I am surprised at Landlord's cool admission. Ask him if he doesn't
feel ashamed at having built such a place. "He didn't build it," he
replies. Then isn't he ashamed at having got me to buy it ?" Not
a bit," he says, cheerfully; I seemed very anxious to get freehold,
and as he was anxious to part with it, why should he disappoint me r
Why,' indeed?
Find, after a month or two, that house is really showing signs of
giving way. Patch it up (at considerable expense), and then try to
let it. Find myself describing it (just as my old Landlord used to do)
as " this desirable and commodious residence." Feel that this is a
fib, and that my self-respect is distinctly lowered by it.
Result of Leaseholds Act, as far as I am concerned, simply is that
I am turned from the swindles into the swindler. (Query—Isn't all
morality a matter of the circumstances one happens to be in ?) Land-
lord seems to be flourishing—probably with money I was fool enough
to pay him for this house. When I meet him in the street, he remarks,
iooularly, that "my taking that lease off his hands was a happy re-
lease to him!" Find myself weakly asking him for his advice as to
beBt mode of letting the house. To think that I should ever have
come to this! Feel that, if mortgagee were to foreclose to-morrow,
and turn me out of my freehold, I should be really grateful to him.

the best Board-sohool for them. You are quite right, Gentlemen, in saying
that the objections to such employment are brought by a number of prejudiced,
narrow-minded, well-intentioned persons, who know little or nothing about the
matter, and do not take the trouble to learn the facts. Why couldn't the Not-
at-Home Secretary have been " At-Home" on this occasion, of which he must
surely have had due notice?

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Mark Twain's Scrap Book, issued by Walker & Co., is worth more than
its price if only for Mark Twain's recommendation of it. He invented it, he
says, to lessen the profanity of his unhappy country, as every possessor of a
scrap-book was accustomed to swear horribly, like our army in Flanders, when-
ever he or she couldn't find the paste, or soissors, or gum. Here no gum or paste
is required, so that even " by gum! is unnecessary. It doesn't obviate the use
of scissors, though, nor of some method of damping, with an accent on the first
syllable, as Arthur Roberts would say when he found he couldn't fix the
scraps; and so, ooupled with the publisher's name, there is a good deal of
Walker about it. A varied volume is that by Mr. F. A. Knight, entitled By
Leafy Ways. The writer, who is a student in the school of the late Richard
Jefferies, here collects two dozen or more papers which first appeared in the
Daily News. We cannot but feel grateful to him for having resoued them and
riving them a more permanent position than they could attain in the columns of
a popular newspaper. It is oleverly illustrated by Mr. E. T. Compton.

No. IV.—The Idyllic.
The following example will not be found above the
heads of an average audience, while it is constructed to
suit the capacities of almost any lady artiste.
SO SHY!
The singer should, if possible, be of mature age, and
incline to a comfortable embonpoint. As soon as the
bell has given the signal for the orchestra to attack
the prelude, she will step upon the stage with that
air of being hung on wires, which seems to come from
a consciousness of being a favourite of the public.
I'm a dynety little Dysy of the Dingle,
[Self-praise is a great recommendation—in Music-
Mall songs.
So retiring and so timid and so coy.
If you ask me why so long I have lived single,
I will tell you—'tis because I am so shoy.
[Note the skill with which the rhyme is adapted to
meet Arcadian peculiarities of pronunciation.
Spoken—Yes, I am—really, though you wouldn't think
it to look at me, would you r But, for all that,—
Chorus—When I'm spoken to, I wriggle,
Going off into a giggle,
And as red as any peony I blush;
Then turn paler than a lily,
For I'm such a little silly,
That I'm always in a flutter or a flush!
[After each chorus an elaborate step-dance, expressive
of shrinking maidenly modesty.
I've a cottage far away from other houses,
Which the nybours hardly ever come anoigh;
When they do, I run and hoide among the rouses,
For I cannot cure myself of being shoy.
Spoken—A great girl like me, too I But there, it's no
use trying, for—
Chorus—When I'm spoken to, I wriggle, &c.
Well, the other day I felt my fice was crimson,
Though I stood and fixed my gyze upon the skoy,
For at the gyte was sorcy Chorley Simpson,
And the sight of him's enough to turn me shoy.
Spoken—It's singular, but Chorley always has that
effect on me.
Chorus—When he speaks to me, I wriggle, &c.
Then said Chorley: "My pursuit there's no evyding.
Now I've caught you, I insist on a reploy.
Do you love me? Tell me truly, little myding!"
But how is a girl to answer when she's shoy?
Spoken—Tot even if the conversation happens to be
about nothing particular, it's just the same to me.
Chorus—When I'm spoken to, I wriggle, &c.
There we stood among the loilac and syringas,
More sweet than any Ess. Bouquet you boy:
[Arcadian for " buy."
And Chorley kept on squeezing of my fingers,
And I couldn't tell him not to, being shoy.
Spoken—For, as I told you before,—
Chorus— When I'm spoken to, I wriggle, &c.
Soon my slender wyste he ventured on embrycing,
While I only heaved a gentle little soy;
Though a scream I would have liked to rise my vice in,
It's so diffioult^to scream when you are shoy!
Spoken—People have such different ways of listening
to proposals. As for me,—
Chorus—When they talk of love, I wriggle, &c.
So very soon to Church we shall be gowing.
While the bells ring out a merry peal of jy.
If obedience you do not hear me vowing,
It will only be because I am so shy.
[ We have brought the rhyme off legitimately at last,
it will be observed.
Spoken—Yes, and when I'm passing down the oil,
on Chorley's arm, with everybody looking at me,—
Chorus—I am certain I shall wriggle,
And go off into a giggle,
Ana as red as any peony I '11 blush.
Going through the marriage service
Will be sure to mike me nervous,
[Note the freedom o f the rhyme.
And to put me in a flutter and a flush!

THE OFFER OF THE OLIVE-BRANCH.

"My suggestion that recourse should be had to
arbitration, as a means of settling the questions
now in dispute between landlords and tenants on
a number of estates in Ireland. I hare, I must say,
almost abandoned hope of my suggestion being
adopted by the landlords and their advisers. My
effort in the cause of peace has been strongly
sustained by those newspapers—such, for instance,
as the Freeman's Journal and United Ireland—
which are universally recognised as exponents and
advocates of the tenants' claims."—Archbithop
Walth'e Letter to " The Times."
Is it a time when aught should bid to cease
One honest effort in the cause of Peaoe f
Is it an hour when journalistic scorn,
Or Party anger should make more forlorn
The fainting hope of the peacemaker P Nay!
Dissension here nas had too long a day;
Hate's hideous harvest only never fails.
The scribe who sneers, the partizan who rails,
Help that, not Law and Oraer—the glib cry
Of pedants sour who mock at amity.
Who knows the history? Who will stoop to
learn?
Let shallow spouters sedulously turn
The leaves of Ireland's story, and shake off
That fatal readiness to rage and scoff
At acts ungauged, and men misunderstood,
Which checks the growth of all the seeds of
good.
Between long raging foes, both hot and blind,
Whom law iniquitous and chance unkind
Conjoined, have alienated, seems to stand,
With friendly mien, and olive-branch in
hand,
A messenger of peace. Is it not time
That stern constraint and fiercely furtive
crime,
So long resultlessly opposed should cease
To have the field between them? "It it
peace?"
Suspicion cries, "or some new shape of guile
Intent to plague this faotion-harried Isle?"
So sneers the squint-eyed spirit whioh in-
spires
Our rival thoughts and fans our mutual ires.
Is here no opening, if not quite for trust
Entire, for patient trial? Ah! be just

COUNTY-COUNCILDOM.
{From the Note-Book of Mr. Punch's Young Man.)
May 14.—The " Mister of Rosebebt " (this
is an adaptation of a Scotch title to metropo-
litan requirements) is in the chair, and ready
to begin (with the assistance of Sir John Lub-
bock and the gentleman who has accepted
"hundreds," after obtaining thousands) at
the stroke of three. There is a pretty full
attendance. A good start is made with the
Agenda until the composition of " the Parks'
Committee " is reached. "How shall the new
members be elected?" The Mister of Rose-
bebt lets it be understood that he doesn't
mind "how," so long as subsequently he hears
no more about it. It" standing of course
for composition, and not committee. No doubt
the Mister is afraid of some one again sug-
gesting that he should superintend the sale of
nuts, oranges, and ginger-beer. An hour or
so is then spent in pleasant, if not very in-
structive chatter, and then lists are ordered
to be made out, and handed in. When they
are collected, a little later, the papers of
Councillor Fobster, Barrister Tore, and last,
but not least, Great Military Commander
Howard Vincent, are found to be imperfect.
The Mister of Rosebebt quite chuckles over
the fact that three such highly distinguished
and intellectual persons should be guilty of
an informality.
Then comes the report of the Finance Com-
mittee; and it is a relief to some of us to
find that its highly respected chairman, Lord
Lino en, is seemingly entirely unconnected
with the recent proceedings in connection
with the Park Club. As I gaze at him, port-
folio in hand, murmuring soft somethings
about figures, I feel certain that he shuns
baccarat as the plague. His explanation
(whatever it is) seemingly satisfies every one,
save that unbloated aristocrat Earl Compton,
who, not hearing every word of the fiery
eloquence of the noble Lord, occasionally
ejaculates " Speak up!"
The customary orators by this time are
well to the fore. The Refreshment Con-
tractor from the Law Courts expands in his
usual fashion, and then takes some interest
in a speech from Mr. Bassett Hopkins,
possibly because it contains reference to " the
Legislature," which latter word, as pro-
nounced, sounds as if it were an entremet in
the menu of a City dinner. Alderman The
Ohott of Hamlet's Father (as I really must
call him) opposes the retention of an open
space (so I understand him) because it may
be utilise (1 to enlarge a chapel. This brings
up a gentleman in a red tie (his face seems
familiar to me, but I cannot say where 1
have seen him before), who expresses his
wish to support the reverend Councillor in
carrying out so admirable an object. Mr.
Augustus Harris, however, prefers open air
to chapel-going in the locality in question
(a very squalid one), and says so.
Then we have a long discussion about engi-
neers and doctors. It appears that we have
to appoint a chief engineer, and we are greatly
exercised ii our minds as to whether the
coming ofiieial shall be allowed (when chosen)
to take pupils. This matter is discussed with
much earnestness, provoking loud cries of

WHAT OUR ARTIST (THE AWFULLY FUNNY ONE) HAS TO PUT UP WITH.
Brotcn. "I sat—look here! What the deuce do tou mean bt Caricaturing my
Picture—hat?" Jones. "Yes—confound tou I—and not Caricatvrisq Km!"
"Hear, hear!" from a part of the Council, and "'ear, 'ear!" from the remainder. On the
whole, I fancy the "hear, hears" are in the majority. As £1500 is the sum proposed as
salary, I am not surprised to find the silvery-tongued Burns suggesting a reduction oi
£500. It is always a pleasure to listen to the agreeable voice of this patriot, even when
he has nothing particular to say as on the present occasion. Next we choose a Medical
0 llicer of Health, and note, en passant that Mr. Clarke (who is a real live Common Coun-
cilman of the City of London) is " guided by the personal appearance of a man as mud
as by anything else," a remark causing the reflection that he must be delighted when he
gazes into a looking-glass. And after our doctor is chosen (after three attempts) we com«
perhaps to the most exciting incident in the afternoon's entertainment.
During the sitting Miss Alderspinster Cons and Miss Cobden have been holding quite
a little court at which, amongst others, Alderman The Ghost of Hamlet's Father has been
(so I have noticed) in constant attendance. I find that we are now called upon to considei
Mr. Fleming Williams' motion for a deputation to the President of the Local Government
Board to urge upon the attention of that Right Hon. and greatly favoured Gentleman
the thirst that the London County Council undoubtedly have for the charms of femali
society. Miss Cobden, convulses us with laughter, as she asks whether the Chairman
Vice-Chairman, or Deputy-Chairman would undertake the arduous duties of visitinf
twenty-three baby-farms, rice Lady Sandhubst disqualified? Some of us (I think thi
"'ear, 'ears") would like to add this pleasant little exercise to the daily routine of tin
self-sacrificing (but £2000 a-year-receiving) Bottomlet, but no one ventures to make th<
proposal. Then, after a forcible but courteous protest from a man of mark, or rathe:
marks, the ladies carry the day by a majority of 26, and we go home after four hour
of hard talking (and harder listening) with what appetite we may, to dinner.
And now, having sulliciently "sampled" the proceedings of the L
Council, I close my note-book—for the present.

At leap-frog, which might

Wigged W-bst-b's more than
Cancellarian dignity.

Of him, the something slow but

Where Justice underneath a neap
Of jarring questions lies.
And cannot heave her head.
We Three feel well-nigh dead.
Cold cynic questions, and quick hot replies
From R-d and R-ss-ll leap,
And scarce our power obey.
From harmony, from party-harmony,
This lengthy little game began,
From 8-l-sb-bt's and G-sch-n's harmony,
And that of those Dissentients who ran
First from the follies of the Grand Old Man.
What passion cannot Eloquence raise and
quell?
When R-ss-ll perorated well,
His listening '' brothers" sat around,
And wonder on their faces fell
Whilst hanging on the silvery sound.
Less than an Oracle there scarce could dwell
In guise of that snuff-taking, legal swell,
Who spake so sweetly and so well.
What passion cannot Eloquence raise and
quell P
But Counsel's harsh clangor
Less certainly charms,
With shrill notes of anger,
And pride up in arms,
The double, double, double beat
Of the hammering fist.
Wake tired ill-temper 'tis hard to resist
When nailed many hours to our seat.
P-oo-tt led W-bst-b a wild-goose chase,
And nigh the Thunderer lost its place
Sequacious of that liar;
But lingering weeks of squabbling sadly tire,
Oh, why to Law was wind so lengthy given,
Making our triune judgment-seat appear—
Well—certainly not heaven?
Grand Chorus.
Therefore We Three thankfully praise
The clock-hands as they move,
And for the hour of Four we raise
Our hands in thanks above.
Oh, dearest, most desired hour!
Thou bald-head who dost all devour,
Grateful we are when thou dost knock
Upon our tympanums with pleasant shock,
And bring us once again thrice welcome Four
o'clock!
MOST APPROPRIATE.
Nothing more natural than that the Lyric
Club should branch out into the Lyric Cricket
Club, a difficult combination of words to

amusements at the Lyric commence about
midnight, and finish about 3 A.it., when the
hours are "small and early," during- which
time the [Lyrical Members are as lively as
Crickets chirruping on the hearth. It was
therefore almost unnecessary to add'' Cricket"
to " Lyric," but why not drop " Lyric" alto-
gether? Let the Lyric Theatre enjoy the
title all to itself, and let the Lyric Members
call themselves The Cricket Club.' Happy

Mr. Punch is glad to see that, in the Daily Telegraph, " E.L." has
once more opened up the old subject of Park Improvement. Mr.
Punch has been harping on much the same string year after year.
Why not kiosques for light refresh-
ment? No necessity for Mr. Plunket,
or George Ranger, or Mr. Rosebery,
if the L. C. C. has got anything to do
with it, to personally superintend the
sale of apples, oranges, ginger-beer,
cakes ana ices. Why not a superior
restaurant for cold lunches? We don't
want to take the trees and shrubs from
the Bois de Boulogne, having got some
very fine ones of our own, but we
might take a few leaves out of the
French book. And, beyond this, why
not consider Equestrians as/well as Pe-
destrians, and give a ride across the
Park, and another through the beau-
tiful shady avenues of Kensington
Gardens? Was there ever such a
monotonous squirrel-in-the-cage arrangement as "Rotten Row" and
its contributories now? And what is there for Equestrians in Re-
gent's Park? A wretched strip not worth mentioning. As to the
ride"—Heaven save the mark!—in Birdcage Walk,—a "ride" in
a " Walk" maybe considered a concession,—instead of being a delight-

ful avenue for a canter, it is occupied by loafing roughs, small chil-
dren, and mischievous gamins de Lonares, who make riding dan-
gerous to man, beast, and child. Are there no park-keepers or police
to keep this place in order, and prevent its being a lounge for
obstructive loafers and a playground for little imps who are a terror
to those who (do or don't) ride well.
Mr. Punch addresses himself respectfully to " Mr." Rosebert (if

PIECES WITH HONOURS.
Thb funniest thing in the Opera of Paul Jones is the back view of
Mr. Ashley, whose cloak might be utilised for advertising purposes.
The music is pleasant, but, at a first visit, not striking; yet this fact
may account for its great success, and for the big houses it attracts,
as every one not oaring much
for it on once hearing it, but
favourably impressed by the
acting and the brilliant
mise-en-scene, would deoide
to go and hear it again.
Once an air "catches on,"
the fortune of an Opera is
made. I should say that
Paul Jones's fortune has
been ohietly made by Miss
Huntingdon, who is a most
refined and unoonventional
representative of the usual

hardest to keep the game alive, and in the Third Act the indefatigable
exertions of the undefeated Mr. Frank Wtatt are generously
rewarded by an appreciative public. Mr. Stanislaus, whose name
recalls the time wnen "The Fair Land of Poland," &c, wields the
baton with as much vigour as if he were thrashing a Russian
oppressor of his country, instead of only beating time. To Miss
Wadman, the Great-grand Nephew of Uncle Toby sends his respectful
compliments, and thanks her for her singing, but wishes she would
not sing in her speaking, and
give us a little more acting.
"Phyllis (Broughton) is
my only joy," of course, and
I never saw her throw so
much spirit into a part. As
Chopinette, she snowed the
unfortunate Bouillabaisse
what she could do with a
husband if she once caught k
him. There are no great *
dramatic situations in Paul
Jones, but some good ef-
fects. M. PLANQUETTE'sZeS
Cloches is still without a
rival, and Paul Jones is
miles behind Rip Van
Winkle. How good Leslie
was in that, and how little
he has ever done since, ex-
cept to Arthur-Robertise
himself.
Mr. J. L. Toole, of the
Tooleries, is a clever advertiser.
Solice up to making their sudden swoop on "the Spooferies" in
[aiden Lane and the Park Club farther West, so that their raid
should be just in the nick of time (doors open at 7'30—"8 is the
'nick'") for displaying his hand of Artful Cards. Very artful.
In this his trump is a trombone, and the honours, in which all share,
are easy; but for especial commendation I must mention Miss Kate
Phillips, who makes quite a character of the sham Countess,
Madame Asteriski. Jack-tn-the-Box.

ship's carpenters, known to the uninitiated as "scene-shifters," be
wanting, Earl De Grey says he will not feel himself degreyded by
tucking up his shirt-sleeves and nailing the colours to the mast.
"This by his voice should be 0. Montagu," as Shakspeare ob-
serves, and here he is willing to "give a hand," as requested by
Capulet, in Romeo and Juliet. Sharp chap, Shakspeare. Henry
Chaplin, M.P., is at the Box Office ready to give two and fivepence
halfpenny and three-eighths of a farthing in change for half-a-
crown, just to show the gain which will accrue to the management
of Covent Garden by adopting bimetallism. H. V. Higglns explains
to the three Princesses in the royal box the thrilling story of / Pes-
catori di Perle. Hidalgo De Murietta expresses his willingness to
assume a picturesque costume and go on as a brigand if required,
while Mr. Oppenhetm hums Signor D'Andrade's music, and holds
himself in readiness to take his place in case of any contretemps.
The National Anthem, by the majority of the Company, brings us all
to attention, and reminds us of the first night of the Drury Lane
Pantomime. After this, the curtain rises on the Act the First of
I Pescatori di Perle, composed by the Busy Bizet. Druriolanus,
as the Pecheur-en-chef de Perles, has been fishing with success. Miss
Ella Russell, Miss Mactntyre, Madame Scalchi, and Marie
Roze being the net result. What has become of that pretty Norwe-
gian Arnoldsen, who sang Zerlina so charmingly at Drury Lane?
The pearls worn by Ella Russell, who was perpetually being
veiled and unveiled like a statue, were thrown before this distin-
guished and appreciative audience. Miss Ella looked and sang
splendidly. Signor D'Andrade—an Irishman Italianised, of course,
his real name Deing evidently Misther Dan Drardy—did his very
best. Signor Talazac filled a considerable portion of the stage, but
I doubt whether his voice reached to the uttermost parts of the
house. The chorus, and the orchestra personally conducted by
Signor Mancinelli, were perfect; so was the mise-en-scene. The
last scene delighted all the cremationists present, and showed Jhow
very easy it is "to make a pile" on the Operatic stage. A misprint
in tie book of the words gave Dan Dbardy's character to Talazac,
and vice versa, which was rather hard on both of them. The First
Act is the best, and the duet with which it closes scored the success
of the evening.
Lucky Ftrth! To get £2000 a-year from the L. C. C! If he
also accepts the Chiltem Hundreds, will he give them to a oharity?

in the back, and with weepy eyes;
Nobody loves him, and none will nuss him;
all hates a hinfant as flops and cries.
Bother that blessed old Mother Purteotion!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE STAGGERED STIPENDIARY.
A Police-Court Cantata—Written up to Date.
The Scene represent! the
interior of a Metropolitan
Police Court towards three
o'clock in the afternoon.
A miscellaneous crowd of
Witnesses in adjourned
cases, Reporters, Police-
men, Attorneys, Officials
of the Court, and the
general Public, who have
been waiting the arrival
of the Magistrate, who has
not yet come, from ten
o'clock in the morning dis-
covered in the last stages
of irritable impatience.
As the Curtain rises, they join in the following
general Chorus:—
General Chohus.
Heavens I It is exasperating
Thus to witness Justice scorning
Publio comfort! We've been waiting
Quite from ten o'clock this morning.
Now on three it's pretty near,—
Yet his Worship is not nere!
Witnesses.
Yesterday our case adjourning,
To attend at ten he told us;
Now at ten to-day returning,
We discover he has sold us.
Officials of the Court.
Yes! and possibly to-morrow
Of your case there '11 be no clearance;
For, we state the fact with sorrow,
He mayn't put in appearance!
Attorneys.
Yet are we our clients fleecing
Through extended litigations,
And our modest costs increasing
Much against our inclinations.
Policeman.
And the burglar we had brought here.
Having tracked him out and traced him!
Sinoe the Beak, he ain't in Court here,
It's a pity as we chased him!
General Chohus.
It's a pity! Yes, and shame, too.
That the public thus should suffer,
If our Beak we gave the name to
We should christen him a " Duffer!"
But Ha 1 'tis on the stroke of three.
[The door at the back of the Bench opens,
and discloses The Magistrate.
And lo! he comes. It is! 'Tis he!
[The Magistrate enters pale and trembling,
and staggers in the direction of his official
chair. All manifest great concern.
What's come to him? Ah! who can tell
The Magistrate [smiling feebly).
I think, my friends, I am not well. [Faints.
[The Chief Clerk and a Chance Medical Man
rush on to the Bench to his assistance.
Chance Medical Man (feeling his pulse).
The cause of this collapse is plain:—
A patent case of over-strain I
Has anybody got some brandy P
The Chief Clerk (producing his flask).
I always have a little handy.
He's been so much like this of late.
[They administer some to him and he gra-
dually recovers.
The Magistrate (cantabile).
Where am I?
General Chohus (con brio).
Here, at any rate!
And p'raps you '11 confidence restore
And say why you've not come before!
The Magistrate.
Ah! you for explanations call.
"Before "? Ask why I've come at all!
Would'st hear the tale of horror I could tell?
General Chorus.
We would! your tale of horror likes us well.
The Magistrate.
Ballad.
Now when first I accepted this post
I considered myself very lucky,
And I think, and I don't want to boast,
When I tackled my work I felt pluoky.
But when five of my colleagues fell ill,
And their work fell to me and one other.
We but feared, when their place we would fill.
That the task would our faculties smother!
And our fear has proved right, for however
you strive,
You can't get out of two the hard work
meant for five!
Take to-day. I've not had any rest,
And have flown without halting or stopping
With a feeling of infinite zest
Straight from Southwark to Greenwich and
Wapping.
And though, here at Wandsworth I wait,
And to you for a moment am speaking,
I perceive, as it's now getting late,
I must shortly be Hammersmith seeking.
But it all proves no-use, for however you
strive, [meant for five!
You'll not get out of two the hard work
(He rises) and now I think, I must depart.
General Chorus (rushing forward).
Our patience surely this has earned :—
And you will hear us ere you start?
[The Magistrate totters feebly towards the
door, and whispers to the Chief Clerk.
The Chief Clerk (confidentially addressing
the Court).
He cannot stay! You 're all adjourned.'
[The announcement is received with conster
nation, on hearing it all rush forward
and join in the following finale :—
General Chorus (finale).
Thus, again our case adjourning,
Justice into jest he's turning!
Yet he's helpless if he strive!
For'tis proved beyond negation,—
Though some pence it saves the nation,
Two can't do the work of five!
[At the close of the Chorus the back of the
Court opens and reveals the Home Secre-
tary discovered slyly winking at the
scene, while the Magistrate retires feebly
from the Bench, and is assisted by two
Constables and the Chief Clerk to a four-
wheeled cab, in which he starts for Hat
mersmith, with a sickly smile, as the
Curtain descends.

'ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Sporting Disappointments. — It was cer-
tainly most annoying to find, that after having
lately invited five London friends to your
"box" in the Highlands for the purpose of
giving them a "fortnight's deer-Btalking,"
there was only one stag in the neighbourhood,
old and lame, and Dlind of one eye, ana
so tame that it hobbles up even to strangers,
who call it" Jock," to which name it answers,
and feed it from their hands with cakes ana
buns. It is no good trying to " stalk" this
poor old creature, who probably is the pet of
the whole neighbourhood, and would not un-
derstand being shot at in the least, though
you might possibly scare him into a run with
a dynamite cartridge or two. Your idea of
meeting the difficulty in future, by hiring a
South American bison from the Wild Beast
Emporium in the Commercial Road, as a sort
of pis alter, is not a bad one, but you must
be careful .when the creature is once let loose
from your premises that it does not catch sight
of the railway omnibus horses, for should it
happen to, it would be sure to go for them at
once. With regard to the chances of your
taking a fish in your salmon-run, we should
think that, seeing the ohemical works you
mention have turned it sixteen miles both
ways to a bright orange colour, and given it
the consistency of starch, they would certainly
be remote, and we would advise you to recom-
mend your friends not to bring any tackle.
Judging that your opportunities of giving
them any sport whatever are, under the cir-
cumstances, likely to be limited, would it
not be as well to avoid having them down at
all, if you could by any means manage it?
Think this out.
AN UNAPPRECIATED GENIUS.
I'm seen at every Private View,
No Matine'e's complete without me,
And people whom I never knew
Talk quite familiarly about me.
With every post the cards pour in,
At every crush my face is seen,
A show-face on a show-body;
And eager paragraphs appear
About my movements all the year,
And yet I'm really Nobody.
The madman of the master's pen
Exulted in his hidden madness;
The homage of my fellow-men
Kindles my soul to kindred gladness.
For Rank, with unexpressive eye,
And vapid Fashion, collar'd high,
And Beauty, in her low body,
Pay ever-growing court to one
Wno stands at gaze to watch the fun,
And knows that he is Nobody.
Oh. were I but an actor-wight,
Or minnesinger sentimental,
Or artist in a threadbare plight,
Or ranter burdened by his rental!
The social favours of my lot
Might make a heart of ice wax hot,
A snow-man's in a snow-body;
But I—I simply go my way,
No fame to reap, no bills to pay,
An independent Nobody.
Mysterious Fate! 1 'm "taken up."
Not even such a lot desiring;
I dine, I dance, I flirt, I sup,
Vires eundo still acquiring.
I know that Fashion's mystic laws
Would frank with equal lack of cause
A rag-doll with a tow body;
Yet, 'mid the "set's " exclusive joys,
The thought my honesty annoys,
That, after all, I'm Nobody! (

OUR ACITANT-CENERAL'S DIARY.
Asked down to Oxbridge, to give
lecture on " Military Power of Eng-
land." Gratifying to find this interest
in Army among University Dons.
Shouldn't have thought it of them.
Not quite their line—to know much
about my " Line"! Master of Belial
(curious title) has invited me, and I
know he's a tremendous Liberal.
Never mind, must have a slap at
Gladstone. Can't help it, though
certainly rather difficult to work it
into a military paper. Well received.
Splendid old port in Common Room.
Should like to bring in something
about "old port" into leoture, but
difficult in military subject.
Arrive at Sheldonian Theatre (why
theatre? Don't like name: nothing
theatrical about me) and find room
crammed with Crammers, Tutors,
Heads of Colleges, Proctors, Bull-
Dogs, Professors, Dons and Under-
graduates. Also women and citizens.
My appearance (in full regimentals,
which I've put on to overawe the
Professors) seems to create some sur-
prise. An officious Proctor hopes
my sword clanking over pavement
"won't injure the encaustic tiling."
At a certain point in my discourse,
create fresh sensation by "offering
my sword to my country." Country
doesn't seem to want it just now, as
nobody responds. Master of Belial
edges his chair away from me nerv-
ously. Offer it instead to Viee-
Chancellor, a quiet old gentleman
who seems afraid of it. Asks me
lotto voce to "put that nasty thing
in the sheath." Shall I resent this
as insult to Army, and run Vice-
Chanoellor through the body? Might
do so if 1 were quite sure my sword
wasn't of the patent pliable corkscrew
pattern, and that I could run it
through anything.
Tell audience that "I know more
of war than anybody else in England."
Don't add (as I might) that I know
more about everything than anybody
else in England, inoluding history,
sociology, law, and politics. Under-

graduate' a long way off shouts,
"Bunkum!" Fix him with my eye.
Undergraduate stares back. Fortu-
nately a Bull-Dog catches sight of
him, and seeing that he is out at
night without cap and gown, makes
for him. Undergraduate leaves
hurriedly. Wish I could get some-
thing in about "the old port."
Now is my opportunity to give it
'em hot about Home-Rule! Nothing
on earth to do with my subject—but
here goes! Audience (among whom
are a good sprinkling of sturdy Glad-
stone an s) seem surprised. What a
lark! Can't, in politeness, go out till
I've finished, and they shift about on
their seats uneasily, looking warm.
Master of Belial pretends to have
gone to sleep. Vice- Chancellor really
has gone to sleep! End up with
rattling peroration about Empire,
and sit down amid cordial cheers.
Audience seems relieved that it's over.
Regret not finding opportunity for
jocose allusion to the old port."
Go back to College with Master of
Belial. Curious personage. I ask
him how he thinks the lecture has
gone; and he replies that the weather
at Oxbridge has been rather rainy this
Term. Is this the result of knowing
too much Greek? Possibly my mili-
tary remarks really Greek to him;
but then, as he's Regius Professor of
Language, that ought not to prevent
his understanding them. And why
did he ask the Military Authority
down if he didn't want enlightenment?
Not treated so well when in Col-
lege as I was before. No old port 1
Is this because I didn't mention it in
leoture? Master asks me, "as a
personal favour," to leave my sword
in umbrella-stand, and to take off my
spurs, as they "may catch in his
carpets." When I begin to talk
about politics, Master (Query—de-
ranged ?) goes off on to Soldiers' drill.
Suoh bad taste. Wish he'd stick to
his own subjects—as I always do!
Though I wish I hadn't on this occa-
sion, and then I could have lugged
in a naval joke about "the old
port."

and we have nothing to conceal from the House, wishing, indeed
being desirous, to give all the information in our power), I would
like to put a question to the Right Hon. Gentleman himself, whose
authority on these matters the House and the Country gladly acknow-
ledge. Does he know why a lump of sugar left at the "bottom of
the cup is so long in melting? The Right Hon. Gentleman shakes
his head. Then, Mr. Speaker, I will tell him, believing as I do
that there should always be a condition of perfect confidence be-
tween the House and Members on
whichever side they sit. A lump of
sugar left in the bottom of the cup
prolongs the process of melting because,
as it melts, it makes the tea around it
heavier; and, so long as it remains at
the bottom, is surrounded by tea fully
saturated with sugar, in consequence
of whioh the same portions of liquid
will hold no more sugar in solution.
That, Sir, is my answer to the Right
Hon. Gentleman. I trust it will be
satisfactory to him and to his friends,
the Government having no other desire
than to do their duty to the House, and,
I may add, to the Country."

at Habcoubt; Habcoubt folded'his arms and looked meditatively at
the toe of his boot; Speaker about to call on Orders, when Grand
Old Man, bursting, as it were, through trance, pointed out that Old
Morality had not directly answered the question.
"The Right Hon. Gentleman," said Old Morality, nodding
pleasantly at him across the table, " is a little exigeant. My remarks
are in the recollection of the House. If there is any other informa-
tion desired I shall be happy to give it. Being on my legs I may
perhaps explain how it is that a piece of sugar held in a spoon at the
top of our tea melts very rapidly. It comes about (so I have been
advised) in the following way:—As the tea becomes sweetened it
desoends to the bottom of the cup by its own gravity, and fresh por-
tions of unsweetened tea are brought constantly into contact with
the sugar till the lump is entirely dissolved. I think I have now
stated everything in connection with this interesting question that
gentlemen seated in any part of the House can desire. If there is
anything more that I could say on the subject I would do it, my only
object, and that of my friends, being to keep the House fully informed
as far as is compatible with our publio duty."
"But the Sugar Bounty Bill?" Grand Old Man gasped. "You
haven't mentioned it. Are we definitely to understand that the
Government aregoing on with the Bill?"
"The Right Hon. Gentleman," said 0. M., with a slight approach
to a frown, "is definitely to understand that which I have stated to
the House."
Loud cheers from Ministerialists, amid which G. 0. M. subsided,
and Old Morality triumphantly brought in Bill to establish Board
of Agriculture for Great Britain.
Business done.—Budget Bill read a Seoond Time. Naval Defence
Bill through Committee. Old Morality triumphant all along the
line.
Tuesday.—At Evening Sitting, Dlllwyn moved Resolution for
Disestablishment of Church in Wales. House resuming at Nine,
Debate must close at One in the morning. Of four hours allotted
for whole debate, Byron Reed, a Yorkshire Member, moving the
rejection of Motion, occupied over one fourth part.
"Always the Bame with Wales," said Osborne Morgan, bitterly.
"When the island was parcelled out, we were shoved into a corner,
to begin with: been there ever since."
Reed's stupendous Lecture (reserved seats one shilling, galleries
free, programmes one pejiny each), rather
cast damper over proceedings. Welsh Mem-
bers in despair; popping up all round, trying
to catch Speaker s eye. Abraham, of
the manly chest, naturally succeeded;
gave fillip to proceedings by dropping
into Welsh; on the platform is accus-
tomed to vary oratorical attractions by a
song; generally introduces, by way of per-
oration, a stave of "March of the Men of
Harlech," " the Welsh Doxology," as Wil-
frid Lawson calls it. Clearing his throat
to-night for a song, when observed Speaker's
eye sternly fixed upon him. In hurry of
moment, lapsed into Welsh. Was replying
to Reed s statement that year by year the
Church in Wales was waxing, and Noncon-
formity waning.
"Machynlleth!" he exclaimed, "caer-
neddan dolhcyddellan"
"Order; Order!" oried the Speaker,
evidently under apprehension that Hon.
Member was using unparliamentary lan-
guage. But Abraham's Welsh blood up.
"Llanymynech.'" he shouted, at the top
of his voice, '' diganwy nantfrankon cedom
dolbadarn castell-gyfarch, cricc"
Never saw the Speaker so angry.

ABraham 1Vel3h\ocalist. 8aidi mterrupting, in his sternest tones,
"and'if he persists in this line of conduct, I shall have no option in
the course I shall be obliged to take."
Friends, gathering round Abraham, pulled him down by coat-
tails. Raikes, with great presence of mind, interposed, commenced
his speech, and what might have been awkward scene came to abrupt
conclusion.
Business done.—Dillwyn's Motion rejected by 284 against 231.
Thursday.—Sage of Queen Ann's Gate brought Oub Only
General up to Bar. The Only One has been speaking disrespect-
fully of Liberal Leaders. Particularly hints that in order to go
back to Downing Street they would assist at dismemberment of
British Empire. Sage, who abhors strong language, thinks that
foing little too far. Drags Oub Only in by collar before Head
taster Stanhope. Head Master Stanhope as severe as he dares.
Says he is not able to defend indisoretion. Only One, digging

knuokles into right eye, and secretly winking left at Colonels below
Gangway, whimpers apology.
"I wish," he said, ' to withdraw anything I ever said which can
give pain to anyone."
"That will do," said Stanhope, "and now withdraw yourself."
Only One disappeared, and Bbadlaugh came on scene. B. taken
British Constitution under his charge; moved Resolution, dissenting
from Treasury Minute
on Perpetual Pension!.
Hanbury seconds Mo-
tion: G RANDOLPH sitl

take part in fray, but
there's the Marlborough
Pension; true it is com-
muted and out of the
way; but someone sure
to mention it if they get
opportunity; so GRan-
dolph lies low and says
nuffin. Grand Old Man,
fresher than ever, selects
this opportunity of ma-
king one of his three
speeches. Hour half-past
seven; House crowded:
just time to rush off and
dress for dinner. Dr.
Clark appears on scene;
House roared like den of
lions with morning meal
delayed.
"I wish to move"—
says Clark.
''Divide! Divide!"
roars House.
"Sir"
'"Vide! 'vide!"
"I wish"
'"Vide! 'vide! 'vide!"
After five minutes' struggle Claek announces his desire to move
Amendment, that "all perpetual pensions shall cease with fives of
present holders." House mollified by this delicious bull. Scotland
beaten Ireland out of the field; Caithness first, Connemara nowhere.
Clark going along beautifully, when Bbadlaugh moves Closure.
So House never learned how a pension that is perpetual shall cease
at given epoch. Business done.—Budget Bill through Committee.
Friday.— Habcoubt had gTeat triumph in House to-day. Have
sometimes, perchance, in privacy of these memoranda, jotted down
remarks lacking in due appreciation of this eminent man. There
are some people, it is well known, who would speak disrespectfully
of the Equator. All the more pleased, and ready to acknowledge
success. Interposed on Third Reading of Naval Defence Bill;
subject hammered away at for weeks; thrice-boiled colewort, a
delicate, tasty entree, compared with it. Habcoubt probably not
intended to deliver speech. That proved a happy incident; no signs
of preparation; no indications of impromptus fragrant with the
breath of the New Forest: a good, rattling, bustling speeoh; blows
hit straight out from shoulder; told all round; so exhilarated Oppo-
sition, that they couldn't be brought to agree to Third Reading,
which stood over.
"If it's the duty of an Opposition to oppose, must say Habcoubt
did his work brilliantly to-day," said Chablie Bfbesfobd, the
"Sweet little cherub who sits up aloft," to whom Habcoubt had
alluded as responsible for Admiralty change of front.
Business done.—Miscellaneous.

Defender of the Constitution.

The Anti-Perpetual-Pensioners' plan
Seemed ripe. Yes, the hour had come, and the man!
But they found it a sell: and that Goschkn was in it.
The hour had come—and the (Treasury) Minute!
That made all the difference. Oh, shame and pity,
That a Treasury Minute should swamp a Committee!
The Limits of Taxation.—Bereaved relations in reduced circum-
stances owing to the loss of a bread-winner, and those who sympathise
with them in their distress, very naturally complain of the additions
lately made to the "Death Duties." Those imposts, however, can
never be raised too high for people who don't pay them. There is no
fear—and no hope—that the taxation of death will ever be raised
high enough to prove prohibitive. No amount of duty can deter
anybody from dying.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"The Court then
adjourned."
ON COMMISSION.
May 21, 22, 23t and 24.—This may be called the Great O'Brien
week, as the distinguished Irish journalist to whom I have referred
has occupied the witness-box for nearly the whole period. And here
let me say, that if my language has become a little more flowery than
usual, it is due to the necessity, the desperate
necessity, of having had to listen to the talented
editor of United Ireland for a terrible—1 had
almost said a fatally-terrible number of hours.
But there have been others who have shared
- with me the pleasant and yet all-but-entirely-
/ distinctly - dead - oertainty fatal labour. On
Thursday, the bright star of Hawarden, that
like the sweet soft secret voice of conscience
rides through the thunder-clouds with an axe
in his hand, an eagle's glance in his clarion-
toned eyes, and the noble aspiration for the
good of the Emerald Isle of the Sea, the land of
the brave and the free, in his heart of hearts,
was present. Mr. O'Brien has been so eloquent in denouncing the
wrongs of Ireland, that Sir Charles Russell and Mr. Lockwood
have evidently been touched to the quick, and as for Mr. George
Lewis (who has sat beside the eminent Counsel to whom I have
iust referred), it appeared to me, that it was all that experienced
lawyer could do to restrain from a burst of passionate weeping.
But here, as the occasion seems to lend itself to treatment in a
dramatic form, I take the opportunity of subjoining a slight sketch,
whioh I need scarcely sav, ts at unlike the real thing as it it possible
to be. And I distinctly declare that no one who has been in Court
will venture to doubt the assertion.
Court full. Three Commissioners all awake. Distinguished per-
sonages in various quarters—some with opera-glasses, others
with luncheon batkttt. Counsel for defence gradually recovering
from extreme agitation coined by a recent description of the
wrongs of Ireland. Messrs. Murphy and Atkinson busy
collecting proofs. Attorney-General riset to crott-examine.
The Attorney-General {lifting seat and leaning on back of desk of
Junior Bar). I think you have just said it is one o'clock?
Witness {in a low tone). If you allow me, I will explain. It is
my decided and eternally expressed impression, that were the
material products of a metaphysical atmosphere to be placed in
juxtaposition [in a louder tone as he warms to his subject) to the rents of
a self-governed country, the result would be unquestionably chaos!
The A.-G. {looking sideways at someone in the jury-box, absently).
I must repeat my question. I think, you have said it is one o'clock?
Mr. Lockwood {interposing). Really the Witness ought to be
allowed to explain?
A.-G. {addressing the Court in a distressed but dignified tone). I
think I have put a plain question, and am not in fault. (Mr. Lock-
wood throws an appealing glance to their Lordships, suggestive of a
desire to say more, much more, which it only rettrained by the
haunting dread of seeing himself too frequently reported in the
newspapers). I really must ask for a plain answer. (Puckering up
his face into wrinkles, and looking earnestly at Witness). You said
it is one o'olock?
Witness {fit bay). Well, well, well! I may have said it! But I
must explain the circumstances under which I said it.
A.-G. (continuing examination). Was it one o'clock?
Witness (excitedly). I ask if this is fair! (Emphatically.) I
have no sort of wish, or kind of wish, or description of wish to con-
ceal anything. But when I admit that I said it was one o'clock, I
wish to draw a distinction between one o'clock and 12'45.
A.-G. (looking with half-closed eyes). Do you approve of 12'45?
Witness (rising abruptly from his chair, and speaking with preat
excitement). No, a thousand times No 1 I say—and I do not wish to
detract one iota from the circumstantial necessity of a tyrant-
composed delegation of artistic sensibilities—that it is the right of a
free nation to peruse the persecutions of an alien dynasty, and thus
cut itself off from the desperately dangerous chains of a wretched
combination of acrimonious atoms! I do not know if this view of
the subject is (with great force) right in law—but" it appears to me
(in a lower tone) to be entirely in accordance with the highest and
most noble dictates of (lowering hit voice to a whisper) superhuman
domestic economy!
A.-G. But you admit that you said it was one o'olock?
Witness (putting his hand to hit head). I really do not know—it
may have been.
A.-G. But I must press you upon this matter (holding up hit
hand to silence Mr. Mtjrphy, who it venturing upon a suggestion).
Do you not know, Sir—Yes or No—that it was one o'clook f
Witness (starting to hit feet). I say that your question is not fair.
I say that when the rifle is in the hand of the desperado, the patient
fowler listens to the frightfully horrible mnsic of the horn of the
hunter with dismay!
A.-G. (pursing his brows). But surely
Mr. Lockwood (interrupting). I really must ask that the Witness
may explain himself in his own fashion. (The Attorney-General
and Mr. Atkinson consult together, while Witness heaves an audible
tigh). I am the last person in the world, my Lords, to put myself
unduly forward, but
The Pretident. I think that the question should be answered.
[Mr. Lockwood respectfully subsides, and devotes several minutes
of earnest study to the completion of a half-jinished caricature.
A.-G. (with weary satisfaction at having overcome preliminary
difficulties). And now, Sir, will you please say whether you declared
it was one o'clock?
Witness (after a short pause for consideration). Yes, I did.
(Interrupting the Attorney-General, who is about to put another
question?) But allow me to say, that you must remember all the
terribly horrible circumstanoes of the distinctly desperate case. Let
me give an example. (With intense determination.) Yes, I will give
an example! When Julius Cesar firBt invaded England, it is said
that he asked for some oysters, and Boadicea, who was then in
revolt
A.-G. (plaintively appealing to the Bench). Surely, my Lords,
this is foreign to this issue?
The President (mildly). Well, it is a little far afield, but perhaps
I may say
[Accidentally glances at clock, which points to half-past one. His
Lordship pauses, and joyfully calls the attention of his Breth-
ren to the welcome fact. The Three Commissioners rise.

drop my pen, and seek a refresher myself.

"WAIT FOR THE WAGGON!"
Oh, who would not ride in a nice Caravan?
For a holiday outing thiB surely's the plan!
There's a boldness about it, a dash, and a novelty,
Which really should make us the travelling hovel try.
Like the snail, you will carry your house where you go,
And your progress may also be snailishly slow;
What matter? For thus you obtain ample leisure
To observe either Nature or Man at your pleasure.
You need not depend on a landlady's lodgings,
Or diurnally note her financial dodgings;
Then you are not confined to a single vicinity,
But can choose just the places with which you've affinity.
You can see the sun rise—if the rain is not falling—
And you '11 know the delights of a Waggon-man's calling.
At night-time, when tired, how pleasant 'twill be
To unharness, and feed, and rub down your Gee-gee!
If asleep, you enjoy quite a rollicking feeling
When the rain has come in through a crack in the ceiling.
Though the van-man, if hungry, it certainly riles
To hear there's no shop within twenty-five miles.
You can cook for yourself—handle kettle and pan;
Oh, who would not invest in a nice Caravan?
Well Thought Out.—Mr. Capper in conjunction with Mr.
Rutland have recently been giving an entertainment, of which the
former has certainly contributed the most amusing and interesting
portion. Mr. Capper undertakes to discover a murder which only
exists in the imagination of the would-be murderer. This he accom-
plishes very successfully. It seems, therefore, almost a pity that
this accomplished gentleman is not attached to Scotland Yard, where
his services in the Criminal Investigation Department appear to be
needed, and might be of considerable value. If he was successful in
finding out the perpetrator of the Whitechapel atrocities, everybody
would take off their hats and " cap" Capper.

PURELY PERSONAL—AN EVENING OUT;
Or, the Latest Development of Good Taste as understood by the " Society"
Gossip-monger.
Mrs. Fizzleton Skit-pinos' much-talked-of dance came off with
immense eclat at her spacious and commodious mansion in Battersea
Fields yesterday evening, and everything, from the strip of carpet
unrolled at the front door, to the tripe-and-onions—a perfect dream,
served at the sideboard at supper with the champagne, Jobson & Co.'s
Cuvee Reserve's Grand Vin, 1889, 23«. the dozen—was as perfect as
the most exacting guests of the ever-provident and economically-
minded hostess who furnished the entertainment could possibly have
desired. In an alcove on the half-landing a delightful rustic effect
had been attempted, with the aid of three pots of mignonette and a
dimly smoking petroleum lamp; but it was not till the drawing-
room was reached, and the ear caught the strains of the inspiriting
dance-musio furnished by the harp and cornet, whose services had
been secured for the entire evening, regardless of expense, from the
public-house round the corner, that the princely though judicious
character of the whole entertainment could be fully appreciated.
As might have been expected, none but the very smartest people
were present. Among the earliest arrivals was Lady Shuffleshy,
strikingly attired in a ditch-coloured peignoir, supported by her
husband, who had on a hired dress suit, and wore a magnificent
button-hole of second-hand Orchids, and her five elderly but
sprightly daughters, who, in their pretty emerald-green directoire
frocks, trimmed with ruches of sacking of charbonne de terre au
natural, created quite a sensation, and were much stared at. Mrs.
Machoozle, in a redingote of rich orange brocade, cut square
and looped in front with asperges en branche, with a single Spanish
onion on the shoulder, who brought a plain little niece with tier in
pepper and salt, also created much astonishment. Lady PorprNS
looked magnificent in a brand new wig, and was severely mobbed.
Commerce was adequately represented by Mrs. Omulligan
Slickers, the wife of the well-known Millionnaire Pork King, who
simply blazed with imitation jewellery; her tiara, necklace, corsage,
and stomacher so glistening with inferior Birmingham paste, that
she was followed by an eager crowd, and had eventually to be roped
off in a corner of the back drawing-room by the host himself, amidst
the ill-suppressed sneers of the inquisitive on-lookers. Count
Rooste, the noted Dutch savant, who came in a faded second-hand
Windsor uniform, created much diversion by its evident misfit, and
was fairly halloaed round the room, while the Countess, in a plum-
coloured Pompadour, relieved with a ruching of mashed tomatoes
chiffonne, with large bunches of variegated double hollyhock over a
bouillonne skirt of rich amber bed-curtain, was admitted on all hands
to be one of the sensations of the evening.
The Cotillon was perhaps the most characteristic feature of the
entertainment. The presents, which consisted of cocked hats for
the gentlemen, and fans for the ladies, made of back numbers of
various newspapers, created at first some little disappointment; but
great verve and go were suddenly thrown into the proceedings,
owing to the greengrocer, who had come to wait, but had helped
himself somewhat plentifully to the champagne on the sly, forcing
his way into the drawing-room, and, seizing upon Lady PorriNS,
insisting on joining in the final galop with her. Some little confu-
sion was caused in the departure, owing to the gas having been
suddenly cut off at the main by tbe Company for arrears; but, with
the assistance of a few local policemen, the guests were eventually
got safely out of the premises, and the general verdict seemed to be
that Mrs. Fizzleton Skippiitgs had provided her numerous friends
with a unique and remarkable entertainment.

What Doris will be after it has run a few hundred nights it
would be rash to prediot, but probably a tremendous, overpowering
success. It goes un-
commonly well at

singers, especially
Messrs. Ben Davtes
and Hayden Coffin,
whose personal popu-
larity is invaluable to
the Opera. The women
are not strong, except
Miss Alice Babnett,
the Eiffel Tower lady,
with very little to do,
but that little is capi-
tally done. The First
Act is decidedly good;
the plot so far being
interesting, and the
situations dramatic, or
humorous, as the case
may be. Mr. Arthur
Williams, too, is
funny, and, in fact,
the First Act has so
Burnett Fayre; or, Une Vraie Madame Eiffel muoh "go" in it—
taking Master Ben Davies and Miss Annie Albu including a charming
out for a walk. song> admirably sung
by Mr. Ben Davtes—that the other two Acts have a hard time of it,
and appear to be eked out with ballet and spectacle. How it happened
that so witty a playwright as Mr. Stephenson came to grief in the
story and the dialogue, probably only the author himself can explain.
Mr. Alfred Cellleb's music here and there is pretty enough,
but why enter into competition with Sir Arthur Sullivan by
introducing a Chorus in the costume of The Yeomen of the Guard at
the Savoy, of which the only raison d'etre ought to be its originality,
but which really is a copy, oonscious or unconscious, of the com-
poser's own Wooden-legged Pensioners' Chorus in the Sultan of
Mocha, which was invented, as far as I recolleot, to show that the
Old Men's Chorus in Faust, and the Conspirators' Chorus in Madame
Angot were not to have it all their own way. The Beefeaters'
Chorus goes for nothing, and deservedly so. I hear that all sorts of
permutations, combinations and alterations have been made since I
saw it, and are even now in process of rehearsal. If Mr. Hayden
Coffin and Mr. Ben Da vies had each another good popular song,
I have little doubt but that the run of Doris would rival that of
Dorothy.
The mise-en-scene reflects the greatest credit on the Stage
Manager, Mr. Charles Harris, the Scene-painters, Craven, Telbln
and Ryan, the Costumiers, and the artful Designer, M. Lucien
Besche. What a first-rate Comic Opera might be constructed out
of Paul Jones and Doris amalgamated, with Miss Huntinodon and
the Ladies of the Prince of Wales's, and retaining the services of
Messrs. Ben Davies and Hayden Coffin. Arthur Williams
should be retained on the premises, and be bound over to keep the
piece in the bills by being originally droll without imitating the
other Arthur whose surname is Roberts. Among the public, the
ladies admire Miss Huntingdon at the Prince of Wales's, and
Cellter's musio at the Lyric.
After all, there is money in Wealth at the Haymarket. The rule
nowadays seems to be that a first-night failure indicates a long
run. If this is due to alterations made in consequence of judicious
criticism, then criticism fulfils a most useful function. So Mr.
Bancroft, the Manager in retreat, is going to reappear in the striking
part of the Abbe in the Dead Heart, whenever Mr. Irving revives
this old play at the Lyceum. Abbe thought!
Mr. Wyndham should seize the opportunity offered by this sudden
tropioal weather to give extra publicity to Still Waters, which
paradoxically are " still running. He might advertise " still waters

Insurance and Irony—From evidence given to the House of
Commons Committee on the working of the Friendly Society's Act,
it appears that all the Coroners in England concur in condemning the

denominated death insurance?
ROBERT ON RATES.
r, but

Well, I does my werry best to hunderstand the whole matter,
it's all in wain, but there's one pint as I does hunderstand, and
that is, that year by year and amost munth by munth my rates
seems for to be increasing at sit eh a rate as fully justifys their
rayther peculiar name, i'm told as how
as a good deal of it is hoing to the change
of government from the old Bored of Works
with their Cole Dues and their Wine Dues,
to the New County Counsel with their no
Cole and Wine Dues and their perfeoly
staggering Rate of 2 and 8 pence three
farthings in their pound. Well, now, I've
bin a calclating it out on a Slate, till it's
amost covered with figgers, and I finds as
my Dues on Wine, witch I'm told it was
ony a farthing a gallon, didn't cost me a
single penny, and my Dues on Coles, which
it was thirteen pence a Tun, cost me xactly
2 and tuppence a-year, while my hin-
creased Rates is just about ten shillings,
so I at wunce, and without no hezzitation,
shall wote for going back to the hold system
and paying my farthing a gallon on all the
wines as I buys, not on the wine as I drink, not by no means, for
that wood be quite another pair of Shoes.
And then jist see what hairs the new Colleckters gives thereselyes.
Mine called last week and I was hout, so in course I coodn't pay him,
so he calls again to-day, and leaves word as he shan't call not no
more! Werry kind I think it of him, till I learns as he '11 have me
up before the Magistrate if I don't pay dreckly! And the lordly
Gent is ony at home twice a week, and then ony for a few ours.
What a blooming lot of Rates there is to be sure! First, there's
the Poor Rate, not so werry poor neither, as it cums to 8i<f. in the
pound for harf a year. Nex there's the County Counsel Rate, and
that's 6rf. in the pound; then oums the Police Rate, and that's 2Jrf.;
and then cums the Rate jist for lighting the Public Lamps, and a
penny in the pound seems a good deal If or that werry small matter;
then cums a rate for the' old Bored of Works, and that's 3d. Then
bang goes 4Jrf. for looking after the Streets, and another 4\d. for
the School Bored, and then a penny for repairing the Sewers, and
another penny for the xpences of the Westry, inclndin, I suppose, a
nice little Westry Dinner now and then, and for that I most suttenly
don't blame 'em; not a bit of it, speshally if they acts libberally to
the Waiter, poor Feller!
I wonders what the good of Rates is. One ginerally xpecs in a
free country to git sumtnink for whatever money one has to pay, but
what do I git here? It's werry difirent in the case of Taxes. Wen
I pays a Nincum Tax I pays it willingly, coz I gets a nincum for it.
The same with the Ouse Tax—I has a ouse for it; and the same with
the Propperty Tax—it gives me a nice little propperty; so I don't
mind paying 'em. But what do I git for my Kates? Litorally
nothink; and so I naterally pays 'em with a grumbel. As to the
owdacious County Counsel, as meets in a place as doesn't belong to
'em, and is in siteh a wunderf ul hurry to make new Rates that they
won't even stop till we've had time for to pay the old ones, so that
we 're acshally asked to pay the two lots at the same time altogether
at once, why, if they'd ony kindly wait till we've all had the hopper-
toonity of telling 'em what we thinks of their wunderful hurry, they
might lern sumtnink as they woodn't like, so praps that's the reason
why they won't.
It's all the fault of having werry rich men to make the Rates.
What does a man with twenty or thirty thousand a year, or ewen
with ony two thowsand a year, care about Rates P Why, nothink.
He doesn't know, and praps doesn't care, what the amount is, and
little knows how a poor Waiter is sumtimes trubbled to raise the
money, speshally wen he's had a bad week or two, a waiting on a
speshally shabby lot of stingy diners-out. We gets rayther more
than usual of this kind of gent during the May Meetings, as they 're
called, for, strange to say, however singler it may seem, wot peeple
calls wice is werry much more libberal than wot peeple calls wirtue.
This is a suckemstance as is werry trying to us Waiters, as it reelly
makes us, wen pertickler stumped up, and has our Rates to pay,
greatly prefer the cumpany of such jolly gents as frequents Rich-
mond or Grinnidge with their fare partners, to those werry much
Bollemer and seriouser gents as has bin a spending the afternoon at
Hexeter All.
Upon the whole I finishes by saying, aB Rates is a conundrum as
I don't quite hunderstand. Robert.
"I don't profess to be much of a theologian," observed the Dean
of Bboadchurch, " but when you ask me how the Church of England
proves her belief in eternity, I should say by the practice of
appointing ' Perpetual Curates.'"

BRAVO, POTTER!
[Bishop Potths, of New York, in his Centennial Sermon commented on
"the infinite swagger of American speech and manner, which mistook bigness
for greatness, and sadly confounded gain and godliness."]
You reckon, Brother Jonathan, that you can lick Creation;
You put on what in this old town's denominated " Bide;"
You 're certain in your inmost heart each antiquated nation
Of Europe looks with envy o'er the vast Atlantio tide.
You 're quite the biggest thing on earth, you'd like to see a bigger;
You count your mighty milBonnaires by dozens at a time;
The first thing that you ask about a man is " What's his figger?"
And nothing except poverty is counted as a crime.
Geobge "Washington was great and good, and not for him the Caucus,
The blatant carpet-bagger and the democratic boss;
The partisans who howl tor place with voices loud and raucous,
And try to grab their profit, though it be their country's loss.
Then purity of principle was held the State's sheet-anchor,
We never heard of lobbying, of dodges, or of "rings;"
Political corruption now has spread, a nideous canker,
Where'er the eagle that you boast has waved his mighty wings.
The swagger, says the Bishop, of your speech and of your manner,
Takes bigness to be greatness, confounds gain and godliness;
So let us have a single reef in that star-spangled banner,
And let Columbia put on a less obtrusive dress.
MODUS OPERANDI.
Monday.—House brilliant again. Their Royal Highnesses the
Prince and Princess of Waives present to hear Faust. Miss
McInttbe looks the McMargherita, or Scotch-German Maggie, to
gerfection. She gives quite a " How-
appy-could-1-be-with- heather"
air (this is not sung, though, as
Gounod might object) to the Opera.
What was Margaret'/ surname?
If she hadn't one, she couldn't

have changed it to Faust, even if she had been asked, which,
except in decorous poet Wills's play, she never was. Maggie
McInttbe's rendering of the Jewel Song, and her un-acting
edition of Faust's victim, just as delightful as it was last season.
The little boy with the long Russian name, Winogbadoff, was
mistaken by those who were not au fait with the Opera for Scalchi
as Siebel. There is a family resemblance when
regarded from a back row of the stalls without
using an opera-glass. But his name should be in
keeping with his stature. Let him either be
"Wino" or "Geadoff," but not both together.
"In Wino Weritas," so I'll stick to this abbre-
viated form, as he is a true singer, nothing false
about him, I won't say nothing bass, as there
must be always something low in a baritone. Of
the Death Scene, Valentine's great chance, Wino
did not make the most. But he will come out The Cap of Mephis-
stronger next time, and Dburiolanus was quite topheles aB reflected
justified in taking Wino for his Valentine. If ?» a ,.tre? _» the
Signor Castel (short for Castelmabt, another w*1*-
long name) as a burly Mephistopheles, would give less of his time
and attention to striking attitudes for a photography his performance
would be more fiendishly satisfactory. To my mind he plays the
deuce with Mephistopheles, which is quite different from being the
very devil. His laugh, too, has in it more of the heartiness of the
practical joker than the cynicism of the demon. The new Faust,

M. Montabiol, sang charmingly, but ought to have been more
ardent with such a Maggie to inspire him. Clever little Madame
Bauebmeisteb always makes Martha a merry and attractive little
dame, who, on this occasion, fully appreciated the humour of trotting
about arm-in-arm with the portly Mephistopheles. Everything else
perfeot; the Old Men's Chorus so especially good as well-nigh to
revive the ancient enthusiasm.
Tuesday.—Marie Roze as Carmen. She can look, act, and sing
it, and to do the two first of these is a good two-thirds of the battle.
Never better than to-night. The simple Maggie McIntibe an
admirable contrast to her as the peasant maid, who tries to reclaim

the enamoured'' bould soger boy." F. Dan Dbabdt Ma job, who plays
the Toreador, with which I was content 0 as usual, has brought his
brother up to town for the season, and so Dan Dbabdt Mi. played
Jost, and did it uncommonly well. Another good performance: the
first week starts admirably. Organising Committee beaming.
Thursday.—Traviata. Splendid House. Ella Russell in great
form, almost too great form for the consumptive heroine of the opera,
vet at times reminding me of an amplified Saba Bebnhabdt in
her acting. Dan Dbabdt Majob excellent as the "stern parient,"
and Signor Talazac appeared as his stout substantial son, a kind of
Italian version of the impressionable Josh Sedley in Vanity Fair
flattered by fascinating Ella Becki Shabpini, who at one time
seemed to me to be going to give a new turn to the old story by
"mashing" flabby and impressionable Alfredo's good-looking and
decidedly well-preserved parent. To-night I see that Albani is to
appear on the same night that the Colonel announces the opening of
the Hopposition. But Dkubiolanus is first in the Garden. Melting
moments for Talleb-Zac, but he sang sweetly, though not power-
fully; and touching was it to witness Ella's deep affection for him.
A big night for Ella and Dan.
Saturday.—Another splendid audience. Performance of Aida
more than satisfactory. "Tho Two Dans" (who must not be con-
fused with " The Two Macs," also very clever artists, but quite in a
different line) again taking a turn. Madame Scalchi as good as ever
in the character of the Egyptian Queen, but perhaps a trifle too white
for a countrywoman of Cleopatba. Signor Mibanda as " II R£,"
no doubt to keep his consort in countenance, also more than fair.
Madame Valda rather heavy for Aida, but still most effective. The
mise-en-scene, of course, splendid,—but this was to be expected
under the rule of Dbubiolanus. Standards in the triumphal pro-
cession in the Second Act full of quiet humour, but absolutely histo-
rically correct. Egyptians always partial to weird waggery. Instance
in this very Opera, where Radames is locked in a cellar, and left to
his fate, to the music of harps and the dancing of fan-bearers. Before
and behind the Curtain equally brilliant. The week ends as it began
with every prospect of a successful season. It is admitted on all sides
that Covent Garden has not looked so much like its old self for years.

Little Jokes picked up a wonderfully smart Hack, for an absurdly low Price, at a recent Auction. This is his first
APPEARANCE IN THE PARK. He NOW LEARNS THE ANIMAL FORMERLY HKLONOED TO BUFFALO BILL'S ClRCUS.
THE (COUNTY COUNCIL) PARADISE AND

A Moorc-ish Legend modernised.
At three a Peri at the (fate
Of Eden stood disconsolate;
And as she listened to the springs
Of talk within in torrents flowing,
And caught the light upon her wings
Through the half-opened portal glowing,
She sighed to think her subject race
Should e'er have lost that glorious place.
"How happy," exclaimed this outcast fair,
"Are the many male members who WTangle
there,
'Midst flowers (of speech) that freely fall;
Though I of the School Board now am free,
And parochial portals open for me,
The County Council were worth them all!
Though sweet an 'At Home' graced by

In the Grosvenor or the Memorial Hall;
Though dear are the platforms your sweet

How the County Council outshines them
It is very hard that the Dames who intrigue
For that Tory Aidenn, the Primrose League,
Are praised and petted by Prince and Peer,
Whilst I'm forbidden free entrance here.
Backstairs influence well may gain
The entrfe to loftiest Habitation;
But here I linger and long in vain
For a seat within, which to attain
Is the goal of she-Liberals' emulation.
'Tis the goal which my womanly heart was
fix t on;
I hoped by the aid of suburban Brixton,
With male monopoly proudly to cope;
And now an outcast I sadly stand,
Foiled by that bogey, the Law of the Land,
Driven to despair by false (Beresford)
Hope!
If only I'd stray on the Primrose Path
(As many Partisan Peri hath)
Society's scorn, and the Saturday's wrath
Might be diverted from my poor head;
But now, my mad and unmodish crimes
Are mocked by the Post and denounced by
the Times,
And ostracism's my daily dread.
Mean race of men, your monopolist spirit
Still, still would told our sex in thrall!
Some show of freedom we now inherit,
But the trail of ' Subjection' is over them
all!"
The smooth-faced Angel who was keeping
The C. C. doors beheld her weeping;
And, as he nearer drew, and listened
To her sad song, a tear-drop glistened
Within his eyelids, like the spray
From patriot fountains, when 'tis pearl'd
On Beakey's blossom, which—Tories say—
Blows nowhere but in Primrose-World.
"Nymph of a fair but luckless line!"
Rosebert said—" one hope is thine,
'lis written in the Book of Fate,
The Peri yet may be admitted
Who brings unto this C. C. gate

AVhat the dear children—who of course are

nardo. We suppose we've not heard the
last about the " Barnardo Homes." "Homes"
is a nice word. If Mr. Matthews were any-
thing but the Not-at-Homes-Secretary, he
would look into the matter at once.

Or, Ten of Oite and Half-a-dozen of the OOter.
In Parliament young Mr. Lawsow—
Learned in facts as in Greek Porson—
Assures us that our L. C. C.
Keeps watchful eye on L. S. D.
But, with much vigour, Mr. Baumann
Leaps from his seat, exclaiming, "How, Man,
Can you make statements rash and heady,
When up the rates have gone already
By fivepence in the blessed suv'rin?
Then Mr. Lawson, on reeov'rin'
From this remark, says, with effusion,
"It's all an optical illusion!
Over ten months the 'Precept' ranges,
And thus the half-year's rate deranges."
Whereto sneers Bat/mann, "At this rate
We shall regret the ' Perks' its fate."
Moral.
Even if our rates are now abating,
There seems to be increase of rating.'

writes thus:—" At the Haymarket Theatre
only one stage-direction is necessary for any
scene in any play, and that is,' Centre, a Tree.''

WHAT THEY 'RE DOING "WITH HIM.
THE vert latest canards.
We hear that the Directors of the General Omnibus Company have
notified to the General their unanimous resolution to give him a lift,
whenever he may desire to avail himself of that means of locomo-
tion, in any of their vehicles, free of charge. On this having been
intimated to the General, he is said to have expressed much satisfac-
tion at the proposal.
The General, we understand, yesterday morning accorded an
interview to several influential Music Hall Proprietors, anxious to
secure his services as a feature in the programme of their respective
entertainments. The terms of eaoh varied in some slight particulars,
but the leading idea of all seemed to be the appearance of the
General in one or more costumes, with or without a comic song, but,
if possible, with a grotesque dance, or some other striking gymnastic
feat performed to the accompaniment of a taking refrain. On the
nature of their respective propositions being explained to him, the
General manifested an evident interest, and after expressing himself
as much gratified at their offers, intimated that he would leave the
question of their acceptance in the hands of his " Committee."
It is understood that the General has been offered, and has
accepted, the Presidency at the Annual Dinner to be held at Wap-
ping on the 19th proximo, in Aid of the Decayed Bathing-women's
Grandmothers' Association.
It is reported that a well known Caterer for Public Amusement
has in contemplation proposing to the General an extended provincial
tour, on advantageous terms, with a first-class Travelling Circus,
the General to contribute to the performance a comic scene with a
highly-trained elephant, from whose back he would eventually be
expected to jump through three paper moons, coloured respectively
blue, white, and red, as indicative of the National Flag of France.
It is contemplated that when the scheme is fully explained to the
General he will entertain it with every expression of gratification.
We hear that this morning an influential deputation from West-
bourne Grove called on the General for the purpose of securing his
presence at a " small and early" organised in the neighbourhood
with a view to introducing him to ' the nobility and gentry" of
Bayswater. On the object of their visit being made clear to him, the
General who smiled most graciously at the deputation, expressed his
gratification at the honour they proposed to pay him, and intimated
that he would leave the matter in the hands of his " Committee."
It is rumoured that on the 9th, 17th, and 23rd prox., respectively,
the General will open the Cabmen's Shelter at Hackney, lay the
foundation stone of the new Cemetery at Tooting, and preside at the
Inauguration of the Bazaar in aid of the Funds of the Consumptive
Pastrycooks' Orphan Asylum at Honndsditeh. It is also further
stated, that not only on these days, but on all others, the General's
time is already fully taken up with prospective engagements. On
this having been pointed out to him, the General is said, to have con-
templated the circumstance with every manifestation of the very
liveliest satisfaction.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIABY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, May 20.—The Noble Baron
had little surprise in store for Opposition to-night. Comforted
themselves with conviction that Sugar Convention dead, and only
awaiting convenient opportunity for burial. But Noble Baron

vention been signed by seven out of the eight great Bounty-giving

Majesty/s Government fully alive to importance of maintaining it.

suspected the Noble Baron of such fund of quiet humour; fancy
Lyon Playfair put him up to this - got a tremendous convincing

[J one 1, 1889.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Debate on Naval Defence Bill set in with accustomed severity.
Thought it was all settled on Second Reading: broke out again in
Committee; now begins again on Third Beading. Members who
could not catch Speaker's eye on earlier stages, now grab at it.
Members stand it weU enough till half-past seven; after that,
patience breaks down. Lllingworth, rising at twenty minutes to
Eight to continue talk, uproar burst forth in deafening shouts for
Division. Axed moved Closure; Speaker took no notice.
"Yet he must have 'Aied him," said Cttakt.tk Beeesfobd, who
had made his speech, and was getting hungry.
Wilfrid Lawson followed Illingworth; heartrending groans
from famished Members; Lawson talked on. Eight o'clock struck;
ten minutes past: dinner spoiled in three hundred desolate homes.
Howls increase; Wilfrid immovable.
"They'll only drink wine and cherry brandy," he said, "if I let
'em off. Better stop here few minutes longer."
Quarter past eight; division called; ten minutes later three hundred
hungry men racing downstairs, and Palace Yard resonant with the
tramp of the sympathetic cab-horse and the roll of the wheels of the
hurrying brougham.
Business done.—House "kept in" over dinner-hour. Third
Beading of Naval Defence Bill carried by 183 votes against 101.
Tuesday.— Buzzing round Sugar Convention again; Harcourt
quite in nigh spirits. Looked up lot of questions he was going to
ask. when what now appears to nave been premature announcement
of demise made; fires them off at Treasury Bench. Gladstone
backs him up. Hicks-Beach throws himself into breach; stands
fire for ten minutes. Didn't make very much of him ■ hasn't the
unique, benevolent simplicity of Old Morality, off which objurga-
tion, reproach, and abuse run as harmlessly as water off duck's back.
"The worst of Old Morality is," Harcourt says, "that one gets
so little for one's pains. Blows
that would pulverise another man
haven't slightest effect on his im-
Serturbable ingenuousness. It's
ke doubling up your fists
and hammering a feather-bed.
Feather-bed shaken up, and two
minutes later presents precisely
same placid, benevolent, inviting
appearance as it did before you
wore yourself out upon it."
Less of the feather-bed about
Hicks-Beach at question time;
but result not much more satis-
factory to assailant. '' I must beg
for an answer from some member
of the Government," Harcourt
blusters.
'' The answer of the Govern-
ment is," said Michael-Angelo
Beach, "that we do not consider
it consistent with our duty and
the interests of the public service
to give the Bight Hon. Gentle-
man the information he wants."
Harcourt persisted; Glad-
stone pounded away; Michael-
Angelo, leaning confidentially
on the box, fired his last shot,
to answer hypothetical questions."
Harcourt not having any other kind ready at moment, performance
terminated.
Later. JosErH Gillis appeared on scene, a rare delight in these
days. National Debt Bill on for Third Beading. Harcourt up
again, dropping big tears over Goschen's unfaithfulness to memory
and principles of Stafford Northcote. Destroyed two great works
of his financial life—Cheap Sugar, and Scheme for Bejection of
National Debt. Harcourt could scarcely control his emotion.
Others joined in. Jokeiit, temporarily laying aside cap-and-bells,
earnestly pleaded his innocence, Then Joseph Gillis appeared with
outstretched hand that instantly stilled tumult of controversy, and
left him the centre of a listening Senate. If you'd given your mind
to it, might have heard a pin drop, as Joey B., with gaze sternly
fixed on prostrated Chancellor of the Exchequer, chanted fortn
his notes of regret, attuned more to sorrow than anger, that there
should be a Government capable within the space of fifteen years of
having twice attacked financial principles of his late Bight Hon.
friend, Sir Stafford Northcote.
Harcourt had said these very things, and had, indeed, the advan-
tage of uttering them first. But Joseph Gillis, unconsciously
imitating sweep of Harcourt's arm as he delivered with Harcourtian
ponderosity the very sentiments he had heard delivered a couple of
hoars earlier, was muoh more effective than the original. Jokeim,
listening to Harcourt, from time to time scornfully smiled and
defiantly shook his head. Bnt when Joey B. delivered same lofty
Michael-Angelo.
'I must decline," he said

All a-blowin' and a-giowin."
sentiments, expounded identical principles of financial purity,
Jokeim's guilty head sank on his alarmed breast, he folded his trem-
bling arms, and vainly tried to shut out with closed eyelids the spec-
tacle of the terrible accuser. Business done.—Budget Bill agreed to.
Wednesday.—London Coal Dues under discussion. Pease wants
to abolish *;nem. Press heavily upon
the poor. Fowler (Alderman) shows,
on contrary, that prosperity of London
is derived entirely from regular exac-
tion of Coal Dues. To this source is
due Holborn Viaduct, Thames Embank-
ment, Polytechnio, Tower of London,
and Underground Sewage. If old
Charters of London are to be abolished,
then New Zealander better at once apply
to Cook's agent for tioket for London
Bridge. Firth, urged by momentous
subject to unusual nights of eloquence,
expresses desire that ancient Charters
of London may "remain in the womb
of the past." Baumann makes clever
speech in moving rejection of BiU; but
Ritchie runs amuck at Dues. Old
Morality proposes compromise, and
Bill read a Second Time by 264 votes
against 104.
Thursday.—Scotland's turn at last.
Ireland we have always with us; Eng-
land gets an opportunity occasionally:
Gallant Little Wales had evening and
morning sitting in succession last week.
Now Sandy takes the floor; all the
blue bonnets are over the border;
Westminster echoing with Scotch
accent; the wail of the pibroch heard
in distant corridor; haggis figures prominently in menu in dining-
room. Jacoby, arrayed in Tightest summer suit, perambulates
lobby. Smiles beamingly an all Scotch Members.
"We'll hae a gude diversion the night, I'm thinkin', Dr. Farr-
quharrson," he said, just now to Member for West Aberdeen.
That not his usual way of speaking; but Jacoby a born Whip.
Knows how to get at the heart of a
man. Only with greatest difficulty
his colleague, PniLip Stanhope,
prevented Mb coming down to-nieht
in kilt.
"It would fetch them," he said;
"I'm sure Sootch very susceptible
on national matters. Would like
a little delicate attention like the
kilts."
Stanhope said, No; thought
they'd better not try it yet. Jacoby,
not permitted to don Highland garb,
put on what he believed to be Scot-
tish accent; whistled "Scots wha
hae" as George Campbell passed
him; asked Buchanan to lend him
uopyof " Meg Merrilees," which he
beli eves is one of Scott's novels.
Wonderfully enthusiastic man in
his new vooation!
Business done.—Debate on Scotch
Local Government Bill.
Friday Night. — A melancholy
day. At morning sitting, Scotch
Local Government BiU; in the
evening, Pickersgill on Penal Sen-
tences. Prevailing dulness momen-
tarily varied by interesting story
told by Matthews, of How They
Went to the Prize Fight at Mose-
ley. Seems "Fancy" had them-
selves packed up in covered fur-
niture-van. Police placidly watched ponderous vehicles passing
along highway; never suspeoted anything, though on qui rtce to
stop fight. When furniture-van—" Taking-all-Bisks "—arrived at
selected spot, unpacked, and "the furniture" went at it un-
disturbed. Business done—Much talk.

Tlie new Whip.
It is the fashion, as a matter ui business, for the Managers oi sea-
side Hotels to telegraph up to town, daily, informing intending
visitors of the state of the weather, chez eux. One sends up, "Dull

"Dull morning, dry. Hand shaky."

ill no case be returned, not even when accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed Envelope, Cover, or Wrapper. To this rale

May 28, 29, 30, and 31.—The feature of
the week has been the examination and
cross-examination of Mr. Bigqae. Of course,
it would be very wrong to comment upon the
evidence of the distinguished humorist in
question, but I must be permitted to say,
that there were many present who expected
a scene, when he was called, something like
the following:—

I don't mind the pig, the pig won't mind me!

I must admit that certainly Mr. Biggab
did not give his evidence in a manner closely
resembling the above. On the other hand,
I should be exceedingly loth to assert that
his cross-examination was at all like the
following:—
Counsel (rising deferentially). I think,
Mr. Biggab, you have devoted many years
ofyour life to public affairs?

thing witty in reply.

Counsel. I am sure you will credit me,
Mr. Biggab, when I say that I have no inten-
tion of fixing you to dates; but may I take
it that those twenty years may be said to
extend from 1869 to 1889?

"MODUS OPERANDI."
(The Covent Garden Govtrnment and Her Majesty's Opposition.)
Tuesday, May 28.—How plucky of Bono to have written
Mefistofeh, after Gounod had made such a success with Faust. It
was almost as if MeAslofele were tempting the gifted Composer into
If bo, Mephistopheles was done, not for the first

magnificently rendered, Signor Novara taking Signor Castelmary's
part at short notice, which made "no vara great difference" as
Miss McIntyre observed in her best Scotch McAocent. Why call
her " Mademoiselle" in the bills't Aiblins (whatever that may be),
but she'8 a pnir and bonnie Scotch lassie, and nae French. She
looked charming as Bono's Marguerite, who is much more of a
genuine ingSnue than is Gounod's girl, and sang superbly. I shall
welcome the time when she can rely entirely upon herself, and act
her part without keeping one eye on Signor Mancinelli to see if it's
all nght. I dare say Mancinelli likes it: I should, if I were in his
place,—and, by the way, if I were in his place, what a row there'd
be in the orchestra! Of course, the old musical hands in the
orchestra sympathise with her, and yet must wish that she
should be out of their leading-strings. Even when she goes as mad
as a hatter—as a Straw-hatter—(is this anywhere near the solu-
tion as to the origin of this proverbial simile '() — her rule seems
to be, "Keep my eye on my Mancinelli, and my Mancinelli will
pull me through." Madame Scalchi, is a jovial Marta, far too
wicked for Mephistopheles, who objects to being Marta'd in Marta-
riraony. Sly humour of Bono'g in introducing a little bit of
Waoneb, well-played and sung by Signor Rinaldini in true
Warbling Wag'ner style, in the First Act. How good that German
dance is! It haunts me for days afterwards, and what a contrast
is its peasant-like clumsiness to the graceful classical movement of
the Grecian Ladies in the Troy Town Act, where the warbling
Wag'ner reappears as Nereus—just like him—and Marta comes out
in classical drapery as a lady of the name of Pantalis (who was she
when she was at home ?) who does her best to play nothing on an
old harp with damp strings—not a true harp, but a lyre—and sings
a charming duet with Helen McGregor; no, I should say Helen
McIntyre of Troy, our sweet Belle Heline, from whom Offbnbach-
again memories expect the song of " O Belle Venus, quel plat sir
trourei-tut" "Ah, Schneider, how you vas!" as Rip Van Jeffer-
son Winkle used to say. The Opera is not a light one, but it was
made heavy by the "waits" between the Acts; especially the Troy
Wait. The Brocken Scene raised the enthusiasm of the house, and
would have restored the spirits—it was full of them—of even the most
Brocken-hearted Manager, which Dburiolancs most decidedly isn't.
Thursday. — An eventful evening for the Cosmopolitan Orga-
nising Opera Committee. Irish Tenor with Scotch name was to have
played on Italian Opera Stage in German Opera LoJtengrin. Rather
mixed. But poor Signor Bartoni Mac-aroni Gcckini unfortu-
nately sprained his ankle, and it didn't come off. By " it," I mean
the event. Rather than disappoint the brilliant house assembled to
meet him, Signor M'GtTCKor would have been only too pleased to
have come on as Lohengrin in a Bath-ohair drawn by swans, and
sung with all the fervour and sweetness of which he is capable. The
Organising Committee all for the idea—such a novelty. Prttrio-
i.anis decided against it. "Bad precedent," said the astute
Manager, "for Tenor to come on in Bath-chair." So Dan Prarpt.
Junior, took the part at short notice, and acquitted himself as well
as the short notice would permit. Audience, following the excellent
example of punctuality set by Their Royal Highnesses,
early, and stopped till the wobbling property pigeon, a v
shot for any marksman with half
an eye for a penn'orth at the
cocoa-nuts, had descended, and
all was over with the wicked
Orirude, who is perpetually
interfering between the Wedding
Knight and Madame Nordica,
looking and singing charmingly
as Miss Somebody Elsa, without

even saying, "Beg pardon, hope I don't do ought rude."
Hardly recognised Madame Nordica in new fair-haired wig, and
evidently she looked much taller than last season. Evidently grown
rapidly in public opinion. Puir Scotch Lassie Maggie McImtkk,
in a state of Scotch lassie-tude, reclined in the Stalls, and was clearly
surprised at finding herself on the wrong side of the Curtain. Mr.
Henry Chaplin was radiant after his successful bimetallistic depu-
tation, and insisted on explaining to Druriolanits the theory of
bimetallism. Druriolanus, equal to the occasion, comprehended it
in a twinkle. "I see," he said, "bioycle thing on two wheels;
'biped,' creature on two
peas: bimetallism evidently
means doubling the prices.
Won't do, my boy: won't
do. Tata!" TheMAHDl—
Fursch-Madi, I should say
—in great force as Ortrude.
Opera magnificently put on
the stage; everything first-
rate except the property-
moulting wobbling pigeon,
and the sooner he is put
into a property-pie, and seen
no more, the better for the
finish of Lohengrin. Or-
chestra conduoted by Man-
tauni, — no. Mancinelli,
—superb. Vive P Opera.'
Saturday. — Bentree of
Madame Albani. Every-
body enraptured. But why
the Story of Alfred and oh'thv> " a G> e"ful moment!
the Cakes, called La Traviata? Alfred, in this case, could hardly be
called Alfred the Great, and Madame Aliiani had doubtless some-
thing to contend against in Signor Talazac's curious idea of a lover's
passion, and Signor Cotogno quaint conception of paternal pathos.
But, despite these drawbacks, what a triumph was hers, and how
well did Violetla deserve the huge bouquets of roses and lilies,
orchids and iris, which were presented to her at the close of the First
and Second Aots respectively! A brilliant House apparently had
eyes and ears for Violetta alone, though it certainly did not let her
alone when her liquid trills and lovely piano passages fairly brought
it down. Alfred the Little sang his part in the duet in the Last Act
with some sweetness and effect; and Signor Cotooni's powerful voice
would probably please more if bis peculiar facial play and manual
movement* did not quite so strongly convey the idea that he was
playing alternately at Dumb Crambo and Forfeits.
Her Majesty's Opposition.—The Session commenced with the
Barhiere, possibly in the hope that that Opera might save, or rather
shave, it from disaster. Signor Padilla (certainly one of the best
Figaros of modern times) gives it most valuable support. But as a
solitary swallow does not make a summer, a singular celebrity (espe-
cially when of the male sex) docs not always create a season's success.
Fortunately the Bosina, Madame Gakoano, and the Altnaviva of
Signor Victim (who [appears vicariously for someone else), are
equally good, r rom the appearance of the House generally, I fancy
that Her Majesty's Opposition is not unlikely to secure what may be
termed "a good working minority."

After the ceremony last Saturday, Prince Geokoe of Wales is in
full possession of the Liberty of the City of London. He can do what-
ever lie likes. It is George without the drag on. This freedom is
H.R.H.'s hereditary right; so, as a Citizen, he is " free as the litir."

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
SIXTEENTH EVENING.
"I know a young policeman," the Moon told Mr. Punch. "He
is extremely civil and obliging, but he has not been very long in the
force. His beat lies in a highly
fashionable and secluded district,
and the other evening his services
were called into request in a
somewhat strange manner. He
e- was going his rounds, and quite
enjoying the clamp of his heavy
boots on the pavement, when he
came upon a gentleman and lady
standing in great perplexity by
the area railings ot one of the
houses, which was all dark and
shut up. My beams shone clearly
on the party: on the constable,
who thought it incumbent upon him
to remember that he was a police-
man and adopt a surface suspicion;
on the pretty pale face of the lady,
under whose furred cloak could be
seen the shimmer of her evening
on the gentleman, who was also in evening dress, and who
humorously annoyed at something, as he sought vainly in
all his pockets. 'This is pleasant, constable!' he said; 'come out
without our latch-key!' The young policeman offered to ring and
knock for them, but the lady would not hear of it. 'It would
frighten darling Lily so,' she said, 'and the poor child has been so
feverish all day.' She had such a sweet voice, and her eyes looked
Iso large and so pathetio in my rays, that the young policeman felt
himself becoming less official. '0 Policeman, she said, 'can't you
think of anything? Fancy not to be able to get into one's own house!'
"The policeman reflected for a moment; it was so gratifying to
feel that this beautiful lady had such confidence in him that he
naturally wished to show that he deserved it. At last he hit upon a

gown
plan. They were painting a house opposite, and the workmen had
left their ladders; perhaps, he suggested, if he fetched one, the
upper windows might be found to have been left unfastened.
So the policeman and the gentleman brought the ladder between
them, and, curiously enough, the upper window had been left un-
fastened—which showed that the young constable knew something
of the world. And presently I saw the gentleman go up and enter
through the window, and then the lovely lady, after prossing a half-
crown in the policeman's palm, prepared, with graceful timorousness,
to ascend. 'What fun it would be,' I heard her say, with a musical
little laugh, 'supposing another policeman saw me now and took me
for a burglar!' 'No fear o' that, Ma'am,' he answered, gallantly,
'not when I'm at hand.' Then she went up the ladder, higher and
higher, till he could only see a dim grey form aloft, and then the
window was cautiously closed, and the house was dark and still once
more. The young policeman gazed up at it sentimentally; a light
shone in the upper room; he pictured the beautiful mother bending
over her sick child's cot, and, reverently and tenderly, he removed
the ladder which had been hallowed by her feet.
"Suddenly it occurred to me that the couple who lived in that
house were quite middle-aged people, and had no child to be feverish.
I remembered now, too, that they had left home that very after-
noon on a short visit. Could the lady and gentleman have mistaken
the house P I think they must have done so, though it took them
nearly an hour to find it out, for it was much later when I next saw
them both oome out by the little garden at the back, when the
gentleman helped the lady over the wall into a side street. He had a
bag in his hand, which I had not noticed before, and she seemed to be
carrying something under her cloak. I fancy they went out that
way because they did not like to trouble that obliging young con-
stable a second time, which was a pity, because, as it happened, he
was in front of the house at that very moment. His beat had brought
him round there a second time, and he could not help stopping to
glance up once more at the windows, where there was no longer any
fight to be seen. I heard him sigh and hum a little snatch of a song,
rather out of tune, as he went clumping on his round, for it is quite
a mistake to suppose that there is less human nature in policemen
than in other people. And this was a very young policeman, too."

parts of the building there are numerous examples of figures and
animals on newels of staircases and tops of pedestals " both with and

Rather a rude question as it stands ; but nothing particular meant;
only Campbell's pretty way. Plunket came back to table ; waited
for uproar to subside, then, nodding and smiling pleasantly at Sir
George, said, "I am not responsible for the fearful creatures either
in Westminster Hall or in this House."
Bolt went straight home; Campbf.ll wriggled up, nervously
nursing his expressive right knee; House roared with delighted
laughter; Campbell concluded that, on the whole, had perhaps
better not interpose when Plunket in the lists.
After this, House prepared itself for another evening with Scotch
Members. Adjourned debate on Local Government Kill down as
first Order; just when majority of Members were preparing to rush
out, and air of resignation stealing over faces of Lord Advocate and
Ritchie, who must needs remain in place, Irish Members bunt in;
raised debate on Luggacurran Evictions. O'Brien's first appearance
since release from prison. Once more face to face with Balfour. A
striking contrast the two men, gaoler and prisoner; the one fair,
debonnaire, smiling, reclining with languid grace on the Treasury
Bench; the other standing upright with clenched fist, set lips, pale
face, flashing eyes, hoarse, passionate voice. Shut up for weeks and
months, and now all the long-pent stream of wrath dashed down-
ward like a cataract. Balfour bore it pretty well. Talk went on
to dinner-time; then Division, and Scotch business began.
Business done.—More Scotch debate.
Tuesday.—Tim's hack again. Been for some time in Ireland
attending to his own business. Now comes to Westminster to look
after nation's. No opportunity for not
knowing Tim Healy is in House when he
once puts in an appearance. As George
Curzon says, "his voice is heard through
rolling drums, that beat to battle where he
stands." Gave Home Secretary a genuine
start, by suddenly appealing to Speaker on
matter of order, touching little dinner-
5arty Matthews gave on Saturday. What
im really wanted was opportunity of publicly
hitting out at Rowland Blennerhasset,
whose name cropped up before Special Com-
mission as having subscribed certain sums
of money for dispensation by an energetic
searcher after truth. Blennerhasset, other-
wise of retiring disposition, takes no part in
public affairs: Tim longing to give him
an Oliver for his Rowland. Difficulty how
to do it? Chance unconsoiously provided by
innocent Home Secretary. Gave customary
dinner in honour of Queen's Birthday;
invited among other friends the Judges on
Special Commission and Blennerhasset.
Here was Tim's opportunity. Used it with
superb gravity. Called Speaker's attention
to fact that, in addition to three Judges, one
of the guests was Sir Rowland Blenner-
hasset, "a person implicated in the Pigott
forgeries."
That was what Tim wanted to say. In
order to say it, framed question to Speaker,
over House and its precincts? Speaker obliged to answer, with
equal gravity, that he had no control over gentlemen who came to
dinner within precincts of House. Tim much obliged for reply, and
business proceeded.
"Wasn't sure at first I could manage it, Toby, dear boy," Tim
said, his honest face suffused with satisfaction. "But you see 1
managed it. Suppose I had got up in my place and said, 'Sir
Rowland Blennerhasset is a person implicated in the Pigott
forgeries'; there womld have been an awful uproar; I should have
been out of order; Speaker would have been down on me; perhaps
I would have been 1 named'; and then where would I have been?
But, you see, I wrap it up in a question, fire it off accidentally as
as it were, the boys cheer and the thing's done. Apart from Blenner-
hasset, quite worth while doing to see how frightened Matthews
was when I alluded to him. For a bit of real sport, if you know
how to manage it, give me the House of Commons.
Business done.—Vote on Acoount taken.
Thursday.—Since Plunket flashed fwth his answer to George
Campbell the other night about " fearful creatures" in and out of
House, has been a marked tendency on part of Ministers to sparkle
at Question Time. Home Secretary tried it to-night with George
Campbell again for subject. It seems that George, talcing his
walks abroad, has exclusively enjoyed spectacle of cabs running over
citizens. Would appear that, walking down from Soutnwell

Tim's back,
as to who had control
Gardens to Westminster, scarcely a turning at which he did net
come upon man, woman, or child under the hoofs of a ruthless eab-
horse. Lived in India some time; Juggernaut nothing to it. Home
Secretary sits with arms folded, legs crossed, his face suffused with
highly cultivated aspect of incredulity.
Are the police to stand by," Campbell insists, "and see cabs
come up and knock persons down without interference or remon-
strance P Will the Right Hon. Gentleman take up the subject?"
No human impulse more natural, even in a Home Secretary, than
to take up a subject if he accidentally finds it knocked down by a cab
at a street corner. But Matthews a lawyer, accustomed to
quibbles.
"There is," he replied, "a statute in force. What handle is
there, then, for taking up the subject P"
This posed Campbell; not prepared for that way of looking at it.
Time might come, if this sort of thing went unchecked, that no father
of a family would go out in London streets without first providing
himself with a handle by which he might be picked up when
knocked down by a cab. That time not yet arrived. Home Secre-
tary, took base advantage; House rudely laughed; Campbell
temporarily subsided.
Other answer was from Arthur Balfour. Questioned as to sale
of lands in Ulster by London Companies, he said Charles Lewis
had Motion on paper, which referred to subject; when it came on
would discuss it.
"But," said Clancy, "Suppose this Motion never comes on;
what does the Right Hon. Gentleman propose to do?"
"When that eventuality occurs," said Balfour, "I shall be
ready to answer the question."
A pretty answer this, imbued with the spirit of Philosophic Doubt.
No one knows whether he quite meant what he said, or whether he
accidentally stumbled on this deliciously round-about way of saying
he would never answer question. Crowded House sat for a moment
puzzled and silent; then there was a titter, ending in a roar of
laughter: in which Arthur blushingly joined.
Business done.— Scotch Local Government Bill read Second Time.
Friday.—Scotch business in the morning, Indian in the evening.
The morning and the evening a dull day.
LA VIE A LA ROOSE.
The art of prolonging life being, of course, a most interesting
subject to everybody. Dr. Robson Roose who is always " up to date,
deals with it in the Fortnightly for this month—still ably conducted
by the open and frank Harris (not Druriolanus of that flk)—and
treats his subject as well as he treats his patients, which is saying a
great deal, but not too much. Here are some notes arising out of a
careful perusal of his article which may be of use to him on a future
occasion, should he resume the subject.
1. —Question. Are men or women the longer lived? Answer. We
have all heard of Old Parr, but never of Old Ma. Perhaps one reason
is that any allusion to a lady's age is considered impolite.
2. —Q. How to prolong life ?—A. Live above Parr.
3. — Q. "Three-score and ten" is "accepted," says Dr. R. R,
pretty generally." Are musicians long-lived 'i—A. Yes, as a rule,
because they live after they have completed several scores.
4. — Q. Is there any Longevity Association to which we can
belong P— A. The Eighty Club is the nearest approaoh to it.
>.— Q. Is there anyone now living who was alive four centuries
ago ?—A. Certainly. Four centuries ago were the Middle Ages. A
number of middle-aged people strll exist. .*. This is a fact which,
strangely enough, has escaped the Doctor's notice.
6. —Q. The Doctor recounts how one old woman, who never
washed, but rubbed her face with lard, lived to 106. What rank in
life was she?—A. We should say she must have been addressed as
"Miladi."
7. —Q. The Doctor is against " tricycling" for old men. Why ?—
A. Doctor is wrong here. For an old man who has completed one
cycle, to go on to two cycles and up to three, cannot do him any
possible harm. He will be a hale and hearty Tricyclinarian.
8. —Q. Dr. Parker is quoted as recommending rice to old persons
bcoause of the starch in it. Would not a diet of nice white ties fresh
from the washerwoman's do equally as wellP—A. Yes. The dish
could be included in the vegetarian list, and called white arti-
choke™.
'.—Q. Rest is absolutely necessary. Can you suggest a form of
diet or exercise, or both, which will economise time by including
simultaneous rest P—A. Certainly. Go to a fishmonger s and take
forty 'winks. As for exercise; quiet games are good, therefore " Go
Nap" as often as possible. **>Si_f" " - '^P
Finally, Mr. Punch presents his compliments to Dr. R. R. and
repeats Pip Van Winkle's salutation, " Here's your health, and your
family's, and may you live long and brosber 1"

So brilliant—and so easy.
Mr. Judge P-nch (to Lord S.). Well, my Lord,
Even a Judge impartial can afford
Congratulations upon such a win.
Naval Defence was certainly well in.
Rather on the small side, perhaps; not quite
The shape and size of one in the first flight
Of equine heroes; still he quite out strode
Anything that the other jockeys rode;
And romped in every incn a winner.
LordS-l-sb-ry. Tes!
Yet we were scarcely cocksure of success.
The horse had not filled out as some expected.
Ix>rd Charles, for instance, fancied he detected
Weediness and a slight peacocky action,
Nor did I feel the fullest satisfaction
With H-m-lt-n's peculiar style of riding.
Which sometimes checks a horse at its full striding.
He's not an Archer, Georgte,—but no matter!
Fancy this victory is like to shatter
The other Stable's prospects for the season.
What can they do,—unless they trot out Treason?
And he is stale and short of work. Of course
They may possess the gteat dark Irish horse
They magnify mysteriously. If so,

Mr. G-sch-n (hugging himself). But for the expense
I rather like this union of Stables.
Our champion anyhow has turned the tables
Upon the Hawarden-cum-Hibernia lot.
Gl-dst-ne does look as though he'd caught it hot,

Although the Stable did not quite behave aright,
According to my notion. Only fault
I find with them is that they seemed to halt.

But I maintain they should have had more on him! [T-eft arguing.

ROBERT ON THE DARBY.
Ah, there was a time when I looked forrard for the Darby for
remember thinking last year that it was about the stickyest place
when wet and the dustyest place when dry as 'ever I seed. I don't
remember as I used to care much about them little suckumstances
years ago, but I spose as we gits more partickler the more older we
grows. In the second place,—which by-the-by is ginerally where
my favorit horse finds hisself at the hend of the race—I had sitch a
dose of bad luck last year that I was afeard of repeating it. I didn't
care about telling my sad tail at the time, coz I finds as one never gits
no simpathy on sitch sad. ocasions bnt rayther plenty of chart and
plenty of reticule, but as it's now a hole year ago, I plucks up my
currage and speaks out like a man.
Well then, I had larst year, thro a sporting frend of mine, the
werry stratest of strate tips, and, what's remarkable strange, it
come off all rite. I lade no less than one golden suwerain to three
on the favorit and another golden suwerain to six on another favorit,
and my fust favorit won and the second lost, so I was the appy
winner of two pound sterling. So in the pride of my art I took
off Browh to Mr. Careless s Dinner Booth and stood treat to a
helegant reparst of cold foul, and am, and sallad, and beer, and
thorowly we both enjoyed it, speshally me with my winnins a sing-
ling in my pocket, as it were. We then set off to find my 2 betting-
book makers, and there was my winning better in Mb usual place,
and he smiled as he seed me a passing hy, and said, "Better luck
next time, Sir; you can't alius win." To which I replied in my off-
and manner, "Oh, suttenly not." Thinking to myself, "Ah, he
little nose wot a stroke of luck I' ve had!"
Presently I turns to my other betting book-maker's place—but
"Oh what a site met my view!" as the poet says. There had evi-
dently been some little misunderstandin, for the hole place was a
Sirfeek reck! On inquiring of a werry remarkabel savage-looking
ent a standing by, what it all meant, he told me the werry start-
ling intelligence that the book-maker with who I had made my large
winning-bet having lost a great deal more money than he cood
posserbly pay, had been conwicted of being a mere swindling Welch-
man, insted of 'a honest Inglishman, as ewerybody had thort him to
be, and so had bin chivied off the Course by a angry mob of his
customers, who all discovered as they was all rayther large loosers,
insted of werry large winners, as they had all fondly hoped as they
was I Wot a dishcovery for a poor Waiter, who, after going
through all the hagony of the prewious two ours, and all the dredful
xcitement of the acsnal five minets, finds hisself proclaimed by the
Humpire as a prowd winner, and then, when he cum s for his farely
wun money, insted of receiving back his one golden suwerain as he
had laid, and his three golden suwerains as he had won, finds hisself
defrauded of all four by a swindling Welshman, and has to seek his
disconsolate home a looser of two pounds sterling, insted of a winner
of the same respectabel sum. I don't beleeve as all Welshmen can
be alike in this respect, for it does so happen as my own Mother was
wun, and in course she produced me, which is a pritty good proof of
what I says, for I am not ony pussonally the wery Sole of Honner,
but I regards cheating with the werry heels of contempt.
I took care to keep my true story a secret larst year, being rayther
ashamed of it, if the plane truth must be spoke; but as the Poet
says, "Distance takes the sting from out the view," and my
xperience may prove a holesome warning to other Noble Sportsmen,
like myself, and then my four lovely golden suwerains will not have
been all together lost in wane: though I suttenly. do hope as the
werry next xampel will be kindly purwided by sum one jest a lectio
more abel to afford that sumwnat xpensive luxury, than a mere
umbel Waiter, tho' he does happen for to be a Hed 'un.
It must be a werry nice thing for to be abel to set a good xampel,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"LE CRICQUETTE"
How he will be played—shortly.
Monsieub, Offices of the Athletic Congress, Paris.
I &m overwhelmed with my gratitude to you and to the
generous dignitaries, the Chanoellors of your Universities, the Heads
of your great Public Seminaries and the Principal of your renowned
Mary-le-bone College Club
r~> urn for the information they have
!\ '}JI ^ 'W^st^ given me concerning "Le
•;- >^ Cricquette," your unique
National game, and 1 thank
you in the name of my Com-
mittee for your present of im-
plements,—les wickettes, le
bottled* canon, les gros bois
(the batsman's weapons), le
cuirasse pour les jambes de Longstoppe, and other necessaries for the
dangers of the contest that you have so kindly forwarded for our
inspection. But most of all are we indebted to you for sending over
a 'ome team of your brave professionals to play thematoh against our
Parisian "onze," for you rightly conjectured that by our experience
of the formidable game in action, we should be able to judge of its
risks and dangers, and after mature investigation be able so to revise
and ameliorate the manner of its playing as to bring it into har-
mony with the taste and feeling of the athletic ambition of the rising
generation of our young France.
A Match has taken place as you will see by "Le Score" sub
joined, which I enclose for your inspection. It was not without its
fruits. It disclosed to us, as you will remark, by referring to
"Le Score" very practically the dangerous, and I must add, the
murderous capabilities that "Le Cricquette ' manifestly possesses.
Our Revising Committee has already the matter in hand, and when
their report is fully drawn up, I shall have much satisfaction in
forwarding it to you. Meantime, I may say, that the substitution
of a light Large ball of silk, or some other soft material for the deadly
"boule de canon" as used by your countrymen, has been decided
upon as absolutely necessary to deprive the game of barbarism, and
harmonise it with the instincts which Modern and Republican France
associates with the pursuit of a harmless pastime. Les wickettes,
as being too small for the Bowlsman to reach them, should be raised
to six feet high, and the Umpire, a grave anomaly in a game
cherished by a liberty-loving people, should be instantly suppressed.
The "overre" too, should consist of sixteen balls. But this and
many other matters are under the consideration of the Committee.
I now, subjoin "Le Soore" I mentioned, a brief perusal of it will
show you what excellent grounds the Committee nave for making
the humanising alterations at which I have hinted.
ALL FRANCE v. AN ENGLISH 'OME-TEA.M.
All France.
M. de Boissr (struck with murderous force on the front of his fore-
head by the boule de canon, and obliged to retire), b. Jones-
Johnson .0
M. Nat/din (hit on his fingers, which are pinched blue with the
boule de canon, and incapacitated), b. Jones-Johnson ■ . 0
Le Marquis de Carotisfx (receives a blow from the boule de canon
on the front bone of his leg, and is compelled to relinquish the
contest), b. Jones-Johnson 0
M. Busson (receives a severe contusion of the cheek-bone from the
boule de canon, whioh is delivered with murderous intent by a
swift " round-and bowlsman"), b. Jones-Johnson1. . .0
Lo General Grkx (hits his three wickettes into the air, in a
daring attempt to stop the boule de canon with his batsman'B
club), b. Jones-Johnson ........ 0
Le Duo de Septfaces (has his pince-nez shattered to atoms by the
boule de canon, and, being unable to see, withdraws from the
"innings"), b. Jones-Johnson 0
M. Carillon, M. le Docteur Giroflk, Le Professeur d'Equitation
(all the three being given, in turn, "out, legs in front of the
wickette," leave the ground to arrange a duel with the Umpire),
b. Jones-Johnson 0
M. de Montmorency (on reaching the wickette and seeing the
terrible approach of the boule de canon, has a shivering fit
which obliges him to sit down), b. Jones-Johnson . . .0
M. Jolibois, coming in last, triumphantly avoids the "overre,"
and is, in consequence, not out.
The English 'Ome-Team.
Jones-Johnson, not out .... 3276
Brown-Smith, not out .... 3065
So the game stood at the end of the fifth day, when, spite all the"
efforts of All France," even to the putting on of three " Bowlsmen"
at onoe, it was fonnd impossible to take even one of the " 'Ome-team"
wickettes. Yet the contest was maintained by the "Out-side" with
a wonderful heroism and elan, for though by degrees, in nobly
attempting to stop the flight of the boule de canon as it sped on its
murderous course, driven by the furious and savage blows of the
batsmen in all directions over the field, the fieldsmen, one by one,
struck in the arms, legs, head, and back, began to grow feeble under
their unceasing blows and contusions, still one and all from the
"Long-leg-off to the indomitable "Longstoppe," faced the
dangers of their situation with a proud smile, indicative of the noble
calm of an admirable spirit. So, Monsieur, the game, which was
not finished, and whioh, in consequence, the Umpire, with a
chivalrous generosity, announced as "drawn," came to its conclu-
sion. You will understand, from the perusal of the above, the
direction in whioh my Committee will be likely to modify the rules
of the game, and simplify the apparatus for playing it, so as to give
your "Criquette" a chance of finding itself permanently acclima-
tised in this country.
Accept, Monsieur, the assurance of my most distinguished
consideration.
The Secretary of the Paris Athletic Congress.
COUNTY-COUNCILDOM.
{From the Vote-Book of Mr. Punch's Young Man.)
May 2~th.—It is with regret that I find myself once more in the
Council Chamber, where I nave listened to so many dreary debates.
I had hoped that I should have been able to give the London County
Councillors a long rest. But Fate, represented by that distinguished
warrior, Colonel Howard Vincent (late Lieut. Royal Welsh
Fusiliers), has decided against it. There is a large assembly present,
all more or less politely thirsting for the gallant Colonel-Lieu-
tenant's blood. I regret to say that the hero does not look very
heroic. He is dressed in mufti, which is unnecessary, as he might
have made quite an effective costume out of his (so to speak) Official
Wardrobe. Surely he could have found in it a Barrister's wig, a
Fusilier's bearskin, a Berkshire Militiaman'B sword-belt and sash, a
Constable's staff, a Central London Ranger's overalls, a Queen's
Westminster pair of gaiters, and the Mess jacket and vest (now,
perhaps, a trifle small) of a Sandhurst Cadet. Over this tasty
combination-uniform the gallant Colonel-Lieutenant might have
worn his badge of the Bath, in addition to the stars proper to a
Knight of the Crown of Italy and the German Crown. As it is, the
hero, in spite of the extreme intelligence whioh habitually charac-
terises his highly intellectual features, seems a trifle insignificant.
"Mister" Rosebery, whose wrongs are too deep for words—has he
not wandered about, looking unsuccessfully for fire-engines, and the
Prince and Princess of Wales on the previous Saturday ["—coldly
calls upon the Colonel-Lieutenant to rise in his place.
Then the hero makes a statement, whioh clearly proves that he
does not know—in spite of his career at Sandhurst, his service in the
Royal Welsh Fusiliers, his appointment to the Royal_ Berkshire
Militia, his command in the Rangers and Queen's Westminsters, his
call to the Bar, his Directorship of Criminal Investigations, and his
entrance to the Paris Faculte de Droit—how to occupy ground to
keep a spaoe clear for the manoeuvring of troops. Immediately the
gallant Colonel-Lieutenant sits down, Sir Walter de Socza (a
gentleman who, according to Dod, was knighted in recognition of
is charity), moves a vote of censure, which is seconded "with
pleasure," by Whiteley's Rival, Mr. Barker. Then, after some
eloquenoe that appropriately may be styled Rotton. Mr. Probyn
(Captain and chemist) rushes to the assistance of nis chief, and
explains, in tones of thunder, what happened in his "immediate
front." Upon this Mr. Boulnois (practically "the Pride of Maryle-
bone and its Neighbourhood ") moves that the Council shall proceed
to the next business. A division follows, and the numbers are equal.
"Mister" Rosebery is asked to give a casting vote, but possibly
remembering a walk through a crowd of roughs with two little
children in kilts on either side of him, promptly refuses. Then
comes a division, and the Colonel-Lieutenant, by a Majority of five,
is " saved—saved—saved " from censure!
Upon this, Earl Compton (who I fear the Patriot Burns would not
consider on this occasion quite so unbloated as usual) asks whether
the Council intends to apologise to their Royal Highnesses the
Prince and Princess of Wales. This is too much for the refined
and popular Representative of Battersea and Clapham, who, in
silvery accents, intimates his intention, if suoh a resolution be put,
of moving an amendment to it. But "Mister" Rosebery inter-
poses, and declares the incident at an end. It being now decided that
the gallant, learned, and Foreign-Knightly Colonel-Lieutenant is
not (at any rate for the moment] to be either executed on Tower
Hill, or confined in the deepest dungeon beneath the Castle's moat,
the proceedings became comparatively uninteresting. So I leave the
County Councillors to their own devices (which, by the way, include
a design for the Common Seal, which has merited "Mister" Rose-
bery's recommendation) until their labours are suspended for a
season by the approach of the Whitsuntide Recess.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S MODEL MUSIC-HALL SONGS.
No. V.—The Amatory Episodic.
The history of a Singer's latest love—whether fortunate or other-
wise—will always command the interest and attention of a Music-Hall
audience. Our example, which is founded upon the very best
precedents, derives an additional piquanoy from the social position
of the beloved object. Cultivated readers are requested not to
shudder at the rhymes. Mr. Punch's Poet does them deliberately
and in cold blood, being convinced that without these somewhat
daring conoords, no ditty would have the slightest chance of satisfy-
in? the great ear of the Music-Hall public.
The title of the Song is:—
MASHED BY A MARCHIONESS.
The Singer should come on correctly and tastefully attired in a suit
of loud dittoes, a startling tie, and a while "pot" hat—the
orthodox costume [on the Music-Hail stage) of a middle-class
swain suffering from love-sickness. The air should be of the
conventional jog-trot and jingle order, chastened by a sentimental
melancholy.
I 've lately gone and lost my 'art—and where you'll never gueBs—
I'm regularly mashed upon a lovely Marchioness 1
'Twas at a Fancy Fair we met, inside the Albert 'AH;
So affable she smiled at me as I oame near her stall!
Chorus—Don't tell me Belgravia is stiff in behaviour!
She'd an Uncle an Earl, and a Dook for her Pa—
Still there was no starchiness in that fair Marchioness,
As she stood at her stall in the Fancy Bazaar!
At titles and distinctions onoe I 'd ignorantly scoff,
As if no bond could be betwixt the Tradesman and the Toff!
I held with those who'd do away with difference in ranks—
But that was all before I met the Marohioness of Manx!
Chorus—Don't tell me Belgravia, &c.
A Home was being started by some kind aristo-crate,
For orphan kittens, born of poor, but well-connected, cats;
And or the swells who planned a Fete this object to assist.
The Marchioness of Manx's name stood foremost on the list.
Chorus—Don't tell mc Belgravia, &c.
I never saw a smarter hand at serving in a shop,
For every likely customer she caught upon the 'op!
And from the form her Ladyship displayed at that Bazaar,
(With enthusiasm)—You might have took your oath she'd been
brought up behind a bar!
Chorus—Don't tell me Belgravia, &c.
In vain I tried to kid her that my purse had been forgot,
She spotted me in 'alf a iiff, and chaffed me precious hot!
A sov. for one regaliar she gammoned me to spend.
"You reallv can t refuse," she said, "I've bitten olf the end!"
Chorus—Don't tell me Belgravia, &o.
"Do buy my crewel-work," she urged, "it goes across a chair,
You'll hnd it come in useful, as I see you 'ile your 'air!"
So I 'anded over thirty bob, though not a coiny bloke.
I couldn't tell a Marchioness how nearly I was broke!
Spoken—Though I did take the liberty of saying: "Make it fifteen
bob, my Lady! But she said, with such a fascinating look—I can
see it yet!—"Oh, I'm sure you 'ro not a 'aggling kind of a man,"
she says, "you haven't the face for it. And think of all them pore
fatherless kittings," she says; "think what thirty bob means to
them!" says she, glancing up so pitiful and tender under her long
eyelashes at me. Ah, the Radicals may talk as they like, but
Chorus—Don't tell me Belgravia, &o.
A rattle was the next concern I put my rhino in:
The prize a talking parrot, which I didn't want to win.
Then her sister, Lady Taisiiy, showed a painted milking stool,
And I bought it—though it's not a thin? I sit on as a rule.
Spoken—Not but what it was a handsome article in its way, too,
—had a snow-scene with a sunset done in oil on it. "It will look
lovely in your chambers," says the Marchioness; "it was ever so
much admired at Catterwall Castle!" It didn't look so bad in my
three-pair back, I must say, though unfortunately the sunset came
off on me the very first time I happened to set down on it. Still
think of the condescension of painting such a thing at all!
Chorus—Don't teU me Belgravia, &c.
The Marquis kept a-fldgeting and frowning at his wife.
For she talked to me as free as if she'd known me all my life!
I felt that I was in the swim, so wasn't over-awed,
Bnt 'ung about and spent my cash as lavish as a lord!
Spoken—It was worth all the money, I can tell you, to be chatting
there across the counter with a real live Marchioness for as long as
ever my funds would 'old out. They'd have held out much longer,
only the Marchioness made it a rule never to give change — she
couldn't break it, she said, not even for me. I wish I could give
you an idea of how she smiled as she made that remark; for the
fact is, when an aristocrat does unbend-well, ■
Chorus—Don't tell me Belgravia, 4c.
Next time I meet the Marchioness a-riding in the Row,
I Ml ketch her eye and raise my 'at, and up to her I '11 go,
(llith sentiment\—And tell her next my 'art I keep tie stump of
She told me on the 'appy day we 'ad at her Bazaar! [that cigar
Spoken—And she '11 be pleased to see me again, I know! She's
mistake about it,
who don't know
_ always say :—
Chorus—Don't tell me Belgravia is stiff in behaviour, &c.

A CASTLE IN SPAIN AT WEST KENSINGTON.
Lea vino the Sunny South, where the ohesnut-treeg blossom, and
the Alhambra, with its thousand lights, bounding brothers and
brilliant signorita* playing on their gay oigarettes, basks in the
golden land of Leicestero El Squaro, I
came to West Kensington. I had been
asked—O nommo del tobacco.'—to be
present at the inauguration of the Spanish
Exhibition. Had I my wish, I would
have preferred to have watched Toreador
as, singing on the boards of a Theatro el
Gusarrisso, he expressed his Italian con-
tento. But, out of a feeling of haughty
nationality—for we sons of the due South
are as proud as the eagles who peck at our
sherry-giving grapes—I thought it my
duty to support the great show of the
products of my native land. I was greeted
at the Welcome Club (an Institution that
reminded me not a little of Madrid and
Barcelona, combined with a dash of
El Dorado, and summits of the merry
Pyrenees), and was regaled with some of the
dishes of my own dear land. Many of these were accompanied by a
vegetable called El potato, which I found to be simply excellent.
But enough of this. Let me paint a picture of the great Spanish
Exhibition—a pioturc that has never had its equal.
Imagine an enormous Arcade filled with every possible production
of Spain. Imagine thousands and thousands of gaily decked booths
erected for the sole purpose of exploiting the merits of Spanish
Liquorice. Imagine again thousands and thousands of beautiful
counters groaning under the weight of a wealth of Spanish onions—
onions so good, so strong, that they draw tears from the eyes of
myriads of pleasure-seekers! Imagine tambourines, and tomatoes,
and olives! Imagine all this, and you still have but the faintest im-
pression of the real contents of the Spanish Exhibition.
Imagine a fleet of Spanish boats, that would create surprise even
on the silvery bosom of the gentle Guadalquivir. Imagine an
enormous magazine of arms, with blades from Toledo, and old
armour from the Btores of the street known as El Wardour.
Imagine onco again, pictures of the most startling magnificence.
Imagine Vandyck at his best, and Velasquez at his more than best,
to say nothing of Pears El Soapo in the more inspired of his
publioity-seeking moments! Imagine all this, and throw in more—
such as local colouring and poetio sentiment—and yet you have not
quite got the Spanish Exhibition!
Imagine a bull-fight. Imagine the Matadors and the gaily-
dressed Cavaliers of the Circus. Imagine Spanish music of the most
admirable kind, headed by the Bando El Gardo, conducted by Lieu-
tenant Dan el Godfkeydo. Imagine the original Electric Light
discovered by Cor.UMiius, ages before gas was invented by Gasco de
Gama. Imagine a fairy scene of wonderment and delight, with its
gay lamps and illuminations, resembling El Yauxhallo de Cremorna.
Imagine every possible distraction—theatres, oonoerts, cuts from
the joint, drinks, dioramas, and earthquakes of Lisbon—and yet you
have not imagined everything. Fancy picture galleries miles long,
conservatories full of tne choicest plants, lakes without equal at
Windermere or Switzerland, and mountains that resemble as little
Primrose Hill as they do the Alps.
Imagine all this, and much more (or less), and you yet have to
imagine the contents of the Spanish Exhibition!

Wedding of the Comte and Comtesse de Pabis. Many of the visitors
were there for the first time, "not in a pays de connaissance,"
observed the witty and venerable Marquis de Viecx-Calemboub,
"for it might as well have been Vn Voyage en Sheen."

LADIES AND LOGIC.
Lady Hardman, Hon. Secretary of the
Ladies' Grand Council of the Primrose
League, speaking at the annual meeting of
the Upminster Habitation,— is reported to
have said, that "not for the wealth of all
the Indies would she consent to enter into
public life and political strife." This savours
strongly of the "self-denying ordinance."
Only one wonders in that case what are the
functions of the Primrose League, which, if
it does not enter into "political strife," has
certainly been undeservedly complimented
by Grand-Master Salisbury, and others.
Lady Hardman "trusted that the Dames of
the Primrose League would never be con-
fused in their minds with those ladies who
entered into contested elections and mingled
themselves in the strife of Party politics."
(Applause.) Contested elections! Party
politics! Dear, dear, and the world had
been supposing that the Primrose League
was a Conservative organisation, and that
its Dames were remarkably active in canvas-
sing and its kindred duties at election times!
Oh, what a surprise! Perhaps, after all, the
lady-beloved League, with its 800,000
members, its Habitations, its badges, its
Tory flatterers and Radical defamers, is only
a great pastoral association for the culture
of Primroses!
A little later, however, Lady Hardman
seems—mark, Punch only says seems !—to let
the political cat out of the Primrose bag.
"The League was an educational movement,
designed to counteract the inaccuracies—if
they liked to use a stronger word she should
not object—of the other side." The other
side! Why that spoils it alL Arcadia vanishes
at once, and the Primrose path becomes a party-
road instanter. The trail of the Cauous is over
it all. "The Knights of the Primrose League
had to fight, not with the lance of the olden
time, but with the poisoned darts of gross in-
accuracies and misrepresentation. This
sounds equivocal,—but let that pass. Only is
there no "political strife," no party mili-
tancy here? What more could a Lady of the
naughty Liberal Federation itself do? Alas
for the pastoral peace!'ulness of the Primrosers!
The League may be "an educational move-
ment," but hardly in the direction of teaching
logic to ladies.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A Menace to " La Pertide Albiou.''
TO CALAIS AND BACK BY PEN AND PENCIL.
Mb. Punch, the Most Respected,
When I told you how I wished to see the beautiful France,
to inaugurate the harbour of Calais, you replied, "Do so, Barkins."
When I said I was an exile from a country I We like a mother—
0 my female parent! —
that were I to return (to
music), I should be arrested,
and perhaps (oh, horrible!)
be expelled I you suggested,
"Then why not go in dis-
guise P" It was a grand
idea! I love all that is of
the theatre! Still I hesi-
tated! I questioned you
once again. "What dis-
guise P Once more you
were ready with an answer
—" You might go as a
Member of the Punch
Staff." I trembled! How
could I undertake such a task—such a responsibility? You continued
—" You will find it easy enough—you are already considered comic."
So I started. I was full of amusing anecdotes (ancient and
modern), and wore my best smile. We left the Victoria Station at
half-past eight—our train carrying a most distinguished freight.
There were nigh Government officials and authors, but, above all,
there were those admirable gentlemen, the Commander-in-Chief of
the Continental Traffic, and the Secretary of State for London,
Chatham, and Dover Affairs. As we passed the various stations,
en route, I fancy I noticed the pointsmen tremble with emotion as
they reoognised. us. I motioned to them not to leave their work—
to cheer us—as I considered that a display of good-will at such
a time, although deeply gratifying, might cause an accident.
On our arrival at Dover, we were conducted, with every sign
of rejoicing, to the Calais-Douvres. This is the magnificent new
steamer of the L. C. & D. It., and worthily replaces its namesake,
the wonderful Siamese twin-vessel that, it will be remembered, was
always at the service of passengers subject to mal de mer— except
in rough weather! In rough weather the old Calais-Douvres very
wisely remained at home. Our voyage was uneventful. Amongst
our number on board was a distinguished Member of the House of
Peers, who by an oversight had neglected to bring his robes with
him (he had. even forgotten the box containing his travelling coronet!)
and who, consequently elected to keep in the background. I felt,
that my countrymen would pardon this noble self-effacement—when
they understood that of course Englishmen cannot forget that the
loss of Calais caused the gravest regret to an illustrious ancestress
of Her present Majesty.. The commemoration of the French Revolu-
tion cannot be officially recognised, nor can the cession of Calais by
England to France!
As the Calais-Douvres reached its destination (in admirable time)

The President Visits the Bight of Watcrlow.
my heart increased its pulsations. I nearly fainted with emotion as
I noticed there was a new buffet. Would it be safe to land? I would
risk it! As the Representative of the noblest form of Literature, I
was soon eating and drinking all that was of the best. Fearing
to be recognised (although my proceedings did not appear to cause
surprise) I returned on board shortly after the dejeuner, and awaited
the visit of the President. But first, we had a procession. It was
led by a dispatch-boat ocoupied iby M. Cabnot, and followed by a
second dispatch-boat, then came some torpedo vessels (representing
the French Navy) then sample vessels from the Railway Companies.
One of the latter—the Albert Victor belonging to the S. E. R.—
seemed to me to get out of hand and would stroke the quay with her
paddle-box. I could not see those on board, but felt intuitively
that this [proceeding must have given great delight to Sir Edwabd
and his ever genial colleague S' Mtles—I beg pardon, I should say
8ir Mtles. As the President passed, there was a little cheering,
which sounded to me as if it came from British throats. We watched
the procession as it disappeared, and then after an hour's pause we
noticed a crowd approaching. It was headed by M. Cabnot. After
a careful (and probably exhaustive) inspection of the resources of
the new Railway Station, the crowd emerged from a waiting-room,
and made for the Calais-Douvres. This was the supreme moment
of my day! The President (such a President! not even in a cocked
hat and on foot.') attended by his Generals (such Generals!—were I
at the Bureau de la Guerre I would but stay, I must dissemble),
came on board. Sir Sydney Wateblow, the D. C. of the L. C. &
D. R., received him. Mr. William Fobbes bowed. I who speak to
you, concealed my face! I smiled grimly as I saw M. Cabnot
shudder and grow paler than ever, as he noticed the preparations
in some of the cabins for what you call " dirty weather." Ah! this
President! he is no sailor! His suite were dressed de rigueur—
fibus, evening clothes, and an umbrella! He did not recognise me!
hen I remembered that I was hidden in the personality of a
member of the Staff of Punch, and laughed! Who would not laugh
at such a sight? The pro- ^
cession—the President, the
Generals (such Generals!),
the bouquet-bearer (such a
bouquet!), the gentilhommes
in evening dress (such even-
ing dress!) — once more,
vanished. I was not known
—I was not denounced! I
was Baved!
In the evening I assisted
at the Banquet. It was
very good. A dream—not
followed by a nightmare!
Is there more to tell? No,
I think not—save to say
that I returned in perfect safety to England. And yet I must add
this: In spite of the necessity of concealing my identity; in spite
of whatever may have been the blandishments of that grand old
farceur, Sir Wilfbid Lawson (who was on board the Calais-
Douvres); in spite of the disappointment of not having the
opportunity of choosing a second horse at a circus—I did not return
disguised in liquor! Accept my consideration the most distinguished,
The Bbav' General.
[Wo are a little surprised at the above communication, as we havo no
recollection of asking any foreigner to represent us at the inauguration of the
Calais Harbour. We wero under the impression that the gentleman who
accepted the post of "Our Special Commissioner" (and whose handwriting,
although rather shaky, strangely resembles that of our unknown Correspon-
dent) was British born. It is right to add that wc arc told, on what seems
to us to be good authority, that this individual did not return by the Calais-
Douvres. It is said that, having attempted to dance (under the inspiration
of the moment) the " Pas de Calais " at the Ball following the Banquet, he
was promptly removed, and, through the kindness of the Authorities, was
subsequently provided, free of expense, with an apartment in that well-
known hostelry, the HAtel do Ville. We still await from him an explanation
of what appears to be a mystery.—Ed.]

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
At Westminster flattered, and cheered in the City.
A ohange has now come o'er the scene; more's the pity!
The swells have cooled down and the cits have called on,
And Royal Dukes snub, and press-pessimists scoff;
And he who John Bull from Conscription's harsh grip
To save on the cheap—cannot get his equipment! [meant
Shame, John! Your bad faith has become more than
Punic,
If your Volunteer guards lack great-coat, mess-tin, tunic
Your young "Dogs of War" without war-kits? Absurd I
If they cannot supply 'em, you should " like a bird."
Well, here's good Lord Mayor Whitehead now gives
you the chance!
And you 're not the old John if you do not advance
At the double to back him, and hang the expense!
For neglecting this form of the Nation's Defence,
The cheapest all round, you can have no excuse.
It should not have been left to him, but there' s small use
In harping on that, you deserve the same raillery,
As when for your National Portraits a Qallery
Had to be furnished by private munificence.
But that you should open your purse in a jiffy, sense
Patriotism and pride must dictate,
And he giveth twice who gives early, not late.
To arm, or equip, the young Sought of the Rifle,
Is clearly your duty; 'twill cost but a trifle
Compared with the sums which you freely disburse
Every year from your big, almost bottomless purse,
For what was once called—you remember the day,
That 'tis equally true at this hour, Punch won't say—
"An army of lions, led on by jackasses."
Volunteering's now shirked Dy the well-to-do classes;
They tell us. The asses must go, if they will,
But the stalwart young lions who stick to it still,
And are plucky, though poor, must be fitly looked after,
Or you '11 be a butt for the world's scornful laughter.
One good turn does merit another, that's clear,
Then volunteer help to the young Volunteer.
Reciprocity should not be all on one side.
It is your great privilege—should be your pride—
Every patriot must pay up, in person or purse;
If some shirk the former, why so much the worse;
But let them fulfil the next best form of right,
And help the Lord Mayor in "Arming the Knight"
Letter Perfect.—In a recent circular petition ad-
dressed to the House of Commons, the Royal College of
Physicians have pointed out the absolute necessity for

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
SEVENTEENTH EVENING.
"A Few nights ago," said the Moon, "I was looking down on a
French Fair, which was being held outside a small Norman town. It
had a very picturesque appearance, with the coloured lamps and
gay streamers, and the bustling crowd of pleased and chattering
French people. All the usual
sights were there; the Strong
Woman, the white-robed Pierrot,
blowing his immense trumpet in
front of the stage, the Quack Doc-
tor, the Lottery StaU, the Circus,
and the Merry-go-round, and I,
the Moon, was present at eaoh per-
formance, from beginning to end.
But the great attraction seemed
to be a Snooting Gallery, around
which aU the best marksmen were
collected, each endeavouring to
hit the bull's-eye, though without
the least success. If anyone could
have managed to hit the exact
centre, he would not only be enti-
tled to choose a prize out of a col-
lection of little gilded vases and
coloured statuettes, under glass
shades, but a door would have opened, and a small plaster angel,
representing Fame, have appeared, holding out a wreath to celebrate
so great a triumph. Unfortunately, though all had done their best,
no one had succeeded in inducing this angel to show itself, and some

sceptical youths were even growing to disbelieve in its existence.
Presently I saw two of your countrymen elbowing through tie
orowd, with that air of grown-up people at a children's party whioh
you all adopt when you go abroad, and which makes you so popular
with foreigners. They came to the Shooting Gallery, and stood
watching the efforts of the natives for a while with pitying con-
tempt. Soon a murmur of excitement arose—the English Milords
were about to try their skill. Would they succeed where Gustave
and Jules and Alphonse—who had all served their time in the
ranks—had failed? Impossible, since these English, it was well
known, were an unmilitary people, for all their arrogance! The
taller of the two was shouldering his gun . . . Would he never
have done aiming? Ah! but see—the beU has rung—he has suc-
ceeded! And then the crowd uttered a long-drawn exclamation—
partly of jealousy, partly of satisfaction—for the angel was no myth
after all f Yes, the door at the back opened, just as the proprietor
had declared it would, and now a little plaster angel, with very red
cheeks, and a trumpet held to its simpering lips, came jerkily out,
extended a garland to the fortunate Englishman, and staggered in
again, after which the door shut with a snap.
"The victor maintained the phlegm of his nation—he did not
seem particularly elated; but the shorter and stouter Englishman
whispered in his ear—it was a challenge of skiU! Now both took
up guns; this time, assuredly, they must fail! But no—the first
Englishman fired, and again the bell rang, and again the smiling
little plaster image came staggering out of the door; and then—in
an instant—before it had time to retreat, the second Englishman,
with a really diabolical treachery, raised his gun, and deliberately
blew the poor little angel—trumpet, wings, simper and all—into
atoms! I thought the orowd would have torn them in pieces, they
were so enraged. The proprietor was frantic—he tore his hair, and
danced dramatically in bis despair, as he pointed to the shattered

remains of the image of Fame. It was detestable, it was ignoble to
shoot his angel down like one of their own foxes I It meant ruin to
him, for that was the only angel he possessed, and was it probable
that Jules and Gustave and Alphonse would continue to contend
when there was only a pair of feet left to csngratulate a victory?
The Englishmen remained cool; they threw down a couple of
sovereigns on the table, and went off laughing.
"A little later, I saw the proprietor standing alone by his deserted
stall. He gazed in the direction of the two Englishmen, whose light
suits were still conspicuous in the crowd, and shook his fist with a
terrible gesture. 'Perfidious Albion!' he cried, 'nation of insolents!
Wait only till we have Boulangeh once more—he shall avenge me
this outrage!' And then, still soowling, he bit the pieces of £old to
see if they were genuine, and closed bis gallery for the evening. I
was sorry for him," added the Moon, "and I think that if your two
countrymen had been true sportsmen, they would have respected an
inoffensive little angel. Still, I hope there will be no war about it."
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Hotise of Commons, Monday Night, June 3.—A great day for
the Government. Business advanced by leaps and bounds. Arthur
Balfour almost breathless with bringing in Bills. Had five all in
a batch; dealt with Drainage, and Establishment of Light Railways.
According to Magna Charta (stipulation also embodied in Bill of
Rights, so Edward Clarke tells me), no law would run in Ireland,
or indeed elsewhere in the United Kingdom, unless Minister or
Member in charge started from Bar of House when bringing it in.
Whole process very funny. Shows with what care Constitution is
built up. Here's Balfour with his five Bills; moves for leave to
introduce them; Speaker puts question; no one obje«ts; Balfour,
springing up from Treasury Bench, walks with long swinging
stride towards the doorway; halts at Bar; faces about; Speaker,
suddenly looking up, quite surprised to find him there, calls him by
name; whereupon Arthur, blushing like young maiden, taking
longer strides than ever, almost tumbling over the obeisance he
makes to Chair, advances with piece of paper in hand, which pur-
ports to be the Bill. Crowning joke is paper imposture; no Bill at
all; only a piece of foolscap, folded lengthwise, indorsed with name
of Bill. Clerk at table enters thoroughly into spirit of fun; when
Arthur, smiling and blushing, brought up his scraps of paper,
Clerk, raising hid eyebrows with air of surprise as who should say,
"Dear me! you don't say soP" read out title of Bill indorsed on
back. "Bann Drainage Bill read a First Time."
Nobody did read it first time, for best of all reasons—nothing to
read; Everybody made-believe that it was read a First Time, and in
to-morrow's official record of business
done you'll find "Bann Drainage Bill
read a First Time." This done, Balfour
set off again on 'fresh expedition to Bar.
Brought in in succession the Barrow
Drainage Bill, the Shannon Drainage
Bill, and the Suok Drainage Bill. Quite
breathless when the fourth Bill safely
landed. Still one other, the Light Rail-
ways Bill. Could he manage this, in
addition to other four? He might.
Would certainly try; dauntless spirit,
and body in fair training with golf. But
was a fatherly eye upon him.
Joseph Gillis noted the feverish
eye, the parched lips, the panting
breast, the trembling limbs. Had
many a quarrel with Balfour, but

?letion of this foolish tour deforce.
he only way to save a valuable
life was to interpose with opposi-
tion to First Reading of Light
Railway Bill. Joseph did it.
Began by graphically and origi-
nally likening the proposed Light
Railway to a red herring drawn
across the path." Then went on
Sir Corrv *° describe ratepayers robbed by
}' # promotion of existing light rail-
ways; drew a fearful picture or peculation and waste of public
money, always with fatherly eye on Balfour, " watching nim,"
said Sir Corrt, "as a hen watches its favourite chicken." In ten
minutes Balfour got his wind again, ready for fresh start; seeing
which, Joseph concluded his objurgations, and Balfour, setting
off for Bar once more, brought in his fifth Bill.
Business done. — Trenormous! Half-a-dozen Bills advanced
stage, besides block of Supply.

Tuesday.—Wily and wary Old Moralist managed the holiday with
his usual tact and skill. Yesterday Lyon PLArFALR wanted to
know whether we could not "have off" till Monday week. Old
MoRALrrr shook his head, a tear glistening in his eye. There was a
tone of infinite sympathy in his voice. No, dear boy," he said,
"it cannot be effected. There are few things, compatible with my
duty to the House, the Country, and the Queen, that would g^ve
me greater effulgence of satisfaction than to extend the leisure time
of the Commons House of Parliament. But, looking at the state of
public business, and having regard to the period of the year at
which we have now, however tardily, arrived, I do not see—and I say
it with great regret—how we can meet the views of Hon. Gentlemen.
We must really return to the scene of our labours on Thursday the
13th of June instant." That seemed to settle it; Motion for Adjourn-
ment must be made at Morning Sitting to-day. When House met,
Old Morality again approached on interesting subject.
"I am," he said, in reply, "most anxious,to meet the views of
the House, as far as I possibly can. Any expression of desire on
the part of Hon. Members falls upon me as dew upon cultivated soil
—that is, as far as is compatible and consistent with my public duty.
Why, I may ask, does dew fall more abundantly on cultivated soil
than on barren lands? Because cultivated soils, being loose and
porous, very freely radiate by night the heat which they absorbed
by day; in consequenoe of which they are much cooled down and
plentifully condense the vapour of the passing air into dew. I am,
—if I may say so,—loose and porous whenever the dew of the
House's desire falls upon me. I think, therefore, that if we are
able to take Class II. in Supply, with the exception of the Irish
Votes, it will be in the power of the Government to propose an exten-
sion of the holidays until Monday week."
That settled it. Class II. rattled through with extraordinary
vigour. Geoeqe Campbell,
concerned for Scotch Votes,
lay down in middle of road,
and tried to stop onrush.
Members ruthlessly trod on
his prostrate body.
"More than ever a 'fearful
creature,'" said Pluxket,
with his childlike smile.
By Six o'clock Votes passed,
and, amid rapturous cheering,
Old Morality,—looser, more
porous than ever,—moved that
the House, at its rising, ad-
journ till Monday the 17th.
Prospect of holiday enabled
remnant of House to bear
with moderate patience debate
on , Bi - Metallism, raised at
Evening Sitting by Squire of

Maclean, only man on pub-
lished list of speakers House
desired to hear on subject, delivered one of his practical, unadorned
speeches, that go right to the point, a pleasing contrast with sur-
rounding verbiage. Old Morality got nis innings at a Quarter to
One- filled up space creditably; and at One o'Clock all went home

MODUS OPERANDI."
(The Covent Garden, Government and Her Majesty's Opposition).
Monday, June 3.—Very full house indeed, ready to support an
addition to the Cabinet of the Covent Garden Government. Mile.
Martr Van Zandt, haying accepted office, appears for the first time
in a responsible position. When
I say "for the first time," I
mean for a good long while.
When the talented Van last
appeared in London, she was
quite a little girl—so to speak,
soarcely a Van—more suggestive
of a perambulator. Ana shortly
after that experience she took to
the Opera Comique stage, and
naturally began to resemble a
Carte—a D'Oyley Carte. Once
more she is with us, singing with
wonderful vigour, and acting
with marvellous "go" her old
A, P^i -Amino, in La Sonnambula.
She has grown into a most gifted
"Evening dress indispensable." and charming lady—as someone
observes in Sweet Lavender, and her term of probation is over. No
meeting of Her Majesty's Opposition.
Tuesday.—Aida again, but with a difference. I was sorry to find
Madame Scaxchi out of the cast, although her place was fairly
well filled by another. This opinion was shared by a friend, who
in recognition of my suggestion (conveyed in good plain English)
that Amneris was "De Vigne," observed "divine—scarcely!)' To
make up for any shortcomings elsewhere, Madame Nokdica in the
title role was simply magnificent. She received an ovation, and
took her call before the Curtain with graceful gratitude. She was
enthusiastically applauded by everyone—even by the orchestra.
Nay more, Signor Cotoqni (upon whose swarthy shoulder the Indian
girl had rested her cheek) bestowed upon her a mark of approbation
which proved to demonstration that he was not nearly so black as
he was painted. The finale of the Triumph Scene was grand in the
extreme. There was a volume of sound that led me to oelieve that
even the serpents of the standards (to say nothing of the serpents
in the military band) were joining in the chorus. The house was
crowded in every part—so full indeed that it was necessary to
placard the vestibule with announcements that no admission would
be granted to umbrellas. This being the case, sticks appeared
before (but not behind) the Curtain. Her Majesty's Opposition
wide awake with La Sonnambula. The Chorus, who missed their
train at Turin, now arrived, and in full force. Pacini (Regina) the
Queen of the evening.
Wednesday.—An extra night (the first of the Season), of extra-
ordinary value. The knotty point of what to play was solved by
Augustus Drurio-
lanus choosing the
Nozze di Figaro.
Madame Albani led
the Van—after the
end of the Act—to
receive the hearty
congratulations of
the audience. Both
were excellent. In
fact, Mile. Maktk
was the most de-
lightful Cherubini I
have ever seen.
When this Opera is
put up again, there
will be no necessity
to substitute a new
page—in that part,
at any rate — for
Mile. Van Zandt
was capital from the
first line to the end of the chapter. Her singing was faultless,
and her acting was not only naughty, but more than nice. In
the Letter-writing Duet between Madame Albaxi and Susanna,
Mile. Ella Russell gave the most artistic assistance. Until then
I had rather regretted the foreign title that had been bestowed
in the programme upon this young lady of Anglo-Saxon birth.
However, I was thoroughly satisfied, as she took an encore with
her distinguished colleague, that it would have been a matter
of universal regret if she had been Missed. Dan Dbardi Majob,
very good as the Count. More at his ease, I fancy, than in the
elderly Germont of the Traviata. Striking a balance, I certainly
prefer him in the Nozze. But, after all, it is obviously merely a matter

of account. Signor Cotogni, a first-rate London representative of
the Figaro, better even than that amiable lover of all that is English
—M. JOHN80N—engaged in another place. All in all, the perform-
ance of " everyone concerned " may prove to be the most artistically
successful of the season. Dburiolanus, with all the resources at
his command (inclusive of the suggestions of his Committee), I
imagine will find it extremely difficult to beat this record. Her
Majesty's Opposition quite silent—in the other House.
Thursday.—Rigoletto at Covent Garden with an excellent caste.
Madame Melba, who has won golden opinions in Australia (as she
has assumed a nom de thiatre, why did she not, as a British
Colonial, call herself Melbourne ?), appropriately brightened up the
Opera as a Giida. Madame Scalchi returned to us as Maddalena.
She filled the part to admiration, but as she appeared neither
insane nor attenuated, the name was misleading. By the way, as
Monsieur Lassalle sang in French, why did not Mrs. Melbourne—
I.beg pardon, Madame Melba—warble in English? Art has no
nationality, and half-a-dozen languages sung together at one and
the same time would out-OUendorn Ollendorff. Be this as it may,
Monsieur could not have been better—his Rigoletto was in every
sense a great performance—not a thin note in it. However, this did
not cause surprise to the professional aotors present, who declared
the part technically to be "full of fat." Another Monsieur (one
Montabjol of that ilk) was anything but bad as II Duea; on the
contrary, he played and looked very well indeed. I fanoy from this
gentleman's performance that the Italian noble must have been
accustomed to the Cafes on the Boulevards. He was quite the petit
creve of the last Empire! The house was full, and yet there was
room for plenty of enthusiasm. Her Majesty's Opposition (to the
accompaniment of a real thunderstorm) introduced Mile. Garoano
as Lucia di Lammermoor.
Friday.—As someone is reported to have said at Epsom (late in the
evening), "a Faust-rate Opera at Covent Garden.' Someone did
not turn up subsequently, and if he had, he would probably have

Rival attractions at Epsom and Covent Garden. Our Artist (who dined rather
late on the Oaks Day) sends an " Impressionist Study."
found no room, as the house was crammed from floor to ceiling.
Before the Curtain rose there was some anxiety felt lest the company
should be detained at the Oaks. But the fear was happily unfounded,
as Mesdames Nobdica and Scalchi, Messieurs Lassalle and De
Keszke, to say nothing of Signor Talazac, were in their places at the
appointed hour. Again a night of triumph. Monsieur Lassalle,
as Mephistopheles, greatly to be preferred to Signor CASTELMABTjWho,
after all, was rather a poor devil of a fiend. No sitting in the House
of Her Majesty's Opposition.
Saturday.—At Covent Garden, a glorious finale to a glorious week.
Lohengrin, with Albani in the title role! Signor Babtoni Maca-
roni Guckini still absent, so his place occupied by Monsieur Herr
Jean he Reszke, Esq. The " Song of the Swan " was sung in a style
that banished the thought of its ever being accompanied by the voice
of the goose. Madame Albani in wonderful voice—Elsa to the life
and death. The Madi also well to the front, ever ready to come up
smiling—or, rather, frowning. Altogether a splendid performance.
Ave, Augustus Dburiolanus, Ave!
By Her Majesty's Opposition, in place of Lucia, which had been
announced, the well-worn La Sonnambula was played in the well-
worn way, with the usual doll's bedstead and toy water-mill, a
somewhat throaty Rodolfo (Signor Dabvall), and an Elvino (Signor
Vicini) who sang forcibly, though now and then just a little flat.
But Mile. Regixa_ Pacini, as Amino, was very well received, and
deserved her reception. Her voice, which has, perhaps, hardly attained
its full maturity, is very pure and sweet, and in the last Act espe-
cially she sang exquisitely, and fairly held a not too crowded house.
Vivat Regina!

And yet, Dear, how little we have seen of each other lately—considering there is only a Partition-Wall

"WESTWARD HO!"
An Idyllic Fragment.
King Arthur . . . Mr. Gl-dst-ne.
-Sir Bedivere . . . Sir W. H-hc-ht.
For on their march to Westward, Bedivere,
Who in the Forest New was Arthur's host,
At Malwood heard the mutterings of the
King:—
"I find it in the records of the polls,
I find it in the flowing of the tide,
But in the West, always, I find it not.
And so I 'm going to pass my holiday
In holding forth to gathered Cornishmen.
B-lf-b, the Tories' new divinity,
Still wages war in the sad Emerald Isle.
0 me! For why is all around us there
As if some lesser god had made the place.
And had not force to shape it as he would.
Till my Home Rule, high scheme, whereof
I'm fond,
Shall enter it, and make it beautiful P
A plan, if faint-defined, yet wholly fair, _
But that the eyes of men are dense and dim,
And have not power to see it as it is!
By heaven, but they shall see it ere I close!
For I, being simple, thought to work my will,
And yet have lifted the new flag in vain;
For much whereon I leaned in flock and friend
Is traitor to my rule, and half my realm
Reels back to Tory ways, and is no more;
Nay, some there be who reckon on my death:
But I '11 astonish them before I die."
This heard the bold Sir Bedivere, and spake:
"0 me, my King, let pass whoever will.
Joe, and that sullen patron of the Turf; _
But I will stick to thee like death, and cling
Until we win back place: the golden cloud
Of thy free eloquence shall whelm men's minds
As ever. Nay, as yet thou shalt not pass.
And oare not thou for Whitsun rest, but rise—
I hear the steps of Modred in the West,
And with him many of thy people, and knights
Once thine, whom thou hast led, but grosser
grown
Than Tories, spitting at their vows and thee.
Right well m neart they know thee for the
King,
Arise; go forth, and conquer as of old."
Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere :—
"Far other is this battle in the West
Whereto we move, than when we strove in
youth,
Or brake 'cute Dizzy's bands, or fought with
Rome,
Or thrust the Tory from Midlothian's heart,
And shook him thro' the North. Ill fate is
mine
To war against my people and my knights:
The king who fights his people fights himself.
And they, my knights, who loved me once,
the stroke
That strikes at them is as a blow to me.
Yet let us hence, and feel or find a way
Through this blind haze, which ever since I
saw
Power lying at the feet of Salisbury,
Hath blurred the passes of the Party World."
So said the tireless chief, and forward fared

NAVAL INTELLIGENCE—UP TO DATE.
It is satisfactory to know that affairs are
looking up at Portsmouth, and that it is now
believed that the Authorities will be in a
position to cope with the difficulty occasioned
by the deficiency of big guns by the date of
the approaching Naval Review.
H.M. Ironclad Blunderer will, it is said, be
sure to have one of her four promised guns on
board in time, while one other will be bor-
rowed for the occasion from the Jackass, and
the remaining two supplied from the reserve
of condemned ordnance of an extinct type, of
which a large store is always kept in hand,
with a view to possible emergencies.
There is also said to be some makeshift in
contemplation for the proper supply for
H.M.S. Megatherium, and the belted cruiser,
Four-poster; but it is supposed that this
deficiency will be met by requisitioning the
services of both the guns on the Parade at
the back of the Horse Guards, the one on the
Fort at Margate, and several others hired
from the proprietors of Rosherville Gardens.
As there is no ammunition available for
any of the above, they will not be of much
practical use for firing purposes; yet the fact
that they are forthcoming at all, must be
regarded as a favourable sign by all who
have been hitherto disposed tocritioise severely
the tardiness of the Authorities. Anyhow,
it may be gathered, as Mr. Stanhope con-
fided to the House of Commons, when he last
addressed it on this question, that "those who
are responsible" are evidently grappling with
it with much vigour and originality.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUCK AMONG THE PICTURES.

When Puck takes the penoil his fancies to limn,
With the spirit of humour, the impulse of whim,
Art, masking as Momus, illumines with mirth,
The follies and frauds of our dull-driven earth.
In a world so beset by the base and impure,
There is plenty of ofh.ce for Caricature;
And when Titian and Turner have played out their part,
There is still a wide sphere left for Humorous Art.
He who'd gather its view of the vicious and silly,
Should visit the Institute's halls, Piccadilly.
From Hogarth to Furniss! A fairly wide stretch
For the lords of broad fun and satirical sketch.
Not too well selected, scarce neatly arranged;
Much might be omitted, and some things be changed.
But he who would study, what few understand,
British Caricature in the mass, at first hand,
Might well do much worse than betake him (as we go)
To view the collection of Horrock and Grego.
Thirteen hundred odd pictures, from canvas wide-spread,
To "postage-stamp" sketch, somewhat muddle the head.
He who pores for some hours, in hot thundery weather,
At " Cartoons" and " thumb-nails," all huddled together,
In fashion suggestive of hurry, may find
More of fog than fine judgment possessing his mind.
There is hardly a thing that depression provokes
Much more than a motley "collection" of jokes,
Whether merely Joe Millers or truly wit-litten ones.
Pictorial skits are in this much like written ones.
The mind, like the stomach's not boundlessly peptic
Of pungencies; showmen should be more eclectic.
But here's broadly humorous, human Hooarth,
Who knows man all round from the hulks to the hearth;
Strong, various, vivid, whose brush is a flail,
Whose eye misses nothing; whose wit cannot fail.
Here's Rowlandson, rioting wild with sheer force,
Ferocious in satire, in comedy coarse,
But masterly; touched too not seldom with grace,
In a bread rustic scene, or a fair female face,
That pencils more finical fail to attain.
Here s Gillrat, his fellow in brush-power and brain.
The gTeat Dioscuri of Satire in Art.
Comes Chuikshank the fertile, and honest of heart,
Humane, inexhaustible, grimly grotesque.
With the spirit of tragedy blent with burlesque.
Comes Seymour's keen eye for the humours of sport;
And dear "Dicky" Doyle's dainty fun, of a sort
Sui generis, genial, graceful, and quaint.
Here's " Phiz," still delightful, with pencil or paint,
Spite of fluent convention; 'tis hard, that is poz,
To criticise closely that colleague of Boz,"
Who first made his characters live in our eyes;
Though Barnard, whose art with late knowledge is wise,
And delicate Green, with broad Browne here compete.
And then, with a world of his own fresh and sweet,
Free and broad as the fair English landscapes he drew
With felicitous ease, and with touches so true,
Or the fair English faces, with oheeks of the peach,
He limned and loved well, unforgettable Leech,
Punch's genial John, in the streets, in the fields,
At home almost equally; hardly he yields
In sheer strength to the elders of Humorous Art;
Whilst in grace and good taste he still plays his own part
Unapproaohed. None too well on these thick-covered walls
Represented is he. Randolph Caldecott thralls
Every eye with that blending of humour and grace,
For which who will fill his too soon voided place?
Then Tennlel, the classic, whose art's fine address
Gives us never a line or a touch in excess;
Du Maurier, the black-and-white Thackeray; Keene
Of the pencil miraculous; his art is seen
Not with insular optics alone as superb.
Then Sambourne the subtle, whose fancy to ourb,
Dulness vainly might try; fertile Furniss, whose fire
Of invention and humour no labours can tire.
Brisk Bryan, and whimsical Sullivan next,
And Baxter with talent too fine for his text.
These and others all crowd on these walls. Well, to Puck,
In the role of an artist. Punch wishes good luck.
The Art that shoots Folly, with fun. as she flies,
And hammers old Humbug, and lashes new lies,
Is a wholesome delight, and a chastening scourge.
So, spite of some drawbacks and faults, Punch would urge
His readers towards Piccadilly to start,
For Sir James's new Show—English Humorous Art.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Impromptu Dentistry.—We can well understand your desire, if
possible, to carry on at once without a day's delay, the nice little
Provincial Dentist's Practice that has just come to you through the
will of the second cousin you mention, and you nave no doubt,
seeing that you know nothing of the business, acted wisely in having
immediately commenced practising extraction by taking up all the
nails in the stair-carpets as soon as you received the Solicitor's letter
intimating to you your good fortune. No doubt your having had
some experience in driving a four-horse coach might, as you suggest,
warrant you in the belief that you would soon be able to command a
good " grip" of the instrument, when onoe you had got it into the
patient's mouth, but we cannot, at the moment, call to mind any
thoroughly recognised Institution that, taking this circumstance
into consideration, would be likely to hurry an urgent applicant
through all the required courses, ana grant him his diploma forthwith.
Doubtless, though, several such exist. Perhaps your best way would
be, after all, to take the bull by the horns, and boldly throw your-
self into the work, and see what you can make of it. You might
at first secure the assistance and co-operation of the local Chemist's
boy, who, you will probably find, has already had a large experience
in the matter of extraction. Between you, you ought to be able, at
least for a short time, so to conduct matters as not to seriously scare
and diminish your clientele. Of course, some disagreeable contretemps
may happen. You may break a jaw or two; and this will be
awkward. But don't let any prospect of this kind dishearten you.
We think your idea of "payment by results,"—namely, that you
should charge your patients only a shilling, if you succeeded in
getting the top of a tooth off, hafi-a-crown if you managed to get
half of it out, and five shillings if you conducted the operation satis-
factorily, and extracted the whole tooth entirely,—a little risky.
There is novelty about it, and old-fashioned patients are, therefore,
likely to look at it with considerable distrust. You are right in
asking why one should not as easily become a dentist as a gardener,
for afl that is wanted is a facility for successful "tugging." We
Bhall be interested in hearing how you have grappled with and met
the few initiatory difficulties that appear likely to beset you in this
rather hastily-adopted new calling.
An Unfortunate Attachment.—That of Captain Woodward's,
at the instance of Mr. Justice Manisty, after consultation with
Mr. Justice Mathevv-

LORD DUFFERING AT THE MANSHUN HOUSE.
Ever since the time as I gave my raythur largish order for Coles
to my lordly Cole Merchant, the most Honnerabel the Markis of
Lundonderry—which it was just this time last year, and werry
decent sort of Coles they was too, fairly nubbly, and werry respect-
able for size and with a nutter habsence of slates—I have bin possesst
of quite a longing desire to see, with my own estonished eyes, what
partickler sort of pusson, to look at, a Most Honnerabel Markis coud
be. I'm told as there ain't no other kind or sort of Nobbleum, or
of any other descripshun of humane beings, as is intitled to be
called a Most Honnerabel One, xcept a Markis, and so I was ony
too glad of my hoppertunity, last Wensday as ever was, to have
the nonner of waiting at the honnerd Manshun House upon the
Most Honnerabel the Markis of Differing.
I don't think as Duffering is quite xaclythe werry name as I
shood have selected, if as how Her Most Grayshus Majesty had asked
me for to be a Most Honnerabel Markis, but as that isn't wery likely
to oocur, I needn't trubbel myself about it jest now, and as I am
told as how as the Most Honnerbel Markis chose his name when he
was over in Ingy, why praps a Duffer may have a diffrent meaning
over there to what it has over here, speshally among us Waiters.
I wunders what line of bizziness as the new Markis will go into P
Brown tells me as the Rite Honerabel the Erl of Shrewsbury has
gone into the Cab line, but I oarnt alius beleeve Brown. Besides,
after all, what's a mere Rite Honnerabel, as cumpared with a Most
Honnerabel? If I mite wenture humbly to surgest, I shood think
as a Itallyan Warehouse woodn't be a bad idear, as his Lordship
woud find his thoro nolledge of Ingian Pickles, and Piccadilly Sauce,
and all kinds of Currys, woud be of the werry greatest use to him in
that rayther genteel perfession.
I may as well menshun it, as he might be a wundering why it
didn't come, that I haven't sent my most Honnerabel Cole Merchant
another order iust yet, as I hear that he's away at his Carsel at
Dublin, so ooudn't in course give his own pussonal atention to it, as
he ewidently did afore, as he told me as he employed no agents. I
hopes and trusts as his pore Carman didn't git into trubbel for his
bad spellin, but reelly Pade," for a reoeet, was a litle too bad from
a Most Honnerabel Markis's hofishal.
I've bin told by a Irish M.P., so in course it must be trew, that
when Mb Most Honnerabel Lordship is iest a leetle trubbled with
affairs of State, such as marching at the head of his Troops a collect-
ing of the Landlords' rents for 'em, that he goes off, after it's all
over, to a place called Punch's Town, of all names in the world, and
then has quite a jolly day's racing; and, if he has a run of bad luck,
he just sells a few thousand Tuns of his best Wall Send Coles, ana
that puts him all strait again. I alius understood as the reel
Mr. Punch was ennormusly rich, but I never thort as he had a hole
town all to hisself.
I begins to find as I'm rayther a wandering away from my
horiginal hintenshun, which it was to discribe Wednesday's peroeed-
ings; but there wasn't much of a werry uncommon natur to
discribe, so I dessay I shall be xcused.
The new Markis is a nice quiet-looking Gent, a good deal like
Brown, who amost blusht wen I told him so, and speaks bewtifool.

deal about Ingy that ewen I had newer heard on afore; but he was
rayther a long time about it, which is allers a great mistake, ewen in
a Most Honnerabel Markis, as the other speakers, as is to be,
naterally don't like to be kep waiting, and to see quite a rush out
when the great man has quite finished. The Chanceseller of the
Xchequer, speshally, looked quite savage at having to speak to a

formation generally (I suppose it has been

now ought to be, the best of all Guides—
quite a maximum in minimo.
Dickens's Dickenshionariet of London for
1889 are now out. Very useful to Country
Cousins and to "Water Babies," which re-
minds me that Messrs. Macmillan have just
re-issued Charles Klngsley's charming
work, with " our Mr. Sambourne's" charm-
ing illustrations.
My faithful Co. says: — " The Fatal
Phryne is a not very pleasant novel by a
couple of authors — Messrs. Wills and
Philips—who hitherto working on their own
separate accounts, have now combined forces
to work together. Such a number of stories
are published nowadays that it is difficult to
remember details; but, so far as I recol-
lect, As in a Looking-glass was written by
one of these gentlemen, and a reference to the
title-page has confirmed my impression—it
there appears under his name. Mr. Philips
seems to write in collaboration with another
with as much facility as he exhibited
when trusting entirely to his own resources.
The plot is rather suggestive of that now
half-forgotten cause celebre onoe known as
'The Pimlico Mystery.' Again, admirers of
the works of Mr. Wilkie Collins may pos-
sibly, on reading the new novel, faintly call
to mind an incident in Poor Miss Finch.
Briefly, a husband much the senior of his
wife does not discourage the idea in his own
mind that some day an artistic friend of his
may become his sucoessor—the date, of
course, to be no earlier than his wife becoming
a widow. The artist friend unfortunately
falls in love with the wife prematurely, and
the husband (a doctor), growing jealous,
uses his medical knowledge to spoil his
beauty. On learning (at the end of the
book) in spite of appearances, that his wife
has been really true to him, the Doctor is so
overcome with emotion that he dies, leaving
his widow to marry, if she pleases, what re-
mains of the man he has hitherto believed to
be his favoured rival. The Fatal Phryne,"
concludes my faithful Co., "has one great
merit—it is in two volumes, and not in three."
Our Celebrities this month is full of excel-
lencies. M. Walbry gives us the portraits
of three Ambassadors—the Frenoh, the Ger-
man, and the Russian. Excellent Excellen-
cies. M. Waddington looks bull-doggedly
English: Count Hatzfeldt,—bare and bald-
headed, he might have had on one of his " felt
hatz," from which, of oourse,he derives his
title,—is uncommonly like a Heathen Chinee
with Christianised moustache; and M. de
Staal bears a handsome and polished re-
semblance to the late Professor Darwin. All
life-like; and, indeed, M. Walery's photo-
graphic portraits, outside this particular Cafe
des Ambassadeurs, strike me as equal to
the best, and superior to most, I have
met with. The other day I saw one of
his reproduced in colour. The effect was
that of a highly-finished miniature, and
I am informed that the tints will stand the
ravages of time as well as a modern portrait
in oils. By the way—Happy Thought—why
should a severe-looking person go to an
artist in oils—say, Sir John Millais or Pro-
fessor Heekoher—for his portrait? Because

THE LITEBARY LADIES' DINNER.
[A Dinner, at ■which Literary Ladies only were
present, was recently given at MeaerB. Spiers and
Pond's Criterion Restaurant.]
They, greatly daring, met to dine,
These Ladies, writing thrilling fiction;
And o'er the olives and the wine
Were doubtless " Ouidalisques " in diction.
Some twenty Ladies
went one Fri-
day night, and
much enjoyed
their dinner;
A smart symposium
atthe"Cri,"
And, save the
waiters, no male
sinner.
"A young Greek
goddess," too,
was there,
Escaped from high
Olympian duty,
Another, with Junonian air,
A delicate dark-featured beauty.
A poetess, in gold brocade,
Who murmured triolets and sonnets;
And many spinsters, every maid
Was quite above the thought of bonnets.
They talked of pictures and of books,
And subjects argument inviting;
They interchanged the sweetest looks,
And each one puffed the other's writing.
And silver laughter filled the room,
At jokes, the subjects are not stated;
But publishers were left to doom,
And Paternoster Row was "slated."
At last, 0 tell it not in Gath!
A lady, hailed as benefactress,
Did not disdain Nicotian path
Of dalliance with the weed: an actress
Produced a case of cigarettes,
And then, 0 theme for sourrile joking!
These attitudinising pets
Of railway bookstalls, took to smoking.
Uprose then Mrs. Mona Calrd,
With soul superior to garters,
And in sarcastic speech she dared
To give as toast, "The Married Martyrs.
Perchance some spinsters there who heard,
Would think they'd often wondered why
Did not propose: and how absurd [men
It was, a wife should scoff at Hymen.

Who are not prudish or pedantic,
If all these foolish tales be true
About each gastronomio antic,
Think on the Laureate's lines, and scan

Although she dines in Piccadilly.

RE-THE TABLE AND BENCH QUESTION.

Coleridoe! We'll
Case.—Apparently as the outcome
of a practical joke, the Right Hon.
James Lowther, Prince Soltikoff
and the Earl of March were selected
to hold sittings as Arbitrators on a
libel case during- the Whitsuntide
vacation. The Arbitrators having
subsequently been invited to make
use of the Queen's Bench Division
Court for this purpose, at their first
meeting, occupied places usually
reserved for Her Majesty's Judges.
In spite of the remonstrance of the
Members of the Bar , present, the
Arbitrators refused to change their
chairs on the Bench for seats at the
Table. Subsequently, on a peremp-
tory command of the Lord Chief
Justice, that the Court should be
closed unless the Arbitrators descended from the Bench, the Arbitrators
expressed themselves satisfied with the less dignified resting-places indicated by
the Lord Chief Justice, which they thereupon occupied.
Counsel will kindly say:—
1. Whether there was any justification for Arbitrators occupying the Bench.
2. Whether the Lokd Chief Justice was right in ordering the Court to be
closed if the Arbitrators failed to content themselves with seats at the Table.
3. Whether the Arbitrators acted wisely in making to the Lord Chief Justice
the concession required of them, and comported themselves discreetly.
And will adviso generally.
Opinion.—1. I cannot, go so far as to say, that the Arbitrators were "justified"
in taking the places reserved for Her Majesty's Judges, but, I feel they had a
strong excuse. No doubt, it was the intention of the Arbitrators to invest the
proceedings, into which they seem to have been lured with so much humour,
with as much pomp as possible. To use a word frequently employed in this
case, they were "handicapped" at the outset, by having to appear in morning
dress instead of the robes worn by their Lordships when sitting in open Court,
and anything suggestive of "importance" no doubt would occur to them as
enhancing their dignity. It may be advanced, that they might have appeared
in hunting costume, and certainly this would have had a picturesque effect, but
it must be remembered that it would have been contrary to the traditions of
the Bar for the Counsel employed, so to speak, to have followed suit. In obedi-
ence to these traditions, the Counsel engaged dispensed with their robes with the
result, that when Sir Charles Russell aided by his learned Junior, Mr. Charles
Matthews cross-examined Sir George Chetwynd, the scene was not entirely
unsuggestive of a retired Doctor of Divinity assisted by a favourite pupil (who
having come from school last, it was to be presumed would be less rusty"
than his leader) conducting the vita voce portion of an attempted pass of a
somewhat backward (both in age and knowledge) undergraduate. It must be
remembered that as a Member of the Privy Council and an ex-State Official of
high standing, the Right Hon. James Lowther (the Chief Arbitrator) would
naturally desire to invest his proceedings with as much state as possible. It
would occur to him that an entrance from the Judges' Apartments, through
curtains, would be infinitely more impressive than emerging, through a 6mall
hole, from the subterranean regions below the level of the well of the Court.
It cannot be denied that this is a reasonable view of the matter, as the first
entrance would not seem to be an unworthy companion picture to the "Doge of
Venice and two of the most influential Members of the Council of Ten taking
their seats in the Council Chamber," while the second would not be unlikely to
conjure up a recollection of a severely reduced band mournfullv occupying the
space devoted to the orchestra in a small provincial theatre threatened with
bankruptcy. There was this further excuse for the
Right Hon. Gentleman, that the surroundings he found in
the Queen's Bench Division No. 5 were similar to those
in an ordinary catue celebre, and likely to create in his
mind some misconoeption of the part he should play
in the inquiry. For instance, the number of reporters
were legion, and the proceedings were of a nature to
suggest the dreariest hours of the Special Commission.
It was natural too, that he should wish to go down to
posterity at the pencil of Mr. Sydney Hail (who was
present) in that atmosphere of grandeur which does not
exist apart from the Bench. But after making all these
deductions I am unable to find an entire justification for
his conduct.
2. As the Lord Chief Justice has jurisdiction over the
Common Law Courts, both in Term and out of Term (I do
not myself find anything in the authorities upon this
matter, but no doubt this decision will in future be quoted
as a precedent), his Lordship was clearly within his rights
to order Queen's Bench Division No. 5 to be closed
unless the Arbitrators consented (like the coon in a fre-
quently quoted American oase) to "come down." I do
not see that the consideration that the possible result of
this closure might have caused a change of venue from
the interior to the exterior of the building should have
had weight with his Lordship, as there was nothing to
prevent (if required) the holding of the inquiry in the
green space bounded on the North by Carey Street, the
South by the Strand, the East by the Law Courts, and
the West by Clement's Inn. I am the more of this opinion
as the matter, being heard out of Term, the proceedings
would not have distracted the attention oi the Chief
Clerks of the Chancery Division, whose rooms overlook the
green space I have sufficiently indicated. Consequently
I concur in his Lordship's decision.
3. For the above reasons I think the Arbitrators acted
quite wisely in making the required concession. I also
believe that they have been most discreet. It was not
impossible that, after the foreign fashion. Prince Solti-
koff, in the heat of the moment, might have demanded
satisfaction. I am happy to hear no suggestion that this
has been the case. It is patent that the Lord Chief
Justice could not have agreed to meet his Highness
within the Queen's dominions; and, had his Lordship
consented to visit some distant land outside Her Majesty s
i'urisdiction, with a view to carrying out the Prince's
lypothetical proposals, considerable, and, possibly, irre-
parable damage and delay might have been occasioned
in the due administration of the law. I also entirely
approve of the Arbitrators placing on their table volumes
of the Racing Calendar in lieu of law books, and concur
with them when a dispute on a difficult point of law
arises between Sir Charles Russell and Sir Henry
James in the advisability of seeking professional advice
from my learned (if somewhat youthful friend) Mr.
North—a gentleman no doubt quite capable of affording
them assistance of the utmost benefit and value.
Finally, I advise generally that those not engaged in
the case should carefully avoid Queen's Bench No. 5, as the
proceedings therein are so dull that, compared with them,
ditchwater is an effervescing beverage, of the most exhi-
larating character.

HOLES AND CORNERERS.
An admirable society for the help of Bachelors, hai
been started in London. The programme is to provid<
persons who will sew on buttons, darn, mend, and other-
wise care for the neglected habiliments of unweddee
gentlemen. In future such a thing as a button off I
shirt, or a rent in a vest, or a little rift within a sock
will be impossible. The Society issues its "No Rent'
manifesto, and will cure faulty garments by the proces
of "mending or ending." All bachelors should m-vet
in the Society's aid—" first aid to bachelors," it might h
called. How often, when we have discovered a " missinj
link," or a link missing between collar and shirt, hav
we been inclined to darn—but no; in future that sort o
thing can be done by the skilled fingers of the humbl
workers provided by the "Stitch-in-time Association.'

How fast the brute within them wakes I
Through flower-beds and shrub-clustered

Smug sages, shifty statesmen, can you measure
The meaning of this new Pursuit of Pleasure?
DOWN ON THE FOG DEMON.
In his pictorial forecast of New London,
Mr. Punch indicated that one of the labours
of that new Hercules, the L. C. C, should be
fighting the Smoke Fiend. Well, Mr. Walter
Wren, it seems, has given notice of Motion
to the effect:—
"That it be an instruction to the Sanitary and
Special Purposes Committee to take into considera-
tion the causes of the Fog* which trouble London
during the winter months, and the increased death-
rate during their prevalence, in order to put in
force existing powers for dealing with them, and
obtaining increased powers if necessary."
In support of whioh Motion Mr. Wren has
written a Memo, on "Causes and Cures for
London Fogs." The Motion and the Memo,
have Mr. Punch''$ approval and best wishes.
"We want London Fogs to be things of
the past," says W. W. Precisely. But it
would seem that in the past they were in-
finitely less prevalent. He draws a pleasing
picture of London seventy—only seventy—
years ago when, says he, "it was a bright and
sunny town." Bright and sunny 1 Why it
was but the other day, Mr. Punch, had to
burn gas during the greater portion of a fore-
noon in June. "At Queenhithe, in 1832, the
air was quite as pure as it now is at Streat-
ham 'or Blackheath; and beds of flowers
blossomed to perfection within twelve furlongs
of the City boundary." Indeed! "This state
of things must be regained." 'Tis a consum-
mation most devoutly to be wished. "Were
coal smoke avoided by complete combustion,
and were houses scientifically warmed, the
saving in the cost of coal, ana in the labour
and sickness, the destruction and depreciation
caused by smoke, would in one year yield all
the sum that is immediately required to pro-
vide sufficient parks and playgrounds, gardens,
boulevards, and avenues for the Metropolis:
and London would then be as bright and
cheerful as it was three-quarters of a century
ago." Sounds optimistic, not to say Utopian.
But we have it on the authority of Sir. Wren
and the Quarterly Review,
0 Walter Wren, if you do not joke,
But will the C. C. powers invoke
To banish from London the Demon Smoke,
Whose game is to blacken, and poison, and
choke,
You '11 win the thanks of long-suffering folk.
0 Scienoe, teach us to burn and stoke,
In 'Arry's phrase, "bid that black-a-vised
bloke."
The London Fog-fiend, "go home and eat
coke,"
And free our necks from his dismal yoke!

fits me. Mr. Punch and his merry men all gone off to Paris, not
principally to see the Exhibition, not principally to enjoy themselves';
stern sense of duty calls them off.
"Why," said my venerated Leader, "should Old Mobality enjoy
monopoly of performance of duty to House and Country? we have
a duty to perform and shall do it; the Mabkiss has snubtied France,
has declined to permit British Minister to take part in Centennial
celebration of certain historical event; Lord Mayor stepped into
breach; very well done, but still something laoking; Mr. Punch
Bhall go to Paris in the flesh (what there is of it) and thus shall be

very pleasant time,
our progress being
marked by those
kindly gifts, mis-
cellaneous in their
design but uni-
formly useful in
their character, the
presentation of

years past marked
my public peregri-
nation through
Oreat Britain.
Amongst other
things we have re-
ceived a casket of
pure white Mexi-
can onyx, with a
handsome raised
floral decoration of
wild roses and forget-me-nots on the lid. The casket is enclosed in a
polished walnut box. Item, a marble mosaio table. These and
other articles of what Mr. Wemmick called portable property we
shall add to the accumulation gathered on earlier pilgrimages whioh,
warehoused at Hawarden, gives the plaoe what my recent host
Sir William Habcoitrt calls a pantechniconio air. I shall not be

remain, Your humble and obliged W. E. Gl-dst-he.

Dear Toby,—What do you think of Grand Old Man spenduur his
Whitsun holidays cavorting about Devon and Cornwall? Why
can't he take a rest like an ordinary mortal? The worst of it is, it
seems to agree with him. What would break down an ordinary man
at half his age, only serves to brighten him up. Still I think he
ought to be ashamed of himself going about with white umbrella, a


rose in his coat, and a mosaic table under his arm. But if he thinks
he vexes me, or gives us a moment's uneasiness, he is mistaken. If
you have an opportunity, just mention this.
Yours faithfully, S-l-sb-ry.
Eddystone Lighthouse, Friday.
Toby, old man, how goes it? It's my watch below, so I take this
opportunity of writing a
few lines, hoping they
will find you pretty taut,
as they leave me at pre-
sent. You will be sur-
prised to hear of me
here; but the fact is, it
seemed the only place I
could go to spend a quiet
time. I can't stand a
ship in present state of
our Navy, and I can't
live ashore. There are
only three courses open
in suoh circumstances.
I determined to take the
third, and live in a light-
house. So here I am,
tra-la-la!
Very jolly time with
my two mates; we weigh
out each other's grub,
take watch and watch
about, and sit down to
supper in tarpaulins when
the weather is rough.
When I come back to
House, I mean to let out on Lighthouses. We are terribly under-
manned. England will never be the nation she was, or able to hold
her own, unless she has as many Lighthouses as any two Conti-
nental Powers combined. That's my new taok, of which you will
hear more by-and-by.
Yours to command, Ch-rl-e B-r-sf-rd.
Somewhere in Norway {can't spell the name). Tuesday.
Dear Toby,—Just heard I've won the Oaks; (hope it is not spelt
with a A.) Dunraven sends me word, and you know what an in-
corrigible joker he is, in spite of his grave aspect, and his mission to
reform the Lords. If it is true, it will suit my book to a t. I
have long had a fanoy that the only thing lacking to complete my
popularity as a Statesman is, that I Bhould own horses, and win an
occasional race. Fancy Georgv Hamilton winning a race, or even
Old Morality, though of him I '11 say nothing. Of course you've
read what warm friends
we are now; how I look
up to him as my natural
Leader, and how ne begins
to think I'm not nearly so
bad as I've sometimes
been painted.
I near there's Borne
wonder expressed at my
leaving London for this
place in height of the
season, and on eve of Oaks.
All kinds of reasons are
suggested. I don't mind
telling you the truth,
though it needn't go any
further. It's Wolffey;
he's come home quite rosy,
with a lot of fresh stories
culled from the Persian;
a sort of spectacled Lallah
Rookh. He was bad
enough before he went,
but now he's unsupport-
able. He offered, in patronising way, to present me to the Shah
when he arrives. Me, who only the other day had Boulanger's
boots under my mahogany! Wolffey is not going to show me
round, I can tell him. So I made up my mind to come off here,
where he is not likely to follow me.
I'm supposed to be fishing, but haven't done much yet. Saw a
salmon yesterday, at least I think it was one; hope I'11 catch it;
Generally do when I'm at home.
Yours, E-nd-lph S. Ch-rch-ll.

Dear Toby, I wonder if you will be in the House on Monday, or
whether you will be tempted by the state of the weather to extend

the Country if I were to miss it, and so fail to be in my place to greet
the Speaker on his resuming the Chair.
I do not expect we shall be excessively lively. The disposition to
lead to excitable episodes appears to have subsided. What influence
upon the assembly my equable presence may have
had it is not for me to say; but it is impossible to
avoid noting the circumstance. Mr. Gladstone,
it is not unreasonable to expect, may, to a certain
extent, be what, in writing privately to you I may
describe, as pumped out oy his excursion to the
West. My esteemed young friend Grandolph
is engaged in what I am given to understand are
piscatorial pursuits; Chaplin is in a
simmering state of content in anticipa-
tion of the devolution upon him of
newly constituted ministerial func-
tions. Looking around from this quiet
retreat in a riparian district, I think I
may say that events have a pleasant
air of quiescence, and that in the
coming weeks we shall have the oppor-
tunity of making steady progress with
business, which, as far as is consistent
with anybody's feelings, is my earnest
desire.

temporary cessation from labour, and

MODUS OPERANDI."
(The Covent Garden Government, and Her Majesty's Ojiposition.)
Monday, June 10.—The bill for this evening at Covent Garden
contained Aula, set down to be read, or rather sung, at least a third,
if not a fourth time. The provisions thoroughly understood, and passed
without demur by a full house. Madame Valda in charge of the
title role resuming the lead (shared a few nights since with
Madame Nordica), ably supported by Madame Scalcbi. Monsieur
Jean De Reszke also made a most effective defence of Verdi's
music. Proceedings in every way satisfactory. Her Majesty's
Opposition still enjoying the pleasures of the Whitsuntide recess.
'Tuesday.—At Covent Garden, Guitlaume Tell, with Monsieur
Lassalle in the bill, but out of the cast. However, the disappoint-
ment might have been
greater had not Monsieur
Sequin supplied his place,
at short notice, most effi-
ciently. Monsieur Lestel-
lter not so satisfactory. If
very great things were ex-
pected from this Mont., the
result has not been entirely
unlike the ridiculus mus.
By the way, it is becoming
so much the fashion nowa-
days to allow the artistes to
select their own language
(I fancy Monsieur Seguln
sang in French this evening),
that it would not be half a
bad idea to put up Lucia,
with Miss McTnttre in
pure Scotch, and the Mac-
Guckin as Edgar (to balance
his not having played the

dad, and Maggie Macintyre "take the flure." mgrin), in the original Irish
of his native land. But to speak once more of Tell. Mile. Lita made
rather a mess (some even said a litter, but they were wags, and as such
unworthy of respeot), of the acting in the part of Mathilde. I could
not help thinking that her presence in the train of Oesltr may possibly
have had something to do with the unpopularity of that misguided
nobleman. The Barber leading the Opposition m another place.
Wednesday.—Evening sitting at Covent Garden as an extra night
with Faust to the fore, and here let me correct a slip of the pen in my
report of last week when the matter was also before the house. I then
praised M. Lassalle as an excellent Mep h istopheles, and however just
that praise may have been (for, no doubt whenever the gifted bari-
tone plays the part he plays it thoroughly well), he was not on the
occasion in question devilling for anyone, but appearing in propria
persona as Valentine. It was Monsieur De Keszke who assumed the
diabolical character, and assumed it very well. To-night we had the
same caste plus an additional De Reszke and Winooradoit and
minus Lassalle and Talazac. The absence of the latter was not
to be regretted, as he was soaroely the sort of Faust to captivate the
heart of so charming a Marguerite as Madame Nordica. It must
have occurred to many present that Mephistopheles had given rather
short measure in return for Faust's blood and bond. The Opposition
taking it very easily at Her Majesty's, but promising something with
the charm of novelty by Gounod for to-morrow.
Thursday.—Again Monsieur Lassalle away as the leader of the
house at Covent Garden, and once more there is an efnoient sub-
stitute to supply his place. A member of '' the talented Dan Drardies
family" simply excellent as the amatory Don. and Madame Marie
Van Zandt more than confirms the favourable impression she has
created in the Page from the Nozze. Another absentee in the person
of Mile. Toni Schlageb was to have done wonders with that lively
individual Donna Anna. Instead, we have the Madi, who, after the
fashion of her great African namesake, turns up unexpectedly, but
(unlike him) most pleasantly.
Another alteration of not quite
so delightful a character is the
appearance of M. Lestellier
as Don Ottavio, when we had
been promised Signor Massimi.
It is of course, rather difficult
to say what the Signor would
have been like, as he did not
appear, but I think he would
have been better than the
Mons.—if he had not, I should
have been at once surprised
and disappointed. _ For the
rest, the mise-en-scene excel-
lent, and the general perform-
ance all of the best.

setting of Gounod's master- Suggestion for a Statue to be erected
piece; the performance on _ in the R. I. 0. C. G.
Thursday being at least an original one. There was a fair muster
on the Opposition benches- or stalls—and the house seemed to approve
Mile. ZfilE DE LussaN as Marguerite, and Signor Pal o' Mine—I
mean Palebmini—as Valentino. Mile. ZfxiE was voted bright and
tunefult and no cynical operatic Taixetrand seemed inclined to
protest m this case against trop de Zelie!
Saturday.—Foreign affairs attracting the attention of the House.
Romeo et Juliette produced in French, and our "lively neighbours"
consequently put upon the footing of the most favoured nation.
Madame Melba (French, no doubt, for Melbourne) a capital repre-
sentative of Shakspeare's heroine. Her singing of the waltz in the
First Act had but one fault—it provoked the audience to ask for a
double encore. The Brothers De Reszke in great force. Monsieur
Edouard conducted the marriage service (fully ohoral) in a
manner calculated to cause the profoundest envy in the breast of
the most accomplished curate attached to St. George's, Hanover
Square; and Brother Jean "lightened up" the part of Romeo, by
wearing tights of an eccentric pattern. Chaff apart (as they do not
say in the Frenoh), both admirable. Smaller parts well filled. Signor
Castelmary distinguished himself as Le Due de Vtrone—this
accomplished person is a very good Duke, in spite of his appearance
in Faust having argued that he was a very poor devil. The whole
production (dresses, mise-en-scene, everything) worthy of the Poet,
the Composer, and the Manager.
Her Majesty's Opposition, to-night, "moved" Donizetti, and
L'Flisir d'Amore, the majority of a rather thin House voting
decidedly "in an affirmative sense." Mile. Giuseppixa Gargano
made a sprightly and melodious Adina, and Signor Cabacciolo a
sonorous and Lal-Brough-ish Dulcamara; whilst Signor Vicini,
whose voice is very pleasing in piano passages, found them to be by
no means " passages that lead to nothing " for in Nemorino's slightly
sentimental Romance, "Una Furtiva Lagrima," they led, on this
occasion, to a very vigorous encore, duly accepted.

PLEASURE OF A DANCE I'
THE SHAH'S HOLIDAY.
Nasb-ed-Dut toliioquiiet:—
Personally conducted!!! By the Seven Fountains of the Sun, it
is one of the accursed innovations of the modern muddle they mis-
call Civilisation to which a descendant of Darius finds it hard to
reconoile himself. Oh, for the Mario Carpet of Houssain the
Persian! When he, setting forth on nis travels, "took the road of
Samarcandc" he was not bothered with such " supporters" as mine.
Better the blessed Carpet of Bishnagar than the cheapest and most
carefully arranged Cook's Tour!
"His throne was in radiance like the bow of Heaven, upon which,
pre-eminent in majesty, he sat without observing the sceptred
potentates of the earth more than atoms in the beams of his presence."
So the old Persian tale said of a King. That was something like.
"Good old Persia!"—as a cockney cad would say. The "sceptred
potentates of the earth"—confound them!—did then not dare to
bother the Shahinshah concerning railway concessions or the free
navigation of Persian rivers. Whereas now, between the Bear on
one side, and the Lion on the other—but hist!—the brutes will
overhear me!
Oh, to be a fine old Persian potentate, one of the olden time!
"He fixed the rings of subjection in the ears of Fortune, and made
the Spring spreader of the carpets of his pleasure. Time gave the
reins of his party-coloured coursers into his hands, and Pride laid
the head of obsequiousness upon the threshold of his door of audience."
Lovely! Isatulla of Delhi, flowery wert thou in language, but
thine ideas of kingliness were decidedly O.K. Then, as Inatulla
said, "of all gardens that of rhetoric justly challenged the highest
fame." But now, to enter the modern Baar Danesn, or Garden of
Knowledge, even Nasb-ed-Din must pass through the portals of
forced politeness, on the arm of these rude rival brutes, who, to
imitate Iitatulla's style, endeavour to hide the greed of carnivorous
appetite under the gnu of diplomatic dissimulation.
As to the Bear, he is getting unbearable. Smirks like a Xautch-
girl, but snubs like a Shah in a tantrum. How affectionately—and
paralysingly—he grips my arm at this moment! On the whole I
prefer his frank menaces to his sinister caresses. Yet could I have
bowstrung him with my own hands when he boastfully and threaten-
ingly alluded to his bristling legions and my defenceless borders.
Like Daeianos in the coils of the serpent, I feel'' a shadow of power,
an object of impotence."
As to the Lion, he is better-mannered perhaps, but has he better
intentions P Keeps a tight hold of my dexter arm as though I were
an inebriated Bank-Holiday-maker, and he, what the batter-faced
infidels call, I believe, a "Bobby." Quite a little holiday! Yes!
Only somehow I feel as if I were being " run in."
That Bishnagar Carpet, now, would obey my orders, and not direct
my oourse. Forty purses were well expended upon its like. Better
infinitely than a Special Pulman. As it is, I feel that I am " on the
Carpet," in the coarse Western sense. Oh, for the wonder-working
aid of the fairy Pari-Banou to give these intrusive Infidels empha-
tically and finally " what for "!
No, by the beard of Zoroaster, were their Buckingham Palace
more beauteous than that of Pari-Banou herself— which it is not!"
—yet would I gladly shirk a second visit thereto did I dare. Nay,
even their grand orchestral musio—what they call "tuning-up"—
and the jocund gyrations of their nimble Nautch-girls—or Gaiety
"Choristers"—should not tempt me again into their brumous
Babylon, were I but absolute master of Prince Houssais's Carpet—
and of myself. But between Bear and Lion—not to mention the
fortuitous wing-flappings and incidental beak-proddings of certain
Eagles, one or two-headed—a Shahinshah's life is not a happy
one. How happ could I be without either! Hah! I begin to think
that life would be tolerable—even to an elderly Shah in difficulties,
but for its—Holidays!

We are told that the London Tram-car men are kept on their feet
some sixteen hours at a stretch. Poor fellows! Mr. Punch wonders
they stand it, and feels that they—and a sympathetic Public—ought
to make a stand against it. Let Public Opinion, as imperatively as

MR. PUNCH'S MODEL MUSIC-HALL SONGS.
No. VI.—The Chivalrous,
The Singer {who should be a large man, in evening dress, with a
crumpled shirt-front) will come on the stage with a bearing
intended to convey at first sight that he is a devoted admirer of
the fair sex. After removing his crush-hat in an easy manner,
and winking airily at the orchestra, he wilt begin :—
These 'a enthusiasm brimming in the breasts of all the women,
And they 're calling for enfranchisement with olamour eloquent:
When some parties in a huff rage at the plea for Female Suffrage,
I invariably floor them with a simple argu-ment.
Chorus {to be rendered with a winning persuasiveness).
Why shouldn't the darlings have votes '< de-ar things!
On politics eaoh of 'em dotes, de-ar things!
{Pathetically.) Oh, it does seem so hard
They should all be debarred,
'Cause they happen to wear petticoats, de-ar things!
Nature all the hens to crow meant, I could prove it in a moment,
Though they've selfishly been silenced by the cookadoodle-doos.
But no man of sense afraid is of enfranchising the Ladies.
{Magnanimously.) Let'em put their pretty fingers into any pie
they choose!
Spoken—For Chorus—Why shouldn't the darlings, &c.
They would cease to care for dresses, if we made them elec-tresses,
No more time they'd spend on needlework, nor at pianos strum;
Every dainty little Dorcas would be sitting on a Caucus,
Busy wire-pulling to produce the New Millenni-um!
Spoken—Oh! Chorus—Why shouldn't the darlings, &c.
In the House we '11 see them sitting soon, it will be only fitting.
They should have an opportunity their country's laws to frame.
And the Ladies' legislation will be sure to cause sensation,
For they '11 do away with everything that seems to them a shame!
Spoken—Then Chorus—Why shouldn't the darlings, &c.
They will promptly clap a stopper on whate'er they deem improper,
Put an end to vaccination, landed property, and pubs;
And they '11 fine Tom, Dick, and Harry, if they don't look sharp
and marry,
And for Kindergartens confiscate those nasty horrid Clubs!
Spoken— Ah! Chorus—Why shouldn't the darlings, &o.
They '11 declare it's quite immoral to engage in foreign quarrel,
And that Britons never never will be warriors any more!
When our forces are abolished, and defences all demolished,
They will turn upon the Jingo tack, and want to go to war!
Spoken—So Chorus—Why shouldn't the darlings, &c.
(With a grieved air.) Yet there's some who'd close such vistas to
their poor down-trodden sisters,
And persuade em, if they 're offered votes, politely to refuse!
Say they do not care about em, and would rather be without 'em—
Oh, I haven't common patience with such narrer-minded views!
Spoken—No I Chorus—Why shouldn't the darlings, &c.
And it's females—that's the puzzle!—who petition for the muzzle,
Whioh I oall it poor and paltry, and I think you '11 say so too.
They are not in any danger. Let 'em drop the dog-in-manger!
If they don't require the vote themselves, there's other Ladies do!
Spoken— And Chorus—Why shouldn't the darlings, &c.
[Here the Singer will gradually retreat backwards to the rear of the
stage, open his crush-hat, and extend it in an attitude of triumph
as the Curtain descends.
"The case in a nutshell "—or at least, if a nutshell may be con-
sidered as a hat, in a hat-box. In the Bishop of Lincoln's
prosecution, it was thought that the decision in the Bennett oase
would be of some weight. One objection to this was, that in future
the two would be quoted as "The Lincoln and Bennett" cases, and
so cause some confusion.

How will they manage to land the Shah attheSpeaker's
Stairs? How will they get him there? Will they smuggle
him on board at Greenwich, and bring him in a Penny
Steamboat, or leave it in the hands of the River Police?
Will he and his suite of seventy-three attendants be
conveyed by the London General Omnibus Company, and
escorted bythe Royal Horse G uards Band to Buckingham
Palace? Will the stair-carpets of that establishment all
be taken up, fresh straw spread on the floors of the State
rooms, and the furniture covered up, so as to Buit it to
the Oriental habits of its temporary occupants?
Will the Director of the Household supply the Shah
and suite, pending their stay, with free admissions to the
Baths and Washhouses in the Buckingham Palace Road?
Will His Majesty be suffered to make his toilette in
the State drawing-room, and wipe his muddy boots on
the blue satin damask of the over-mantel?
Will he, when he lunches with the Lord Matob,
present him with the stalks of his asparagus and expect
him to eat them?
Will he insist on bestowing the Grand Cross of the
Order of the Pink Hytcna on M. Tussaud?
Will he, during his visit to Covent Garden, send for
Mr. Augustus Harris and, offering to buy the entire
Corps de Ballet of him, expect him to cart it off to
BucKingham Palace as it stands?
Will the Crystal Palace Company secure him on a
Saturday, and making a feature of him, together with
"fountains and fireworks," manage, by the joint attrac-
tion, to score a decent financial success.
WiU the rival institution at Muswell HiU be able to
persuade him to go up in a Balloon and descend in a
Parachute before the admiring thousands who congregate
there daily to witness such performances.
Who will look after the Shah when the public Show-
men have done with him?
What on earth wiU Lord Salisbury do with him for
the two days that he is going to entertain him at
Hatfield? How will he try to counteract the effect of
the Czar's alleged threat of the "hundred thousand
bayonets"? Will he button-hole the SHAH^and do his
best to allay his fears at a Garden Party P Will he try
to pacify him by making him an Honorary Grand
Knight Outsider of the Primrose League? Or, will he
endeavour to impress him by showing him his poultry
and pigs? If not, will the Duke of Norfolk, who is
to have him next, be likely to improve on the occasion?
Failing this, who will be able to provide a programme
of excitement, change, and sight-seeing that will last
his surfeited Majesty out the entire three weeks he
purposes devoting to his inquiring stay among us?

HOOK AND LINE.
Happy Thought of the Great Eastern Railway Com-
pany to issue little pamphlets containing lists of houses
and cottages to let along their line, also farm-house
apartments, with names of owners, number of rooms,
terms, &c. Delightful associations conjured up by the
words "farmhouse apartments"—better still, if they
could keep the good old title of "lodgings"! Home-
made bread! Pure milk! Fresh eggs! And fresh air!
And purling (why "purling" P) streams! And daisied
and buttercupped meadows! All you have to do is to get
your pamphlet, and take your choice—of houses. The
list is a long one—you enter the lists, and you 're suited
at once t Then the G. E. R. also publishes little descrip-
tive leaflets of the districts it runs through—the Valley
of the Stour, for instance, which of course helps the
tourist greatly in fixing on his s-tour! He will probably
sing, "Mine be a cot beside the Great Eastern Railway
Line," and thank the Directors for directing his attention
to this crowd of would-be letters—this rural "letter-press"!

We have come across the sea from America the free,
And we guess it is to see how you are, John Bull.
We'd a notion that your bridges matched with ours were much like midges,
When compared with a big buffler or a bar, John Bull,
We have enterprise and nous, and a hundred and fifty thousand
Miles of railway, and the Washington monument, John Bull, _
But we 've seen in your small clearing some big works of engineering,
And a very jolly time of it we've spent, John Bull.
We have seen the Mersey Tunnel, 'tis a tidy little funnel;
The Manchester Ship Canal, and Bridge of Forth, John Bull.
And we find the land of Smeaton not so easily is beaten.
We have travelled East and West, and South and North, John Bull.
In your skiU we've grown believers, and those Forth-Bndge cantilevers
Lick the topping towers of Washington and Eiffel} John Bull.
And now we would say thankee on behalf of every ^ ankee
Who has had your hospitality, no trifle, John Bull.
At the Guildhall Banquet truly every toast was honoured duly,
And the Yankee Engineers received a bumper, John Bull.
The old " Star-spangled Banner," sung by r byer in a manner
All his own, made every Yankee heart a thumper, John Bull.
It seemed to float right o'er us as we all joined in the chorus,
And drank the loving cup in Civic style, John Bull.
Well, and here's three nearty cheers for Old England's Engineers,
Who make the best of your queer little isle, John Bull.
'Tisn't long, 'tis rayther narrow, but Laird, Bessemer, and Yarrow,
With Armstrong, Whttwobth, Maudslay, Fobd, and Kennie,John Bull,
And others quite as clever use thfir very best endeavour
To make their little land as good as any, John Bull.
We must presently go back, and when on the homeward track
The results of our excursion we shall tot, John Bull,
And shall find ourselves agreeing we have seen some things worth seeing
In the land of Telford, Stephenson, and Watt, John Bull.

A PACIFIC LAY.
"The American Consul in the Society Islands, Consul Dotv, hasjust married the beautiful
but dusky Princess Polona."—Daily Paper.
Mb. Doty was an enterprising Yankee,
An aggressive, imperious, go-ahead sort of cuss;
In New York he frequently became rather moody (but
not particularly Sankey),
Because the place offered no scope to bis undoubted
geni-us.
He said to himself, " I am in rather a ticklish position,
If I stay here, I may be driven to some desperate
deed;
I may become a murderer—or even a politician,
Though naturally to the son of scrupulously honest
parents (that's me) the latter possibility is horrible
to contemplate, unless one were in absolute need."
So Mr. Doty went off to the White House, and asked for
a berth,

And, having a good eye to the main chance, he determined to chance the perils
of the main.
He arrived at the Society Islands in perfect safety,
And seeing a comely Princess, bethought himself of a Safety Match!
"As an American Consul," he soliloquised with remarkable na'ivetS,
"I have a right to some Consul-ation, and I fancy I'm rather a catch,"
The wooing was short, in accordance with the habits of the nation,
For Consul Doty just told the King he doted on his Burnt-Um-berish girl;
And his Majesty treated the matter as an official communication,
And regretted that all the dowry he could aiford was one exceptionally fine pearl.

When his Father-in-law explained the usual rites where a cannibal Princess is

And Princess Polona herself boxed his ears in the vestry.
Because he had not provided some plump relations (cold) for the nuptial spread.

However, they served up his best man (a Yankee friend)

And the Princess's " going-away dress" was exclusively
composed of the teeth of some lively sharks.

"LE EOOTE-BALLE."
Offices of the Athletic Convention, Paris.
Monsxeub,—Havlno already expressed my views as to
the capabilities possessed by "Le Crioquette" for becoming
a national game worthy the attention of the young sport-
ing gentlemen of our modern France, I now turn me to
the consideration of your " Foote-Balle."
I have examined tne apparatus for the play you have
so kindly sent over,—the great leathern bag of wind
which is kicked, "Us Goalpoles," and the regulations for
the playing of the game, and have seen your fifteen pro-
fessional County kicksmen" engage,—I shudder as I
recall the terrible sight,—in a contest, horrible, mur-
derous, and demoniacal, with an equal number of my un-
happy compatriots, alas! in their enthusiasm and flan,
ignorant or the deadly struggle that awaited them in the
game in which they were about innocently to join. To
witness the savage rush of your professional kicksmen
was terrifying, and when, in displaying " le scrimmage,"
they scattered, with the kicks of their legs, my fainting
compatriots, who fell lamed and wounded in all directions,
I said to myself, this "Foote-Balle" is not a pastime, it
is an encounter of wild beasts, "un vrai carnage," fit to
be played, not by civilised sporting gentlemen, but by
cannibals.
But let me explain that it is not the kick to which I
object, for is not le coup de pied the national defence of
France? Indeed, in your own fist contest in "Le Boxe-
Match," is not to deliver a kick in the jaw of your
antagonist considered a meritorious coup, showing great
skill in the boxe-man? And do not our own garcons de
college kick a confrere when he is " down," and point to
the circumstance with a legitimate pride and satisfac-
tion? No, it is not le coup de pied which makes horrible
"Le Foote-Balle," but the conspiracy organised of tie
kicksmen—Les Demidos (the 'alf-backs), Les En A runts
(the Forwards), and the "Goal-keeperes"—all to kick
the leathern bag of wind at once, and so produce a
murderous meUe, in which arms, legs, ribs, thighs, necks,
and spines are all broken together, and may be heard
simultaneously cracking by any of the terror-struck but
helpless spectators who are watching the ghastly contest.
Viewing the game under this aspect, you will not be
surprised to hear that my Committee have, as they did
in dealing with "Le Cncquette" revised the rules and
regulations for the playing of your " Foote-Balle," so as
to suit it to the tastes and requirements of the rising
generation of our Modern France. I cannot at present
furnish you with full details of the suggested modifica-
tions, but I may inform you that it has been unanimously
decided that the " Balle," which is to be of "some light,
airy, floating material, and three times its present size,
is not to be touched by the foot at all, but struck lightly
by the palm of the hand, and thus wafted harmlessly,
with a smart smack, over the heads of the combatants.
As to costume, the game is to be played iu white satin
bed-room slippers, with (as a protection in the event,
spite every possible precaution, of "le scrimmage"
arising) feather pillows strapped over the knees and chest.
It is calculated by our Committee that the savage pro-
olivities of the game, as fostered by the terrible rules of
your murderous "Rugby Association," will be thus, in
some measure, coxinteracted.
Hoping soon to hear from you on the subject of your
Courses cTEsu, as I shall doubtless have some sugges-
tions to make in reference to the conduct of your aquatic
contests, receive, Monsieur, the asauranoe of my most
distinguished consideration,
The Secretary to tee Congress.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.


House of Commons, Monday, June 17.—Anticipation of quiet time
after holiday abruptly broken in upon. Something less than a hundred
Members present, when at Half-past Three Speaker called on Questions.
Old Morality in his place, looking round with nervous smile; Chaplin
ming large in corner seat below Gangway.
'Sat here and hereabouts, boy and mm, for twenty years," he said,
breathing gently on his eye-glass, ana meditatively polishing it with
cambric handkerchief. "What wisdom I have distilled! what eloquence
flashed forth! what pointed irony! and what withering scorn! Twenty
years a considerable slice out of an ordinary man's life. Not speaking
of G. 0. M., of course. Twenty years, more or less, nothing to him. On the whole, a
pleasant time, profitably employed, not only for contemporaries, but for posterity. Now,
changes imminent: new office created; corner seat will know my face no more; a Minister
of Agriculture added to the ranks of British Statesmen, and the Treasury Bench gladdened
by my presence. Must make the most of opportunities. Shall be pretty regular in atten-
dance below Gangway till Board of Agriculture Bill passes."
Chaplin musing thus; Old Morality viewing Opposition; Speaker looking down list
of Questions; when swift rustling heard behind Chair, and lithesome figure presses forward.
A cheer goes up from the Opposition side, and Grand Old Man, who everybody thought was
at least no nearer home than Dorset, takes his seat.
"Ruddier than a cheery, too," said Plunket, watching him as he skipped along.
"Don't wish him any harm, but really thought that after campaigning in the West through
the holidays he'd be a little fagged; like to go home and rest; instead of which he seems
fresher than ever."
"Yes," sighed Arthur Balfour; "to he eighty years young is sometimes more cheerful
and hopeful than to be forty years old."
Presently pounced on Old Morality, who had, without making a speech, moved Resolu-
tion to take over Tuesdays for publio business. Hair literally hristled with indignation;
voice shook with emotion. Was it possible that the Leader of the House, having such an
opportunity to make a speech, should pass it by? Old Morality, almost frightened out
of his life, tremblingly explained, that he really had meant to speak, but had proposed to
defer it till a later stage, when he might answer questions, G. 0. M, only hall mollified.
Old Morality hastily put in his statement.
Most Bills given up, including Sugar Convention. Great thing, ultimate aspiration of
Ministers, was to wind up quickly and get off early for autumn holidays. House cheered
this prospect. Adroit move; seemed to nave carried everything hefore it: when Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate interposed, and with admirable gravity charged Old Morality with
systematically aggressive conduct: hoped there would be an improvement in this respect.
Old Morality, at first thought this was a joke, and smiled his genial smile. But no

responsive flicker of amusement on faces round him. All looked
grave, sad, reproachful. Smile after few ghastly flickers, died off
Old Morality's face. Was it true? Could it be so, that he had
shown himself aggressive, bullying the House, trampling on the rights
of private Members, scaring his colleagues with scathing glances?
He bent his head in acknowledgment of the crime, resolved to fight
against his besetting sin. Business done.—Supply.
Tuesday.—Miraculous effect of waving of Old Morality's magic
wand. His masterly speech of yesterday has overcome all opposition,
smoothed away all acerbity, brought about a political Millennium.
"Talk about squeezing oil out of bladders on to the stormy seas,"
said Admiral Field "it's nothing to our great Captain's opera-
tions. I'm an old Salt of many years
pickle. Suppose I may say that I'm
the best stage sailor in the House, more
rollicking in my gait, more familiarly
uncouth in my speech, and more gene-
rally a nuisance than any other retired
Admiral. Feel I've a right to speak
on this as on any other matter, and I
will say that, for a regular storm-
soother, a patent dead-calm producer,
pipe all hands aloft and give me Old
Morality!"
More point than usual in Admiral's
remarks. House evidently made up its
mind to wind up business, and get ready
to make holiday with the Shah.
Grandolph, who was to have smashed
Georgte Hamilton in Committee,
salmon-fishing in the Champs ElyBees;
Charlie Berks ford still aboard the
^\ lighthouse; even the austere spirit of
!j, PjK Sage of Queen Anne's Gate subdued.
Votes put and passed without contro-
versy; thousands piled on tens of
thousands, and millions on millions.
By Half-past Ten the last Vote for the year in Navy Estimates
agreed to. Everyone makes believe it is in ordinary course of
things; not even a cheer raised. Then Fleet retires; British Army
assembles on the strand, and Stanhope moves successive Votes. The
Colonels prove as dooile as the Admirals; Vote after Vote passed;
only when midnight hour strikes, Committee pulled up, having
done more work in a single sitting than accomplished in the whole
of twenty-nine nights previously spent in Committee.
Business done.—Supply voted with both hands.
Thursday.—George Campbell managed to give a fillip to Debate
on Scotch Universities Bill. Didn't look as if anyone could do it;
but George, taking counsel with Dr. Clark, managed it. Debate
been on for several nours. Scot succeeded Scot with regularity and
despatch. English, Welsh, and Irish Members fled the soene. It
was Home Rule realised; Scotch Parliament debating a Scotch
measure. Joseph Gillis, whose judicial engagements keep him in
town, hovered around the back benches, casting benevolent regard
upon the scene. Particularly enjoyed the borea look of the Clerks,
and the lassitude against whioh Speaker bravely struggled. When
five or six Members rose together, competing for precedence,
Joseph's smile broadened, and his eye took on a deeper mist of tender-
ness as it fell upon the four or five who missed the chance and
resumed seat with woebegone look. After a while the pleasure
palled, and Joseph lightly withdrew, to return again at midnight
and see that no one by accident got his Bill advanced a stage.
Campbell and Clark each had speech to make. Rose with great
regularity when opening presented itself. Speaker didn't see them.
Oh! very well!" said the Knight of Kircaldy, "the time
will come when you shall hear me."
Lyon Playfatr, finding an opening, grew quite eloquent. "The
lion rampant o' Scotland," said he, "has been standing on its hind
legs, pawing the air." Curious to note how involuntarily the orator,
extending his hands, imitated gesture of the nobler beast.
At midnight Professor Stuart on his legs, "commenting with
satisfaction on the clauses for affiliation with local institutions with
the Universities." Only ten minutes left. Old Morality sent for;
hurriedly enters; planted himself on extreme edge of Bench, with
hands on knees and eye on the clock; familiar attitude, ready to
pounce. Stuart, catching sight of him, brought remarks to sudden
conclusion. Five minutes to twelve, and still time to divide. Then
uprose Knight of Kircaldy and moved adjournment of Debate.
Cry of despair from Ministerial Benches. Old Morality's emotion
pitiful to look on. Just missed his chance. If he moved that
"the question be now put," "the question " would be, not that Bill
be read a Second Time, but that Debate be now adjourned. Appealed
to Knight to withdraw. Clark said "No." He and Knight would
die first. Question put, that Debate be now adjourned; the Knight
relented; did not challenge Speaker's decision that Noes had it.
Therefore Debate might proceed. Clark rose to continue it Only
two minutes to twelve. If he spoke for two minutes Debate neces-
sarily stands adjourned. Critical moment. Old Morality, trembling
with exoitement, rose to its height. Almost tumbling off edge of
seat, he pounced. Closure was carried, with sixty seconds to
spare, and, just on the stroke of Midnight, Bill read Second Time.
"These are mad moments," said Old Morality, as he passed the
Lord Advocate's handkerchief over his moist and massive brow,
"that make old men of us before our due time."
Business done.—Scotch University Bill read Second Time.
Friday Night.—Ireland once more burst in at Evening Sitting.
Introduced by John Ellis. House went back to old topic like
reformed drunkard breaking out again. Benches filled; eyes
brightened; faces flushed; cheers and counter-cheers filled place.
Grand Old Man looked in, spoiling for a fight. Up half-a-dozen
times whilst Saunderson speaking. But no chance for Old Parlia-
mentary Hand. Arthur Balfour driven into last half hour of
sitting; John Morley crushed out altogether; Clancy delivered
tremendous oration; Saunderson lashed out in fine form. Then
Wind-bag Sexton took the floor, and all was lost. Stretched himself
and his speech over Half-past Twelve. Business done.—More Supply.
SOLDIERING AT ISLINGTON.
Three more days of the Military Tournament! Charming sight
at Merry Military Islington. Go and see the musical single-stick
drill by the boys of the Royal Military Asylum, Chelsea. Not a
single stick among them. What a good idea for rehearsing dull
actors P The "Single-stick Drill" eh? The Prince of Wales's own
Lancers—Dancers are as good as ever, and their musical ride is one
of the prettiest sights of the Show. So for the Gallant Heavies on
their magnificent chargers. The musical dumb-bell Sailor Boys
Drill is a fine sight. How the exercise opens their sea-chests! And
then to see them marching home gaily sucking oranges I "The Tug
of War," is exciting. This is a part of the entertainment calculated
to attract all Etonians, and I wonder your friend Mr. Dumb Crambo
hasn't drawn a youthful Eton Colleger squaring up at an Oppidan to
illustrate " The ' Tug' of War."
The Grand Finale of laying down a river, starting a couple of
banks— quite secure, and offering facilities for military investment—
of making a bridge in less than five minutes, of bivouacking, of
firing, fighting, killing, wounding, mending, marring, storming and

"The Camels are coming! On quick! On slow!"
capturing the fort, is admirably done. This portion of the show,
with the additional novelty of a specimen of the Camel Corps, is
under the command of Colonel Onslow, the Inspector of Military
Gymnasia, who has done so much to give an impulse to useful and
entertaining work. Then, when the battle is over, to see them pack
up, demolish the bridge, pull up the river (without any boat! quite
a marvel in itself), carry off the wounded, and ride and drive away
as blithe as thrushes in the early morn, sends all the spectators away
contented, except such as choose to stop for the lemon-slicing and
ring-sticking for prizes. Perhaps ere this appears the German Dogs
of War will be on view. In speed they excel bicyclists and horses,
and are trained to fetch and carry despatches. Retrievers capable of
retrieving the ill fortunes of war. Ah, que faime let Militaires.'
And long life to Major Marcus Tullius, the courteous and obliging
Cicerone. The Angel or Islington.

MON SHAH, CHAR-MANT.
Sib,—Now that the Shah is on his road to
our shores, it has occurred to some one to re-
member the condition in which Buckingham
Palace was left after his last visit. To say the
least, the recollection is not a pleasant one,
and can scarcely afford gratification to Lord
Salisbury^ the Duke of Nobfolk, and the
other obliging and patriotic persons who have
been so good as to promise to 'look after" his
barbario Majesty from " a Saturday to a Mon-
day." It is, perhaps, not too late even now to
make some slight alteration in the programme
which would at once protect the Royal pro-
perty, and sensibly increase the oomf ort of the
swarthy Sovereign and his eccentric suite. To
assist the Authorities (if they are willing to
adopt this idea), I beg to suggest the following
time-table:—
10 a.m. Grand reception of the Shah and
suite in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.
11a.m. State practical joke of upsetting His
Majesty and suite into the ornamental water.
12 noon. Great drying competition in the
sun on the top of an artificial hill, in which His
Majesty and Court will be invited to take part.
1 p.m. State visit of inspection of theSnAH,
attended by his Grand Vizier, to the coal-
cellars of Buckingham Palace.
2 p.m. Royal banquet. Specially prepared
luxuries for the Shah and suite, served in an
empty wine vault.
3 p.m. Prize-fight in a retired part of the
pleasure-gTounds, at which the Persian
visitors will assist in honour of His Majesty.
4 p.m. Siesta (in the loose-boxes of the Royal
stables) of the Shah and Persian Court.
5 p.m. "Five o'clock bones" served in the
same place.
G p.m. Visit to Spanish Exhibition, where
the Wild West Enclosure will be reserved as
a retiring-room for the Persian visitors.
7 p.m. Fireworks and a Bull-fight, subject
to the consent of the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals.
8 p.m. "Row-how-whack," or State Quar-
rel, in which members of the Persian Court
will take part.
9 p.m. The Shah, escorted by a squadron
of Horse Guards (Blue), will be conveyed to his
State Apartments in the Zoological Gardens.
10 p.m. His Majesty will take dinner in the
presence of the British Public.
They say His Majesty has much improved
since he was last here, so this change of pro-
gramme may not be so necessary as at present
it appears to yours, "Sweet Lavender."

"I must stop this," said Mr.

silver ink-horn to his lips, he sent
forth one circular note, clear and dis-
tinct. In obedient response to the
summons, fourteen Cabinet Coun-
cillors stood round tho Presidential

"Ten of you will accompany me to

Excitement at Dover.
Weather lovely. On board the New Calais-Douvres Mr. Punch
was received by all the L. C. & D. officials in full uniform, and
shown into the State Cabin. Here a Deputation of the Ladies of
England presented an Address and a magnificent bouquet. Then
the Private Orator returned thanks in a speech which would have
been ever memorable as one of the finest efforts in the English
language, had not Mr. Punch, to whom punctuality is of the
essence of politeness, ordered the cloture bell to be sounded, when the
Deputation withdrew as quickly as possible, and the Orator was
taken below.
The Scene at Calais.
Here the enthusiasm was indescribable. All along the quays, the
jetties, and everywhere about the harbour, the crowd was drinking
a "Punch d'honneur." Captain Blomfield, of the L. C. & D.
Navy, presented the courteous Chef-de-gare, the principal officials,
and the French representative of Robebt the Waiter, who in turn
presented the luncheon, on its arrival.

his wish to proceed.

as read."
Rejoicings in Paris! La Fin se La Gbeve!
Mr. President Punch's progress had been one long triumph all along
the line. His entry into Paris was an event the like of which, for
simple and touching grandeur, has not been seen within the memory
of man. The Cochers, all out to a man, beamed with joy, cracked their
whips and sides with laughing. Largesse and pourboires everywhere.

band and chorus, received Mr. Punch in the courtyard. After a
short speech from the Private Orator, Mr. Punch was conducted to
the State Apartments, specially reserved for him and five of his
suite. The remainder were taken to

Touching Ceremony.
It was here that Toby, M.P., wearing his collar, for it was a
"Collar Day," most reluctantly took leave of his kind master and
the luncheon, which he eyed wistfully.
"Sorry we cannot take you with us, Toby," said Mr. Punch, "but
you must stay at home and mind ' The House.' You can have some
chicken and a little Beaune at the Buffet. Your barque is on the
sea. Love to all at Westminster. Au revoir.'"
En Route.
"Better a luncheon ong root, and contentment therewith," began
the Marquis d'Ampstead, forgetful for the moment of the presence
of the President, who at once, raising his glass, drank to absent
friends." Robert le Francais did wonders with an apparently inex-
haustible basket. It was an entertainment equal to anything of
another Robert's—Robert Houdin—only infinitely more substantial.
Reception at Amiens.
When Robert with his trick-basket desefnded from the train,
Mr. Punch presented him with a gold medal commemorative of
the occasion. The chief officials were in waiting, the Private
Orator had already placed himself in an attitude near the book-
stall, in front of which an enthusiastic and respectful crowd had
The Continental Hotel,
Where the Treasurer dit " The Pard," The Bard, The Lightning Im-
pressionist, Mr. Cartoon Junior, and The Young Substitute
for the Unapproachable, were comfortably accommodated. The next
morning the first meeting was held at
La Tour Eiffel.
There was a discussion as to the correct pronunciation of this
word. "Man ami," said the President, taking off his hat to M.
Eiffel, and then looking up at the gigantic, but light and elegant,
structure, "I pronounce it—Marvellous!"
M. Punch visits M. Figaro.
"We cannot do better than procure a Guide-Bleu for the Exposi-
tion." observed Mr. Punch, "published by my friend Figaro, who,
as Fignro should he, is everywhere."
"Ah, bravo Figaro, bravo brarisnimo," hummed Mr. Punch
gaily, as, stepping out on the second platform of the Eiffel Tower,
he made his way to the Pavilion du Figaro, "d llo metres 73
centimetres de hauteur,"—hut there was not the slightest sign of
hauteur about M. Emile Berr, who, tret bien ilevi at that elevation,
most courteously received the Illustrious Visitor, explained to him

printing machines worked, and gave him " remeignments generaux"
of the most useful and comprehensive character.
After warmly shaking hands with M. Exile Berr, and saluting
the cheerful and polite compositors, Mr. Punch was conducted to the
lift by M. Eiffel, whom he sincerely congratulated on the success of
his vast enterprise.
At the Summit.
Subsequently, in company with the Great Originator, Mr. Punch
spent over an hour on the topmost storey, whence is visible the most
admirable panorama in the world, and in the Observatory he made
this one observation—" L'Exposition,—c'est La Tour Eiffel."
"Now, Sir," said Mr. Briefless, Q.C., of Grub Court, "it is
already twenty minutes past breakfast-time,"—but not another word
was requisite, and they descended by the lift
garden of the Tuileries. Alter a short rest, and an entire change of
costume, Mr. Punch drove to
Le Rendezvous Diplomatique, Aux Ambassadeuhs.
Here, as might be expected, the table, tur la terrasse, was covered
with "excellencies," while a crowd in the garden below from time
to time acclaimed with rapture the entertainment, which lasted on
"that lovely night in June" (Miss Damian's health andsong^!) until
11 o'clock. It was nearly midnight when Mr. Punch, noticing that
Mr. Briefless, Q.C., was speaking of a Cafe" Chant ant as a shaffy
kontong," thought it time to summon the voitures, and drive to the
Cafe de la Paix, where he considered that a refreshing iced drink
taken through straws, would revive the eminent Barrister. The last
straw, however, broke the Barrister's back, and murmuring some-
thing about "legal business of importance requiring his instant

MR. PUNCH AT THE GRAND HOTEL.
Au Restaurant Brebant,
where, out on the balcony, was served for him and his companions
an excellent dejeuner d la fourchette, a light and airy repast, with
plenty of moisture perfectly in keeping with the situation in nubibus.
"It is an eager and a nipping air," quoth Mr. Cartoon Junior,
as he helped himself to a "fine."
"JFYnw coronat opus," said The Philosophic Bard, following
Cartoon Junior's example.
After cigars and coffee, the party descended to the Beaux-Arts
Section, where awaited them an
Artistic Deputation,
headed by M. Maurice Bonvoisin, to whom the Journal Amusant
is the Krai Champ de "Mars," and M. Poirie dit "Caran d'Ache,"
in whose work Mr. Punch has always been deeply interested.
Accompanied by these Artists of Light and Leading. Mr. Punch
visited the most interesting and entertaining shows of the Exhibi-
tion, as well as the oleverly executed Panorama du Siecle in tie
attention," Mr. Briefless received permission to retire for the night.
On the third evening, being waited upon by a deputation from the
Francois to be present at a performance of V Etrangere, Mr. Punch
expressed his genuine regret that such a visit was not included in
his programme, as nothing would have given him greater pleasure
than to visit
La Maison de Moliere,
if he had not received a most hospitable invitation to be present at
a special evening entertainment
Chez Molier,
which he admitted was a horse of quite another colour. Here, while
the night was yet young, Mr. Punch enjoyed the humours of Le
Veau et le Paysagiste, the fun of Le Buste, and the capital burlesque
pantomime of Buffalo Bill's Show.
Le Retour d'Ultsse.
Early on "Wednesday morning Captain Churchward, L. C. & D.,

where, soon after 10 30, a sump-

The Drama in Paris.—With the Exposition, and splendid
weather, the Theatres in Paris ought to be having a bad time of
it. Yet there are nineteen still open, including the Opera, two
cirques and the Eden. Belle Maman, at the Gymnase, seems to
be taking the cake,—a small one, perhaps; and the Manager of
the Theatre Cluny has been bold enough to bring out a new Three-
Aot Vaudeville, Miel d Quatre, the motive of which seems to be
founded upon that of Le Parfum. The piece may be a trifle
risky, but it must be risky to bring out anything now to com-
pete against such "great attractions," as are offered by the
Exposition.

PUNCH
THE TOUR EIFFEL.
A FULL AND COMPLETE CUIDE TO THE EXHIBITION.
(Compiled in the Style of the French Newspapers.)
You wish to get there? Why not? First your ticket. Bought
at the door—one franc! Purchased at the Grand Hotel, seventy-
five centimes!! You may even obtain one just outside the entrance
for four sous! But the one purchased at four sous may be a forgery!
If it is, a sergent de villa will arrange matters with you, and
probably give you a new experience!!!
And now you are in the great Exposition! Your first impression is,
that the Government have annexed a large slice of Paris! You find
that the " right of way '| has disappeared from bridges, streets, and
galleries. If such a thing were done in England, the papers would
teem with indignant letters, addressed to the Editors. Do the
Parisians complain? Not in the least—it is simply carrying out the
idea of "Liberte", Egolili, Fraternite," at the nominal charge of
one hundred centimes per person. Long live the Republic!
"Vive la Liberte !" ought to have been inscribed over the Section
where " Liberty's Fabrics" are exhibited.
*
You pass under the canvas awning of an annexed bridge, leaving
on your left the Palais Gastronomique, and the theatre of Les
Fiili'es Parisiennes, and on your right the Pavilions devoted to
the glories of two sister governments, the Mexican and Argentine
Republics, supported by a railway station. You can leave these
objects (with the Trocadero at your back, full of casts of ancient
sculpture) safely for inspection until you visit the Exposition for the
489th time; if you do not visit the Exposition as often—well it
doesn't'matter I And now you are at the Tour. It is certainly
immense, and so are the crowds waiting to go up itl There are two
ways of going up.
Plan Number One.—Wait an hour in the first crowd round the
bureau for tickets up to the second itage. Wait two hours in like
manner on the second etage for tickets for the troisieme itage. Fight
your way to a seat after each wait, feel "jumpy" (especially during
the last ascent—deuxieme to troisieme etage) from first to last, get a
view of Paris which might be equally well obtained from Mont
Valerien, and—come down again! ^
Plan Number Two.—Get at once and without any difficulty a
ticket at the bureau for the premier Stage, and go up to a restaurant
(that of Russia is the best) at an altitude of about the summit of
St. Paul's. Stay an hour, or an hour and a half. Allow yourself
five minutes for the view—the rest for refreshment. Come down
again and see whether you can decide which was the sweeter—the
air or the champagne tres tec!
Having disposed of the Tour Eiffel as you imagine (it wiU be only
in imagination, as you will find it in models and pictures, everywhere)
you can turn your attention to other matters. Make for the Beaux
Arts, and do the pictures. But, first admire the group of sculpture
round the statue of Chancy. And although Gastronomy is certainly
a fine art (and consequently very properly, here you will find the chief
restaurants inclusive of Safin's) ao not forget the pictures. England
represented by Millais, Leighton, Solomon, Fildes, Watts, and
gentlemen nearly equally illustrious.
General impression created by the picture-show,—" Seen nine-
tenths of this before, and would not mind seeing a third of it again."
•
Pictures done, and there remain the Galerie des Machines and
the Groupes Divers. Well, the last are like the usual things at
Kensington, Yienna, Australia and America. International selection
of leather, cotton, pottery, furniture, brass, wall-paper, clothes,
jewellery, and clocks and watches. You may spend five minutes or
(if the Exposition remains open long enough) five years in lookinjg
at the interesting display—if you are pressed for time, perhaps it
would be wiser to limit yourself to five minutes!
* •
*
Galerie des Machines .'—Biggest room in the world, full of work-
ing machinery. Compared with the Jubilee collection at Manchester,
objects superior in quantity but inferior in quality. Exit, and you
will find at hand the Cairo Street and the bits of Old Paris, whioh
would be startling in their novelty had not the same idea been
worked out in the British Metropolis years and years before!
• 4
4
Grounds left—and right. Fountains—illuminated, and others—
shrubbery. Make for the toy railway _ station to the left of the
Tour Eiffel. You start. The little engine puffs, and bangs a gong.
You rattle away, and your_ attention is drawn to a request,
written on the walls, in English, French, Greek, Russian, Spanish,
and Hebrew, to "respect the trees, and not to put head and arms
out." You jerk along, just shaving a tunnel here, a road there, and
some shrubs yonder, until, you stop at the " Station Alimentation."
En route, more shaves, another station, and you find yourself landed
at the terminus of the Ouai D'Orsay.
j> , • • . P~ ■ * - j

There are yet a few odds and ends. You will find them in front
of the Hotel des Invalides. Some concerts—which are not to be
recommended, as they are unworthy of a country fair. French
Colonies, Ministry of War, with guns, balloons, ambulances, tents,
mineral waters, and a Panorama (to wind up) of Tout Paris. This
last costs an extra franc, which may be cheerfully expended by a
loyal Briton wishing to see how much imagination a French artist
can display in painting the portrait of the Prince of Wales I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Junk 29, 1889.
•ARRY IN PARRY.
Dear Chablie,—You'll twig by the paper this oomes from a Parry hotel;
It's the great " Contmongtal," my pippin', the pick of the proper and swell.
I'ma doin' my Parry on prance, I can tell yer, dear boy, and no kid;
And an English Milord on the scoop carnt be equalled at blueing a quid.
Oh them spondulicks, Chablie, old pal, 'ow they 'andicaps dashers like hus!
Still I've spread myself out pooty sparkling, dear boy, and it might 'are
bin wus.
There's a party I know lives in Parry, got pieces, and well in the swim,
And this pal's put me up to a lot I should never've seen but for him.
This 'ere Grand Expersition. dear boy, is a town in itself, and no kid.
If you'd wandered about it for hours on the 'unt for a friend, as I did.
You'd have thought 'twas as big as all Brompton, with Battersea Park, say,
chucked in,
To do the thing proper all round would want weeks and a hatfull of tin.

There's miles of it, Charlie, I tell ye. It covers the big Chump der Ma,
And stretches hout like a large Hoctopus 'eaven alone knows 'ow far.
I quite lost the run of it, swelp me, found Guide Books and Plans little use,
And the paths was that endless and gritty I wore out my best pair o' shoes.
Bazaar bizness, lots on it? Yus; but there's larks in them bloomin' bazaars,
Some sights as would knock a mere juggins, and make even 'Arry see stars.
Arab dancers, dear boy, dark-eyed donas in shawl-patterned togs on the twirl.
One on 'em a fair champion wriggler; I got reglar mashed on that girl.
Not our form of the mazy, my lad; she teetotummed about on her toes,
Whilst her mates drummed and soraped like Jemimer. 'Twas one of the
rummiest shows
A gal with her body all hinges aint my style of partner, exact.
But if dancing means wild wiggle-waggle, she did take the cake, that's a fact.
The East must be 'ot and no herror! but podgy young minxes arf drest,
A-wobbling their 'ips to wild music seemB nuts to the swells of the West.
Whether Tunis or Egypt perdooced 'em their ways wob not pooty or nice,
And for beauty a ioe-gal from Peckham would lick 'em two times out of twice.
Then the Tower, dear boy! Ah, that Tower! I guess I've the gift o' the gab
But this 'ere is a case where description falls flat as a sole on a slab.
It's a bloominger sky-scraping Topper; Jack's Beanstalk in iron! Oh my!
Good old Babel may take a back seat, for the Eiffel is boss of the sky.
Just fanoy a big iron tortoise a-straddle in Trafalgar Square,
With a lighthouse of girders and rivets about arf a mile in the air
Aperch on its back; all Bank Holiday chucked into lifts
and let loose,
To grub, swarm, and cackle, all over it! Fanoy—but
lor, wot's the use?
Fancy chucks up the biz as too big for her. Paris jest
now is the Tower.
The Chump may be like a bazaar, and the Bor der
Boolong like a bower,
But to eat, drink, and smoke, on the Eiffel, and brag of
the " stages" you've done,
Is the treat of the whole blooming Show, and the pick of
the whole blooming fun.
To grub arf a mile in the air on a balcony 'ung in blue
space,
With mankind like black beetles below, and the clouds
nearly flicking yer face,
Gives yer storberries quite a fresh flaviour, and lends a
new charm to yer smoke.
From the top of the Eiffel, old pal, all the world looks a
jolly good joke.
When you go to a Show, my dear boy, and must travel
about it by rail.
And take trips—say, from Tunis to Java, a oove's parts
oi speecn Beem to tall.
If I piled it on thick for a ream, I should still 'ave a lot
left to pile,
So we'll jest leave new Babel a bit, and trot back to the
city awhile.
I've done all the Caffys in turn, mate, and as to the
tipples—well, there!
'Ardly know 'ow I worked through 'em, Charlie, and
managed to keep on my hair.
Nasty syruppy mucks, many on 'em; the waiters are
slippy and neat,
But I couldn't, somehow, make 'em see as they mixed all
my lotions too sweet.
Here, Gassong! sez I—"Via Mossoo !"—Now, regarday,
sez I, "mong onfong,"
Donnay mor unq—er—squash—par trow doo, lei—cr—
last was like treacle gone wrong,
Didn't twig, but fell back upon "Commongt" the
Frenchified form of our " Wot?,"
/fell back on a " Bock," sort o' beer as is prime when it
isn't too 'ot.
In fact, mate, I Booked it tremenjus, for wosn't it sultry?
Ah, just!
And the fust thing I picked up in Parry, dear boy, wos
a thunderin' thust!
I 'ad Books on the Bullyvards, Bocks on the Tower, at
all the rum shows,
In faot, Charlie, "Hangcore ung Bock!" wos my
motter from starting to close.
Wot I like about Parry, dear boy, is the general alfritky
all round.
(Al frisky means out in the open) wherever you sit there 'g
a sound
Of feet and /takers (that's cabs), rustling leaves, chinking
glasses, and song.
And I must say the slapuppest lark is to sup at a Caffy
Chantong,
Our "Healtheries" game wasn't in it with—say the
"Ambassadors." Ah!
Fanoy pouching your prog on a terrace, with crack Comic
Singers lah-bah;
Green leaves, pooty women, gay mashers. Tam-tam!
Potato!! Patapouf!!!
Great Scott! I could go it for hages, if only I'd more of
the oof.

bandbox, dear boy,
Talk of Lumps of Delight! It's all dazzle and yum-
yum, a place to enjoy;
The crame der lar crame of the rosy and rorty, mate.
Thanks to my friend,
I 'ad wot is ere called the ongtray; and him and me went

I wasn't quite fly to the patter, not always, French chaff may he prime,
But it flew a bit over my 'ed, and I felt in a fofj arf the time.
Still, when one of the ladies, a sparkler, got quoting " Two Lovely Black Eyes,"
Wy, it put me at 'ome in a jiff, though I answered, " 0, wot a Surprise!"
At night-time they squat at round tables of marble, mate, under green trees,
The Frenchies, men, women, and young 'uns, in parties of twos or of threes.
Buz-wuz goes the Bullyvard bustle, chok-clack go the Voytures, and loud
Above leaf-rustle, glass-chink and ohat sounds the tramp of the orderly crowd.
Spicy cards, snapping cigarette-cases, rum himages, all sold as free
As Bhirt-studs or sticks in Cheapside! There ain't no bloomin' fiddlededee
Of mealy mock-mndesty, Charlie, about the dashed Froggies, that's flat,
As their funny offi -hees or posters will prove. But no more about that.
It's the whole world packed into a field, spreadin' out by
the side of the Seine,
A Babel of talk, with the Tower ohucked in, travelled
over by train,
Full of palaces, parks, and pavilions, bazaars, buffets,
brasseries—tor!
When I foxed the whole thing from the Eiffel, it struck

And went in for more Bocks and loud barnies, estonished the Gassongs, no doubt.
Our true English manner of greeting, a dig in the ribs and a 'owl,
Seemed to kibosh the Frenchmen completely, and some on 'em did a fair scowl.

And my stror and striped flannels fair flummoxed 'em. Scissors! our style made

More than all the Moors, Arabs and Chinamen found in that rum Iioo der Caire.
Bill and me did that quarter completely. Rode races in queer Chinese cars
Drawn by lemon-skinned Johnnies in 'ats like hextinguishers. Made 'em see

We did, at the caffays and sing-songs, a gammon der Parry's all there.
But when 'Arry is well on the swivel he makes Cairo donkey-boys stare.
They are nice cups of tea, and no herror, fair cautions for patter and cheek.
Then—but, there, I can't tell yer a tenth of the larks if I yarn for a week.
It's a reglar fust-class fair eye-opener; a Big Thing, dear boy, and no kid.
I can't patter or picture it out, and you couldn't eaten on if I aid.

And enough grubbing places chucked in, mate, to feed

If you get tired of padding the hoof, there are foiooey

1889.
From Calais to Paris. Quite First-Class.
"WHAT, GO YOU TOWARD THE TOWER?-'
King Richard the Third, Act. III. Sc. 2.
The Pharos of Egypt, the world's Seventh "Wonder,
(If poets feign not and historians don't blonder)
Must take a back seat amongst marvels quite minor,
Since France pitted stable strong fact against fable,
And beat at a bound all the rivals of Babel,
Where men do not swarm up in lifts, smoke or dine, or
Crowd on to and into. That old liar. Pinto,
His credulous hearer would hardly dare hint to
Of such an imposing, colossal, Titanic,
Earth-striding, sky-climbing, huge mountain metallic.
Which schemed in the epoch of structures termed phallio
As something Satanic had raised a world-panic
Lutetia's long-spined, wide-straddling, young giant
Though huge, to the canons of beauty is pliant,
"What marvel it acts like a world-lighting beacon
And draws to its Hare all the earth's birds of passage?
Curiosity draws both in clever and crass age,
Its hold on mankind wit and wisdom wont weaken.
See, see how they muster, and crush, crowd, and cluster!
With what wild wing-flappings, what bluster and duster.
These birds which can scarcely be called " of a feather,"
So varied their plumage; but yet with wild rumpus
From every conceivable point of the compass,
With far night convergent, they 're flocking together,
With twitter and squeal, and with crow and with cackle,
"With all shapes and colours of pinion and hackle,
Cocks, eagles, and owls, birds of paradise, pigeons,
Great condors and ospreys, and gulls, quite a lot of 'em,
Some vultures (he'd help the great world who'd get shot of 'em)
And bantams, and boobies, and wild-ducks and widgeons,
All species of creature that flutters on wings there,
The harpy that preys, and the warbler that sings there,
Come, drawn like tne gulls to a lighthouse, with power.
And Punch owns that there is attraction, for Paris
Has managed to blend Vulcan swart with sweet Charis
For once in her Titan-like world-witohing Tower.
VOCES POPULI.
At a Parisian Caf£ Chantaitt.
Scene—An open-air restaurant in the Champs-Ely sees; the seats
in the enclosure are rapidly filling; the diners tn the gallery at
the back have passed the salad stage, and are now free to take a
more or less torpid interest in the Entertainment helmc. Enter
Two Britons, who make their way to a couple of vacant chairs
close to the orchestra.
First Briton. "EntrSe libre," you see; nothing to pay! Cheaper
than your precious Exhibition, eh P [Chuckles knowingly.
Second Briton (who would rather have stayed at the Exhibition,
hut doesn't like to say so.) Don't quite see how they expect the thing
to pay if they don't charge anything, though.
First B. Oh, they make their profit out of the dinners np in the
gallery there.
Second B. (appreciating the justice of this arrangement, having
dined with his companion elsewhere). Well, that s fair enough.
[Feels an increased respect for the Entertainment.
First B. Must get their money back somehow, you know. Capital
scats for hearing, these. Now, we '11 just take a cup of coffee, and
a quiet cigar, while we listen to the singing—you'll enjoy this,
/ know!
[ With the air of a man who knows the whole thing by heart;
the Waiter brings two tumblers of black coffee, for which
he demands the sum of six francs; lively indignation of the
Two Britons, who denounce the charge as a swindle, ana lake
some time to recover sufficient equanimity to attend to what
is going on on the Stage.
Female Artiste (sings refrain)—
"Pour notre Exposition,
II faut nous faire imposition!" &c., &o.
Second B. (who not biing at home in the language, rather resents
his companion's laughter.) What's that she's saying?
First B. (who laughed because he knew there was a joke about the
Exhibition.) Eh (—oh! I '11 tell you afterwards.
[Hopes his friend will have forgotten all about it by that time.
Second B. (pertinaciously, as the Singer kisses her hand, and rushes
precipitately offstage). Well, what was all that about?

[June 29, 1889.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
First B. (who, upon
reflection, finds that he
hasn't the faintest idea).
Oh, nothing very much
—more the manner,
you know, than any-
thing else—it's the men
who nave all the really
funny songs.
[A Male Artiste ap-
pears, bowing and
kicking up his left
leg behind: the First
Briton bends forward
with an anxious
frown, determined to
let nothing escape him
this time. Fortu-
nately, as M. Char-
lemagne, the Comic
Singer, possesses a
powerful voice, the
First Briton is able
to follow most of the
words, from which,
although they reach
his ear in a somewhat
perverted form, he
contrives to extract
intense amusement
This is how the
Chansonreacheshim.
Seul boulevard Bilent
vous arrete:
Quand monde a tout
depart d'amas,
[He can't quite make
out this last word.
Repondez vitement—
[Something he doesn't
catch.
Le fou l'eau sitot vous
crie "un rat'."
[Here he whispers to
his friend that
"That last line
was rather neat."
Refrain {to which M.
Charlemagne
dances a gavotte
with his hat thrust
into the small of his
back).
II n'a pas depart
Dinard.
[This makes the First
Briton — who once
spent a week at Di-
nard— laugh immo-
derately.
MR. PUNCH'S FANCY PORTRAITS.

/
M. EIFFEL.
"Our Artist's Latest Tour de Force.
M. Paulus
One of the Niggers
to the other. "Ha—
George Washington,
Sax! I'll warm you
fur dat ar conduck f ")
First B. (in a supe-
rior manner). Oh, yes;
you soon get into the
accent.
[Later—M. Charle-
magne has re-ap-
peared, and sung a
song about changing
his apartments, with
spoken passages of a
pronouncedly Pari-
sian character.
First JJ. (who little
suspects what he has
been roaring tcith
laughter at.) That fel-
low really w amusing.
I must take Nellie to
hear him some night
before we go back.
Second B. (dubi-
ously). But aren't some
of the songs—for a girl
of her age—eh?
First B. My dear fel-
low, not a bit! I give
you my word I haven't
heard a single line yet
that was in the least
offensive—not a single
line! Anybody might
go! Look here—it
P&lcsse next; now you
listen—Ac '11 make you
laugh I
[The great M. Paulub
appears and lings
several " Chansons"
in a confidentially
lugubrious tone, and
with his forefingers
thrust into his waist-
coat pockets. Curi-
ously enough, our
First Briton it less
successful in follow-
ing M. Patjlus, than
he was with the
Artistes who pre-
ceded him—but this
is entirely owing to
the big drum and
cymbals, which will
keep coming in and
putting him out—
something in this
manner:—
Ne Pa, ne Ma!
C'etait pas tant, mais eais comm <^a—
II n'a pas depart Dinard,
II non a pas certain-y-mal la!
First Briton (to Second Ditto). Very funny, isn't he?
Second B. (who—less fortunate than his friend—has not caught a
single word). Urn—can't say I see much in it myself.
First B. (compassionately). Can't you? Oh, you'll get into the
way of it presently.
Second B. But what's the joke of all that about " Pa "?
First B. (who has been honestly under the impression that he did
see a point somewhere). Why, he says he's an orphan—hasn't any
Pa nor Ma.
Second B. (captiously). Well, there's nothing so very funny
in that.'
First B. (awing up the point on consideration, as M. Charlemagne
skips off). Oh, it's all nonsense, of course; these fellows only
come on to fill up the time till P&lusss sings ( feels rather proud of
having caught the right pronunciation). P&lusse is the only one
really worth listening to.
Second B. (watching two Niggers in a Knockabout Entertainment).
I can follow these chaps better. [ Complacently.
Et quand j'rentr', ee n'est pour rien—
Ma belle me dit; "mon pauv' bonhomme,
Tu n'a pas l'air de "—(The cymbals: brim-brin-brien!)
Ell'm' tlanqu' des giffl's— (The drum : pom-pom-pom-pom!)
Befrain (which both Britons understood).
"Sur le bi—sur le bu; sur le bo, de bi, de bo.
Rur le bo—sur le bi; sur le bi, de bo, de bi!" &c, &c, &o,
First Briton (after twenty minutes of this sort of thing). That's
the end, I suppose. They've let down the curtain. Capital, wasn't
he? I could listen to him all night!
Second B. (as they pass out). So could I—delightful! Don't know
when I've enjoyed anything so much. The other people don't se<
to be moving, though. (Consults programme.) There s another Part
after this. Patjltjs is singing again. I suppose you '11 stay?
First B. Well—it's rather late, isn't it t
Second B. (much relieved). Yes. Not worth while going back now
(with a yawn). We must come here again.
First B. (making a mental resolution to return no more). Oh, we
must; nothing like it on our side of the Channel, y' know.
Second B. (with secret gratitude). No, we can't do it. (Walk back
to their hotel in a state of great mental exhaustion, and finish the
evening with a bock on the Boulevards.)
