PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PRETACE
SCENE-The top of the Tour Eiffel, TIME-The Eve of the New Year.
Present, Mr. Punch and Toby.
Mr. Punch (quoting from his friend the Poet Laureate).
"I
stood on a tower in the wet.
When the New and the Old Year met.”
Humph! ALFRED, you were unfortunate in your weather.
(You are not in your new poem, however—nor is the world.)
Wonder what tower it was? Not the Tour Eiffel, anyhow.
(Improvises.)
Ponch stands on a Tower in the right,
As the Old Year takes its flight;
And the star-rays shower like rain
O'er the City by the Seine;
O'er the site of the mighty Show
That in shadow stretches below,
Silent, where lately beat
The tramp of a million feet;
Still, where a while ago
Such a tide of life did flow;
Dark, where Lutetia's air
Was gay with her summer glare ;
Ghostly, where —
TOBIAS, what are you looking at? Do you see a ghost ?
Tobias. Whack-wow-wow !
[Crouches and quivers.
Mr. Punch. Toby, Toby, be not alarmed !
Come, bear thee like a Sage's dog,
And do not droop thy tail!
By SmaksPEARE and the Psychical Society, he does see a ghost, though. Who is this, slowly“ materialising," like a Mahatma,
before my very eyes? Spirit of BEAUM IRCHAIS, Shades of Mozart and Rossisi, I should kuow that short Spanish jacket,
that jaunty cap, that jimp figure, that espiègle physiognomy. It is, it must be, mon wni Figaro himself. Largo al factotum!
Ah ! braro, FIGARO ! bravo, bravissimo!!!
Figaro. None other indeed ! Well met, in good season and suitable place! The Sage of Fleet Street and the Barber
of Seville encountering on the top of Paris's Babel Tower, just before the dawn of the Jour de l'An, is a sight for gods and
men,-could they see it.
Mr. Punch. “ Two on a Tower,” as my friend Thomas Hardy might say. Would the witty watchmaker were here
to make a third. Pierre Augustin Carox, surnamed of Beaumarchais, has never yet perhaps been quite fully appreciated.
Figaro. Sir, I salute you! The compliment to my spiritual progenitor sounds pleasantly in my cars.
Mr. Punch. Les beaux esprits se rencontrent ? But wits well met surely never foregathered so singularly. Lucian
and CHARLES LAMB talking a-top of Cheops' Pyramid, what time Memnon awaited the music-stirring sun, might perhaps be
“in it” with this encounter.
Figaro. You were here before, when the Great Show was at its height, n'est-ce pas ?
Mr. Punch. Is it not written in the book of the chronicles of the Visit of the Punch Staff to Paris ? Which of course
you have read ?
Figaro. Upon the advice of M. Extile Berr-yes. But here we are, higher than even the “ Pavillon du Figaro,"
" à 115 mètres 73 centimètres de hauteur." And what a panorama is spread before us—to the mind's eye ! Wider even than
the Panorama of the Year in your Christmas Number, Mr. Punch.
Mr. Punch. I perceive that you keep au courant with the best literature and art of the time, friend Figaro.
Figaro. Else would the Shades be somniferous indeed. Notre Dame still towers là-bas, notwithstanding Paul Bert
and Company. And there stands the simulacrum of that Bastille, the destruction of which BEAUMARCHAIS lived long enough
to witness. "Tout Puris" is therein expressed. They say I " did no little towards preparing the way for the Revolution,"
that the Mariage de Figaro effected even more than the Memoires towards bringing contempt upon the institutions of the
old régime.” Fitly then was the Pavillon du Figaro perched high on the Tower whose erection was part of the celebration
of the Centenary of the Year of Revolution. And yet—-
Mr. Punch. " BEAUMARCHAIS, in spite of all his wit and energy, was not naturally a revolutionist.” Neither am I.

'Tis the “flies on the cart-wheels" who prate most of Revolution. Like you, I am "partout supérieur aux événements, loué
par ceux-ci, blâmé par ceux-là, aidant au bon temps, supportant le mauvais, se moquant des sots, bravant les méchants.” Yes,
" aidant au bon temps,” but not turning the world upside down in search of an Utopian Paradise of Fools.
Figaro. Mr. Punch, I also spake of myself as “ faisant la barbe à tout le monde.” But even I could not " shave" you !
Mr. Punch (singing).
“My comb and my razor,
My lancet they praise, or
My scissors for trimming stray locks into grace."
My dear FIGARO, your razor, or lancet, and my báton, should be co-operative, not antagonistic. “ Se moquant des sots,
bravant les méchants !" There lies our joint function !
Figaro. And how do you fulfil it, Mr. Puxci?
Mr. Punch. I, the FIGARO of Fleet Street ?
Figaro. That, and much more!
Mr. Punch. Graciously said, but truly withal. My instruments are pan-pipes and drum, yours is the guitar. But I am
Moralist as well as Musician, Sage as well as Shaver, Bard as well as Barber, Warder as well as Wit,-have in fact a whole
world of varied functions that even the Factotum himself never aimed at fulfilling. As you say, yon scene, stretching far and
wide from the foot of this Tower, suggests my Panorama of the Past Year! A scene of Changes and Chances, of Catas-
trophes and Centenaries, of Revolutions and Royal Flights, of Wandering Princes and Flying Pretenders, of Mighty Reforms
and Brave Rescues, of Social Upsurgings and Great Strikes, of Big Commissions and Colossal Shows! As my pointer
indicates, so my bâion should direct. It is a sort of universal wizard-wand, or cosmopolitan sign-post, conspicuous as this
Titan Tower, sensitive as the fabled Divining-Rod, unerring as the gnomon on the sun-dial of Old Time himself. Sages,
Heroes, and Wits gladly accept its guidance, as Fools, Knaves, and Quacks shrinkingly fear its force. BISMARCK, EIFFEL,
Sranley, as well as McDOCGALL, BOULANGER, and BARNUM, recognise, each in his own way, its influence. True as the
Magnetic Needle, straight as the tail of TOBIAS, it “rides the whirlwind and directs the storm " of contemporary events. And
you, my brave Barbier, would fain know“ how it's done,” as Dr. Lynn would say. Take, then, what will enlighten you
on that, and on most other points, as well as move you to honest laughter that is not merely a mask for menacing tears.
You hastened to laugh lest you should be constrained to weep. I laugh that the world may not weép, but be merry and wise.
Take, my dear FIGARO, what will tell you all about it, and make your New Year happy! Take, in short, my

"A NASTY ONE!”
OR, “OH, WHAT A SURPRISE !”
A Sensational Scene in the Modern Corinthian Ring.
"
a
A CURIOUS incident occurred a few days ago, during
an evening gathering of Corinthian patrons of the Fancy,
at a celebrated and highly " select " Sporting Pub. in the
neighbourhood of Westminster, kept at present, as those
"in the know” are well aware, by that hospitable and
high-bred host, BOB SALISBURY, better known in fistic
circles as SWELL SOLLY.
For some time past SOLLY has taken huge interest
in a very promising young Pug, in whose pretensions to
first-class" form mine host of the “Št. Stephen's
Arms” has unshaken belief. The youngster was "intro-
duced " in the first place by old "HARDSHELL GIFFARD,"|
commonly called "The Chancellor," but it was well
known that youngBILL LAND” had the invaluable
backing of that Modern MENDOZA, crossed with Gentle-
man JACKSON, favourably known to all prominent Sports
of the period as “ould” BOB SALISBURY. BILL was,
indeed, commonly spoken of as “ SOLLY's Novice," and
great things were expected of the pet protégé of so
experienced a judge of fistic promise.
BILL had, indeed, at the St. Stephen's Meetings on two
occasions, been taken on ” and put through his facings,
in a quiet sort of way, with undoubted success, and
great satisfaction to his chief backer. BILL seemed a
well-set-up, young fellow, as capable of taking, gruel
as of administering it, and was thought to be highly
popular all round in Corinthian circles.
As the Transatlantic lute-thrummer puts it, however,
things are not what they seem” always, and a secret
simmering, sort of hostility to SOLLY's Novice had un-
questionably been observable (by the acute) among the
sportive top-sawyers in the habit of assembling at the
St. Stephen's Arms." Young Bill, was thought by
some of the tradition-tied old-stagers to be a bit bump-
tious in his bearing, and disposed rather to ignore some
of the ancient "rules of the ring,” and go in for what
they considered "flashy” innovations in tistic “style,";
which, though taking enough to the groundlings, did
not meet with the approval of the elder Corinthians.
BILL, they maintained, was hardly “respectful” enough
to his elders and betters, was inclined to sligặt the

Ah! this is the land where men hustle and hurtle,
And e'en at their feeds seem to race against Time;
But 'tis also the place where the Love of the Turtle
Makes crowding endurable, hurry sublime.
I know the spot, I have tasted the wine.
To see the Madeira once more richly shine
In the slender-stemmed glasses, and sniff its perfume,
More sweet than big gardens of Gúl in full bloom,
Is worth travelling far, though the Briton 's a brute,
And the voice of diplomacy never is mute ;
And the tints of the towns, and the hues of the sky,
With mud-lakes and bitumen-filled valleys might yie.
Still the virgins are fresh, and the dishes are fine,
And as for their thick Turtle-soup, 'tis divine !
'Tis the Land of the West, uncaressed by the Sun,
But no doubt, as before, I shall have some good fun.
Ah! 'tis sixteen long years since I bade it farewell,
And strange tales to this day of my doings they tell.
Yes, once more I am here ; so's that sly, Western WOLFF!
'Twixt the present and past there's a tidy wide gulf.
If a Diary once more the SHAH deigns to pen,
Some contrasts will show twixt the Now and the Then.
Yet at bottom the whole situation 's the same;
There's small change in my fix, or the Giaour's sly game.
A cordial reception? A warm welcome? Bah!
Do they think they see green in the eyes of the SHAH!
At Gravesend-detestable name!-I was met
By Princes and Dukes—the old mutton-faced set,
Rather grizzled perhaps, some gone shiny-topped. Ab!
Time will not even spare a sublime Shahinshah!
But no matter! Whilst bowstrings and hair-dyes abound,
I shall well hold my own-on my own Persian ground.
However, to-day to the City I turn;
To the Mansion House Banquet my bosom doth yearn.
The great Civic Turtle and I are old friends.
Ah! "doth not a meeting like this make amends"
For the infinite boredom and insolent fuss ?
Dear Turtle! I knew you would welcome me thus !
What! affected to tears, Turtle? Come to my arms!
My long long lost friend, how sublime are your charms!
Come! keep up your pecker, and tip us your fin,
For I love you, old boy—and I long to begin!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FALSE NOTE FROM HENLEY.
Regatta Week, 1889.—It is satisfactory to be able to
state that the arrangements of the Thames Conservancy
this year are admirable; but it must be well understood
that I make this statement on my own personal responsi-
bility. I may add, that nothing could have been more
delightful than the original idea of the Authorities, to
ballot for stations on the river. If this had been carried
out, no doubt many persons who let out house-boats
would have reaped a golden harvest, to the anger of
those old owners who year after year have taken an
infinity of trouble to secure a “coin of 'vantage” beside
the river's bank. Well, it would have been a fair
exchange, hire for ire ! However, the Conservators at
the last moment reverted to the old custom of first come
first served. And is everybody satisfied ? Well, I will
not go as far as that; but I can, at any rate, say that
I am !
For Henley is certainly delightful. No trouble about
the steam-launches, which, of course, are not allowed to
come so near the "river residences" that illumination is
an impossibility-oh, no, nothing of that sort allowed this
year. And I make the satisfactory announcement on my
own personal authority!
And are the people on the banks satisfied? Well, I
say so.
It is an open secret that the landowners are
only too pleased to have as many house-boats as possible
in front of their grounds. They revel in the view of awn-
ings and kitchen funnels. Who says so? Why, I do.
And you may ask me for my signature. You may
wish to learn who is so satisfied with Henley and its sur-
roundings. You may like to find out the name of the
enthusiast who considers the Thames Conservators the
best possible Conservators, the owners of the Thames
house-boats the best possible persons, the riparian land-
holders the most unselfish of proprietors? This curiosity
is easily satisfied. So I append my signature. In
guarantee of my satisfaction, content, and delight, I
sign my name. Who then is satisfied with this year's
arrangements at Henley? Why,
NOBODY!

and in that capacity once returned thanks for his Illustrious Chief
and the Rest of the Royal Family), shall only have £1500 for the
present. Mr. DAVIES promptly, as an "amendment,” moves that
£1500 a year is ample. "Mister" ROSEBERY suggested that "the
Pride of Mill Hill and Rickmansworth” (as I think we may fairly
call Mr. DAVIES, as he was educated in those sparkling localities) has
not moved an amendment, but only used an adjective. Then Mr.
HORSLEY, to set things right as a civil, a very civil, engineer, pro-
poses that the salary of the ci-devant representative of the Prince of
WALES and the Rest of the Royal Family shall have £2000 a-year.
Upon this we have a real treat. The Patriot BURNS-whose sweet,
gentle voice, and nice ear for the use of the aspirate is a joy for ever
interposes in his customary winning manner. It is pleasant to see
him as he stands addressing the Mister, with his bright aristocratic
face, his commanding stature, his well-fitting clothes, and his spot-
less linen. Of course, he objects to Sir PETER receiving more than
£1500 a-year, for the Patriot is an economist, and in his opinion, the
learned gentleman indicated is already receiving a salary out of
proportion with the services rendered. Moreover, the kindly BURNS
mildly intimates that he considers that some of the sentences lately
passed by Sir PETER are “simply disreputable.”. Called upon to
withdraw the expression as inappropriate, the Patriot, with the fine
feeling for which he is justly, celebrated, substitutes" disgraceful
for “disreputable.” Then the storm continues, until "Mister"
ROSEBERY feels it incumbent to inform “the Pride of Mill Hill and
Rickmansworth” that something or other he has said is immaterial,
and to tell Mr. DAVIES that he cannot withdraw his Amendment
without the consent of the Council. Then we have the Closure, and
a Division of 73 votes to 7.
But our troubles are not yet finished. We are treated to a long
wrangle over a report of the Corporate Property Committee, which
keeps the Council hard at work until eight o'clock. When the
Chairman at length vacates his seat, I cannot help thinking that he
must regret his acceptance of office. For when all is said and done,
the Earl of ROSEBERY is a gentleman and a scholar, and holds
Cabinet rank as a Statesman. Surely someone else of less distinc-
tion would do equally well to preside over such worthies as the
Patriot BURNS, "the Pride of Mill Hill,” and the rest of them!

NOT IN THE NEWSPAPERS;
Or, What our Illustrious Guest saw in Bacterial Billingsgate.
It was early-very early-on a fine July morning,
when two striking, though evidently carefully disguised
Personages might have been observed worming their wet
and winding way with much difficulty amidst the chaos
of vehicles of all sorts, from a railway van to a coster's
barrow, which cumbered all the approaches to what Mr.
J. LAURENCE HAMILTON, M.R.C.S., has not inappro-
priately termed Bacterial Billingsgate. Despite their
elaborate mufti, consisting in each case of a waterproof,
a sou’-wester, and wooden-soled shoes, the discriminating
eye might have detected the Sage of Fleet Street and
the Star of Ispahan.
The latter slipped up over a slimy and malodorous pool
on the much-cracked pavement of the market, the jerk
arresting an obvious yawn which had begun to distort
the swarthy symmetry of the royal features.
"It is early,” he muttered, apologetically,
“An Oriental Luminary should, like the sun, rise
early," said his companion, sententiously.
My gorge rises, anyhow, and readily enough,”
responded the Star, sniffing distastefully.
*Ah! Civic Banquets and florally decorated theatres
are all very well in their way,” remarked the Sage.
But this scene is more really characteristic of our
sea-washed Isle, and one of its great staples.".
"Is it ?" snapped the Star. “Well, it looks very
dirty, and it smells very nasty. Bismillah ! What is that?"
Only the tail of a half-frozen cod-fish. I hope it
has not damaged the royal eye.”.
"But why," asked the Star, “do these dirtily-draped
hordes of burden-bearers dart about in every direction
in this distracting way? And why do those others, at
intervals, howl so distressingly? And why do those
vociferous vendors stand cramped up in nooks and corners,
surrounded closely by a damp crowd of customers? And
why are the floors like muddy pools, and the slabs like
reeking gutters? And why is there so little suggestive
of the sea and so much suggestive of a sewer? And
why is it impossible to stand, or move, anywhere without
getting wet-footed, and dust-besprinkled, and scale-
covered, and permeated with the peculiar fætid odour
which pervades the whole place ?”
“These questions, and others which suggest them-
selves," replied the Sage, “can only be answered in one

And if that wasn't a complement, Í shood like for to kno what wood

By the by, I'm werry much greeved to hear as that sum few of our
unexpereenced extra Waiters got theirselves into great disgrace by
their unwaiter-like conduck. That they must have been born fools
as well as mere Green Horns is proved by their showing their bad

Why, if they had behaved badly before a lot of Dooks and Wicounts
it woodn't have been of half so much himportance, becoz they carn’t,
by harf-a-dozen words of complaint in their reports, like the others

that sum of us about spiles the public as regards Waiters. Of

Upon the hole I feels inclined to say, as Wensday's recepshun of

the world, and the large number of the Corporation Leftenants, as

number of Royal Carridges and Royal Hosses, was about the most

His Royal Madjesty behaved werry kindly to me on parting. For,

It having come to the knowledge of the
General Commanding at the Pillar-to-Post-
Office, that the Public are under the false
impression that the Department is intended
for the convenience of Her Majesty's sub-
jects, the following regulations are now issued
for their better information :-
1. When a telegram is superscribed in such
a manner that the receiver can only be ascer-
tained by a momentary reference to the Post-
Office Directory, the despatch will not be
delivered, as the Department does not under-
take to consult Directories for the purpose of
amplifying addresses which the senders have
curtailed apparently to reduce the charge.
It must be understood that the object of the
Department is to cause the Public as much
expense as possible, and to disturb the leisure
the female officers have for chatting with one
another and engaging in flirtation with suit-
able persons on the other side of the counter,
as little as practicable.

THE POLL OF HIS HEART!
NEW VERSION.
AIR—" His Heart was True to Poll.”
“I must go to sea,"
Said CHARLEY B.
As he sang the good old song;
“When a tar wants to fight,
He doesn't do right
To stay ashore too long.
For there are such rum 'uns
In the House of Commons,
Red tape-ist old pig-tails, droll!
They won't mind my defection,
And I shan't seek re-election,
That's not my sort of Poll.'
But-
To PoLl my heart is true,
And 'POLL' means the Jacket Blue,-
It's no matter what I be,
On the turf or an M.P.
To Poll my heart is true!"
Chorus.
His heart is true to POLL!
His heart is true to POLL!
No matter what he be,
On the Turf or an M.P.,
His heart is true to POLL!
So he spoke out his mind;
And immediately resigned
His Parliamentary seat;
For says he, “Belay, I shall
Come back an Admiral
When once I've joined the Fleet.
Just give
me a command,
No more I'll stop on land
To be a figure-head or wooden doll,
For wherever I may wander,

For my heart is true to POLL!
Refrain (with resignation).
No pol), but true to POLL!
No "poll,' but true to POLL!

What Doctors call my “vital force"
Is all expended ;
I've headaches sometimes rather bad,
And, on the whole, I'm very glad
The Season 's ended.
At garden parties oft one gains,
On damp lawns, queer rheumatic pains;
And talks idyllic
Beneath wet trees whence falls a spray,
Lead to the acid, doctors say,
Is salicylic.
From a hot concert-room or ball,
Neuralgic pains will oft befall
A hapless maiden ;
While over-ventilated rooms
Are like so many living tombs,
With phthisis laden.
And whether one is host or guest,
The wily plumber does his best,
Methinks, to kill us;
Within his untrapped drains there lurks
What no one all his lifetime shirks,
The gay bacillus.
I'm tired of pleasure's endless round;
My voice has quite a feeble sound;

To think I need some stringing up,

The hideous bustle at last is dead.
Come and talk of the beast a minute!
Never again will flourish, it's said ;
What on earth we women saw in it,
Or why we liked it, is hard to discover ;
Only the world is a nicer place,
Now that the pest called a "* dress-improver"
Is'improved, by Fashion, right off its face.
There's the tall hat, too, which they say is doomed,
One rather liked it, or viewed it with awe,
Till one sat in a theatre, and far away loomed
A rampart of feathers, frilling, and straw,
Hiding the stage, the footlights, and all,
Save perhaps the top of a paste-board tree;
Oh, then one's fingers did certainly crawl
To fling a book at the filigree !
But, some day, in Fashion's whirligig,
The monstrous bustle, the Eiffel hat,
May arise once more, even twice as big,
For our great-grandchildren to wonder at.
Well, that's Posterity's matter, not mine.
The one thing now is to put up a hymn
Of praise, and of hope that, when new suns shine,
Good taste may flourish instead of whim!

Was furnished forth with bladders twain.
How the peas rattled! List, oh list!
The Mob is prompt in Motley's train.
Sweet on its ears attentive swells
The music of the Cap-and-bells !
The Jester sang, the Jester rode,
And flicked the ass's lengthy ears.
The patient creature he bestrode
With voice as loud as chanticleer's,
But less articulate, brayed out
A strident music on the air.
The pea-filled bladders played about,
When lo! the clarion's martial blare
Countered across the forest dells
The music of the Cap-and-bells.
There came a clump of steel-clad knights
Along the high-road's sandy way.
Their lances gleamed like wandering lights,
Their leader he was old and grey,
But martial still, and still erect;
Their steeds came pacing, pacing slow,
With cautious hoof and circumspect,
Following the bugle's brazen blow;
Better, they deemed, than mobdom's yells,
Or music of the Cap-and-bells.
The Jester rode, the Jester's glance
Fell mockingly on knightly mail,
And pennon proud, and lifted lance,
And ordered chargers head to tail;
Fell on the grey but gallant chief
Who led the careful cavalcade.

TEHERAN was in mourning. The inhabi-
tants went about their avocations silently and
gloomily. There had not been a public
execution for nearly a fortnight, and thus it
seemed that the business of the State had
come to a standstill. The cause of this un-

found in the Palace.

return from Europe he had seemed to lose all

The Prime Minister again struck the earth

"Nothing would give your slave greater
pleasure, your Majesty, than to behead BROCK,

1. P. You are right. You, no doubt, are aware that
I have the greatest possible objection to expressions that
might be considered by a Curate (much less by an Arch-
bishop) of a too forcible character.

words to the same effect.
1. P. It is not my custom, Sir, to say all I think, when
my thoughts are of a painful character! But let that
pass. You are aware that the Royal United Service
Institution enjoys an annual subvention of £600 from
the War Office and Admiralty, and pays a ground-rent
to the Government in respect of its present premises of
£205 a year?
The C. I quite understand the stress you lay upon the
word " present.
I. P. Yes, Sir, we have notice to quit, and this notice
has been hanging over our heads for nearly twenty years.
In 1872 Mr. Lowe stated that he would recommend the
Government to grant assistance in placing the establish-
ment on a permanent footing. In 1876 Mr. W. H. SMITH,
then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, declared "that
the Government fully recognised the value of the Insti-
tution, and that, when the proper time arrived, its
claims should be duly considered.” In 1881 and 1884 the
Institute received assurances from the Treasury that
those claims should not be lost sight of.
The C. And nothing since has been done?
I. P. Nothing-save the Government have intimated
their willingness to pay the ground-rent of any site
(less £205) that may be selected, on condition that the
Institute finds its own building. This would entail a
cost of £30,000, an expense that our scanty funds would
not allow us to incur.
The C. Well, your Royal Highness, what is the
alternative proposal embodied (as I understand) in your
memorial ?
I. P. That, following the precedent established in the
cases of the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries,

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
AGRICULTURAL DISAPPOINTMENT. The
description you furnish of your newly-in-
vented machine for "chaff-cutting, riddling,
sifting, and bagging fresh straw,” is very
interesting, and if it had not unfortunately
got out of order, owing to the accident to
which you refer, and so prevented you from
offering it in competition, you, no doubt,
would, as you contemplated, have taken a
prize with it at the Great Windsor Show.
The arrangement of the knives seems very
ingenious ; but it is a pity that they sliced
off the fingers of one of the scientific experts
you got to examine the machine; while, of
course, it was more to be deplored that, when
set in motion to show its action, it should, by
some mischance, have caught up and riddled,
sifted, and bagged the other. It is satisfac-
tory, though, to hear that he is progressing
favourably in the local bospital; but we can
quite understand how the presence of such
à foreign body must have damaged the
mechanism of your carefully constructed
machine, and can heartily, sympathise with
you in your consequent disappointment at
its temporary derangement.

In either the Row or the House.

Are thinning; St. Stephen's is left
To rowdies and riders of hobbies,
And boobies of manners bereft.

With eloquent anger, half sham,
Of the Marquis's eloquent blunders,
And BALFOUR's base battering-ram.

Packed juries, and patriots in thrall,
Couched all in the dullest of dictions,

" OUT IN THE COLD!”
A Song of the Civil List. AIR—“Whar the Corn-Juic: flows."
Paterfamilias sings :
My Son, before you settle down in life, and make a start,
And fix your choice on Literature, on Science, or on Art,
I have a word to say to you, it will be wise to hear :
For an unlucky genius the prospect's mighty queer,
You 'll own that this conviction one's unable to resist;
If you will do'as I have done, read down the Civil List.
Some things are illustrated there you really ought to know;
So take stock of the quarters
Whence
The Pensions
Flow.
Civil List Pensions were, at first, intended to lend aid
To-Well, not to the Peerage, or the Services, or Trade.
They have their little pickings in a very many ways,
And get their share of pudding, as a rule, as well as praise ;
But writers who have missed their tip, or painters who have failed,
And savants upon whom the gifts of life have hardly hailed,
Were thought to have a special claim-but, ah! 'twas long ago !--
Upon official quarters
Whence
The Pensions
Flow.
And verily, my hopeful son, the Soiences and Arts
Afford precarious footholds to poor human brains and hearts;
And you to protoplasm or Pelasgic lore may yield
Your life, and find those regions far from a Tom Tiddler's field.
You may paint Ideal Pictures to a very great extent,
And find you'll have to die before they'll yield their cent. per cent.,
Like MILLET's canvas marvels; life is short, and fame comes slow,
And that's why the fund they started
Whence
The Pensions
Flow.
That's why-at least they said so. The endowment of research,
The providing of old Genius, when down, a modest perch
Above the slime of Poverty for its declining days,
Is a thing for which humanity has little else but praise.
But then that's only theory, and theory, you see,
Is grey, as your great GOETHE says, unlike Life's verdant tree.
If you will try Fame's steep ascent, all right! but ere you go')
Take stock of that queer region
Whence
The Pensions
Flow.
It is very curious reading, as the Times remarks, this List,
And some singular conclusions one's unable to resist.
Twenty-five thousand annually is not a vast amount ;
To supply for luckless Genius a charitable fount.
It might keep a Lord-in-Waiting, and a Silver Stiok or two,
But the Muses' luckless yotaries must be fortunately few
If the valid claims of such of them as fortune has brought low,
Do not absorb the fountain
Whence
The Pensions

If you chanced to be descendant of a great Ambassador,
Or of Somebody distinguished in Diplomacy or War,
Or a high Police official, you would doubtless get a dip;
Or if your great grandfather was commander of a ship,
Or was murdered'in Kamstchatka, or indeed if you should be
An expatriated

Then the high Official Wisdom would not probably say No!

PUNCH TO THE POET LAUREATE
On His EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY.
POET of passion pure and tempered strength,
Our England's pride in these hysteric days
Of fevered fancyings, and of fretful lays;
We bless kind fate that gave thee golden length
Of life and singing-season. Still sing on !
Thy manly music ill our hearts can spare,
Fresh as the balmy breath of English air
Rolling o'er gardens e'er the rose is gone,
And mellow as the flutings loud or low
That haunt the laurels round an English lawn.
May rosy radiance as of Summer dawn
Lighten the lingering eve whose footing slow
Softly approaches such a son of song,
So loyal, and so reverent, so unstained,
As since Spring first on English meadows rained
Largess of blossoms, scarce hath joined our throng
Of native minstrels. Live! Our restless day
Beholds no brow so worthy of the bay !

in sometimes through the latticed window, as I do, and
see some little London urchin, ensconced in the only
armchair, enlightening the family on the ways of the
Town, while the flaxen-headed children stand by, open-

cottager says nothing, but smokes his pipe on the settle,
marvelling at the wisdom and knowledge of his youthful
guest, and receiving enough new ideas to last him for a
twelvemonth to come.
“Unfortunately they are not all like that. Not very
| long ago I saw a painful little scene at the garden-gate
of one of the cottages. The Vicar's Wife was seated in
her pony-carriage, while a stout, pleasant-faced woman
was denouncing the conduct of the small boy who had
been billeted upon her. They could do nothing with
him. The first night he came, he had refused to sleep in
the room upstairs, because such a smell came through
the window-and it was only honeysuckle, too! Then
he had stoned the hens, and beaten the pig, and pinched
her little girl till she cried, and behaved generally like
the turbulent little ruffian he was. There he stood,
listening sullenly to the charges against him, with an
impenitent scowl on his hardened, low-browed coun-
tenance-he was certainly not an engaging-looking boy.
So the Vicar's Wife told him that he did not deserve to
stay where he was, and that he should be sent back to
London the very next day. He made no answer, but I
knew what he was thinking. He was thinking that he
had thrown stones and ill-treated the animals because
he felt bad and didn't know of anything else to do; that
he had hurt the little country girl because she had made
him feel how bad he was. That the little girl hated
him, but he didn't care. That when he got home next
day, his father would beat him, and he didn't care for
that either. That everybody was a beast, and he wished
he was dead. The cottager's little daughter was standing
shyly by, her round freckled face very flushed under
her sunbonnet; her mother had made her show the
bruises on her arm where the naughty boy had pinched
her, and she felt sorry and ashamed, particularly when

1e90,
SPORTING SUBSTITUTES. - That, after invit-
ing a distinguished party, including, among
others, a Peer, two well-known shots, and a
French Marquis, who has come over to see
some English " sport,” to the place you have
rented, as you thought, "cheaply,” in Suffolk,
"to have some shooting,” to find at the
eleventh hour that you have taken it under a
total misapprehension, and that not a single
acre of shooting goes with the letting, is indeed
a trying and awkward situation in which to
find yourself placed, and one that will test
all your ingenuity and resource to meet with
equanimity. Your first idea of buying up all
the available pigeons in the neighbourhood,
turning them brown by dipping them into
Condy's Fluid, and letting them
loose in the
adjacent fields, and trying to palm them off
as a peculiar sort of “local partridge,” might
perhaps have passed muster with the French
Marquis, but would have been sure to have
been detected by the British Peer and the
other practised sportsmen of which your party
mer
consist; and we think you did wisely in
abandoning it. Your purchase of the thirty-
five young turkeys you mention, which, with
a view to making them savage, you are fat-,
tening up on a diet of dog-biscuit, gin, and
Cayenne pepper, seems a happy thought; but
whether you will be able to persuade your
guests, as you hope to do, that they come
of a stock of genuine American wild turkeys,
which you yourself introduced into the
local woods some seasons since, remains to
be seen.
THE PROPER WAY of MAKING “A Haggis.”

it was confided to you, as you say, by "the

&tracted from The Diary Y TOBY.M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, 'August, 19.-As
many pages of this Diary bear record, I have pro-
found respect and admiration for JOSEPH GILLIS.
His simplicity of character, his directness of pur-
pose, his genial bearing, his enlightened mind, and
his oratorical gifts ever attract me. JOEY B., as
was written long ago, is sly-dev'lish sly. No
use impecunious member of the community whose
financial interests are entrusted to his care coming
round him with pleas about drawing a month's, or
even a week's, salary in advance. JOSEPH, without
causing wing of friendship to moult a feather, ever
understands their blandishments. He knows what
he's about, and generally accomplishes his end,
performing the maximum of public good with the
minimum of personal estrangement.
To-day JOSEPH shines in new and brighter light.

enthusiastic and low-born inventors have existed in Stage-land

testify.
But for all that The Middleman (produced at a moment when the
sweater is attracting more than usual attention) is a good sound

his mark in polished villainy, he has also appeared to advantage in the
pathetic comedy of such a part as the faithful retainer in the Amber
Heart, but never before has he had a cbance of showing us what he
can do with an entirely sympathetic and many-sided character, -a
character which rises at times almost to the dignity of tragedy, and
pet narrowly escapes occasionally the broad humour of old-fashioned
farce. Now that Mr. WILLARD bas been seen in The Middleman,

somehow, on the spot to his entire satisfaction.
Have you ever seen a Mesmerist who gives a glass of water to the
subject on the platform, and says to him, “That's excellent port,
isn't it?" and the helpless mesmerised person replies, with gusto,
“Yes, it is ;" then immediately afterwards, while sipping the same
water out of the same glass, the operator, with his mesmerising eye
on him, says fiercely, “Why that's champagne, good dry cham-

adds, "it struck me that Monday would be a better day for Clovelly,
as there wouldn't be so many cheap-trippers about. But just as you
please." And how does this end? Why, of course, “Our Own
Mr. Cook" sees the reasonableness of this suggestion, and the day
fixed for the excursion is Monday. Her day, you see, after all, and
not Mr. Cook's.
Another lady of our party is Miss BRONDESLY, JENNIE BRON-
DESLY, She can never utter three consecutive sentences on any
subject without laughing, opening her eyes, and raising her eye-
brows, as if in a chronic state of surprise at the idea of everything
and everybody, occasionally stretching a point to include herself,
being so utterly ridiculous. She is most enthusiastic and energetić
in her manner. She energetically affirms that she cannot possibly
go up that hill-"He! he! he l'Oh no!-I really can't go up a
sort of an upright ladder like that !—too absurd, you know !”
Here she goes into a shriek of laughter, and tries to suffocate
herself with her little scented pockethandkerchief rolled up tight
into a ball. Then, having protested, with intermittent hysterical
giggles, that "it's positively impossible for her to climb an inch,"
she suddenly dashes up the ascent, putting her head well down and
butting at the hill, which she takes, there and then, by assault.
On achieving a height of quite fourteen feet above the level of the
road, she stops short, puts her hand to her side, as if utterly
exhausted, and exclaims, "There!” in triumph, as she waves the
miniature pockethandkerchief, and, like the little dog in the nursery
rhyme, "laughs to see such fun.”
"Oh, I couldn't jump down that precipice!” she cries, and is
then violently shaken by a spasm of laughter, as she stands on the
top of a bank. “Oh, I couldn't! Oh, Mr. Cook, you never expect
me to jump down that, do you ?” More uncontrollable laughter.
"Why," she cries aloud, convulsively, "I
shall be like QuinTUS
What's-his-name, who threw himself into the something or other ! ”
Here she almost falls off, so overcome is she by the egregious absurdity
of the resemblance.
"Nonsense !” says her young friend BLANCHE NETLEY, brusquely,
in her short sharp way, which always sounds as if she were dictating a
telegram. “Jump down. Nothing. You can.”
"Oh! can I?
" cries Miss BRONDESLY, hysterically. “Are you
sure P-well "-here a few bars of the giggle symphony,—then she
continues, "I'll try-only-he! he! he - you'll have to pick
up the pieces and send them home to Papa.” And then, with
another hysterical laugh, she gives one hand to the Poet and another AR
to COPLEY, and down she comes as light and as safely as a gazelle,

LEY, severely, making up a telegraphic message of eight words. replies, trying to repay her in her own coin. But, from a short
distance off, she only shrieks with laughter at him, and crying out,
“Oh, Mr. MARKHAM, how can you be so rude !” she giggles more
than ever, and wanders down the mountain side, waving the strongly-
perfumed kerchief, and walking with a sort of swagger, which young
HARRY SKRYMMAGER, our dashing mountaineer, calls“ putting the
mountin' side on."
We all like Ilfracombe. First as a central place—easy to get to,
and to get away from. It has the advantage over Lynton of
possessing a railway station. Some persons pretend that Lynton
has the advantage over Ilfracombe in this respect. The drives, rides
and walks are varied and all lovely. Happy Thought.-North Devon
is so hilly, there being scarcely a mile of level road anywhere, that,
“the Switchback” as a means of ordinary locomotion might be
brought to perfection here. The lines could be "in pleasant places"
alongside of the high roads.
Ilfracombe is described in some guide-books as “this fashionable
watering-place." Thank goodness, it is nothing of the sort ; at least
not what I understand by the term. But is a most delightful country-
and-seaside place, of which and of our party more in my next.

WHAT MR. PUNCH'S MOON SAW.
TWENTY-SECOND EVENING.
11
"I was up quite early the other day!” said the Moon,
so early, indeed, that the Sun had not begun to cool
down, and it was really painful to see how warm he had
made himself. I must say, for my own part, that I do
not consider such unnecessary exertion as he takes at all
dignified or in good taste, and if I found myself unable
to do my shining without overheating myself, I should
make way for some luminary who was more equal to the
work. However, I am the last person to obtrude myself,
and, as he seemed determined to go on with the thing, I
had nothing to do but look on and wait until it pleased
him to retire. There was not much doing amongst you
men that afternoon; at least, everything seemed quiet
and sleepy about the old ruined Castle, which I have
known in the days when it was strong and splendid.
Just then the custodian of the small museum in the
keep was dozing in the heat amongst the battered Saxon
skulls, the rusty and ragged shirts of mail, and tracings
of mediæval brasses which decorated the walls; outside
stood an easel, with a sketch of the ruins, all out of
perspective, but the painter sprawled on a bench in the
shade, asleep, too. I looked down into the old tilt-yard.
The only living things to be seen there were a stately
Stork and a grey Guli. The Stork paced up and down
slowly, absorbed in profound meditation : now and then
he was obliged to stop and stand on one leg to recover
the thread of his ideas. For a time I thought it must
be some mathematical problem that he was endeavouring
to solve, but at last I discovered that he was really
trying to hit upon some means of getting rid of the Gull's
society without hurting his feelings, for he was a con-
siderate old Stork. The Gull, meanwhile, either did not,
or would not, perceive that it was in the way; it kept
pace with the Stork with an affectation of being on a
tooting of perfect equality and familiarity, which was
most offensive.
“But what especially annoyed the Stork was that
this intrusiveness of the Gulls was not even disin-
terested. The Gull really admired the Stork, and was
glad to be seen about with him; I believe it even imagined

from some gross miscalculation or mistake. The head-keeper, abso-

I got it from an advertisement, which I subjoin. It ran as

I lost no time in securing this, as it struck me with its "spreading"
powers, it was just the sort of gun for a beginner. The Bulgarian
Count, too, seemed well provided for sport, for he took with him his
chalgzar, or native mountain blunderbuss, a formidable-looking
weapon that has to be fired from a large iron tripod stand, and will,
I fancy, much surprise and annoy the other “guns” told off to shoot
with him in his batch. The Indian Chief, on the other hand, simply
armed himself with his chilliwallah, a sort of boomerang, with which
he expressed every confidence he would be able to knock over a
partridge without killing the dogs. Talking of dogs reminds me
that I must not forget to mention that, having no sporting dogs of
my own, and not knowing where to find any in a hurry, I closed
with a bargain, and at the last moment purchased three black
poodles, which, however, the vendor assured me were “up to any.

I presented myself at my sporting host's place, and found myself,
as I have already stated, the next morning after breakfast, one of the
remnant of the 127 guns left waiting on the lawn to begin the day's
sport. And I will here just jot down my notes of the day's pro-
ceedings, taken on the spot at the moment.

I am glad to say that the Band does not descend to collecting

one halfpenny) that it is to have, before the Season closes, a two-

success, for the poor, lone, melancholy regimental band without the
regiment is a very good one.
And this reminds me that one of the great attractions of the town
is the local halfpenny paper, which is sometimes distributed gratui-
tously. It is not a large sheet, but it contains a mass of valuable
information. We have, for instance, the band programme, the
railway time-table, and the announcement of any such wild dissipa-
tion as a flower-show held in the Town Hall, or a performance of Miss
Rose's excellent Theatrical Company in the Assembly Rooms. The
latest news outside our immediate neighbourhood is certainly rather
condensed. As an example, were the Autocrat of the Great North
to be assassinated at St. Petersburg, our paper would, I fancy,
announce the rather startling intelligence briefly, —"CZAR was mur-
dered this morning," while devoting a ten-line paragraph to the
graphic description of an accident to a local goat-chaise. Well, we

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The great day of the Festival was Thursday, when
Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN'S Prodigal Son was performed
in the morning, and his Golden Legend in the
evening. This attractive combination had the effect of
increasing the population of Gloucester for twenty-four
hours to such an extent that the cheese-famed city
seemed suddenly to have developed from single Gloucester
into double Gloucester. The Golden Legend is a tra-
ditional tale of a fortune amassed at Gloucester by an
hotel-keeper during the Festival week; while the Prodigal
Son, is the sad story of a young man who, in spite of his
father's warnings, lived an entire Festival week at a
Gloucester Inn. The execution of the Prodigal Son
pleased me. Not that he is put to death-you know what
f
mean. There was one remarkable defect, however, in
the singing of Mr. EDWARD LLOYD. The Prodigal
after his brief period of plunging, had lived on husks,
It would have been at once realistic and subtle to have
indicated this by a little huskiness in the voice of his
representative. Far, however, from being husky, Mr.
EDWARD LLOYD sang his part with provoking clearness.
I must not forget Sitt's concerto, introduced by CAR-
RODUS Junior-Sirrah BERNHARD CARRODUS. During
the performance the E string of Sirrah BERNHARD
CARRODUS's violin suddenly snapped. Having now only
three strings to his bow, the young man went to his father
-and might have fared worse. The Governor, as leader,
was close at hand. He passed his instrument to his son
and the orchestra's first violin became the soloist's
second
fiddle. The playing of the youthful CARRODUS quite
carried us away.

it with me inside the four-horse coach that deposited us at Glen-

The Bulgarian Count was certainly better off in this regard, for I
had secured him for his rod a chimney-sweep's apparatus-minus, of
course, the brush,—of twelve lengths, which, when screwed together,
afforded quite a magnificent-looking rod, though I fear it may prove
a little heavy in the hand, and somewhat difficult to manage with
an artful fish at the other end of it. As to the African Chief, he
declined any rod at all, saying, that all he wanted was a good-sized
"pitchfork,” with which he proposed to dive after the fish himself.
This appears to be the way in which salmon-fishing is conducted in

Mwangumbloola, the place from which the Chief hails, in South
Central Africa, and I found it hopeless to persuade him to try any

For our lines, we were fortunate in securing two hundred yards of

but if the fish at Glen-Muggie are as lively as our host hints, it will
be none the worse for that.
Coming to the matter of "flies," we found our ingenuity at first

I was not, however, far out in my calculations, for on the Laird

seizing the carving-fork, and saying, "'Im no fly but this. "Yah !

yah!” I could see that, though our host endeavoured to tone the
observation down with a “Dear me! You don't say so!” he was
very much annoyed, and evidently considered that, in introducing
this sort of sport into the ordinary and accepted methods of conducting
salmon-fishing on a Highland "run," I had taken quite an undue
advantage of his hospitality.
I was not, therefore, surprised when, holding a brief converse
apart with some of his other guests, he came up after dinner to me,
and said he thought, as I and my two foreign friends had apparently
been more familiar with Oriental fashions of casting, and so forth,
and might probably like to conduct our operations in our own way,
he proposed to divide the party, and take the left bank himself, with
a couple of distinguished local rods, and tell off a keeper to look after
myself and my two foreign friends, who would take us to a capital
bit of water that he thought would just be about just suited to our
purposes, and provide us more with the sort of sport we seemed
disposed to relish
There was nothing for it, of course, but to acquiesce, but this is
how it has come about that I have, as I have previously stated, been
now about seven hours and a half hanging about in a drizzling rain,
slipping down every minute on scattered boulders, and lashing a
foaming torrent that seems bursting from everywhere on all sides of
me at once, with about fifty yards of paid-out line, to the end of
which are attached three of my bluebottle flies, by this time together
with a mass of weeds, in which they have caught, mixed up in a
hopeless tangle. Above us is the “pool,” into which the Bulgarian
Count has twice tumbled, overbalanced, I fancy, by the enormous
weight of his rod, to which, however, clinging, as it kept him easily
afloat, he has both times been washed through the narrow gorge into
my water, from which the Gillie and I have had no little trouble
in rescuing him, and he is now somewhat exhausted, drying for
the second time on the bank as well as he can in the wind and
rain.
The Indian Chief I have lost sight of for the last four or five hours,
and as he came provided merely with a pitch-fork and large carving-
knife, and, after plunging several times into the pool and intimating
that he could find no fish in it, started off, spite my earnest protesta-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
T
THE KING IN THE PALACE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, --On Thursday, innocently saunter-
ing in the rain to the Crystal Palace to gaze with
languid rapture at the damp fireworks, I was over-
joyed to learn that King John was going to be played
there with an "exceptional cast." And certainly the
palate-tickling announcement was borne out to the full
by the appearance of clever little Miss NORREYS as a
neat Prince Arthur, bright Miss AMY ROSELLE as a
pleasing and inoffensive Queen Constance, and ever-
welcome Mr. H. KEMBLE as (so it seemed to me) a rather
waggish Pope's Legate. I was somewhat startled, on
referring to the programme, to find Mr. BEERBOHM TREE
in the title rôle; but remembering, that this excellent
actor tried his Falstaff upon the favoured inhabitants of
Sydenham before bringing it up to town, my astonish-
ment soon gave place to satisfaction. The Lessee of the
Haymarket Theatre, I must confess, did not make very
much of the mean Monarch. Perhaps the most interest-
ing part of his performance, was his scene with Hubert,
à propos of the murder of Prince Arthur, as it seemed
to suggest that King John, in spite of other short-
comings, was at times not altogether devoid of a certain
sort of hard grim humour-humour provocative rather
of a relaxed frown than a genial smile, of a stealthy
wink than a broad grin. The mounting of the play was,
under the circumstances, commendable, although I am not
quite sure (I have not Pinnock's Abridgment at hand to
guide me) whether the Royal Arms of England in the
twelfth century, included the harp of Ireland, and the
banner of France at the same remote date bore for its de-
vice a republican eagle. However, I was delighted to make
the acquaintance of King John with “the exceptional
cast” at the Crystal Palace, as I do not think I shall
have an opportunity of seeing the performance elsewhere.
Believe me, dear Mr. Punch, yours, sorrowfully,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SYMPOSIUM.
SIRS, let us sit in a ring, and praise ourselves,
Shut out the silence of a heedless age,
And, with the music of the mutual page,
Charm fortune and renown, reluctant elves.
Albeit our works adorn no alien shelves,
Such chill cannot repress the noble rage
That drives the poet from the public stage
To rare academies of tens and twelves.
I care not for your songs, nor ye for mine;
But honied patience stills the waiting pain,
Till each may tread the path the others trod.
When my turn comes, I will not stint one line ;
Still will I read, though you lave ears in vain,
To my high lullaby constrained to nod.
A RAIL AT A RAILWAY SYSTEM.
MR. PUNCH, SIR, I observe by your Correspondence
from Aix-les-Baines that Sir MYLES FENTON, the able and
enlightened Manager of the South-Eastern Railway, has
been on a visit to French territory with the object of
studying the management of French Railways, and learn-
ing what to avoid. I also see that there has recently
been
foregathered in the capital of France a Congress of Railway
Magnates. What their particular business was is not

they were pals of his whom he got to know from playing
in the same game. Could hardly sleep last night;
afraid I don't get enough to eat.
Monday.-No sleep. Laid in a stock of melons and
tinned lobster to keep me going. Have no appetite for
meals. Eton seems a very dull place. Nothing to do
except sock. I suppose the Governor means me to
read; but there aren't any books of the sort I like in
our House Library, and it's too much trouble to go up
town and buy novels.
Tuesday. Nothing to do. Rather seedy. Tried some
fresh sock-shops. JACK rather shy of me. Said he
didn't like to be seen with a fellow who did nothing but
sock; said he expected I would be called “Mamma's
Crumb-pet,” or “Muffins,” if I became a permanent

Wednesday.-Felt very bad. Asked Matron if I
couldn't go home. Doctor came, and vowed I had over-
eaten myself. What rot! Why, Mamma is always
complaining of my, poor appetite! He said I was as
strong as a young horse, and only wanted early rising,
regular meals, and lots of exercise. I call it a howling
shame.
After Six.-My Tutor confiscated my melons and
tinned lobster.
Thursday.-My Tutor has been influenced by the idiot
of a Doctor. Sent for me, and said he wouldn't stand
any more malingering (that was his brutal word). “You
shall obey the same rules as other boys,” he says, “ for
a week; and, if your health breaks down, you're not
fit for school-life.” Told him my constitution wouldn't

to eat some breakfast, first time for several days.

That ninety out of every hundred parts

The sea-shore bathing is pleasant enough for those who like al
fresco entertainment; and it is as free-and-easy as at a French
watering-place. It is true there is one place set apart for the Nep-

distinctions are frequently set aside. One day I saw two soberly

could not see what they were reading, but perhaps these two ladies
were members of the Salvation Army, delivering sermons to the
bathers. The only reason I had for thinking that they might possibly
belong to the Salvation Army was, that they were seated on camp-

FURS.
(A writer on fashion says that Autumn dresses are being pre-
pared with borders of furs, chinchilla being much in request.)
FASHION bids you wear furs that will fill a
Fond heart with delight, for fall soon
You'll be charming and chic in chinchilla,
And ravishing quite in racoon.
Silver fox may be praised, but leave ermine
For monarchs. Among all the rest,
I'm sure, dear, I cannot determine
The fur in which you 'll look the best.
You have called your poor poet a dreamer ;
In sooth, dear, he dreams but of thee,
And he vows you'll look simply" a screamer,"
When fur-clad, whatever it be.
While he swears
that he gladly would peel skin,
Could his hide be made handsome by art;
But alas ! he must yield to the seal-skin,
That can count all the beats of your heart.

Saturday.-More marching round. Some of the cads
in the town asked to join us, and we let them, as they
are too big to fight. Told them how we were made to do
parsing and iregular virbs, and they were most indig-
nent. Go round to other schools, to pursuade the
fellows to come out. I believe they would have, too, if
they hadn't seen the cads. Tell a chap they call "BLACK
JOE” that we'd rather he and his friends didn't come
round with us. He says they're going to see
through with it. Told him if I let them stay, I should

he's skulking in the schoolroom. Our skirmishers have

occasions on which he, in the discharge of his duty, had
listened to the entertainment, he had noticed a song of a
highly improper and suggestive character put into the
mouth of a clown. What had the proprietor to say in
defence of that song?
The Proprietor said he saw nothing in the song what-
ever. It was only one verse taken from an old nigger
Mr. McMuchadoo (to the Proprietor). I happen to have
taken it down, and I ask you whether the following words
are fit to be uttered before a mixed audience of both sexes
in the public thoroughfares (reading) :-
“ Lubly Rosa, Sambo come,
Don't you hear de banjo, tum, tum, tum.
Someone in de copper wid Jo !!
The Proprietor. Well, I don't see what you've got to
object to in that.
Mr. McMuchadoo. "Got to object to ?” Why, the
whole thing is most suggestive. Who is in the copper
with Jo ? It is open to anyone to infer that it may be
the Rosa already mentioned, and that I consider a highly
improper inference,
The Proprietor said the word should be altered to
no-one" in the copper with Jo. It would serve his
purpose equally well, if it would suit the views
of the
Committee.
Mr. McMUCHADOO said he thought the change smacked
of subterfuge, but that the Committee would take it into
consideration when discussing the matter presently. But
he had still grave objections to make. It was bad enough
to lower the general moral standard by the introduction
of such features into an entertainment. What had he to
say to bringing the Devil on the scene? Was not that a
distinct attempt to tamper with public faith, as well as
public morals?
The Proprietor said he certainly did not see it in that
light. The Devil was only introduced as a sort of comic
Bogey, as an appropriate finish to the whole affair. To
take it in a serious light was, indeed, stretching a point.
Why, to show the jocular vein in which the whole enter-
tainment was conceived, Punch brought down the Curtain,
so to speak, by twirling the Devil about on the top of his

He said he wrote for the Telegraph,

If you stood him a pint of half-and-half,
He went about to every town

But he claimed to himself world-wide renown,
Did the Man who said he was SALA !
He boarded and lodged at Worcester, whence
To Malvern he went at great expense;
He lived, without paying, which showed the sense

They thought he was the biggest of swells,
Then he took them in, so history tells,
Which was but fair in the way of "sells,"

A cucumber, hamper of green-stuff, trash,
But not so green as those who lent cash
To the Man who said he was SALA !
He'd stories of DICKENS and THACKERAY too,
And all the distinguished men he knew
Were boon companions, good and true,
Of the Man who said he was SALA !

TO A FAIR NICOTIAN.
(WITH A WHIFF OF LORD TENNYSON.)
DEAR Lady CLARA, let me, pray,
Remonstrate. It's beyond a joke,
When your flirtations, so you say,
Begin, as oft they end, in smoke.
You 're beautiful, but fairer far
You'd be, if only you would let-
Your male friends smoke that big cigar,
And yield them too that cigarette.
You smoke because you think it's fast.
How sad the day when you began
To bridge the difference—so vast-
Between a woman and a man.
The heroine of idle tales,
Of scorn, of slander, and dispraise ;
Your womanhood is lost ’mid veils
Of smoke, your foolish lips upraise.
And, Lady CLARA, though mayhap
These words may never reach your ear;
Young LAURENCE was a decent chap,
And his old mother held him dear.
Why did you teach the hapless boy
To smoke ?_'twas quite against his will;
Tobacco, you so much enjoy,
Made him, we know, extremely ill.
Oh, trust me, CLARA, though I like,
Myself, my yard-long Brosely clay,
Your lovers all will go on strike,
If you smoke in this awful way.
Howe'er it be, it seems, my girl,
Your ladyship too oft forgets

Standing on the steps of No, 69, regarding the still treeless waste,
you notice an inscription on the door-plate, whose polished surface
would certainly shine in the sun if there happened to be one.
Bending forward you read the legend, : Knock and Ring." You
feel at once how strikingly characteristic this is of the eminent
statesman whom you presently find seated on the sofa, the saddle-back
sacking whereof tones gently from deepest blue to liveliest red. For
some people it would be sufficient to knock at a door through which
they desired admission. Others, differently constituted, would ring.
The Right Honourable GEORGE JOACHIM GOSCHEN, now Chancellor
of Her Majesty's Exchequer in the Ministry of Lord SALISBURY, as
he at one time was in the Ministry of Mr. GLADSTONE, leaves nothing
to chance. “Knock and Ring" is his motto.
You do so accordingly, and are promptly admitted within the hall.

permitting your mind to trifle with the inquiry, Has the Dog-tax

the appearance of your host, clad in a long dressing-gown of purple
silk, turned up at the sleeves with azure velvet, and picked out at
the collar with tasty splashes of red. Your host wears a smoking-
cap, thickly tasseled with gold lace, and in his mouth, cleverly held
between his teeth, is a short clay pipe. Busy as he is, occupied with
the affairs of an Empire compared with which that of ancient Rome
was nought, your host can still spare a few moments to warmly
welcome you. There is no misunderstanding the cheery twinkle in
the orb half obscured by the eyeglass.
“ Very glad to meet you here, dear Toby,” he says, gracefully
removing the short clay from between his shining rows of teeth.
"Haven't seen you since the House adjourned. Hope you've had a
good time. But what's this you 're up to now, going about inter-
viewing, your friends at home? Is this what's called the New
Journalism ? As far as I have looked into the matter, it seems to
me that New Journalism is simply Old Americanism."
You take the seat which your host warmly proffers you, and look
round the room, somewhat surpised to find a poker and tongs lying
within the well-cut fender, that incloses a hearth in which, in spite
of October chills, a coal fire brightly burns. Your host, walking up
and down the cosy room, and seizing the opportunity of dusting the
chairs with the skirt of his dressing-gown, tells you the history of

great Historian here quoted from is singu-
larly akin to that-in another medium-of
the illustrious HISTORICUS, R.A., as displayed
in this imposing picture.
Sir HISTORICUS has seized, for the purposes
of his chef d'auvre of historical art, upon
the exact moment when the Commander-
in-Chief, having murmured to himself,
"Night, or LABOUCHERE ! ” and shut up his
umbrella-we mean telescope (mixed historic

scope, bas reopened that glass in order to
take a final survey of the field. He sees the
enemy under the leadership of F.M. Lord
SALISBURY, and Generals ARTHUR BALFOUR,
GOSCHEN, and SMITH, making a gallant but
final stand against his own forces. The flower
of his troops, the pick of his guards, are
lying down behind him, hidden by slightly
rising ground, in which somewhat uneasy
position they have for some time been
awaiting with cramped limbs, but eager
hearts, indomitable patience, and invincible
resolution, the expected word of command,
which welcome signal, the Commander-in-
Chief, motioning them with his left hand to
keep still, and, in the words of BRER RABBIT,
"lay low" yet a little longer, has not yet
given, but appears upon the point of uttering.

be the cynosure of all eyes during the Season,

called “Sensational Historic Scenes, "of

the muddy streets, the pouring rain, and the dismal

Perhaps a long course of muzzling has taken away their spirits.

early SMEETH8–Excusez mon gant.” Amongst the rare
documents your host presently shows you is a faded copy
of the local newspaper giving an account of the attempt
made by the Sieur to cross the Thames in a coracle. It
is the same Thames still, and Henley is on it. But
many other things are changed, including the proprietor
of Greenlands.
You are examining the umbrellas in the hat-stand
of carved oak, and the engravings of knights in armour
in the staircase beyond, when a pleasant voice salutes
you.
“Good morning," it says; "have you used—I
mean, it is very good of you to come out so far. Any
news in Town? Any more bye-elections ? You know
what the MARKISS says on the subject ? "Mr. SMITH,'
says he (always calls me “Mr.').‘if there are any more of
these moral victories for Unionism, there will be only one
bye left for us, and that will be good-bye.' Hal ha!
MARKISS has a certain mordant humour which endears
him to his friends."
You look up in the direction of the voice, and find
your host beaming upon you from the mullioned stair-
case. You note that his dress is a happy mixture of the
modern country, gentleman and the Georgian Era; a
frock-coat of bright blue, on which brass buttons boldly
flash; whilst a flamboyant waistcoat is superarched over a
pair of kerseymere trousers tied at the knee with black
bows. Steel buckles glint on black shoes; a pair of
ruffles lie at the wrists like wreaths of snow; whilst a
pin, curiously fashioned, showing CHARLES THE FIRST
with bis head under his arm, fastens at the throat a
lightly-tied kerchief. This pin, which has been in
the family many years, has attached to it a curious bis-
tory, which your host relates, as he sits by the open
window at bis desk, looking down on a grass-plot some
eighty feet square, with a tiny greenhouse in one corner,
and a still tinier grotto in the other, whilst far in the
rear flows the lordly Thames.
"I have always liked a Grotto,” your host says, as he
turns over a new leaf in one of the numerous copy-books
that fill an entire side of the rosewood and marqueterie
book-cage that rises from the floor to within an inch or
so of the corniced ceiling. "POPE had a Grotto you
know, and LABBY lives in it, which, BALFOUR says,

lightly passing over the Flemish buffets tenanted by a
collection of Dutch pottery, alight on a picture hung
over a bronze bust of Lord' BEACONSFIELD. It presents
to view a little boy seated at a school desk. You notice
that his head is turned on one side as if he had a
crick in the neck; the tip of his tongue protrudes
from the side of his mouth; his elbow has an agonised

There's none like crafty LABBY,

And guileless as a babby!

RESEARCH AT CAMBRIDGE.
Trumpington Street, Cambridge.
DEAR MR. Punci,
I do not remember ever having read a
copy of your paper, but I have been told that
it is chiefly devoted to Psychical Research ;
so you will probably be glad to receive an
account of an experiment which I made the
other day. Although I am only reading for
the Pass Degree, I am a man of considerable
intellectual attainments, and I have devoted
a great part of my time to the study of
Hypnotism, and Transcendental Medicine.
Now, on the evening of Monday, October 21,
I happened to pick up a Number of a Cam-
bridge Periodical, The Granta, in which the
Editor offered a money prize for the best
definition of-(1) a Dean ; (2) a Tutor ; (3) a
Father ; (4) a Senior Wrangler ; (5) a Fresh-
man; (6) a Bedmaker. The only definitions
I had ever read were in a little book bearing
the fanciful title of Euclid, and written by
a Mr. TODHUNTER ; and although the work
is generally considered sound as far as it
goes, I found that there was absolutely no
mention in it of Deans, or Bedmakers, or
anything of the sort. Feeling sure that the
omission was purely accidental, I determined
to discover what Mr. TODHUNTER would have
written if he had thought of it.
I therefore took a Ěuclid paper, and, with

To
which not every nation
The warmest welcome brings.
In fact, dear, Revolution,
When it is tinged with Red,

Fills timid souls with dread;
And it was rather risky
Your fortunes to combine
With forces fierce and frisky
That ruled in Seventy-Nine.
But you, as the fair sequel
Has very plainly shown,
Were to the occasion equal,
My beautiful, my own!
Yes, you conciliated
My disingenuous foes,
I saw them, who 80 hated,
Half friendly ere your close.
Your wondrous fascination
Was all too much for them;
For English affectation,
And eke for German phlegm.

Grew courteous, for your sake;
As for the swarming Yankee,
He fairly “took the cake.'
You softened the stiff Spanish,
And warmed the stolid Dutch,
And now, my dear, you vanish!'
It is indeed too much!
Pardon this deliquescence !
You never made me weep,
Until I felt your presence,
I could no longer keep.
You filled the Beauteous City
With nearly half the earth.
The world should be more witty,
More capable of mirth,
For these mad months of revel
In the great Champ de Mars.
It may not reach my level,
It may not “shock the stars ; "
But sure your crowded acres,
Your dances, and your drinks,
Might stir the dullest Quakers
To wit, and warmth, and winks.
The “ Orient,” in your pictures,
Was piquant, chic, and pschutt !
And as for prudish strictures
On them we may be mute.
You sent us up like rockets,

Filled all its streets--and pockets.

Hopeful and sad by turns.
Thanks to you, pas de danger!

And the Red Spectre charmed.

From zealots coarse and crude,

Hushed is the brilliant Babel,
Though you have left its Tower.

UP-HILL WORK.
Mr. Punch loquitur :-
UP-HILL work ? To be sure. And, my very dear Madam,
Up-hill's always stiffish whatever the road,
Whether gȚavel provincial or London Macadam;
But much, very much, to your “Chairman" is owed,
For choosing straight courses and obstacles clearing,
And pulling and hauling with hearty good will.
I congratulate you on the prospect most cheering,
At least for a time, of retaining him still.
If anyone can pull you straight he will do it.
You'll freely admit you 're a pretty good weight;
And were you to lose him just now you might rue it,
That's hardly a thing that admits of debate.
And you, Mister ROSEBERY, Punch is delighted
To know you 'll remain for a time at your post.
By pitchforks and pelting you'll not be affrighted;
"Tis true English fashion our rulers to roast;
And when a new broom is found making a splutter,
And not so much clearing as raising a dust,
“Olympian” critics, and others, will atter
Some quips which appear, and perhaps are, unjust.
Some L. C. C. doings have roused cynic merriment,
But Councils, like Rome, are not built in a day;
Mr. Punch wishes well to the mighty experiment,
And he will take care it is given fair play.
Meanwhile, Ma'am, if you will but just cut the cackle,"
Some rushers restrain, and some chatterers burke,
Your excellent Chairman his task then may tackle
With every prospect of less “ Up-hill Work !"
THE NINTH.
The Lord Mayor's Show, arranged by Mr. LEWIS WINGFIELD, was
a great success, and Mr. Punch presents BARNUM Junior with the
freedom of Fleet Street. The biggest crowd assembled to witness
it that has been seen for some years. LEWIS Le Grand himself sat
in a carriage with three City magnates, and tried to look as if he had
got there by accident, and his friends were merely "giving him a
lift.” In the evening the scene in the Guildhall was brilliant. Mr.
STANHOPE spoke boldly about national defences when he looked
round and saw General Atlas in a brand new uniform, with a
sword by his side, ready, aye, ready," and Colonel BRIEFLESS,
ablaze in scarlet, looking like a Counts Court Martial, burning to
draw pleadings, defend the innocent, or charge a prisoner at the
bar. Lord SALISBURY was heavy. He had nothing to say, and said
something less than that, as he omitted to propose the Lord Mayor's
health, and had to be stirred up again, when he rose in his place
and gave the toast as a sort of after-thought. Sir HENRY Isaacs
spoke well, clearly, to the point, and, above all, briefly. ARTHUR
BALFOUR received a big ovation, and assumed an air of quiet
surprise, as if uncertain whether the applause might not have been
intended for some one else. Altogether a Notable Ninth.

Nothing Like Lather.
The Scentenary of PEARS' Soap was celebrated with a banquet
given to Mr. BARRATT, Sir ALGERNON BORTHWICK, Bart., M.P.,
being in the chair. Needless to say that there was a plentiful
exhibition of soap on the occasion. The chief feature of the menu
was of course the cakes of soap. Sir ALGERNON made, as he always
does, an excellent speech, and, as if he were at a double wedding,
drank the health of "The happy Pears.”

STATESMEN AT HOME.
DCXXXIV. MR. ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR AT 4, CARLTON GARDENS.
MR. ARTHUR BALFOUR, wending his way across the Horse Guards
Parade from a late sitting of the House of Commons, can never reach
his home without having his mind attuned to lofty thoughts. Behind
he has left a tumultuous assembly, where vulgar hate finds voice in
rasping words. Tim HEALY may have been flinging hard sayings at
him, or JOSEPH GILLIS may have bent upon him that look of benig-
nant contempt which is harder to bear than spoken words. But as,
with long, swinging strides, your host crosses the gritty roadway in
the rear of the Horse Guards, and hears behind the silent footfall of
the two plain-clothes denizens of Scotland Yard, he always feels the
soothing influence of the Duke of York's Column. There, planted
advantageously on the crest of a noble flight of steps, uncarpeted,
and even unswept, there rises, sheer and round, the lofty column. On
it stands, in solemn loneliness, the figure of the Great Duke, staring
out straight before him, as if watching the retreating figures of his
famed ten thousand men. As your host lightly skips up the steps,
taking them two at a time as if they were Amendments moved by
an Irish Member, a strange calm settles over his erewhile flattered
soul. There, ander the flaming gaslight of the House of Commons,
is hurry-scurry, turmoil, and tribulation. Here is long rest after
labour, majestic peace, which may, some day, be his.
You also take the Duke of York's Steps on your way to No. 4,
Carlton Gardens, but these sentiments are not appropriate to your
case. You think, rather, that the stairway is a little steep, the
Steps & trifle frequent, the Monument something of a monstrosity.
Arrived at No 4, you are warmly welcomed by one, whose expressive
dark eyes, olive complexion, and finely cut features afford abundant
evidence of his ancestry. ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR, though a Cabinet
Minister and in control of one of the most troublesome Departments
of the State, is still a young man. He looks more like a troubadour
than an Irish Secretary, an illusion fostered by the dress in which
he receives you. A robe of rich violet velvet is girdled at the slim
waist by a rope of silk, wrought in dead gold colour. As he leans
with negligent grace, one arm resting on the molten marble mantel-
piece, he toys with his left hand with a lyre that reposes on a cabinet
filled with the rarest specimens of Majolica and Sèvres.
“Not that I play you know," your host says; “but ORPHEUS

A MEDICAL OWL.
[An Owl has taken up his abode in a tree at Guy's Hospital.]
An Owl seen at Guy's! We may surely surmise,
That the bird of Minerva seeks knowledge ;
And comes to the
place to find favour and grace
At the hands of the men of that college.
They may say, “It's absurd to encourage this bird,"
Like the hero of Lear's famed fasciculus ;
But why that should be so we really can't see,
There are many things far more ridiculous.
No man can deny that, in ages gone by,
The Owl for his wisdom was famous:
This bird may aspire, with a clinic desire,
In medical culture to shame us.
At the lectures we feel he will certes reveal
Strict attention, in every attitude;
With a wink in his
eye (Do owls wink, þy the bye ?)
When Professors indulge in a platitude.
Minerva we know, in the ages ago,
Was the patron of physic concoctors ;
Why should not the Owl, as the goddess's fowl,
Be enrolled on the list of our Doctors ?
Let us see that he gains the result of his pains ;
Make him free of each medical mystery ;
Till we hail Strix M.D., as he sits on the tree,

the use of talking about the Land Question, or any other qạestion,
until you've got the light of clear, impartial, impersonal inquiry
shed upon it. That's what he says, and there's a good deal in it.
When two men like HEXLEY and SPUNSER discuss anything, they
stick to the point. There are no digressions, no personal recrimina-
tions, nothing but calm sobor inquiry. Now then, let's begin some-
where in the middle. Never mind the introductory letters.

mistaken for black by gas-light, I do not see in what respect his views
on the compensation for inconveniences caused by compulsory
muzzles are other than analogous to my own opinions on the precisely
similar point discussed by me in my last letter?"

“ HANSOM IS AS HANSOM DOES."
(A Ballad of a Police-Court Case, set to the ancient rhyme of
"Billy Taylor.")
THERE was a young and Hansom Cabby,
Which he had a sweet young wife,
Annoyed by a willin base and shabby,
Who werry nearly worried her out of her life.
He dogged her footsteps whenever he met her,
Wrote her many a billy doo;
But the sweet young wife gave every letter
To her Hansom hubby fond and true.
So the Hansom Cabby, up to him dashin',
Descends from his perch, "Take that!” says he.
When he'd given the willin a well-deserved thrashin',
He gave hisself into custodee.
And the Magistrate says to the Hansom driver,
"I can't help applaudin' wot you've done ;
But I must bind you over in a fiver,
To keep the peace to everyone.
“ Which, talking of 'peace,' you go to the Adelphi,
Where there's a melodrama fine;
You take your wife, and you 'll see yourself, I
Think, as a Hansom Cabman Shine.
"As you know the science of fisticuffin',
Which the gent can say who felt your knocks.
The Gattis may Hansomly admit you for puffin?,
Or a friend will square up for a Private Box."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WORD FROM THE MOUTH OF THE BOURNE.
Now that the subject of winter resorts is before the
world, some account may appropriately be given of that
Bournemouth to which so many visitors return. The
town seems to have been built in the midst of pine-
forests, through which roads have been cut in different
directions; and it is significant that every thoroughfare
in Bournemouth, with but one exception, is still called a
"road.". The whole place, as Haydn, or his librettist,
might have put it, is “ with verdure clad”; the rich
greens of the pine-trees and the firs being, in many places,
relieved by the scarlet berries of the mountain ash, or
the pink Aowers of the rhododendrons. Snowdrops and
winter roses may here and there be seen; but the general
uniform of the place is green sprinkled with red.
At Bournemouth I was, for the first time in my life-
but not, I hope, the last-inveigled into taking up my
abode at a temperance establishment. It was not even
an hotel--not at least by name—the proprietor of the
house being specially forbidden by the terms of his lease
from calling it one. He was prevented, moreover, by a
clause in this formidable lease from applying for a wine
and spirit licence. A feeling of depression comes over
the visitor, when on crossing the threshold of the “Im-
perial,” he finds an announcement staring him in the
face, to the effect that the proprietor does not possess a
wine licence, and is bound not even to ask for one.
All ye who enter here, leave drink behind,” the solemn
inscription seems to say.
But an hotel, even though it be furnished like a well-
appointed private house, and bear no special designation,
is still an hotel; and though an hotel-keeper may have
bound himself not to apply for a wine licence, this does
not prevent him from enabling his customers to order
wine from another hotel. A sort of cheque-book is
brought to the visitor, who draws for whatever draughts
he happens to require'; whether for lunch, dinner, or the
intervals between regular meals. This plan of ordering
wine beforehand might advantageously be adopted at
all hotels. It would save delay, and that rushing to and
fro on the part of the waiters, which must necessarily
take place when wine is ordered only at the moment of CHARITY THAT BEGINNETH NOT WHERE IT SHOULD.

A SONG OF THE SCHOOL BOARD.
AIR—" Three Students were travelling over the Rhine.”
THREE strangers were travelling townward one day,
And together they paused to hobnob by the way.
Oh, far might you wander before you would see
A grislier group than that terrible Three!
For not the Three Ravens of legend looked foul
As these Three with the mortar-board," "stove-pipe," and cow);
And not the Three Fates, when intent on their thread,
Had an aspect more harsh, a demeanour more dread.
There was he of the “mortar-board," pedant austere,
With the book and the biroh that the little ones fear;
The grinder of hearts and the racker of brains,
Moloch-service the price of his dubious gains.
The Teacher as torturer, poverty's scourge,
Who the lesson would force, and the school-fee would urge.
Though poor bairns to his rostrum should hunger-racked come,
With the penny that left them all starving at home.
And who is his villanous plump vis-à-vis,
Of the visage suffused with such sinister glee ?
That ruddy-faced rogue is Society's curse :
His hands ever grope in the fat Publio Purse.
Plump hands and prehensile, they grub, and they pick,
And, oh, how the gold to those digits will stick!
That's Jobbery, thiefdom incarnate is he,
And perhaps the worst knave of the rascally Three.
As sly Jerry-Builder he best loves to pose,
But that cypical eye, and that fee-sniffing nose,
Into everything peer,
into everything poke,
Where there's chance of a “job,' which he hails as a joke.
And the third of the Three, the strange spectre, and thin,
With the cowl, and the bowl, and the skeleton grin!
Ah! Pedantry callous, and Jobbery foul,
Find companionship fit in the Thing with the Cowl!
"Drink, Gentlemen! Fill up your cups to our Cause ! ”
And they rap on the Board with effusive applause.
For the stuff in that bowl is right stingo, you see ;
And they all love a dip, do those sinister Ihree.
And these be thy friends, Education! The grub
Who would ruthlessly cram the poor famishing scrub,
The knave, of whose life base corruption is breath,
And-auxiliar of all things, destructive !-pale Death.
Education ! O spirit benignant and kind,
To the ghouls who dishonour thee canst thou be blind ?
Not this was the promised Utopian bliss,
Of thy kingdom so lately established - not this!
Thy task is divine, but 'tis badly begun.
Autolycus, Herod, and Moloch in one
Appears this new idol that some would set up,
To drink childhood's bane in a poisonous cup.
Hath Justice no power-hath Law not a hand,
To sweep jocund Jobbery out of the land ?
'Tis our newest Utopia, and lo 1 he creeps in,
Hob-nobbing with Death, with its menacing grin!
The fames of those draughts are of deadliest breath,
Pedant cruelty, knavish corruption, and Death!
Education 's a spirit benign, with fair ends,
But Heaven deliver her from her new friends!

ONE WHO HAS SUCCESSFULLY ČOMBATED THE INSIDIOUS GERM.
SIR,- I have followed the correspondence on the danger of the
spread of infection by Doctors with interest, but I have not, as yet,
come across any suggested specific that equals my own. Mine is
simple. I never call in the Doctor at all. Not that I am without
medical aid. When ailing, I turn to the advertising columns of my
daily paper, and try the first patent medicine that meets my eye. As
I am constantly ailing, my recourse to this form of remedial aid is
tolerably frequent. Indeed, I may say, I almost live on drugs. My
life is, therefore, not quite a happy one. I am often overwhelmed
with melancholy; still, as long as there is a self-recommended Pill
in the market, I feel I'have something to fall back upon, and that,
even if it does not entirely agree with me, I may still regard it as a
preferable alternative to the visit of the infecting Doctor. At least,
you may take this to be both the hope and consolation of one who,

believes he may honestly sign himself A MATCH FOR THE DOCTOR.

TUTTE
A FORECAST-SAY, FOR THIS TIME NEXT YEAR.
The agitation of the Curates for an annual stipend of
not less than £300, has culminated in their determination,
arrived at yesterday afternoon, to abstain from visiting
their respective Churches and doing duty on Sunday
next. It is said that 7000 Vicars and Rectors who are in
sympathy with the movement have intimated their
intention of manifesting it by also joining the lock-out.
There are other matters under dispute beyond the mere
question of pay. “One Service a week, one Sermon a
month!” has now become a party cry; It is calculated
tkat 15,000 churches of the Establishment will there-
fore not open their doors to their congregations next
Sunday,
The Legal Profession, following in the footsteps of the
Church, has struck for bigher fees; and the Judges,
forced by the pressure put on them by leading Queen's
Counsel," have joined the “Amalgamated Lawyers'
Union."
A Solicitor, who was caught yesterday seeing
a client who had managed to evade the notice of the local
pickets, was denounced as a black-leg, and hooted by a
mob of yelling Attorneys, who followed him with
threatening gestures till he eventually made his escape
into Chancery Lane.
The Medical Profession has not been slow to be
influenced by the general strife of the Church and Bar;
and yesterday, at a mass-meeting, held outside Guy's
Hospital, it was unanimously decided that the three-
guinea fee should be the minimum, and that all medical
men should join in a general lock-out forthwith, declining
to see any patient at a lower rate. It was further
agreed that these terms be presented in the form of an
ultimatum to the Committee of Invalids, who have
hitherto conducted negotiations on the part of the
general public, and represented them in the matter.
There was some talk last night of the probability of a
strike in both the Houses of Lords and Commons. This
will probably startle Society into an endeavour to find
some means of adjusting the disputes between Capital
and Labour other than that supplied by an immediate
recourse to obstructive combination.

A SEASONABLE DITTY.
By Stepniakney.
A MONTH ago I had a cold,
And when my family I told,
They all exclaimed, “Oh, rubbish !”
And all the solace that I got
Consisted in a treatment hot,
Hot-groggy, and hot-tubbish.
My symptoms met with jeer and scoff ;
They heard unmoved my plaintive cough,
And told me, void of pity,
Instead of staying warm at home,
'Twould do me far more good to roam
As usual to the City.
The self-same symptoms-only slight-
Are radiant with the lurid light
Of the new epidemic,
And now that Turnham Green is "down,"
They gwathe me in my dressing-gown,
And proffer potions chemick.
Obedient to affection's call,
To depths of huskiness I fall,
In tremulous cadenza;
What though a native cold they jeer,
They treat with mix'd respect and fear
A Russian Influenza.
A while ago, without remorse,
A slighter cold would mean divorce
A toro necnon mensâ ;
But the whole household now hangs round,
Conciliated by the sound
Of Russian Influenza.

ODE.
On the Pleasure arising from Ginger-cake.
SKYLARK, that dost the morning wake
Up in the pearly hạights of dawn,
Or when its dædal splendours break
In streaks of empyrean brawn,
Be not so proud, thou canst not make,
As CHLOE can, a ginger-cake.
O thou fleet-footed fawn,
That through the glade dost lightly take
Thy dappled way,
and scarcely shake
The dewdrops from the lawn,
Be not so proud ; thou canst not make,
As CHLOE can, a ginger-cake.
O beefen herds of browsing steak,'
That sweeten all the air around,
Rich milk you give, and many a pound
Of butter, fresh as primroses ;
You cannot make a ginger-cake
As CHLOE can, with perfect ease.
O chanticleer, who flapp'st thy wings
Before the watchful lark upsprings
And sound'st thy clarion, ere the flakes
Of the on-rushing daylight's foam
Whiten the fields where the stars roam,
Thou ken’st of many mystic things
But not a whit of ginger-cakes,
Which golden-headed Chloe makes.
O nightingale, that trill'st thy pearly note,
While yet the Easter breezes coldly blow,
Gargling with tender song thy strained throat
Melting the moonless night with raptured
woe,
And charming all the budded bower,
Though all around thee is in flower,
Yet cooking is, proud bird, beyond the
warbler's power;.
And CHLOE makes délicious cakes,
Albeit, as yet, she hath not charmed a bower.
Not, Cake, from greedy love of thee,
The bard is fain thy praise to sing,
But that all Nature's minstrelsy,
All woodland craft of foot and wing
All magic of the budding spring,

ment--a medley, of grace and humour with the lightest touch as of softest
zephyr--he laughingly recalls an incident which befel on the very threshold of
his parliamentary career. Returned Member for Launceston, after suffering
from the strokes of envy at various other constituencies unsuccessfully wooed, he
at last came up to the Table of the House of Commons to take the Oath. Asked
in ordinary form to produce the return to the Writ, Sir HARDINGE GIFFARD (as
your host then was), dived in the breast-pocket of his coat, expecting to find
the document there. But he found it not, and, the cynosure of the eyes of a
crowded House, conscious of stopping its proceedings, he hunted in every pocket
for the missing and necessary document. After a scene of growing hilarity on
the part of a reckless Opposition, it was found under the Bench where the newly
elected Solicitor-General had been seated before being called to the table.. You
have heard a shrewd judge of current events state his opinion that the incident,
trivial as it might appear, had a marked influence upon the future career of the
even then not youthful Solicitor-General. It was felt that a man with such
infinite miscellaneous resources in and about his garments, such an armoury of
pocket-knives, such a collection of bits of string, such numerous handkerchiefs,
such an infinitude of scraps of paper, would never at any crisis be found
lacking. You are glad to mention this favourable comment.
“Ah!" says your host, an ingenuous blush mantling his countenance," you
are always too good to me, Toby, dear boy; Still I think it is just as well that
neither writ nor patent is required in the matter of the creation of Lord
Chanoellor. It would not have done for me to come up and not be able to
find my patent when demanded.”
The LORD CHANCELLOR's table is littered with letters and telegrams, Flemish
buffets are tenanted by a collection of Dutch pottery, and through the folding
doors you catch a glimpse of the picture gallery with its unique collection of
predecessors in office. There is a' mezzotint in remarkable preservation of
ABFASTUS (sometimes called HEREFAST), Chaplain to WILLIAM the CONQUEROR,
and Bishop of ELMHAM, who was the first Lord Chancellor, having received, in
1067, the Seal which at this moment dangles from the watch-fob of your host.
There is JOHN MORETON, Archbishop, of Canterbury, temp. 1487, first of a
succession of prelates, who also held the office of Lord Chancellor. The dark
face of Thomas MORE, first Lay Lord Chancellor, looks with softened expression
on his illustrious successor of to-day. There, too, is Francis Bacon, EDWARD
HYDE, Earl of CLARENDON; Sir FRANCIS NORTI, Lord GUILDFORD; Lord JEFFRIES
