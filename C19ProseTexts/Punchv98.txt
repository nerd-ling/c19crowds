T was a Midsummer Night, and Mr. Ponch in his sanctum dreamed a Dream! To adapt the Laureate's luy :-
1
He read, before his eyelids dropt their shade, i Sung by the Lusitanian bard, who made
The Lusiads of CAMOENS, long ago
Great Gama's glories glow.
It was the wondrous tale of STANLEY which had turned the Sage's attention to the pages of the great Epic of Commerce.
He had read :-
“ Afric behold! alas, what altered riėw!
Her lands uncultured, and her sons untrue;
Ungraced with all that sweetens human life,
Savage and fierce, they roam in brutal strife;
Eager they grasp the gifts which culture yields,
Yet naked roam their own neglected fields."
And though eren Africa has considerably changed since the year of grace 1497, when “ daring GAMA" went “incessant
labouring round the stormy Cape," Mr. Ponch thought of that great gloom-shrouded Equatorial Forest and its secular savage
dwarf-denizens, and mused how much there was yet for our modern Ganas to do in the Dark Continent.
Mr. Purch found himself in the lovely “ Isle of Venus," the delicious floral Paradise which the Queen of Love, "the
guardian goddess of the Lusiau race," created " amid the bosom of the watery waste," as “a place of glad repast and sweet
repose," for the tired bome-returning GAMA and his companions.
“Of glad repast,'" said a familiar voice, “there is plenty and to spare; but for the sweet repose,' 'tis not to be
found in this · Isle of Banqueting.'”
“Mr. STANLEY, I presume?" said the Sage.
“You cannot presume," rejoined H. M. neatly. “But some of these gregarious dinner.givers do, and sometimes,-yes,
sometimes I'm afraid I let them see that I'm aware of it."
“As fame-preoccupied, country-loving GaJa, wearied of the feasts, interludes, and chivalrous entertainments,'
with which the taste of that age demonstrated the joy of Portugal,' might perchance have -snubbed some too importunate
Don. The compliments of the Court and the shouts of the streets were irksome to him,' says the chronicle."
“SALISBURY is nut quite a Prince HENRY apparently," remarked the modern GAVA. - “He and his father John did
not find the discoveries and acquisitions of their heroic compatriot'embarrassing.' "The arts and valour of the Portuguese
had now made a great impression on the minds of the Africans. The King of Congo, a dominion of great extent, sent the
sons of some of his principal officers to be instructed in arts and religion.' This was four hundred vears ago! And now

the Portuguese can be safely snubbed and sat upon, even by a SALISBURY! But if your prudent Premier doesn't stiffen his
back'a bit, with regard to the tougher and tentative Teuton, the arts and valour of the Britishers will not make as great
an impression on the minds of the Africans as your ill-used East African Company could desire.” .
“ Don't be too downhearted, HESTY," smiled the Sage. “Much dining-out doth breed dyspepsia, and atrabilious
views are apt to be a leetle lop-sided.”
“Right, Mr. Punch !" said a musical but somewhat mournful voice, that of the great but ill-starred LUIS DE CAMOEXS
himself. “I wrote much of my Lusiadas in Africa.
".One hand the pen, and one the sword employed.'
My reward was banishment, imprisonment, poverty, neglect, and a miserable death in an almshouse. Soon after, how-
ever,' says the record, 'many epitaphs honoured his memory: the greatness of his merit was universally confessed, and his
Lusiad was translated into various languages. The whirligig of time bring; its revenges,' as your own illustrious Singer
saith. How think you myself and my friend Vasco DE GAMA here look upon the fallen state of our beloved native land ? In
vain he ventured for her. In vain I warningly sang :-
"Chill'd by my nation's cold neglect, thy fires
Glow bold no more, and all thy rage expires.
Shall haughty Gaul or sterner Albion boast
That all the Lusian fame in thee is lost!'"
Mr. Puxcu bowed low to the illustrious Puct and the in lomitable Explorer. “Greatness," said he, courteously,
“claims reverence, and misfortune respect. Your countrymen, Gentlemen, have been rather angry with me of late. But
sterner Albion 'may be proud indeed if she produces such men as GAMA to perform heroic deeds, and such poets as CAMOENS
to sing them.” The stately Shades saluted. “I wonder,” said GMA, “who will be the Laureate of the later Ulysses, and
which of your singers will write the Epic of Africa ?”
“ I fear,” said Mr. Pusco, “ that at present they are too busy smiting the Socialistic big drum, or tickling their sono-
rous nitive tongue into tinkling triolets. In this Island of Venus-
“I beg pardon," interrupted STASLEY, with a sardonic smile. "This Island of Menus, you mean, Mr. Pusca!”
Mr. Punch looked around. The Acidalian roses and myrtles, the purple lotos and the snowy thorn, the yellow pod.
flowers and the waving palms, the vermeil apples and the primrosed banks, of Canoexs' somewhat zone-confounding vision,
had indeed vanished, and in their stead seemed to wave snowy serriettes, to flow champagne-streams, to glitter goblets, and to
glow orchid-laden épergnes.
“Humph!" said the Sage. “ The prose of the Restaurateur—which by the way sounds as if I were alluding to
the literature of the Restauration,-hath insensibly superseded the poesy of the peerless Portuguese. Well, Gentlemen, in
vain may sterner Albion 'glory in the profusion of wealth and the pomp of 'glad repast,' unless also she breeds heroes to
adventure and poets to celebrate. As you sang, my CANOENS-
""The King or hero to the Muse unjust,
Siz ks as the nameless slave, extinct in dust.'
For the present, STANLEY's arm and Mr. Purch's pen suffice to save the State from such abasement. But let our timid
Premiers and our temporising Press remember the glories of GAMA and Camoexs, and the fate of ungrateful and indolent
Lusitania! '
“The Pen of Mr. Puxch!” cried CAMOENS. "Ah, long have the valiant Vasco and myself desired to peruse its
sparkling and patriotic outpourings."
“And you, my STANLEY," proceeded Mi. Poxca, " said to the banqueting Fishmongers, 'I am an omnivorous reader
whenever an opportunity presents itself.' It presents itself here and now. Take, Illustrious Trio, the greatest gift that even
Purch can bestow upon you, to wit his

ROBERT'S STORY ABOUT CHINA.

I passes over that woyage, and my many blunders in trying to make myself
hunderstood by the hignerent natives, and at once goes in to describe what was of
coarse most hintresting to me, namely, the dinners. I dined wun day at the
Shing-Cully Otel, which is a fust-class consern. I was told as all the Swells dined
at the top of the house ; so hup stairs I went, and sat myself down at a large
tabel, with about 30 Chineese Gents, all drest in their riduklus kostoom of
Jackets and pettycotes. They all stared at me as if I was sumthink werry
strange, tho' drest in my ushal full hevening dress, with white choker. We only
had 1 Maynoo for all of us, and had to chuse our Dishes, so I chose Birds -nest
Soup, Sharks' fine, as they hadn't got no Turbot, lots of frute, and Roast Puppy!
We began with frute! but, before we ate any, we all took wine with one another !

at the side of our plates, with which we all wiped our messy
chop-sticks, and our oily mouths. The dux was werry good,
so I had about harf a one. The Puppy Dog looked much like
a Sucking Pig, but even the strong hunion sauce didn't hide
the parfume enuff for me to be able to taste it. The wine
wasn't anythink werry grand, but, what it wanted in flavior,
it made up in strength, and many a eye began for to twinkle
afore the dinner was over ; and, judging from what I saw
then, and at other times, I should think about the most
commical hobjeck on earth is a drunken Chinyman. I was
arterwards told that the propper place to get dogs and cats
for dinner was in Jack-Poo-Kow. The idear of calling such
horrid filth Kow, made me suspishus, so I found the place
out, and, who should I see oppersite the winder where the

another of them, where a black cat was hanging up, when in TOBY

knowing who I was, seized me, and dragged me into the shop, and
demanded 100 sents, or four shillings, for the black cat's body, and
tuppence for its pair of eyes, which, it seems, are considerd a speshal
lukshury? TOBY, insted of looking ashamed of hisself ivr his shamefool

And they journeyed on and on, through the snow and
the ice, until they came to the land of the desert, in which
they found themselves (strange to say) in a warmer atm)-
sphere than that to which they had grown accustomed in
the regions of the North Pole. Then a strange thing
happened. They witnessed a fight between an elephant
and a cat. The elephant managed to get well on the
bank of the river which ran (conveniently) through the
desert, in spite of the cat nipping on to one of its legs.
Gradually the cat began to swallow the leg, then the
body, then the head, until nothing but the trunk of the
elephant was left. A strange thing had happened-the
elephant had been swallowed by the cat!
"He was evidently going out of town," said UNPEDD,
airily.
"So I see," replied SPOYLPAPEROS, and he pointed to
the trunk. Once more came the dreadful muttering noise
that ended in a roar of laughter, and again a shadowy

Suddenly there was an awful roar-I call it a roar, but it was really the noise of a volcano in action-and the place shook as though in

A Cool Collation of Several Bards.
I WOULD I had not met you, Sweet,
I wish you had been far away
From where, in Upper Wimpole Street,
We two foregather'd yesterday.
Somewhere in that unlovely street
Summer's lost beauty, hid away,
Woke at the music of your feet,
And sought the little girl in grey.
Around your head the sunbeams play-
Home to the depths of your deep eyes
Soft shadows of the woodland stray,
Then sparkle with a quick surprise,
As when the branch-entangled skies
Shake from the depths of woodland stream,
Awhile in laughing circles gleam,
Then spread to heaven's peace again.
Amber and gold, and feathery grey,
You suited well the Autumn day,
The muffled sun, the misty air,
The weather like a sleepy pear.
And yet I wish that you had been
Afar, beside the sounding main,
Or swaying daintily the rein
Of mettled courser on the green,
So I had passed, and passed unseen.
For I arose, from dreams of thee,
Bo late that morn, my matin tea
Was cold as mutton two days cooked ;
As in the looking-glass I looked,
Methought the razor need not wreak
Its wonted vengeance on my cheek,
Nor clear the shadow from my chin

Composed of mighty bone and brawn he stands,
A six-foot straight; “ fine fellow of his hands.":
ENTELLUS, Champion of the Austral realm,
Whose sight fat DARES seemed to overwhelm.
(“Yah!!” cried SAYERIUS, “brave HEENANUS stood
Well over me ; yes, and his grit was good.
But did I funk the Big 'Un from the fust?
No, nor when nine times I had bit the dust !!")
They both attentive stand with eyes intent,
Their arms well up, their bodies backward bent.
One on his clamorous “ Corner" most relies ;
The other on his sinews and his size.
Unequal in success, they ward, they strike,
Their styles are different, but their aims alike.
Big blows are dealt; stout DARES hops around,
His pulpy sides the rattling thumps resound.
(“He always was a fleshy 'un, yer know,”
Said brave SAYERIUS. “But on yer go!")
Steady and straight ENTELLUS stands his ground,
Although already rowdy rows abound.
His hand and watchful eyes keep even pace,
While DARES traverses and shifts his place,
And, like a cornered rat in a big pit,
Keeps off, and doesn't like the job a bit.
("No, that I'll bet!!" the brave SAYERIUS said.
“ Wish I'd been there to punch his bloomin' 'ed!")
More on his feet than fists the cur relies,
And on that crowded “Corner" keeps his eyes.
With straightening shots ENTELLUS threats the foe, )
But DARES dodges the descending blow,
And back into his Corner's prompt to go,
Where bludgeon, knuckleduster, knotted sticks,
Foul sickening blows and cruel coward kicks
Are in his interest on ENTELLUS rained
At every point that placky boxer gained.
(“Oh!" groaned SAYERIUS. “And this sort of thing
Wo8 let go on, with gents around the Ring!”)
In vain ÉNTELLUS gave sly DARES snuf;
DARES already felt he'd had enough;
But twenty ruffians, thralls of bets and "booze,"
Had sworn could he not win he should not lose.
DARES, you see, was “ Champion" of his land,
mworowwwwwwwwww
And these were “Trojans all you'll understand.
(" Champion be blowed!” SAYERIUS said. “Wus luck,

They wosn't Trojans. This is British pluck!")
Then from the Corner fiendish howls arise,
Algy (patronisingly), “ULLO, JIM !-WHAT-YOU PLAY THE BANJO ? You
And oaths and execrations rend the skies.
LUCKY DOG, YOU POSSESS ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS I LACK!”
ENTELLUS stoutly to the fight returned.

Good Tories all, of County Kent,
Give ear unto my song,
And spare your puerile intent
To do your Party wrong.
There was a mighty Minister,
To power appointed late;
A virtuous and valiant Vir,
A Pillar of the State.
If one who doth fat oxen drive
Should in himself be fat,
This Minister seemed bound to thrive
As to his post most pat.
A more bucolic personage
Bucolics never sang;
And when he took that post and wage,
All round his praises rang.
O'er Agriculture to preside,
CHAPLIN was surely born;
He bore his honours with the pride
Of Chanticleer at morn.
In Kent there were some Tories found,
For Tories still there be;
In fact, the species doth abound
In spite of W. G.

But when a feud began

The motto of these Men of Kent
Was, “Love me, love my Dog ;"
And soon with angry discontent
The County was agog.
For CHAPLIN-it was like his cheek,
Cockiest of Ministers !-
Quite supererogant, did seek
To muzzle Kentish Curs !
Around to all the counties near
An angry protest ran;

A CURIOUS CURE. liriw MA
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
January 13, 1890.
So much attention is now bestowed upon the prevailing
epidemic that I will not apologise for troubling you with a letter
detailing a case that has recently come under my own notice. My
eldest son, AUGUSTUS, returned home from the educational establish-
ment admirably conducted by my eminent and reverend friend,
Dr. SWISHTALE, apparently in excellent health and spirits, shortly be-
fore Christmas Day. On the 4th (just a week before the date fixed for his
return to the educational establishment to which I have referred) he
showed symptoms of influenza. He complained of low spirits, seemed
inclined to quarrel with (and thrash) his younger brothers, and flatly
declined to accompany me to an inspection of the treasures contained
in the Natural Historical Museum at South Kensington. I immediately
prescribed for him a diet of bread and water, and an enforced retire-
ment to bed. He spent the remainder of the day in loudly-expressed
expostulation and lamentation. On the Sunday (after a consultation
with his mother) I decided to adopt a home treatment of kindness,
which I trusted would prevent the necessity of calling in our family
doctor. I give the remainder of the case in diary form.
Monday.-AUGUSTUS very poorly. Complains of pains in his head,
arms, legs, back, nose, and right little finger. Says he has no appe-

if called upon to shed their life's blood, it would be solely
in defence of that great engineering work, the true
monument of peace, in which their aspirations, their
hopes, and, above all, their capital, had been so fearlessly
embarked and largely invested. (Renewed enthusiasm.)
A Shareholder here rose, and said, that if there really
was, as the Chairman'seemed to imply, a probability that
war with our friendly neighbours might break out at any
minute, would it not be advisable, in the interests of
the Company, to come to some amicable and therefore
satisfactory commercial arrangement for the transit of
troops through the Tunnel, which, no doubt, it would be

their first object to secure. (Laughter.) There might
possibly be some stupid attempt of our own Government
forces to seize upon and even damage, with a view to
rendering the Tunnel useless, the works commanding
this end of it. Should not a Volunteer Corps of Share-
holders be at once organised-“ Hear! hear!”)—for the
purpose of keeping them until the French Military
Authorities came over in sufficient force to enable them
to seize and securely hold them against all comers? He
trusted he was not wanting in a well-balanced and
legitimate patriotism-(“No! no!")—but like their
respected Chairman, he felt that there was a higher
claim, a louder call than that addressed to an Englishman
by his country, and that was the deep, grim, stern and
stirring appeal made to the Seventeen per Cent. Deben-
ture-holder by his Company. (Roars of laughter.) .
Considerable uproar here arose over the ejection from
the meeting of a protesting Shareholder, who injudi-
ciously proposed an Amendment to the Report to the
effect that, In the face of grave National danger, the
Company ought to be prepared, even if it involved
serious financial loss, to close their Tunnel, if such a
step should be regarded as necessary to the security of
the country by the military advisers of the Government."
This proposition was howled down, and the Chairman
was again about to address the now somewhat quieted
meeting, when a copy of an evening paper, announcing

there should be a Voice which, like that of the Muezzin from the
Eastern minaret, shall summon the Faithful to the duties imposed
by their belief. We go into this waste land to possess it. It is
capable of being made to flourish as of old under the stimulating
radiance of a great ideal, and the diligent and intelligent culture of
one who, like Ourselves, has the capacity for direction.
Who will help Us? There is not a street in London, nor a village
in the country, which is not capable of producing, even at short
notice, and under slight pressure, a man or a woman who will spend
two hours a week, every week in the year, in more or less irksome
voluntary exertion in order to sell the Pilferer. To such we say,
“If, by canvassing, or otherwise, you secure, say, six subscribers,
the Pilferer shall be sent to you as long as the six continue their sub-
scriptions." In this case, the subscriptions should be paid in advance.
Are there any among the readers of the Pilferer craving for
counsel, for sympathy, and for the consolation of pouring out their
soul's grief at so much a quart, so to speak ? If so, may we ask them
to communicate with Us? Their cases, as they submit them, will be
placed before such competent and skilful advisers as We are able to
gather round Us from the best men and women in the Volapuk-
speaking world. Their confidences will be printed free of cost, and,
touched up with the literary art that shaped many a spicy series,

SET DOWN FOR TRIAL.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
DURING the Winter Vacation,
now at an end, I have been visiting
some of the theatres with a view to
educating my eldest son. Hearing
that in A Man's Shadow at the Hay-
market there was a representation of
"the Assize Chamber, Palais de Jus-
tice, Paris," I took NORTHBUTT (the
name I have given to my boy, in re-
cognition of the kindness thatis habitu-
ally shown to the Junior Bar by
two of the most courteous Judges of
modern times) to that temple of the
Drama, and was delighted at the
dignity and legal acuteness displayed
by Mr. KEMBLE as the President of the
Court. On referring to the programme,
I found that the part of the Usher was
played by Mr. ROBB HARWOOD, and
I trust that learned Gentleman (I
cannot help feeling that from his
Christian name, Mr. HARWOOD must
be connected with the law) will for-
give me if I make a few suggestions.
It has been my good fortune to be pre-
sent in a French Court, and I can
assure Mr. ROBB, that the Usher is an
infinitely more important personage
than he represents him to be. I am
not a dramatist, but I can readily
understand that it might interfere
with the interest of the play, and
perhaps, unduly damage the import-

A VERY SILLY SONG.
(By a Syndicate of Singers.)
In the gay play-house mingle
The gallant and the fair;
The married and the single,
And wit and wealth, are there;
And shirt-front spreads in acres,
And collar fathoms high;
Dressmakers and unmakers
In choice confections vie.
A sight to soften rockses !
Yet low my spirit falls,
For she is in the boxes,
And I am in the stalls.
The music's lively measure,
The curtain's plushy fold,
I hear untouched with pleasure,
Unsolaced I behold.
And rank and fashion vainly
My wandering eyes survey,
Though Mrs. B. and Lady C.'
Look well in green and grey.
The watchful leader knocks his
Desk, as the prompter calls,
And she is in the boxes.
And I am in the stalls.
How dully moves the drama
To one whose heart is dumb.
In listless panorama,
The actors go and come.
The couple just before me
Keep bobbing to and fro,
It doesn't even bore me
To see them doing so.
The lover closely locks his
Emotions one and all,

A PAGE FROM A DIARY.
(Purely Imaginary.)
First Week. Now let me see what I have to do. I will
leave out of consideration my extra-parliamentary utter-
ances—they will take care of themselves. Shan't forget
them. But other matters. Well, I have to turn the works
of my dear old friend ALF TENNYSON into Greek-of course,
omitting certain bigbly injudicious lines of a reactionary
character. Then I must read through the last edition of
the Encyclopædia Britannica. No skipping, but go through
every article thoroughly and conscientiously. Then, of
course, there is Grand Day at Gray's Inn. Must not forget
that. Should like, above all things, to be present. Now let
me see that I have got the date all right. Yes, I remember.
Grand Day, Hilary Term. Falls on a Thursday. Ishan't forget.
Second Week. - Translation of TENNYSON into Greek going
on famously. Not had time to cut down any trees, so busy
have I been. Got as far as "Foghorn” in Encyclopedia
Britannica. New edition a very good one. Glad I made up
my mind to read it. Let me see, anything else? Why, to be
sure, Grand Day at Gray's Inn ! Rather cut off my hand
or even my head, than forget that! Treasurer particularly
nice man. So are all the Benchers. So are all the Bar-
risters and the Students. Excellent fellows, all of them-
yes, excellent. So must not forget Grand Day at Gray's
Inn. To be sure. Falls on a Thursday.
Third Week.-A. T. progressing nicely. Little difficulty
about the translation of the Northern Farmer. Rather
awkward to give the proper weight of a country dialect in
Greek. However, it reads very well, indeed! Think my
dear old friend ALF will be pleased with it; he should be,
as it has given me a good deal of trouble. However, all's
well that ends well. E. B. also satisfactory. Got into the
"D's.” Article upon the “Docks," scarcely exhaustive
enough to please me, so have been reading some other books
upon the same subject. Forgotten nothing? No, because I
remember I have to dine at Gray's Inn. Yes, to be sure-
23rd of January, Grand Day. Hilary Term. Falls on a
Thursday. Would not forget it to save my election! Look-

THE CAPTAIN OF THE “PARIS.”
CAPTAIN SHARP, of the Newhaven steamer,
Paris, you're no craven;
Grim and growling was the gale that you
from your dead reckoning bore ;
And, but for your brave behaving, she might
never have made haven,
But have foundered in mid-Channel, or been
wrecked on a lee-shore.
With your paddle-floats unfeathered, wonder
was it that you weathered
Such a storm as that of Sunday, which
upset our nerves on land,
Though in fire-side comfort tethered. How
it blew, and blared, and blethered !
All your passengers, my Captain, say your
pluck and skill were grand.
Much to men like you is owing, when wild
storms around are blowing,
As they seem to have been doing since the
opening of the year:
Howling, hailing, sleeting, snowing; but for
captains calm and knowing,
Passage of our angry Channel were indeed
a task of fear.
Well, you brought them safely through it,
when not every man could do it,
And your passengers, my Captain, are in-
spired with gratitude.
Therefore, Mr. Punch thus thanks you, and
right readily enranks you, [brood.

THE LUXURY OF PANTOMIME.
ONE day last week, after a struggle for life, Her
Majesty's Theatre was shut up, five hundred persons, so
it was stated, lost employment, and the Cinderella family,
proud sisters and all, nay, even the gallant Prince him-
self, were turned adrift. Smiling, at the helm of the
Drury Lane Ship, stands AUGUSTUS DRURIOLANUS, who
sees, not unmoved, the wreck of "Her Majesty's Oppo-
sition,” and murmurs to himself as Jack and the Bean-
stalk continues its successful course, "This is, indeed,
the survival of the fittest," and, charitably, DRURIO-
LANUS sends out a life-boat entitled “Benefit Perform-

And, indeed, as your host leads you along the stately
passages, through the storied rooms, you find his pho-
tograph everywhere. The tables are covered with them,
showing your host in all attitudes and costumes. “Yes,"
he says, with a sigh, “I think I have marched up to the
camera's mouth as often as most men of my years."
Ascending the rustic staircase which leads from the
garden, WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE takes you past the
library into the drawing-room, in the upper parts of the
leaded windows of which are inserted panels of rare old
glass, cunningly obtained by melting superfluous Welsh
ale bottles. He leads you to a table, as round as that
at which a famous Conference was held, and points to a
little ivory painting. It shows a chubby little boy some
two years of age, with rather large head and broad
shoulders, sitting at the knee of a young nymph ap-
proaching her fifth year. On her knee is a book, and
the chubby boy, with dark hair falling low over his
forehead, his great brown eyes staring frankly at you,
points with his finger to a passage. When you learn
that this is a portrait of your host and his sister taken
in the year 1811, you naturally come to the conclusion
that the young lady has, for party purposes, been mis-

HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.
Hints from the Chancellor of the Exchequer's correspondence.
SIR, -If you wish to immortalise yourself as Chancellor
of the Exchequer, now is your opportunity. You have a
surplus, I believe, of eight or nine millions ? This is about
the figure required to provide the Members of the London
County Council with a moderate-sized palace, not per..
haps entirely suited to their exalted dignity, but, at least,
sufficient to house them in something like proper and fit-
ting style. A site should be secured on the Embankment,
by clearing away Somerset House, and the intervening
buildings, including the blocks of the Inner and Middle
Temple, which could all be carted away and re-erected
further down, say, at Millbank, and on the space thus se-
cured a white marble structure could be reared with an
adequately imposing façade facing the river, that would
in some slight degree represent the majesty of the illus-
trious body destined to occupy it. I don't say that nine
millions would be enough thoroughly to carry out the de-
sign I have in view, but your surplus might serve as a
central fund to begin upon, to which Parliament, no doubt,
would cheerfully add another five or six millions' if re-
quired. Such an obvious use for your money, I feel, needs
no further argument from yours encouragingly and sug-
gestively, A FULL BLOWN LONDON COUNTY COUNCILLOR.
SIR-I have several near relatives in the Colonies, with
whom I have, owing to the present exorbitant rates for
postage, not communicated for many years. This fact has
suggested to me that the golden opportunity now offers
itself to you of re-uniting family ties, re-opening closed
correspondence, restoring natural affection in otherwise
hardened breasts, and, in a word, consolidating the
Empire, it may be, for countless ages yet unborn. Spend
your surplus, Sir, in providing this country and all her
dependencies with a farthing postage-mind, not a penny,
but a FARTHING POSTAGE! I read somewhere that the
actual cost to the Government for the transport of letters
was at the rate of ten for a penny. Thus your four mil-
lions sunk in the enterprise ought to produce you an im-
mediate profit, at least so I make it, of six millions a year.
But, profit or no profit, think of the boon to thousands of

THE Vaudeville, when it was opened, was devoted to all that was
light and cheerful. Comedy and Burlesque went hand-in-hand, and
the audience, if ever asked to weep, were begged to cry with
laughter. But Mr. ROBERT BUCHANAN (with the assistance of the
late Mr. RICHARDSON) “has changed all that." Clarissa, the pre-
sent attraction at the little theatre on the North-side of the Strand,
is a piece of the most doleful character. The First Act is devoted
to a very heartless abduction, and the last to a lingering death and a
fatal duello. When it is announced that the successful fencer who
“kills his man” is no less a person than that excellent Comedian,

volves a financial question, your opinion thereon
would be of great value.
Report of the Quartermaster-Gen., to be for-
warded to Inspector-Gen, of Fortifications.
CAN offer no suggestion about the cost of pro-
duction until it can be ascertained whether the
Cannonette will be suitable for Home Defences.
What is your opinion on this point ?
Report of Inspector-General of Fortifications,
to be forwarded to Secretary of State.
No doubt the Cannonette might be used in
a variety of ways. But it will be observed that
the Ordnance Committee raised the question
of expense-a matter that scarcely concerns
my Department.
Memo. of Secretary of State, to be forwarded
to Financial Secretary.
PLEASE read inclosed Report, and send on.
Report of Financial Secretary, to be forwarded
to the Director-General of Ordnance.
It is premature to consider the question
of expense until it has been decided that the
introduction of this Cannonette will be of
advantage to the Service. The Ordnance
Committee use the words, “Might possibly,"
which are not, in themselves, a strong recom-
mendation. It must be borne in mind that
the Army Estimates must be calculated with
the greatest attention to economy.
Report of Director-General of Ordnance to
Commander-in-Chief.
I HAVE examined Cannonette, which appears
to have been constructed on the lines of a
weapon manufactured in the reign of HENRY
THE EIGHTH, of which there is a specimen in

JOEY beamed as he walked across Lobby towards Cloak-Room.
Rather a sickly beam, compared with wild lights that used to flash
from his eyes in the old times, when majority against Home Rule
was a great deal more than 67.
“Yes, I am a little tired, Toby, dear boy,” he said. “These dull
sittings and early adjournments don't suit me. I was better and
stronger in the old times, when we used to sit up all night and fight
all day. Remember thirteen years ago, when I slept for an hour on
two chairs in the Library ? Returned to House at five in morning;
found them all looking jaded and worn; cheered them up by saying
I'd come back like a giant refreshed. Well, I'll go home now, have
a good sleep, be all right in the morning.”
And when we are gathered in House for Wednesday's sitting we
learn that all is right indeed, and that poor old JOEY B. lies quiet,
with face upturned, in his alien lodgings off Clapham Common.
He would be surprised if he knew with what warm and sincere
feeling his sudden taking-off is mourned. At the time he spoke of,
thirteen years back, he was certainly the most abhorred person on
the premises, and gleefully chuckled over consciousness of the fact.
But the House, with nearer knowledge, learned to recognise his
sterling qualities, and now, when Death rounds off with tragic touch
the comicalities of his public life, everyone has a kindly word to say
for JOSEPH GILLIS.

that the Indefatigable and Percy-vering One did not apply to Mr. Punch for
permission to reprint the page of Bradshaw which appeared in Mr. Punch's

magnum opus in parvo is really interesting and amusing, but if there is one

AN
instance, our PERCY is inaccurate. Be writes : “ Close on fifty years have passed
by, and the guide with every year has continued, like Mr. Stiggins, to be a
swellin' wisibly.'” The Brave Baron challenges PERCY to mortal combat on
this issue, defying him to prove that Mr. Stiggins was ever described within the
limits of Pickwick, as “swellin' wisibly.” Will the erudite biographer of Brad-
shar be surprised to learn, that, in the first place, the description "swellin'
wisibly” was never applied to Mr. Stiggins at all, but was used by Mr. Weller
senior, as illustrating the condition of a “ young 'ooman on the next form but
two" from where he was sitting, who had“ drank nine breakfast cups and a
half, and," he goes on to whisper to Sam,“ She's a swellin' wisibly before my
wery eyes.” In the second place, the expression was employed at a time when
Mr. Stiggins was not present, but, in his official character, as " a delegate from
the Dorking branch of our society, Brother Stiggins" was in attendance down-
stairs. With these two exceptions, one mistake of omission, and one of com-
mission, the Baron confers his imprimatur on the Story of Bradshaw's Guide,
and recommends it to the public.
For a first-rate, short, well-constructed, and sensationally interesting story,
let me recommend my readers to The Peril of Richard Pardon. Only one
possible objection do I see to it, and that is a matter of my own private opinion,
which is, that Richard Pardon is the most irritating idiot ever created by an
author. For the sake of the story, it was necessary that he should be weak;
but he is such a very backboneless man, and yet quite strong enough to support
the fabric of the plot. Then one is cleverly put off the soent by a certain Richard
Mortlock, from whom the reader expects much more than ever comes out. The
Bequel of this capital novelette must be Richard Mortlock. I have quite for-
gotten to say that The Peril of Richard Pardon is by Mr. B. L. FARJEON,
whom I have to thank for making time pass too rapidly on many a previous
occasion. The Hour Before Dinner Series - not that this is the genuine title, but
it might be, and is a suggestion-is a real “boon and a blessing" to those who,
like Podgers, in JOHN HOLLINGSHEAD's immortal faroe, “only have a 'our,"
not for "their dinner," but for their novel-reading throughout the day.

THE GREAT LINCOLN TRIAL STAKES.
LAMBETH is in darkness. A Policeman with a bull's-eye prevents
my driver's energetio endeavours to drive through the Palace wall.
I stumble into the large hall known as the Library. “Here," said
I to myself, "is taking place the historic trial of the Bishop of
LINCOLN.” The weird soene strongly resembles the Dream Trial in
The Bells, where the judges, counsel, and all concerned, are in
& fog. Will the limelight flash suddenly upon the chief actor,
the Bishop of LINCOLN, as he takes the stage and re-acts the part
that has caused the trial ? Archbishop BANCROFT founded this
library, 80 theatrical associations are natural. The only lights in
the long and lofty library (excepting the clerical and legal) are a
dozen or two wax candles and a few oil-lamps, but of daylight, gas-
light, or electric, nothing. I can hear the voice of JEUNE, Q.C.,
the JEUNE premier of this ecclesiastical drama.
They have commenced proceedings. In this, the Archbishop's
Court, they, very properly, begin with prayer. So does the House of
Commons. “Any special form of orison ?" I ask in a whisper of
the JEUNE premier, Q.C. “Yes,” he answers in a subdued tone.
“Look in your prayer-book for form of prayer to be used by those
at sea.' That's it." Then he has to continue his argument.
At the further end of the library we have the Church, represented
by an Archbishop and five Bishops; also a Judge, in a full-bottomed
wig, who has evidently got in by mistake. Then we have the Law,
represented by a row of Q.C.'s, their juniors, and attendants; and
then a chorus of ordinary people, and common, or Thames Policemen.
But where's the Bishop of LINCOLN ? Not among the Thames
Policemen ? Not in the Dock? Where ? Aha! I see him. I foous
him. I sketch him. Veni, vidi, vici! I show result on paper to
Official. “Oh, no,” he says; "that's not the Bishop, that's
TAINGUMMY," a Clerk of the Court, or something. Hang THINGUMMY!
Official disappears. Lights, ho! a link on Lincoln ! I determine to
find him. The Bishops sit round three tables, on a raised platform.
The Archbishop of CANTERBURY sits in the centre; on his right is
the mysterious Judge, in full wig, and red robes; this is the Vicar-
General, Sir JAMES PARKER DEANE, Q.C.; next to him sits
Assessor Dr. ATLAY, Bishop of (HEREFORD, who looks anything but
happy; his hair has the appearance of being impelled by a strong
draught, and his hand is to his face, as if the draught had
produced toothache. The portly Bishop of OXFORD is on his right,
and like the other corner man, the Bishop of SALISBURY, he scribbles
away at a great rate in a huge manuscript book, or roll of foolscap.
LIKELY-VERY!
On the left of the Archbishop sits the Bishop of LONDON, who " CONFOUND THESE BLACKS! THEY FOLLOW ME EVERYWHERE,”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CRY OF THE CITY CHILDREN.
(For Playing Fields.)
[A conference of delegates of various Athletic Clubs was held
on March 4, in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, for the
purpose of considering the necessity for the further provision of
Playing fields for the people of the Metropolis.]
WOULD you see Town Children playing, O my brothers,
With their bats and leathern spheres ?
They are herding where the slum-reek fames and smothers,
_And that isn't play, one fears.
The young rustics bat in verdant meadows,
The young swells are "scrummaging” out west;
They are forming future GRACES, STODDARTS, HADOWS;
They are having larks, which, after all, is best.
But the young Town Children, O my brothers,
They are mooning all the day;
They are idling in the play-time of the others,
For they have no place to play!
Do you recollect they used to play at cricket
In the bye-streets years ago,
With a broomstick for a bat, a coat for wicket?
Now the Bobbies hunt them so!
The old ladies grumble at their skipping ;
The old gents object to their tip-cat;
So they squat midst slams that shine like dirty dripping,
Not knowing what the dickens to be at.
And the young Town Children, O my brothers,
Do you ask them why they stand
Making mud-pies, to the horror of their mothers,
In their dirty Fatherland ?
They look up with their pale and grubby faces,
And they answer—“Cricket? Us?
Only wish we could, but then there ain't no places ;
Wot's the good to make a fuss ?
Yes, you 're right, Guv, this is dirty fun and dreary;
But 'Rounders' might just bring us 'fore the Beak,
And if we dropped our peg-top down a airey,
They would hurry up and spank us for our cheek,
Arsk the swell 'uns to play cricket, not as nippers ;
We must sit here damp and dull,
'Midst the smell of stale fried fish and oily kippers,

OMNIBUSINESS.
(A Report of a Meeting yet to be held.)
A MEETING of the Improved Saloon Palace Coach Combination (Limited),
was held at the Offices of the Company on Thursday last, when Lord BUR-
LINGTON ARCADIA (in the absence of the Duke of UTOPIA) was called upon
to preside.
The noble Chairman said he was delighted to see so many benevolent-
looking shareholders present. He admitted that he felt a little nervous, as
no doubt the Board of Directors (of whom he bad the honour to be one) had
acted to a great extent upon their own responsibility in conducting the busi-
ness of the Company. Encouraged by the comments of the Press, the Board
considered they owed a duty to the Public second only in importance to the
duty they owed to the shareholders. Nowadays, great trading communities
had no right to act selfishly—they must think not only of those who owned
the capital, but also of that vast majority whose comfort it should be their
pleasure to enhance
The paper to which he specially referred suggested that various improve-
ments should be made. All the Saloon Palace cars of the Company, it was
proposed, should be repainted in various colours, to facilitate identification;
but this would cost money-(loud cheers)—and he was happy to say they
had money to spend. They had spent it. (Murmurs.) He was sure that they
would be pleased when they learned the manner in which that money had
been spent. Instead of being hoarded up to swell the dividend- (groans.)-it
had been absorbed in improvements which would confer great benefits upon
the community. (Uproar.)
A SHAREHOLDER. What have we to do with the community ?
The CHAIRMAN explained that as the greater included the lesser, the com-
munity must include the Shareholders. " No, no!"). He was sorry to hear
those sounds of dissent, but what had been done could not be undone. (Loud
and prolonged groaning). He trusted that he would be treated with courtesy.
(“Hear, hear!” He had come to the meeting at considerable inconvenience.
(Cheers.) As a matter of fact, he had little stake in the Company, as some
time since he had disposed of the vast bulk of his shares. (Groans.) How-
ever, he would continue. As they knew, the vehicles were now fitted with
warm bottles in winter and air-cushions in summer. Every passenger had a
velvet upholstered arm-chair. Flowers were supplied in great profusion in
the interior of the vehicles, and costly shrubs arranged on the platform sup-
porting the cushioned garden-seats of the exterior. As the additional weight
to be drawn in consequence of these improvements was considerable, it had
been considered advisable to increase the number of horses to each vehicle
from two to six, (Groans.) New routes had been selected for instance,
special services of carriages had been arranged up and down the Belgrave
Road, the Mall, Hammersmith, the Upham Park Road, Chiswick, and round
Brompton Square. Then he might say-
A SHAREHOLDER. We know all this, but how about the dividend ? (Cheers )
The CHAIRMAN regretted the interruption. However, as the meeting
wished to enter into the subject of finance-(cheers and cries of “ We do !")

Mr. VAL PRINSEP, A.R.A., having tempora-
www
rily dissociated himself from the paint-brush
and canvas, by which he has made his name
and fame, continues his novel Virginie. In
the present chapter he incidentally gives a
description of the service of Mass in the good
Abbé Leroux's parish church, which is a
triumph of imagination and subtle humour.
No wonder “the Abbé Leroux was scandal-
ised," when the service had been turned
topsy-turvy, the credo put before the gloria,
and a young person among his congregation,
topping all other voices, was singing a solo !
Where was the Beadle? or a Churchwarden ?
or an Aggrieved Parishioner? Three cheers
for Facile PRINSEP's novel!
In Plain Tales from the Hills, by Mr.
RUDYARD KIPLING, the jaded palate of the
"General Reader” will recognise a new and
piquant flavour. In places the manner sug-
gests an Anglo-Indian BRET HARTE, and there
is perhaps too great an abundance of phrases
and local allusions which will be dark sayings
to the uninitiated. But the stories show a
quite surprising knowledge of life, a fami-
liarity with military, civil, and native society,
and a command of pathos and humour, which
have already won a reputation for the author.
Few can read Beyond the Pale, The Arrest
of Lieutenant Golightly, The Story of
Muhammed Din, The Germ Destroyer, and
The Madness of Private Ortheris, for example,
without admiration for the versatility which
can cover so wide a range, and impress,
amuse, or touch with the same ease and

MUSICAL NOTES.
I HAVE just received FLORIAN
PASCAL's Music composed for Tra
la la Tosca, published by JOSEPH
WILLIAMS of Berners Street.
Justice was not done to it on the
stage at the Royalty, but there
are two morceaux in it which
ought to become popular; one
being a song entitled “Her Eye,”
which, were it wedded to serious
words, would be highly popular
as a contralto song, just as SOLLI-
VAN's charming "Hush a bye
Bacon,” in Cox and Box, became
“Birds of the Night.” Then the
Gavotte in this book is as grace-
ful and catching as the Gavotte
de Louis Treize, and would be
in great request with orchestras
and bands everywhere.
KLEIN's Musical Notes of the
Year, a useful and trustworthy
historical record, was sent to me.
and not" de-KLEIN'd with thanks."
I have just heard that there is a
new pick-me-up called “Zingit.”
What it is I don't know, and I
haven't as yet come across the
inevitable big advertisement; but
what I have ascertained is, that
Mr. EDWARD SOLOMON, who is
now wearing the diamond scarf-
pin presented to him by the
Guards whom he led on to victory
in their recent burlesque engage-
ment, has composed à polka or
waltz which bears the name of
“ Zingit," and which might bear
on the wrapper, “If you can't
play it, or dance it, Zing it.”

CONSERVATOIRE).
WHERE MARRIAGES ARE
MADE.
THE application for a licence to
marry at St. George's, Albemarle
Street, made by the JEUNE PRE-
MIER, Q C., on behalf of the Rev.
Dr. KER GRAY, was opposed by
Canon CAPEL CURE, of St.
George's, Hanover Square, the
Hymeneal Temple par excellence
of the Metropolis. Dr. TRISTRAM,
with traditional Shandyan cau-
tion, said he would “take time to
consider his decision." Should
Dr. Time be adverse to the oppo-
nents, then will the Minister with
the sad-dog name of “KER
GRAY" become the Canon's bête
noire. If the decision be t'other
way, then KER GRAY may twit
the Canon with being “a regular
Care," and might compose &
chant on the old lines of
“ A Cure, a Cure, a Cure, a Cure,
Oh isn't be a Cure !”
While the Canon could retaliate
with a parody on “Old Dog
Tray."
“ The chapel's far too near,
But p'raps another year
May put a stop to old KBR GRAY."
In the meantime, the affair

ment, and wish luck to both

THOUGHTS ON HIS WINE-MERCHANT.
I LOVE my Wine-merchant- he talks with a charm
That robs his most dubious vintage of harm.
And the choicest Havanas less comforting are
Than the fames of his special commended cigar.
I'm a reticent man, with a palate of wood,
And I judge by results if a vintage be good.
But I own to the charm of my Wine-merchant's worst,
If he gives me his comforting flattery first.
He proffers me samples to praise or to blame,
And I strongly suspect they're exactly the same.
But we gaze at each other with critical eye,
And I wish he would hint if it's fruity or dry.
I want, say, a dozen of average stuff
(Though a couple of bottles were really enough),
And I enter his portals, reluctant and slow,
Resolved just to give him the order and go.
But he takes me in hand in his soothering style,
Suggests in a whisper, and “ books" with a smile ;
And I vainly dissemble the joy in my face
When he ceases to ply me with bottle and case.
The talk drifts away to affairs of the State,
And I ought to escape, but I palter and wait;
And he opens a box in the midst of his chat,
And asks, like a flash, my opinion of “that” ?
I sniff the tobacco, and turn it about
With an air that is really of genuine doubt,
And knowing so little what judges would say,
I meekly consent to a hundred- and pay.
There's a charm, when the varied consignment arriver,
To men who are blost with amonable wives;
But I watoh my AMANDA with covert alarm,
And wait till she severs the Wine-merchant's charm.

LADY MAIDSTONE announces "an 8:30 o'clock” (to adapt
the Whistlerian title when he did his ten-and-sixpenny
o'clock”) at the Westminster Town Hall, for April 26,
for the production of an entirely new play, entitled
Anne Tigony, by a new and original dramatic authoress
of the name of SOPHIE KLEES. It is, we understand, a
domestic drama illustrative of Greek life. The great
sensation scene is of course “when Greek meets Greek.”
This tragedy, we are informed, “refers to what, in the
Greek way of thinking, are the sacred rites of the dead,
and the solemn importance of burial.” It is, therefore, an
Anti-Cremation Society drama. The tableaux are by

OLD TIMES REVIVED.
"RETURNING TO OLD TIMES.—The new coaches, which are to carry the parcel mail
between Manchester and Liverpool nightly, ran for the first time to-night. The coach
from Manchester for Liverpool started punctually at ten o'clock from the Parcel Office, in
Stevens Square. Some thousands of people had assembled to witness the inauguration of
the service. The van, which hus been specially constructed for the service, was well-filled
with parcels, and a guard in uniform, an old soldier, took his seat inside it, armed with a
sword. The departure of the coach, which was announced by the
blowing of a horn, was loudly cheered by the crowd of people, and the vehicle was
followed down the main streets of the city by some hundreds of spectators. There are
three horses to the van, and relays of horses are provided at Hollins Green and Prescot.
The coaches are timed to do the thirty-six mile journey in five and a half hours, arriving
in Manchester and Liverpool respectiveiy at 3:15 A.M."-Correspondent's Telegram. Daily
Telegraph, April 15, 1890.
ON THE SWOOP!
Far from its native eyrie, high in air,
Above the extended plain,
The Teuton Eagle hovers. Broad and fair
From Tropic main to main
Stretches a virgin continent vast, and void
Of man's most treasured works ;
No plough on those huge slopes is yet employed ;
The untamed tiger larks
In unfelled forest and unfooted brake;
Those streams scarce know a keel;
Through the rank herbage writhes the monstrous
snake;
Dim shapes of terror steal
Unmarked and menacing from clump to clump,
Whilst from the tangled sorub
Is heard the trampling elephant's angry trump.
The frolic tiger-cub
Tumbles in jungle-shambles; in his lair
The lion couches prone.
What does that wingéd portent in mid-air,
Hovering alert, alone ?
Strong-pinioned, brazen-beaked, and iron-clawed,
This Eagle from the West;
Adventurous, ravening for prey, unawed
By perils of the quest.
Beneath new clouds, above fresh fields he flies,
Foraging fleet and far,
With clutching talons, and with hungering eges,
Scornful of bound or bar.
Winged things, he deems, may safely oversweep
Landmark and mountain-post.
The Forest-king may fancy he can keep
His realm against a host
Of such aërial harpies. Be it proved !
Till late the Imperial fowl
Not far from its home-pinnacles hath roved ;
Now LEO on the prowl
Must watch his winged rival. Who may tell
Where it shall strike or stoop ?
LEO, your lair must now be warded well ;
AQUILA's on the Swoop!

IN THE KNOW.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)
THE Duke of DUMPSHIRE seems to
bave been much annoyed by my state-
ment that he killed two trainers with
hisown hand, for being caught watch-
ing a trial of his Derby horses, and
that the Jockey Club took no action. I
beg to inform his Grace and those who
approve his methods, that I care no
more for their annoyance than I do for
the muddy-minded lucubrations of
Mr. JEBEMY and his servile tribe of
moon-calves. I have public duties to
perform, and if, in the course of my
comments on racing, I should find my-
self occasionally compelled to run
counter to the imbecile prejudices of
some of the aristocratio patrons of the
turf, I can assure my readers that I
shall not flinch from the task. I there-
fore repeat that, in the middle of last
month, the Duke of DUMPSHIRE killed
two trainers, and that up to the pre-
sent time the Jockey Club have not
enforced against him the five-pound
penalty which is specially provided by
their rules for offences of this sort.
When Mr. JACOBS, who has no aristo-
cratio connections, ventured to lynch
a rascally tout on Newmarket Heath
last year, he was made to pay up at
once. The contrast is suggestive.
A lot of jannering nonsense bas
been talked about Bazaar by the
Will-o'-the-Wisps who mislead the
long-suffering public in turf matters.
Bazaar is by Rector out of Church
Mouse, and in his pedigree are to be
found such well-known roarers as
Boanerges and Hallelujah Sal-not
much of a recommendation to any-
body except Mr. JEREMY. His own
performances are worse than con-
temptible. As a two-year old, he was
placed second at eight stone to Candle.
stick in the Warmington Open Welter
Handicap. After that he sprang a
curb in the middle of his back, and
the fools who train him actually
brought him out to run in the All-
aged Selling Plate at Ballymac-
whacket. He won the race easily
enough of course, but only an im-
postor, whose bead was stuffed with
horsehair, would attach the least im -
portance to that. Since then he has
eaten two pairs of spurs, a halter, and
half of a jockey, which scarcely looks
like winning races. I have now re-
lieved my conscience on the matter, so
if the puddle-brains wish to back hím,
their loss must lie at their own doors.
The Marquis de MILLEPARDON has
bought Chorobock for £2000. At the
last Epsom Meeting Chorobock showed
himself a fine pace-maker in an East
wind, having cantered in from Sister
Mary, who as good as walked round
Vilikinswhen the latter was being tried
without his pastern-pad on the Cots-
wold Hills. At the same time it must
be remembered, that Sister Mary only
got home by a length from Smockfrock,
after having been double-girthed and
provided with a bucket of Pocock's
antiseptic, anti-crib-biting condition
balls for internal application over the
Newmarket T. Y. C.
Next week, I may have something
to say about Derby prospects. For
the present, I can only advise would-
be investors to steer clear of Mr.
JEREMY and his quacking, goose-
headed parasites.

PRIMROSE'S PEEP-SHOW.
(Vide Lord Rosebery's resume of the year's work of the

MASTER BULL loquitur :-
HUMPH! Show is very passable, no doubt;
And as you pull the strings, my clever Showman,
'Tis clear that you know what you are about,
Sense's sworn friend, and babbling folly's foeman.
The slides, as worked by you, seem mighty fine,
A trifle vague, perhaps, in composition,
Sloppy in colouring, and weak in line,
As is the civic peep-show's old tradition ;
Still there is graphio vigour here and there,
Perspective, and a general sense of “movement."
On the old “Shirker" Show, 'tis only fair
To own, it evidences some improvement.
Plenty of slides ! there is no doubt of that ;
In fact one questions if there are too many.
Yes, I shall find when you pass round the hat,
The price is more than the old-fashioned Penny.
I pay my money and I take my-choice ?
Well 20, it won't quite fit, that fine old patter,
Still, if your Show proves good, I shall rejoice;
A trifling rise in fee won't greatly matter,
If 'tis not too “progressive" (as you say).
To stump up for sound work I'm always willing ;
But though, of course, a Penny may not pay,
One wants a first-class Peep-Show for a Shilling!
Some of your novel slides are rather nice,
Some of them, on the other hand, look funny.
I felt grave doubts about 'em once or twice.
I don't want muddlers to absorb my money.
However, as I said, 'tis very clear

Her courteous informant bowed, and shook

“Well, never mind,” said good-natured
NELLIE, “I daresay you will get on very well

THE FIRST FIGHT.
(Between the Seventh Team of Australian Cricketers and an
English Eleven, begun at Sheffield Park, on May 8, 1890.)
A HAZE hung over the Surrey Downs
In the early morning; but Nature's frowns
Broke up in smiles as the day advanced.
And the grey mist cleared and the sunbeams glanced
On MURDOCH bold, and his merry men.

Were on the alert, at Sheffield Park.

[The Report of the Sweating Committee says that “the inefficiency of many of the lower class of workers, early marriages, and the tendency
of the residuum of the population in large towns to form a helpless community, together with a low standard of life and the excessive supply
of unskilled labour are the chief factors in producing sweating. The Committee's chief "recommendations " in respect of the evils of Sweating
seem to be, the lime-washing of work-places and the multiplication of sanitary inspectors.]

“NOT SUCH A FOOL AS HE LOOKS.”
· Leo Britannicus, loquitur ;-
Good Gentlemen both, you 're on opposite tacks!
Well, your plans you are perfectly welcome to try on.
They talk of the patience of lambs, or park haoks;
They 're not iq it, my lads, with an elderly Lion.
A Lion, I'mean, of the genuine breed,
And not a thin-skinned and upstart adolescent.
Dear me! did I let everybody succeed
In stirring me up, or in making things pleasant,
By smoothing me down in a flattering style,
I'd have, there's no doubt, a delectable time of it.
You think I look drowsy, and smile a fat smile ;
Well, what if I do? Where's the very great crime of it ?
A Lion, you know, is not all roar and ramp,
So, STANLEY my hero, why worry and chivey?
Mere blarney won't blind me; I'm not of that stamp;
So don't hope to hypnotise me, good CAPRIVI.
Why, bless you, my boys, long before you were cubbed
I was charged, by your betters, with being too lazy ;
But rivals have found, when outwitted or drubbed,
That a calm waiting game is not always 80 crazy.
In Indian jungles, American plains,
And far Eastern wilds, they have fancied me" bested,"
Because, when hot rivals were hungry for gains,
I kept my eyes open, and patiently rested.
A stolid and sleepy expression will steal
At times, I'm aware, o'er my leonine features ;
But, when the time's ripe, my opponents may feel
I'm not the most easily bombagged of creatures.
In North as in South, in the East as the West,
Opponents have planted their paws down before me.
But where are they now, boys ? J'y suis, et j'y reste !
Staying power iſ the thing ; so don't bully and bore me.
I hear you, my STANLEY, I hear you and mark;
To snub you for patriot zeal were ungracious;
But-well, after all, on your Continent Dark
My footprints are plain, and my realm's pretty spacious.
I'don't mean to say that a purblind content
My power should palsy, my policy dominate,
And Congos and Khartoums that pay cent. per cent.
Are tempting, but arrogant haste I abominate.
My" prancing proconsuls" not always are right,
Whose first and last word for old Leo is "collar !"
I'm not going to flare up like fury and tight
Every time someone else wins an acre or dollar.
But if you imagine I'm out of the hunt
Every time I take breath, you are vastly mistaken :
I know you're a brick, and like language that's blant;
Well, Lions sleep lightly, and readily waken!
For you, friend CAPRIVI,'your manners are nice,
Your style of caressing is verily charming;
How soothingly sweet is your placid advice,
Your mild deprecation is almost disarming;
Almost, but not quite, for 'tis true Teuton law
That unfailing defence is the root of the matter;
And Leo is fully aware tooth and claw
Must not be talked off e'en by friendlies who flatter.
Your prod, my good STANLEY, CAPRIVI, your pat,
Are politic both; I've an eye upon each of you.
The lids may look lazy, but don't trust to that;

IN THE KNOW.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)
THERE has been lately some racing at Kempton and
various other places, as to which, I ought perhaps to say
a few words. Not that I acknowledge a right in any-
one to dictate to me how and when I shall notice mat-
ters connected with the turf. The Bedlamites who mouth
and gibber about horses and their owners, as if they
were in the constant habit of living on terms of familiar
intimacy with the aristocracy, instead of being, as they
probably are, the dumpling-headed parasites of touts
and stable-boys, are entitled only to the contempt of
every decent man who knows anything about what he
professes to understand. At any rate, they have mine.
My knowledge of the Kempton Course dates back at least
fifty years. To be sure, it was not at that time a race-
course, but was mostly ploughed fields and thickets.
But if the anserous and asinine mooncalves, whose high
priest is Mr. JEREMY, suppose that that fact in any way
weakens the authority with which I may claim to speak
on the subject, I can only assure them, that they prove
themselves fit inmates for the various asylums from
which they ought never to have been withdrawn. I
never thought much of Philomel. Ten years ago, I
observed, with regard to this animal, “ Philomel must
be watched. There is no knowing what a course of
podophyllin and ginger might not do. Failing that, I
should feel inclined to say, buncombe.” Mr. J. says,
this was a different mare. What of that? In turf
matters the name is everything, and I am therefore
justified in citing this as one of the most extraordinary
instances of prescience known to the turf world.
Megatherium, I notice, has many admirers. As a
horizontal bar, or possibly as a clothes-line, he might
have merits, but as a horse, I must confess, he has
little to recommend him. When Loblolly Boy cantered
home for the East End Weight-for-age Welter Handi-
cap, I said that the son of Rattlesnake could make mince-
meat of all his rivals. Since then he has made for his
owner £5,000,000 in added money, at an initial expense
of twopence halfpenny for saveloys and onions, a com-
bination of which this splendid animal is particularly
fond. Loblolly Boy was by Rowdy out of Hoyden, and

the minds of the people, do your utmost io make this new example of the unparalleled cruelty of Russian despotism known to the whole world..
Tbis is a great task well worth accomplishing; and if you succeed, the losses we suffered in that terrible butchery will be redeemed." - From the

In shuddering flight away from that frozen hell,
That pestilent prison for all things free and fair,
Where the raven's croak is the patriot's only knell
On the tainted air.
Let it be known! Ayel the cruel secret crawls,
Despite the vigilant watch of tyranny's hounds,
From the scaffold's screen, from the kamera's sombre walls;
Away, as you wished, o'er enfranchised lands it sounds,
And shocks the gentle, and stirs the blood of the strong ;
But he, the Autocrat, sits, with a shaken mind,
And a palsied heart; to the tale of horror and wrong
He's deaf and blind !
Pale ladies lashed, at the word of a drunken brute, ["plet!"
To the death they welcome e'en from the torturing
And his eyes are blind, and his trembling lips are mute,
Whilst the eyes of a world of shuddering men are wet.
Chained gangs of patriot captives stabbed or shot
At the scared caprice of a bully, craven-souled !
And the Autocrat, whilst all hearts with shame wax hot,
Sits still and cold !
Ust-Kara's far, and the hasty scaffold reared
In the grey of the early morning bore-a fool,
Who had not learned that Law must be blindly feared,
Though sent to the stern Siberian wastes to school.
The unconvicted exile who dares to lift
A voice, a hand, is a proven “ Terrorist,"
And if, in Yakoutsk, he is given a shortish shrift,
Need the White Tzar list ?
The White TZAR sits on his gorgeous seat, alone;
Blindfold and deaf, in his realm the veriest slave,
Though the seat he fills is the rack men call a Throne,
And the Tzar is a stalwart Titan, strong and brave.
Strong-yet helpless as yon blain woman's hand;
Brave-but shaken through with a haunting Fear.
Of all his myrmidons' devilries done in the land
The last to hear!
Let it be known! Poor ZOTOFF's legacy wakes
A living echo in every ear humane.
E'en the Autocrat in his lonely splendoar quakes
At the vague vast sounds of menace no bonds restrain.
But there, in the heart of horrors, he sits and sighs,
Blindfold Injustice bound to a joyless throne;
Whilst far the voice of his fallen victim flies-

not unjust. Picked up small book, for which inquire at W. H.

weather, as being a weird, mystical legend, of a soothing and inte-
resting character, commencing a few years before "ADAM delved
and EVE span," and finishing in the time of steam yachts; so that
it is brought right up to date. It is full of incident and picturesque
description. I see Mr. FARJEON has been at it again with the

(By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)
EVERY jackass who ever was seen in the pig-skin
knows perfectly well, or ought to know, unless his brain
has gone barnacle-hunting in one of Mr. J.'s journalistic
bum-boats, that a race is to take place at Epsom in the
early part of next month. It has been customary to
speak of this race as the Derby, and to imagine that
the owner whose horse wins it gains possession of the
Blue ribbon of the turf. As if, forsooth, in a matter
like this, the colour mattered in the very least. But I
have a further objection to this hugger-mugger, three-
cornered, rag-and-bone, vermilion-faced, grog-blossomed,
hasb-headed fashion of describing things, and it is this.
If a two-year-old, provided with one of Mrs. PARTING-

Course by fourteen shoe-nails in a hundred, how in the
name of all that is lop-sided can a three-masted frigate
in full sail keep up with a Chinese Junk on Southampton

venomous imbecility of the vermin who infest the turf,
I think it will be a long time before I get one.
Crimson Jack is a good horseno thanks to the
puddling and pilfering slop-shop proprietors who manage
him. When he used to draw a dust-cart in Grosvenor

dling bell, and now knows when luncheon time has
arrived. A year ago, I wouldn't have given a copper

Now I believe him to be worth even more than the £10
given for him by the Ropes Contingent. But I have

IN THE KNOW.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)
I AM told that many of the
millions who have read with de-
light the brilliant sporting articles
that have appeared from my pen
week after week expect me to utter
a few words of seasonable advice
as to the chances of the various
animals engaged in the Derby and
the Oaks. "If I were one of the
chowder-headed numskulls who
cackle for hire, the task would
doubtless be an easy one. Mr. J.
has performed it yearly with that
magnificent want of success which
attends all his addle-pated efforts.
But, praise be to Heaven! I am
not Mr. J., or one of his crew. I
am only a humble writer, distin-
guished alike for his unerring
sagacity, his undeviating accu-
racy, and his incisive force of ex-
pression. My task is, therefore,
stupendous, but I will perform it.
THE DERBY.
There are many horses in for the
Derby. Some people fancy Sure-
foot. Fancies are not, of course,
facts, but the name is good. Keep
your eye on the black and cerise
of LIDDIARD. Sainfoin is not
generally supposed to cover grass,
but there are generally exceptions.
I have not heard the angels calling
Le Nord lately, but they may
begin at any time. A man may
get home, so may a horse, and I am
bound to say that if I were The
Beggar I should give the lie to the
crack-brained puddling proverb,
and be a chooser of first place.
| Bel Demonio should be all there
when the first part of his name
rings, so that he may go like the
second, if he wants to be one, two,
or three. Rathbeal rhymes to heel.
Has he got a clean pair to show ?
Orwell should score well; and you
must never tie your Garter too
tightly, unless you want to stop
your ciroulation. Golden Gate is
not always as open as might be
wished ; and The Imp is some-
times a hindrance. Good old Polo-
nius! As for Kirkham, Alloway,
Martagon, and Loup, all I can say
is, Mum's the word. How about

made there. Somuoh for the Derby.

The Marsh King's Daughter. One of WARNE & Co.'s
publications for children's amusement, but the illustra-
tions by JESSIE CURRIE are too highly curried, or rather
coloured, and the effect is hard and theatrical. By the
way, Miss CURRIE's genius is a triflo wilful; for example,
take this situation, which she has chosen to Wustrate, -
-“She ..... pointed to a horse. He mounted upon
it, and she sprang before him, and held tightly by the
mane." Now, asks the Baron, taking for granted the
“sprang" is for “sprang up,” how would ordinary talent
depict this scene? Why, certainly, by showing the girl
mounted on the horse, holding on by the mano in front
of the man, and the man up behind. Not so Miss CURRIE.
She puts the good man-apparently an Amateur Monk
-astride the horse, and she riding behind, holding lightly
as it appears, with one hand the broad red orupper, and,
with the other, probably, some portion of the Amateur
Monk's dressing-gown. But genius must not be fettered.

ance of the quaint old woodcuts-some of which, how-
ever, the Baron is of opinion, never belonged to the original

would venture to observe that, in his opinion, the revi-
vification is an excellent idea rather thrown away.
Whether it would have been better for more or less
Boyleing, ho is not absolutely certain, but perbaps the
notion required a somewhat different treatment. The
best of the fables is The Sly Stag, which, according to
the woodcut, ought to have been a goat. But there may
be some subtle humour in the frequent incongruity
between a fable and its pictorial illustration.

“THREE FISHERS.”
THREE fishers went fishing North-east and North-West
(Like the trio from Kingsley familiarly known).
Each thought himself, doubtless, the bravest and best,
And held the good "swims" should be mainly his own.
There was JOHNNY the Briton, and FRANÇOIS the Frank,
And JONATHAN also, the artful young Yank,
An expert at “ bouncing" and "boning."
And François the Frank, who went fishing for cod,
Nicked lobsters as well, and he stuck to them too;
He declared they were all the same thing, which seemod odd,
The result being anger and hullaballoo,
And rows about Bounties, and shines about Bait;
For ructions all round are as certain as fate,
When parties go “bouncing” and “boning."
And JONATHAN, well, he went fishing for seals,
And he wanted the fishing grounds all to himself.
When the Russ had done ditto, the Yank had raised squeals
(How consistency's floored in the struggle for pelf !)
And JONATHAN took a most high-handed course;
For greediness mostly falls back on brute force,
When parties go“ bouncing” and “boning."
And JOHNNY the Briton, a sturdy old salt,
Had been a sea-grabber himself in his time;
Some held that monopoly still was his fault,
Others swore that his modesty verged upon crime.
Nor is it quite easy to say which was true,
For so much depends on a man's point of view,
When parties go “ bouncing" and "boning."
But when JOHNNY the Briton caught sight of the Frank
Making tracks with a lobster—the whoppingest one-
And when he perceived the impertinent Yank
With the seal-such a spanker !-skedaddling like fun,
He stood and he shouted, " Stop thief! Hi! Hold hard !”
For language does not always " go by the card,”.
When parties go “ bouncing” and “boning."

A HARMLESS GHOST.
[A Gentleman advertises for an old house, and says, "Harmless
Ghost not objected to.”]
A Spectre speaks :-
TFLL us, good Sir, what is a Harmless Ghost ?
One who walks quietly at dead of night,
For just a single hour or so at most,
And never gives folks what is termed a fright?
Is it a Ghost that never clanks his chains,
That never gibbers, and that bangs no door:
But quietly and peact fully remains
In calm posesssion of some upper floor?
A Harmless Ghost is not a Ghost at all,
Unworthy of the name; no Headless Man,
Or other spectre that could men appal,
Would condescend to live 'neath such a ban.
No phantom with a grain of self-respect
Would make a promise never to do harm.
Find your old house, but please to recollect,
A Ghost who knows his business must alarm.

With reference to the several cases of “Masque-

columns of a contemporary, I wish to add a remarkable

Following the brilliant success of Miss FAWCETT at Cambridge, Mlle.
BELCESCO, à Roumanian lady, took her degree to-day as Docteur en Droit.

trees in the Park and arranging them in the inverse ratio of their
distances at rectangular intervals from the common centre of their

equal to exactly five hundred times the cubic capacity of a goose-

Miss ROBINSON, Mrs. TOUCHE-ARMING, and Lady CORDELIA CROSS-

The wonderful tameness and docility of the three African lions
now going through their daily performance at the French Exhibition
at Earl's Court, have astonished no less than pleased all who have
witnessed them, but it is not generally known, that their obedient
condition is due to their diet. This has for some time consisted of
a well-known infant's and invalid's food, washed down with copious
draughts of a widely advertised patent medicine that claims to act

utter prostration of spirit which enables their talented trainer,

[Miss HARKER took service as a day governess in a family at Stockton, at
a salary of 258. a month, coupled with the privilege of dining in the house.
She found herself under the necessity of taking a lodging, the rent for which
more than absorbed her modest stipend. She taught three children English
and musio. Afterwards a couple of infants were placed in her charge. Nor
was this all, for when the servants left, the new governess had “to cook the
dinner, wash the dishes, and clean the knives." After this she asked for a
holiday, the result being that “she was shown the door." Thereupon she
brought an action in the County Court for a month's salary in lieu of notice.

DIANA AT DINNER.
[On the first page of the prospectus of the recently-established
“ Dorothy " Restaurant it is stated that it is for “ Ladies only.”
On the last page will be found the following modification :- At
the request of many of the Lady customers, it has been decided
to open the Restaurant from 6:30 P.M. to 10 P.M. to both Ladies
and Gentlemen."]
THERE was started in London, I mustn't say where,
And, beyond saying lately, I mustn't say when,
A sweet Restaurant, where the sex that is fair

Lest you meet with the fate of Acteon, and die."
Thus the Ladies addressed us; the tables were set,
The silver was polished, the viands displayed.
And, like doves in a dove-cote, the customers met,
In a plumage of silks and of muslins arrayed.
“This is sweet !” said AMANDA. “Delightful!” said
JANE.
While the rest in a chorus of “Charming!" combined.
And, declaring they cared not if dishes were plain,
So the men remained absent, they solemnly dined.
And they toyed with their entrées, and sipped their Clicquot,
