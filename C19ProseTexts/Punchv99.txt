December 27, 1890-1 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. "i

SCENE— Early morn, in the neighhourhtod of the Saronie Gulf. A mirhle Temple, olive-shadowed, and overlooking the tea,
Hti.eia discovered discoursing xci'h her venerable Sire. To them enter Mr. Pukch, accompanied by "a burly man of middle
height, with a countenance remark ib!e from its depth of expression and strength of contour."
Mr. Punch. Greetings, Hygeia !" I hope I don't intrude " (as Paulas Speculator would say) upon the musiugs
of the ancient Sire of Medicine and his daughter, well-beloved of modern man.
Hygeia (affably). Mr. Punch could never be an intruder anywhere.
Mr. Punch. You do me proud, Hygeia. Pray grant me the additional favour of introducing me to your father.
JEsculapius. Mr. Punch requires no introduction. Moreover, though that satirical dog, Lucian, represents me as
wrangling with Hercules about precedence, " in a manner unseemly, and quite strange to the banquets of the Gods," yet
indeed I am too little of a parvenu to be proud, or of a quack to be quarrelsome.
Mr. Punch. Only what was to be expected of " the blameless physician" of Epidaurus. I wish that some of your
later followers, British and Teuton, would take example from their great prototype. Then we should be spared some
unseemly professional squabbles, and much peevishly polemical pamphleteering.
JEscuUipitis. Who, Mr. Punch, is your companion? I perceive by his manner that he warmly echoes your wish.
Mr, Punch. Like Hermes of old, I am privileged to act as ambassador and intermediary between the Immortals and
mankind. This is Dr. Robert Koch, the great German bacteriologist, and dauntless foe of the deadly Bacillus.
JEsculapius. "Whom not to know argues oneself unknown." By the beard of Jove, that thrasonic " strong man,"
Hkbccles (albeit he called me "paltry herb-doctor and mountebank "), with all his heroic exploits against huge Hydras and
swarming Stymphaliau Birds, performed tasks not more arduous, and iufinitely less useful, than he whose life-long battle has
been against the microscopic scourges of mankind.
Dr. Koch. But my battle is not yet won, JEscui.apius. I am sorry that some of my over-eager disciples fail to dis-
tinguish between sounding the charge and blowing the trumpet of final victory.
Mr. Punch. Bravo, Modesty! Sensationalism in Science, particularly in Medical Scicnco, is singularly detestable.
So many ccckadoodlcdoo
Too soon, Fame's temple plotting in 1
You 're modest, Kocu, my learned Teu-
-ton, m when studying at the U-
-niversity of Guttingen!
Dr. Koch. 1 trust so. But, Sir, it is not in Berlin or in London as it was in old Epidaurus. A modern Prometheus,
even, would have his beneficent lire puffed into premature uotoriety by the accursed, ubiquitous, indiscreet, ilatulent, swag-
gering, sensation-mongering spirit of Advertisement, almost before he had time to appraise or to apply it. My friend Pasteur
and myself should not be held responsible for the unmeasured pretensions of our hasty exploiters.

»» PUNCH, OH THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [December 27, 1890.
Hygeia. All civilised mankind are now worshippers at my modernised shrine; but, uuhappily, like the devotees of
other altars, they are sometimes a little too corybantic in their cultus.
Mr. Punch. Most true, Htceia !—
To dedicate to thee, benignant Nymph,
Our Teuton's magic febnfacient lymph,
Unheralded by blatant, noutlett noise,
Were first of duties, genuinest of joys.
But, .^sculapius mine, I greatly fear
The modern advertising Chanticleer,—
A strutting fowl, cacophonous, absurd,—
Is not the clarion-voiced dawn-hailing bird
Sacred to thee, which Socbatis the wise
Chose as bis mortuary sacrifice.
Nay, rather 'tis that gallinaceous pest,
Whose noise deprives a weary world of rest.
Heavens! how the wise abhor the blatant crew,
Whose life is one long Cook-a-doodle-do!
But here, ./EscuLAFirs, we are far from the shindy of Sensationalism; here, Hyueia, the dawn creeps upon us over yon
shadowy hills without the devil's tattoo of puffing quackdom; here, Dr. Koch, all is as calm and thought-aiding as those
lonely Klausthal Mountains where you first meditated war upon the Bacillus.
JEsculapius. Here is wine of a vintage that Clubdom could not match, and that Sir Wilfrid the Water-worshipper
could hardly demur to. Let us drink the health and the ultimate triumph of the illustrious Bacillicide!
Mr. Punch. With all my heart—though 'tis early for so potent a potation.
In cpite of the quackish and quizzical,
May Keen's magic lymph anti-phthisical
Effect a safe cure,
As lasting as sure,
O'er the saddest of maladies physical! [They drink.
J5$culapiu8. Hark! my bird in jubilant strains greets the dawn. May it mean the dawn of Health to the
disease-harassed world of men whom I loved, and suffered from angry Jove for aiding. Your devoted dog barketh briskly,
Mr. Punch.
Mr. Punch. As though ho beheld the angry spectres or spooks of the malignant Microbes driven forth with the
vanishing darkness. Toby's Master is also, in his way, a slayer of Microbes, the parasitic mental pests, the soul-corrupting
Bacilli of palsying Humbug, and feverish Folly, and cancerous Cant. Foes, Doctor, as multitudinous as ubiquitous, and as
difficult of extirpation as any of the physical disease-germs that we are all hoping your long-sought lymph will finally defeat.
As you labcur in your Hygienic Museum in Kloster Strasse, so do I in my Sanctum in Fleet Street, in the interests of
disordered Mankind. Would you study my doctrine, and learn my infallible specifics 1 Then read this!
And Mr. Pukoh politely presented to 2Esculapius his

VOCES POPULI.
AT THE MILITARY EXHIBITION.
In the Avenue facing the Arena.
An Unreasonable Old Lady (arriving breathless, with her grand-
ton and niece). This'11 be the place the balloon goes up from, I
wouldn't miss it for anything! Fat
,7^ the ohild up on that bench, Maria;
- '' we '11 stand about here till it begins.
Maria. But I don't see no balloon
nor nothing.
[ Which, as the foliage blocks out
all but the immediate fore-
ground, is scarcely surprising.
The U. O. L. No more don't I—
but it Btanda to reason there wouldn't
be so many lookingon if there wasn't
something to see. We 're well enough
where we are, and I'm not going further to fare worse to please
nobody; so you may do as you like about it.
[Maria promptly avails herself of this permission.
The U.O.L. (a little later). Well, it's time they did something,
I m Bure. Why tho people seem all moving on! and where's
that girl Maria got to P Ah, here you are! So you found you
were no better off f—Next time, p'raps, you '11 believe what I tell you.
Not that there's any War Balloon as i" can see 1
Maria. Oh, there was a capital view from where I was—out in
the open there.
The IT. O. L. Why couldn't you say so before P Out in the
open! Let's go there then—it's all the same to me!
Maria {with an undutiful giggle). It's all the same now—wherever
you go, 'cause the balloon's gone up.
The U. O. L. Gone up! What are you telling me, Maria?
Maria. I see it go—it shot up ever so fast and quite steady, and
the people in the car all waved their 'ats to us. I could see a arm
a wavinsr almost till it got out of sight.
The U. O. L. And me and this inneroent waiting here on the
seat like lambs, and never dreaming what was goin' on! Oh, Maria,
however you '11 reconcile it to your conscience, /don't know!
Maria. Why. whatever are you pitching into me for!
The V. O. L. It's not that it s any partiokler pleasure to me,
seeing a balloon, though we did get our tea done early to be in
time for it—it's the sly deoeitfulness of your conduck, Maria,
which is all the satisfaction I get for coming out with you,—it's
the feeling that—well, there, I won't talk about it 1
[In pursuance of which virtuous resolve, she talks about nothing
else for the remainder of the day, until the unfortunate
Maria wishes fervently that balloons had never been invented.
In the Building.
An admiring group has collected before an enormous pin-cushion in
the form of a fat star, and about the size of a Church-hassock.
First Soldier {to his Companion) Lot o' work in that, yer know!
Second Soldier. Yob. {Thoughtfully.) Not but what—(becoming
critical)—if I 'd been doin' it myself, I should ha' chose pins with
smaller 'eds on 'em.
First S. (regarding this as presumptuous). You may depend on it
the man wno made that 'ad his reasons for choosing the pins he
did—but there's no pleasing some parties 1
Second S. (apologetically). Well, I ain't denying the Art in it, am I?
First Woman. I do call that 'andsome, Sarah. See, there's a
star, and two 'arps, and a crownd, and I don't know what all—
and all done in pins and beads! "Made by Bandsman Brown,"
too! {Reading placard.
Second W. Soldiers is that clever with their 'anas. Four pounds
seems a deal to ask for it, though.
First W. But look at the weeks it must ha' took him to dol
(Reading.) "Containing between ten and eleven thousand pins
and beads, and a hundred and ninety-eight pieces of coloured
cloth!" Why, the pins alone must ha' cost a deal of money.
Second W. Yes, it 'ud be a pity for it to go to somebody as 'ud
want to take 'em out.
First W. It ought to be bought up by Gover'ment, that it ought—
they 're well able to afford it.
A select party of Philistines,' comprising a young Man, apparently
in the Army, and his Mother and Sister, are examining Mr.
Gilbert's Jubilee Trophy in'a spirit of puzzled antipathy.
The Mother. Dear me, and that's the Jubilee centrepiece, is it?
What a heavy-looking thing. I wonder what that cost?
Her Son (gloomily). Cost? Why, about two days' pay for every
man in the Servioe 1
His Mother. Well, I call it a shame for the Army to be fleeced
tot that thing. Are those oreatures intended for mermaids, with
their tails curled round that glass ball, I wonder P [She sniffs.
Her Daughter. I expect it will be crystal, Mother.
Her Mother. Very likely, my dear, but—glass or crystal—7 see
no sense in it I
Daughter. Oh, it's absurd, of course—still, this figure isn't badly
done, is it supposed to represent St. George oarrying the Dragon P
Because they ve made the Dragon no bigger than a salmon!
Mother. Ah, well, I hope Her Majesty will be better pleased
with it than I am, that's all.
[After which they fall into ecstasies over an industrial exhibit,
consisting of a drain-pipe, cunningly encrusted with frag-
ments of regimental mess-china set in gilded cement.
Before a large mechanical clock, representing a fortress, which is
striking. Trumpets sound, detachments of wooden soldiers march
in and out of gateways, and parade the battlements, clicking,
for a considerable time.
A Spectator (with a keen sense of the fitness of things). What—all
that for on'y 'alf-past five!
Overheard in the Ambulance Department.
Spectators (passing in front of groups of models arranged in rea-
listic surroundings). All the faces screwed up to suffering, you see!
. .. What a nice patient expression that officer on the stretcher has!
Yes, they've given him a wax head—some of them are only papier
machi.... Fity they couldn't get nearer their right sizo in 'elmets,

dear; it may be a peculiar breed out there—cross between^, towel-
horse and a donkey-engine, don't you know 1
In the Indian Jungle Shooting-gallery.
At the back, amidst tropical scenery, an endless procession of
remarkably undeceptive rabbits of painted tin are running
rapidly up and down an inclined plane. Birds jerk painfully
through the air above, and tin rats, boars, tigers, lions, and ducks,
all of the same size, glide swiftly along grooves in the middle
distance. In front, Commissionnaires are busy loading rifles for
keen sportsmen, who keep up a lively but somewhat ineffective
fusillade,
'Arriet (to 'Arry). They 'ave got it up beautiful, I must say. Do
you get anything for 'itting them?

A Father (to intelligent Small Boy, in rear of Nervous Sports-

That's a rabbit he's aiming at now. . . . Ah, missed him!
Small Boy. 'Ow d'yer know what the gentleman's a-aiming at,

Small Boy. I sor that time, Father. He was a-aiming at one o'

Enter a small party of 'Arries in high spirits.

companions nave decorated his coat-collar behind with a long
piece of white paper.

A Song for the Seat op Judgment. Ant—" The British Grenadier."

With blatant brazen brayings, and thump of tambourine.

In rural nooks their shoutings are on the summer air;
Though sea-side peace be pleasant, its spell may not resist

0 Holy Noise! 0 latest and greatest of man's gods!
With common-sense at issue, with comfort at fierce odds;

WEEK BY "WEEK.
The Season has now only some three weeks to run. Already
careful dowagers are having themselves packed in chintz or old
newspapers, and fathers of feminine families are beginning to emerge
from the lurking places in which they had sought refuge with their
oheque-books. The number of detrimentals has been calculated to
amount to three times the number of first editions of the Star news-
paper, plus a mean fraction of a child's Banbury cake, multiplied by
the nod of a Duchess to a leader of Society in Peckham Rye.
From the Canton of Koblinsky a report reaches us that the Deputy
Grand Master of the Koblinsky Einspiinner has met with a some-
what alarming accident. As he was going his rounds last week,
accompanied by his faithful Pudelhund, he observed a mark lying on
the pavement. On stooping to pick it up, he was unfortunately mis-
taken for a Bath bun by his canine companion, and before help
could be secured he had been partly devoured. However, all that
was left of him has been packed in ice, and forwarded, with the
compliments of the Municipality, to the Ejipeeor.
The Great-Western Railway Company intend, it is said, to make
unparalleled efforts to secure the comfort of those who may visit
Henley Regatta during the present week. All the ordinary trains
have been taken off, and special trains, timed to take at least half-
an-hour longer, have been substituted for them. As a special
concession, holders of first-class return tickets will be allowed to
travel part of the distance by omnibus. At Twyford Junction the
amusing game of follow-my-leader will be rdayed by four locomotives
and a guard's van. The winning locomotive will then steam on to
Henley, and.upon its return passengers will proceed as usual.
Yesterday being the opening day of the Regatta, was observed as
a holiday by the natives of Henley. The ancient ceremonial of
"Prices up and money down," was, as usual, observed with proper
solemnity by all the burgesses of the little Oxfordshire town. There
was some boat-racing during the day; but it is beginning to be felt
that a Btop should be put to this barbarous survival of the dark ages.

MODERN TYPES.
[By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.)
No. XV.—THE JACK OF ALL JOURNALISMS.
In order to become a successful Journalist of a certain sort, it is
only necessary that a man should in early life provide himself with
a front as brazen as the trumpet which he blows to announce to
the world his merits and his triumphs. It is, of course, essential
that he should rid himself of any trace of sensitiveness that may
remain to him after a youth about which the only thin.? certain is
its complete obscurity, in order that no hint may he sufficiently broad
to fit in with the tolerant breadth of his impudence, and no affront
sufficiently pointed to pieroe the skin with which Nature and his own
industry nave furnished him. Literary culture must be eschewed,
for with literary culture come taste and discrimination—qualities
whioh might fatally obstruct the path of this journalistic aspirant.
For it must be assumed that in some of its later developments
journalism has entirely oast off the reticence and the modesty which
successive generations of censors have constantly held to have been
characteristic of an age that is past. Indeed, while it is established
that in 1850 the critics of the day fixed their thoughts with pleasure
on the early years of the century, though they found nothing but
abuse for the journalism of their own time, it is curious to note that
many of those who hurl the shafts of ridicule and contempt at the
present period have only words of praise for
1850. Without, however, going so far as
these stern descendants of Cato, it may be
affirmed that the porpoise-hided Jack of all
Journalisms, as we know him, never had a
greater power, nor exercised it over a larger
scope with smaller scruple than to-day.
It has been already said that the youth of
the Jack of all Journalisms is lost in obscurity.
It is obvious that he cannot have acquired his
readiness of pen without much practice, but
where the practice was obtained is a puzzle to
whioh each of his enemies has a different key.
Some say of him that he spent a year or two
at a University, where he was noted for the
unfailing regularity with whioh he sought the
society of the wealthy, imbibed strong drinks,
and omitted to pay his debts. It is also
alleged that he started a colourable University
imitation of the journal whioh happened at
that particular time to be the most highly
coloured in London, and that, after struggling
through two numbers of convulsive scurrility,
the infant effort withered under the frown of
the Authorities, who at the same time sent its
founder down. Others, however, declare him
to have been the offspring of a decayed purveyor of spurious racing
intelligence, who naturally sent his son to shift for himself after he
had lost his last shirt in betting against one of his own prophecies.
Others again aver, and probably with equal accuracy, that he was at
no time other than what he is when the world first becomes aware of
his existence—the blatant, cringing, insolent, able and disreputable
wielder of a pen which draws much of its sting and its profit from
the vanities and fears of his fellow-creatures. Be that as it may, he
somehow becomes a power. He attaches himself to many journals,
the editors of whioh he first pesters, afterwards serves, and always
despises. He may perhaps nave dabbled in music, and caused a
penniless friend who is musical to write for small pay songs whioh
he honours by attaching his own name to them as their composer.
Woe betide the unhappy aspirant to the honours of public singing
who ignores the demand of this quasi-musical Turpin that she
should sing his songs. For, having become in the meantime a
musical critic, he will devote all his talents to the congenial task of
abusing her voice in his organ—whioh is naturally the more powerful
instrument of the two. Should she, however, submit to his extor-
tionate requests, he will deem himself entitled to embitter the rest
of her existence with his patronising commendation.
However, before reaching this pitch, he will have made his mark
as an interviewer and a picturesque social reporter. In the former
capacity he will have hunted momentary celebrities into the sanctity
of their rooms, whence, after exchanging two words with them, he
will have emerged with two columns of conversation.' In the latter
capacity, he will create for himself and the readers of his paper a
social circle, the members of which, bear the same relation to Society
proper as a lurcher does to a pure-bred greyhound. For there are
many so-called social sets whioh are select merely because few desire
to enter and many to leave them, and to these the Jack of all Jour-
nalisms is often a prophet and a leader pointing the way to the
promised land. Thus we learn, with surprise, at first, and afterwards
with the yawn that comes of the constant repetition of an ascertained
fact, that the receptions of Lady Tiffin are a model of all that is
elegant and recherchi, whilst the dresses and jewels of Mrs. Jiffs are
always a subject of enthusiastic admiration to those amongst whom
she moves; and it is only in moments of peculiar moroseness that we
remember that neither of these two ladies is qualified by position or
refinement for anything more than a passing smile. Yet to many,
the mere fact that they are mentioned in paragraphs, is proof positive
of their descent from the Vere be Veres.
Moreover, the Jack of Journalisms will, at one time or another,
have risen from the position of one who chronicles second-rate shows
in remote corners of his paper, to be the recognised dramatic critic of
a powerful organ. He thus acquires an extraordinary influence
whioh he consolidates amongst outsiders by occasional lapses into a
fury of critical honesty and abuse. It may be said of him, indeed,
that, "Hell hath no fury like a critic scorned," for if he should, on
any occasion, have taken umbrage at the treatment accorded to him
by an actor or a manager, he will never allow the offence to fade, so
long as he can fashion insinuations, misconstrue motives, or manu-
facture failure with his pen.
In appearance the Jack of all Journalisms is not altogether pleasing.
His early struggles against irresponsive editors have left their mark
upon him, for having been compelled to seek consolation for disappoint-
ment by indulging in strong drinks, he never completely loses the
habit whioh tells, of course, both upon his dress and temper. Though
success, by bringing the pleasures of the table within his reach, has
increased the rotundity of his figure, it has never been able to make
his collars snowy or his conversation refined.
He is often found upon the Committees of new
Clubs whioh start with a blare of journalistic
trumpets upon a chequered existence, only to
perish in contempt a few years afterwards.
But while they last he attends them in the
hope of picking up a friend who may be valu-
able, or some gossip whioh he may turn to
account. As a rule, he affects the society of
those who are intellectually dull in order that
he may pass with them for a man of immense
culture and unfathomable sagacity. Over the
third long drink provided for him by an ad-
miring associate _ of this sort, he will grow
eloquent, and his conversation will sparkle
with reminiscences of leading articles he may
once have written, and anticipations of others
that he proposes to write. Those who hear
him on such occasions will opine that he is a
man of genius, who is only prevented by the
carelessness of a Gallio from becoming a states-
man of the first rank.
A little later he will rise still higher, and
will become the almost recognised medium
through which really fashionable intelligence
is converted into common knowledge. In this
position he will allow nothing to escape him, and if one of the highest
persons in the land should invite six friends to dinner, their names
will on the following morning be known to the Jack of all Journal-
isms. It is unnecessary to say that in the course of this oareer he
acquires, not only notoriety, but enemies, who watch eagerly for the
false step that shall bring him to the ground. In spite of his craft,
he is inevitably driven from boldness into rashness, and after waging
a fruitless war against rascals more accomplished than himself, he,
with a courage that scarcely atones for his imprudence, enters the
witness-box, and, a flood of light having been thrown upon his past
career, he finds himself for two nights blazoned in enormous letters
on the posters of the evening papers, and is compelled, in the end, to
submit to an adverse verdict, and to retire, "it may be far years or
it may be for ever," from the open practice of a profession in which
he had so distinguished himself.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Baron begs to acknowledge the receipt of a delightful book
entitled, Bordeaux et ses Vine (Cinquieme idition!) Classes par
Ordre de Merile, written by M. Edouard Ferret, and enricned
with 225 views of vine-oul

Chateaux, by M.
It is
taring
Eugene Vergez,
published by G. Masson,
Boulevard Saint Germain
120, and now the Baron has
placed it within reach of all
the world. This particular
volume was presented to
the Baron by Messrs. Han-
ket, Bannister & Co., who
succeeded to the business of
Tod Heatlet & Co. (why
was there never a Scotch
firm of Toddy Drinklby &
Co. ?) Judging from a few
casual dips into its contents,
it will evidently afford him
some interesting half-hours
with the best crus. The
connoisseur in claret should
go right through the book
until he comes to " Entre-
deux-mers," by whioh time
he will be as wise and as
ready as was Solomon,
entre deux meres, to pro-
nounce judgment. The
history of the Pape Clement
\ wine takes us back to 1305,
• and is correctly told; but
the Baron doubts whether
M. Ferret has ferreted out
Befreshment for the Baron. the real story of the Chateau
Haut-Brion. The fact is, that about the Twelfth Century, Seigneur
The Baron O'Brien from County Clare—which, as you see. only
requires a " t" to make " Clare" into " Claret "—became the happy
possessor of this elegant vine-growing district. The Baron O'Brien
having taken a great deal of trouble about the good of his
body, was one day struok by the remark, "in vino Veritas," and
thought he would do something for the good of his soul. So he
founded a Mission, La Mission O'Brien, and then died in the odour
of the most celebrated crus. On his tomb were the simple words,
"II crut." In the course of time, grass grew over the stone, the
Mission moved, sold the property, and another family of Irish
descent, O'Blivion, would have wiped out every memorial of the
original pious founder, had it not been for the peasantry, who had
Gallicised O'Brien into Haut Brion, under whioh name it has been
known for the last two centuries. If this is not the veracious history
of this celebrated wine, the Baron would like to know what is?
How sensible to give an order of merit to the best Claret-grower.
Two Barons of the House of Rothschild are thus distinguished. It
was after trying many other Clarets that Baron James turned to
Barons Alphonse Gustave and Edmond de Rothschild, and uttered
the memorable words, "Revenons a nos moutons." It is a fascinating
work, and the Baron has only just put down these few notes as an
instalment of a grand book on wines, wine -growers, and wine-drinkers
of all countries, which he is on the point of bringing out, entitled
Folks and Grapes.
The Baron likes persons who take a hint kindly and act on it
sensibly. He says this d propos of the Hairless Paper-pad Holder,
the bald idea of whioh was suggested in
Mr. Punch's pages. The paper-pad will be
found most useful to travelling writers who
use ink, and those authors whom gout, or
some other respectable ailment, compels to
work recumbently in bed or on sofa. The
writer in bed, with ink handy, has only to
take up his pad in one hand and his pen in
the other, and as sheet after sheet is covered
—sheets of paper bien entendu—he tears it
off, and dries it at once on the blotter, which
forms a portion of the pad. For Mr. Glad-
stone, when he is once again Prime Minister,
the Hairless Paper-pad will be invaluable, as he can place it com-
fortably on his knee, write his despatch to Her Majesty, and blot
it without distraction. As a writer of considerable practical experi-
ence, the Baron De Book-Worms strongly recommends the Hairless
Paper-pad, which he will leave as a Hairloom to his family.
The Baron wishes to say that he has received Dunlop's Calculating
Apparatus, and in attempting to discover how on earth to use it,

whether as a game, or a puzzle, or a ready-reckoner, the Baron's
hair is turning from grey to white. There are numbers, and sections,
and tons, and small figures and large figures, and slips, and strips,
and numbers in black ink, and others in red. ink, and though it must
of course be the very simplest and easiest thing in the world when
you once know all about it, yet it is just the sort of book (yet it isn't
exactly a book) that might nave deeply interested the Hatter and
the March Hare, and Lewis Carroll's Snark Hunters, and sug-
gested many deep questions to the inquiring mind of Alice in Won-
derland. As a really humorous production, capable of affording
amusement for many a weary hour, it may be safely recommended
to parties in country nouses during an exceptionally rainy season.
The Baron de Book-Worms.
P.S.—My faithful "Co." has been reading The Lazy Tour of Two
Idle Apprentices, No Thoroughfare.tcni The Perils of Certain Eng-
lish Prxsoners, the joint work of Charles Dickens and Wilkie
Collins, and now published for the first time in a single volume.
He says that the book is instructive, inasmuch as it shows the growth
of its authors' collaboration. When the writers started The Lazy
Tour they were, so to speak, like the gentleman seated one day at
the organ, "weary and ill at ease;" they grew more accustomed to
one another during The Perils, and attained perfection in No
Thoroughfare. This last novel shows no traces of dual workman-
ship, and might have been the outcome of a single pen. My "Co."
has out one fault to find with Messrs. Chapman and Hall (Limited)
—he says that the stories deserved better illustrations.
A VALID EXCUSE.
[A Juror who failed to put in an attendance at the Old Bailey sent an excuse
that he was away on his honeymoon. The Lord Mayok declared this was
a perfectly valid excuse.]
The sly Undergraduate, eager to be
Of Tutors and Deans an acute circumventist.
Has been known to declare, when he went on the spree,
'Twas to bury his uncle, or call on his dentist.
The husband who's ever in scrapes or in pickles,
And in coming home early displays a remissness,
Is wont, if it's safe to believe Harry Nicholls,
To say he stayed out on "a matter of business."
The hero whose praises they constantly sound,
A Triton 'mongst minnows in prowess at cricket,
When bowled by a ball that did not touch the ground,
Very frequently swears 'twas the state of the wicket I
And the Juryman, finding excuses wore vain,
Of the Judge's displeasure has ever been fearful,
Since he knew it availed not a whit to complain—
He must be in his place, or pay up and look cheerful.
But the thought of a fine never more will produce
Consternation, nor ever again make him pallid.
In a Honeymoon now he has got an excuse,
And the Lord Mayor pronounces it " perfeotly valid" 1

TOUCHING RECIPROCITY BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE.

"HOPE DEFERRED."
"Wkahy of watching and waiting!"
So the old song-words go I
Charity here, contemplating
This trio of lads in a row,
Might turn from the slums of the City,
From "Nobody's Children" might spare
One glance of true practical pity,
One hour of considerate care.
The waifs from the slum and the gutter
Are off "to the country " in troops,
To feed on new eggs and fresh butter,
To frolic with balls and with hoops;
These three, with their eyes on the potter
That hints unattainable joys,
Must envy the son of the Coster,
The waifs of the Workhouse. Poor boys!
They, too, are unitedly yearning
To "go to the country," together.
Hope on the horizon is burning
With prospect of promising weather.
One pities them, looking and longing,
Aweary of waiting their turn
With those who are country wards thronging;
The "Voioe of the Country" they'd learn.
The lay of the lark or the linnet?
The babble of brooklet or rill?
Nay, that " Voioe," to their ears, hath more
in it
Than sounds in the nightingale's trill.
There's a song, though to some it sounds
raucous,
For them most seductively rolls;
'Tis the crow of a bird (the " Caw-Caw-Cus ")
Whose song is so like " Pretty Poll's"!
HENLEY REGATTA.
(By Mr. Punch's own Bowing Man.)
Henley, Monday.
I hate arrived, and Henley once more is
Henley. Even the weather has recognised
me, and good old Plu himself came out to
shake me by the hand and talk of old times.
The course is of the usual length, but a slight
alteration has been made in the breadth.
Many house-boats are moored along the Ox-
fordshire bank. The bridge has not changed
its position since I saw it last. The courteous
Secretary of the Regatta assured me, that
my complaint with reference to the impedi-
ment which this Btruoture offers to rowing-
boats had been laid before the Stewards. No
action, however, is to be taken this year.
This being the day before the Regatta, very
heavy work was done by all the crews engaged
in the race for the Grand Challenge Cup.
They all have a good chance, and, personally,
1 should not feel the least surprise if I saw
at least two eights rowing in trie final heat
on Thursday. Thames, London, Brasenose,
Kingston, New College, and Trinity Hall all
possess some " sterling oarsmen," and carry
banners" of different colours. I may re-
mark, in passing, that no crew is allowed to
row with more than eight oars.
The race for the Stewards will be exciting.
All these officials are in hard training, but
the Mayor of Henley is favourite at short
odds.*
• Note by the Editor.—hie you sure this is
right?
Reply.—R:ght? Of course It is. I'm here, and
I ought to know.
I notice that the Ladies have a race all to
themselves. Doubtless this is due to Miss
Fawcett's pernicious example, but the inno-
vation is not to be commended. The entries
for the Visitors are of average quality. Three
visitors only are to compete over a course of
picnic luncheons and strawberries and cream.
I have only room left to remark that the
weather has been changeable, and that all the
above tips are to be thoroughly relied upon.

EVOLUTIONARY ASSIMILATION.
A Story of Signer Piatti and his 'Cello.
SUNDAY AT HOME.
The stillness of the Summer day
Broods o'er the country sweet,.
And all thines, save the murmuring: stream,
Are silent in the heat.
The sunbeams through the green leaves
play,
The air is sweet with new-mown hay—
But I am bound at home to stay
Here in Great Gasworks Street.
On the fourth-floor I take the air,
And hear the trains roll by.
And dream of all the visions fair
That o'er the housetops lie;
The meadows where the daisies stray,
The bleating sheep, as white as they,
The breakers and the sparkling spray,
Beneath the smokeless sky.
There's Minn if. in the cradle,
And Tommy on the floor,
And Johnny with a ladle
Is banging on the door:
And, where the household linen dries,
Cross little Ann if. sits and cries
As loud as she can roar.
About the street the children sprawl,
Or on the door-steps sit;
The women, gay with kerchief-shawl,
Engage the men with wit,
Who lounge at ease against the wall,
And meditate and spit.
So through the Summer Sunday hours
The sunbeams slowly steal,
Gilding the beer-shop's saw-dust bowers,
The cabbage-stalks in lieu of flowers,
The trodden orange-peel,
Till, calm as heaven, the moon appears,
A Sister in a house of tears,
Who soothes, but cannot heal.
And now the cheap excursionitts
Come, tired and happy, home,
And hear amid the noisy streets
The churning of the foam.
They've seen the surges rolling in
With slow, reluctant roar,
Or shouted to the ceaseless din
Along the rocky shore;
And others in the woodland way,
Or on the breezy down,
Have gone excureioning astray,
While I have stayed in Town.
And wished that I was dead ana bu-ri-etf,
For all my Sunday gown.
And little Bobby's hair is curled
By oountry breezes sweet;
And Lizzie's heart is full of light,
Though heavy are her feet.
Father and mother face their plight
More hopeful for the treat,
And bless the God who made a world
Beyond Great Gasworks Street.
Where and How to Spend a Happy Day,
Weather Permitting, of Course.—Go to

House, drive back

ding crowd — to
Dartford, where
dine at the ancient
hostelrie called
"The BulL" Re-
oommended by the
Punch faculty, the Bull and no mistake.
Then up to London, still by road,—if a fine
moonlight night, delightful,—and remember
the summer day so well spent as "a Knole

TOO CLEVER BY HALE.
(Being Questions and Answers Cut on the Straight.)
Question. So you have finished your educa-
tion?
Answer. Yes, thanks to the liberality of
the School Board.
Q. Do you know more than your parents?
A. Certainly, as my father was a sweep,
and my mother a charwoman.
Q. Would either occupation suit you?
A. Certainly not; my aspirations soar
above such pursuits, and my health, impaired
by excessive study, unfits me for a fife .of
manual labour.
Q. Kindly tell me what occupation would
suit you?
A. I think I could, with a little cram-
ming, pass the examinations for the Army,
the Navy, or the Bar.
Q. Then why not become an officer in either
branch of the United Service, or a Member of
one of the Inns of Court?
A. Because I fear that as a man of neither
birth nor breeding, I should be regarded with
contempt in either the Camp or the Forum.
Q. Would you take a clerkship in the City?
A. Not willingly, as I have enjoyed some-
thing better than a commercial education,
besides City clerkships are not to be had for
the asking.
Q. Well, would you become a shop-boy or
a counter-jumper P
A. Certainly not; I should deem it a sin to
waste my accomplishments (which are many)
in filling a situation suggestive of the servants'
hall, rather than of the library.
Q. Well then, how are you to make an
honest livelihood P
_ A. Those who are responsible for my educa-
tion must answer that question.
Q. And if they can't P
A. Then I must accept an alternative, and
seek inspiration and precedents from the
records of success in another walk of life,
beginning with the pages of the Newgate
Calendar!

Capital entertainment the German Reeds have just
now. Mr. Alfred Reed immensely funny in Carnival
Time, written by Malcolm Watson and Corny Grain.
You should have heard Miss Nellie Farren's hearty
laughter at the drolleries in St. George's Hall last Thurs-
day afternoon. Nelly Farren's as good an audience as
she is a comic actress, and that's saying a good deal. Miss
Fanny Holland and Miss Kate Tully excellent. Then,
after the Carnival, Corny Grain's Society Peepshow for
1890 sent everybody into fits. That austere Indian Judge,
Mr. Justice Straight, was straight no longer, but bent
double by convulsions of laughter. Mr. Corny Grain
deals out pleasantly some hard bits all round, but as
everyone applies them to his or her neighbour, everyone
naturally enjoys the joke immensely. We used the word
"drolleries" just now. Happy Thought; As we have

We have been sitting here for an hour, and nothing has been said
upon the important subject we proposed to discuss.
E. {tapping him lightly on the cheek). Tut, tut, my dear boy, you
must not be petulant. And yet, when I come to study you more
closely, your face looks charming when you make a moue. Let me
eea you do it again. Ah, yes. You look into my eyes with the
divine sullenness that broods tragically upon the pale brow of the
Antinous. And through your mind, though you know it not (how
indeed should you ?), march many mystical phantoms that are not of
this base world. Pale Helen steps out upon the battlements and
turns to Flaubert her appealing glance, and Cellini paces with
Madame de Sevigne through the eternal shadows of unrevealed
realism. And Browning, and Homer, and Meredith, and Oscar
Wilde are with them, the fleet-footed giants of perennial youth,
like unto the white-limbed Hermes, whom Polyxena once saw, and
straight she hied her away to the vine-clad banks of Uyssus, where
Mr. Pater stands contemplative, like some mad scarlet thing by
Dvorak, and together they mirjh with the perfect significance of
silence through realms that are cloud-capped with the bright dark-
ness that shines from the poet's throne amid the stars.
[Stops, and lights a cigarette.
G. Oh, beautiful, beautiful! Now indeed I recognise my Erbert's
voice; and that is—yes, it must be—the scent of the cigarettes you
lately imported. Grant me one, only one. (Takes one and lights it.)
Bnt what were you talking about?
E. (pinches his cheek). There you are horrid again. But you
smile. Je te connais, mon brave. ri^Foxrira; <r« veu (never mind the
accents). Ich kenne dich, mein alter. Cognosco te, amice. I know
you, old fellow. You are only chaffing. As if you had not dis-
covered that whioh all truly great indolence has taught ever since
the first star looked out and beheld chaotic vastness on every hand.
For to say something is what every puny whipster can do. To talk
much, and in many languages, and yet to have said nothing, that,
my dear Gillie, is what all have striven for, but only one, gifted
above his fellows with magic power of weaving the gossamer thread
of words, has truly attained. For it is in that reconcilement of
apparent opposites, and in the cadenced measures of a musical voice,
that the dignified traditions of an aesthetic purity, repellent to the
thin, colourless lips of impotence, reside and make their home.
But [Breaks off, and lights a cigarette.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FEOM TEE DIABY OF TOBY, M.P.
Some of Commons, Monday, June 30.—Wanting to know about
Heligoland in the Lords. Baserert inquires especially how popu-
lation like the change P
"Oh. that's all right," said the Mabkiss; "if there's one thing
the Heligolanders have been pining for since date of their birth,
it is for union with Germany. If we'd only been generous, we
ought to have gratified their desire long ago. I don't wish to touch
on controversial matters, but I must
say if the Government, of which my
noble friend was an ornament, had,
when in office, only ceded Heligoland
to Germany, they would have deserved
well of their country, and might have
been assured of the enthusiastic sup-
port of noble Lords on this side of the
House, and of the Party of which my
nephew is a Leader in another place.
It is impossible for me, without making
your Lordships late for dinner, a crime
from which I trust to hold my conscience
free, fully to set forth the universal
advantage that arises from this stroke
of policy. It pleases everybody, espe-
cially the Heligolanders."
aosebert persistent; wants to know
what means were taken to obtain the
opinion of the population, and elicit
this rxan of joy?
"Oh!" said the Mabkiss, "ob-
viously, they are documents of a con-
fidential nature."
'' Confidential with the population ?''
asks Granville, in softest tones, with
bewitching smile, and most deferential
manner. For once the Makkiss has
no retort ready. Lords sit silent for
moment, awaiting answer; none forth-
coming; Lord Chancellor, with great
of mind, proposes "that this House do now adjourn."

laboriously and conscientiously ascertaining their views,
ual and aggregate, on question of transfer.
"The Markie8 is quite right," said Ashbourne, looking in from
his honourable exile in Dublin; "you can't, I know, frame an
indictment against a nation. But you can certainly enter into con-
fidential communication with a population. Capital oopyhead it
would make for Old Morality: Confidential Communication!
Corrupt Good Seligolanderi."
Bmineti done.—In the Commons, spurt to start with; four Bills
advanced a stage; then House floundered in Western Australia.
Tueiday.—" Wish you'd get yourself made a Peer, Toby," said
Desman, gloomily. "Not difficult, 1 understand; Brabournr will
tell you how it's done; unlike the Poet, a Peer is either bora or
made; Aylesbubt, for example, was bora; Bkauouknk was made.
As you weren't born, you must be made. Baron Bouverie-Street

boubne knows); keep on asking, and in meantime make yourself
disagreeable in the Commons, and the thing is done."

Very muoh obliged to Denman; quite kind of him to take this
interest in me; but why bo anxious on the point P
'I'll tell you frankly, Toby. I want to create a' Party here, and
you'd do admirably to begin with. A Statesman, however capable,
no use without a Party. You know that very well in the Commons.
Everybody there has a Party. I am all by myself here, and the
Mabkiss and the rest put upon mo. Now if I had a Party"
"Hans Bkeitmann had one, you know," I say, liking to humour
Denman, who is evidently in low spirits.
"Had he P Where did he sit for? Never heard of him; however,
as I was saying, if I had a Party I should make the Mabkiss sit up."
In the meantime, I gather they have been making Denman sit
down. Debate on about Sheriff's Assizes Expenses Bill. Denman
had something useful to say. Approached table; Esheb got up at
same moment. Peers impatiently called for Esher: Denman
ignored petty insult; commenced his speeoh; sentences drowned in
hubbub; Esher resumed seat; Makkiss approached table; Den-
man drew himself up to full height, ana glared on Mabkiss.
Knew of old his jealousy of him; stops at
no means of gratifying it; now moves,
"That Lord Esher be heard." Lord
Chancellor, that minion of the majority,
promptly puts question, and declares it
carried. For a moment Denman stands
irresolutely at table, looking round. Sup-
pose he were to lightly skip on to table,
and, standing there, defy them all P Sup-
pose he were to lower his head, and run
a-butt at the stomach of the Lord Chan-
cellor P What delight to topple him
over—to see his heels rise in the air, and
disappear with rest of his body at other
side of Woolsack! Denman laughed to
think he should see suoh fun. Content for
the present with contemplation of it, and
so resumed seat. "Bat I '11 form a
Party," said he; "have my own Whips,
and shake this effete Government to its
foundation."
Butinett done.—In Commons: a dull
night, lighted up by luminous speeoh from
Rath bone on Government of Western
Australia.

A Hot 'Un fcr the City.
Wedneiday.—House hard at work all
afternoon on Directors' Liability Bill.
Wabmington in charge of measure; intends to make it warm for
Guinea-pigs. Roper Lethbridge, Dixon Hartland, James Mac-
lean, and Kimbeb, Q.C., protett at length. Robert Fowler, Bart.,
breaks into lava flood of burning eloquence. If the Bill is carried,
what is to become of the City P
"You may," he moans, "write on the front of the Bill, 'Delrn-
dum eit Londinium,' um? um?" He, for one, will have no re-
sponsibility in the matter; and so, tucking his bands under his
coat-tails, he strides forth, to vote against Third Reading of Bill.
All in vain; Third Reading carried by 224 votes against 50.

"COMING IN THEIR THOUSANDS."
The announcement that a Thousand Nurses would be received at
Marlborough House last Saturday, naturally attracted a large
number of the Guards and Household troops, who were off duty, to
the vicinity of St. James's Park and Pali Mall. The excitement
among the military somewhat abated when it was ascertained that
the Prince and Princess were receiving the "first working sub-
scribers" to the National Pension Fund for Nurses. The Prince
made one of his best speeches, and the Princess smiled her best
smiles. The Comptroller of the Weather
for the Royal Household had given
special orders for sunshine, or a good
imitation of it from one till three, so
umbrellas were not needed; thus sym-
bolically showing that the day of
"Gamps" was over, and that a new
era of superior nursing was now an
established fact. If such a state of
affairs had continued as was portrayed
in Martin Chuzzlewit, their Royal High-
nesses might have been receiving the
last thousand Sarah Gamps and Betsy Prigs, and addressing them
in a very different strain.
Dramatic Notes.—Alexandre the Grateful, in returning thanks
for the toast of "the Avenue Piece," observed that "he objected to
this phrase, as he did not mean to 'av a new pieoe for a long time,
the present Bill being good enough." This oast a gloom over the
assembly, which then quietly dispersed.
Mr. Irving, disguised as Louts the Eleventh (the last of the great
French cricketers), is at the Grand, in celestial Islington, where the
Angel is. These angelic visits are few and far between.

The Baron has read Oscah "Wilde's "Wildest and Oscarest work,
called Dorian Gray, a weird sensational romance, complete in one
number of Lippincott's Magazine. The Baron recommends any-
body who revels in diablerie, to begin it about half-past ten, and

Joe, the Fat Boy in Pickwick, startles the Old Lady; Oscar, the Fad Boy in
Lippincott's, startles Mrs. Grundy.
Oscar, the Fad Boy. "I want to make jour tieBh creep!"
to finish it at one sitting up; but those who do not so revel he
advises either not to read it at all, or to choose the daytime, and take
it in homoeopathio doses. The portrait represents the soul of the
beautiful Ganymede-like Dorian Gray, whose youth and beauty
last to the end, while his soul, like John Brown's, "goes marching
on" into the Wilderness of Sin. It becomes at last a devilled soul.
And then Dorian stioks a knife into it, as any ordinary mortal
might do, and a fork also, and next morning
"Lifeless but' hideous' he lay,"
while the portrait has recovered the perfect beauty which it
possessed when it first left the artist's easel. If Oscar intended
an allegory, the finish is dreadfully wrong. Does he mean that,
by sacrificing his earthly life, Dorian Qray atones for his infernal
sins, and so purifies his soul by suicide"Heavens! I am no
preacher," says the Baron, "and perhaps Oscar didn't mean
anything at all, except to give us a sensation, to show how like
Buxwsit Lytton'b old-world style he could make his descriptions
and his dialogue, and what an easy thing it is to frighten the
respectable Mrt. Grundy with a Bogie." The style is 'decidedly
Lyttonerary. His aphorisms are Wilde, yet forced. Mr. Oscar Wh.dk
says of his story, it is poisonous if you like, but you cannot deny
that it is also perfect, and perfection is what we artists aim at." Per-
haps; but "we artists " do not always hit what we aim at, and, despite
his confident claim to unerring artistio marksmanship, one must
hazard the opinion, that in this case Mr. Wilds has shot wide."
There is indeed more of "poison" than of "perfection" in Dorian
Gray. The central idea is an excellent, if not exactly novel, one;
and a finer art, say that of Nathaniel Hawthorne, would, have
made a striking and satisfying story of it. Dorian Gray is striking
enough, in a sense, but it is not " satisfying" artistically, any more
than it is so ethically. Mr. Wilde has preferred the sensuous and
hyperdeeorative manner of "Mademoiselle de Mauptn," and with-
out 0actikk's power, has spoilt a promising conception by clumsy
unideal treatment. His " decoration " (upon which he plumes him-
self) is indeed "laid on with a trowel." The luxuriously elaborate
details of his "artistic hedonism" are too suggestive of South
Kensington Museum and esthetic Encyclopaedias. A truer art would
have avoided both the glittering conoeits, which bedeck the body of
the story, and the unsavoury suggestiveness which lurks in its
spirit. Poisonous! Yes. But the loathly "leperous distilment"
taints and spoils, without in any way subserving "perfection,"
artistic or otherwise. If Mrs. Grundy doesn't read it, the younger
Grundies do; that is, the Grundiet who belong to Clubs, and who
care to shine in certain sets wherein this story will be muoh dis-
cussed. "I have read it, and, except for the ingenious idea; I wish
to forget it," says the Baron.
The Baron has seen the new, lively, and eccentric newspaper,
entitled The Whirlwind. It has reached the third number. _ "I
am informed," says the Baron, "that, on payment of five guineas
down, I can become a lite-subscriber to the Whirlwind. But what
does life-subscriber mean P Do I subscribe for the term of my life,

has to be wound up, or whirl-winded up, and suppose I am still
going on, can I intervene to stop the proceedings, ana insist on my
contract to be supplied with a Whirlwind per week for the re-
mainder of my natural or unnatkiral life being carried out? If the
contract is for our lives, then, as a life-subscriber, I should insist on
the Whirlwind remaining oo-existent with me, so that, up to my
latest breath, I might have a Whirlwind, But if the life-subscrip-
tion of five guineas is only for the term of the Whirlwind's life,

Wednesday.—All the Police, having now
been replaced by Amateur Special Constables,
who are as yet unfamiliar with their duties,
the position of the Metropolitan Magistrates
becomes impossible, and they resign in a body
at five minutes' notice, causing the greatest
consternation in signalling their resignation
by sending every case on the charge-sheet
that morning for trial to a superior Court.
Thursday.—The Judges, overwhelmed by
the prospect of an unusual and quite impos-
sible amount of extra work, demand the
increase of their salaries to £10,000 per
annum. On this being categorically refused
by the Treasury, they then and there, on
their respective Benches, severally tear off
their wigs and robes, and quit their Courts
"for good," with threatening gestures.
Friday.—The Lokd Chancellor, on being
informed of the conduct of the Judges, rips
open the Woolsack, scattering its contents
over the floor of the House of Lords, axd, de-
nouncing the Government, throws up his
post on the spot. The legal business of the
country, coming thus to a deadlock, is in-
volved in further chaos by a sudden strike of
all the Members of both the Senior and Junior
Bars, which is farther complicated by another
of every Solicitor in the three kingdoms.
Saturday.— Gatling guns being posted in
the Entranoe Hall, and Bow Street having
been cleared by a preliminary discharge of
artillery, the programme of the Royal Italian
Opera for the evening is carried out, as
advertised, at Covent Garden. Ladies wear-
ing their diamonds, arc conveyed to the
theatre in Police Vans, surrounded by detaoh-
ments of the Household Cavalry, and gentle-
men's evening dress is supplement* d by a
six-chambered revolver, an iron-cased um-
brella, a head protector, and a double-edged
cut-and-thrusting broad-sword.
Sunday.—The Church having caught the
prevailing fever, the entire body of the
Clergy, headed by the Bishops, come out on
strike, with the result that no morning, after-
noon, or evening services are held anywhere.
The Medical Profession takes up the idea,
and, discovering a grievance, the Royal
College of Surgeons issues a manifesto. All
the hospitals turn out their patients, and
medical men universally drop all their cases.
An M D. who is known, upon urgent pressure,
to have made an official visit, is chased up
and down Harley Street by a mob of his
infuriated brother practitioners, and is finally
nearly lynched on a lamp-post in Cavendish
Square. The day closes in with a serious
riot in Hyde Park, caused by the meeting of
the conflicting elements of Society, who have
all marched there with their bands and
banners to air their respective grievances.
Monday. — The London County Council,
School Board, Common Council, Court of
Aldermen, and the Royal Academicians after
discovering, respectively, some trifling sources
of dissatisfaction, wreck their several esta-
blishments, and finally march along the
Thames Embankment towards Westminster,
singing, alternately, the " Marseillaise" and
"Ask a P/eece-man."

the members of the Incorporated Cain-and-

Mr. George Augustus Sala indignantly re-

coming out strong in opposition, and astonish-

No more will Henby Mokton roam,
Nor from your oharms away for long go,
But, honeymooning here at home,

The stately home of Don and Prootor—
Where, 'mid the deafening cheers that rtnt
The air, he straight became a Doctor.

We've sung him in a thousand ditties,
And freedoms too we've made him take
Of goodness knows how many cities!
Yet while to honour and to praise
With one another we've been vying,

Of rest to come he ne'er ceased sighing?
And when, with pomp of high degree,
Your marriage vows and troth you

Why, everyone was glad to see

WEEK BY WEEK.
Scarcely a day passes without bringing us nearer to the end of
the year. That is a melancholy reflection, but we are not sure that
it exhausts all the possibilities of misery latent in the flight of time.
It has been noticed, for instance, that the Duke of X—-, whose
sporting proclivities are notorious, never fails to celebrate his birth-
day with a repast at an inferior restaurant, and, as His Grace is
powerful, his friends suffer in silence and bewail his increasing
ducal age.
Henley Regatta came off as arranged. This is a peculiarity which
is very striking in connection with this Royal fixture. We are
informed that several certainties were upset, but by whom and why
has not been stated. Candidly speaking, suoh a brutal method as
"upsetting" consorts ill with the softer manners of our time. On
the Thames, too, it must be extraordinarily disagreeable.
Mrs. Wkkdle, the Hon. Mrs. Threadbare, and Lady Fawn, have
joined the lately established Bureau for the Dissemination of Fashion-
able Friendships. The Personal Advertising Department is now open,
and is daily filled with a distinguished crowd of applicants. Arrange-
ments are in process of completion for supplying the deserving rioh with
cambric handkerchiefs, and imitation diamonds, at nominal prices.
A well-known Actor has lately been deprived of his customary
allowance of fat. His loss of weight (in avoirdupois) has been com-
puted at five-sixteenths of the integral cubit of a patent accumula-
tor's vertical boiling power, divided by the fractional resistance of a
plate-glass window to a two-horse-power catapult.
The weather has been variable, with oryptooonchoidal deflections
of a solid reverberating isobar previously tested in a solution of zinc
and soda-water. This indicates cold weather in December next.
Consols jcbjth better,

A Politician, whose name has been frequently mentioned during
the late crisis, has stated it as his opinion that a temperance orator's
powers of persuasion are to a moral victory as a Prime Minister is to
a willow-pattern dinner-plate. The remark caused muoh excite-
ment in the lobby, where this gentleman's humorous sallies never
lack appreciated.
What is this I hear of a certain Noble Duke, well-known in
sporting circles, having accepted a three months' engagement to
appear in a "comic character sketch of his own composition," at a
long-established East End-Musio Hall? If there is any truth in
the rumour, I should like to ask what the Duchess has been about f
A distinguished Oxford Mathematical Professor has, just after
prolonged and patient research, established the undoubted certainty
of the following interesting facts beyond any possible question or
controversy:—That the quantity of Almond Rock Hard Bake, con-
sumed in the United Kingdom in the year terminating on the 15th
of May last, amounted to 17 lbs. 9 oz. for each member of the
population, including women and children. That if at all the old
and discarded Chimney Pot Hats for a like period were collected in
a heap, and packed closely together, they would fill a building twice
the height of St. Paul's, and three times the length of the Crystal
Palace. That winners of the Derby who have become eventually
four-wheeler cab-horses are ninety-six in number, but that there is
only one authentic instance of a four-wheeler cab-horse having
become a Derby winner.
So great is the craze for the newest idea in locomotion that it is
calculated that including Duchesses no less than 1470 grandee dames
whose names are well-known in Society, now pass Piccadilly Circus
on the outside of the London General Omnibus Company's vehicles,
between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily.
A Passport to the Best Society, and a Guarantee fob Re-
spectability, is to be a diligent student of Mr. Punch's works, and
to have eamea the abuse of the Pall-Mall Gazette,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.
Monday.—Les Huguenots. Great night in consequence of police
strike in Bow Street. Rioting, and Life Guards called out late, just
as they were retiring for the night. Down they came, in regimentals,
in undress, anyhow, to quell the
disturbance. At least, such is the
report inside the house. But in-
convenient to be in two places at
once. Henceforth they ought to
reoord this incident by haying an
extinguisher (typical of going to bed
and also of quelling the row) slung
on to their breast-plates. Extin-
guisher clinking against armour
would make pretty noise. Their
Royal Highnesses the Prince and
Princess of Wales, having come to
en j oy the Opera, remain undisturbed,
and leave in perfect tranquillity.
Excellent example to perturbed au-
dienoe. Excitementwithin the house.
Drubiolanus, Earl db Grey, Mr.
Higglns, and other members of the
Organising Operatic Committee, ready to charge the mob at a moment's
nonce, to charge up to two guineas a stall, if necessary. Not neces-
sary, however. Calls for the Sheriff-elect. Drubiolanus, not having
the official costume ready, cannot appear in it, but uses his authority
and his persuasive powers in clearing lobbies, saloons, and hall. At
any moment he is ready to march out with all the Huguenot soldiers
and charge the rioters. Peace restored about midnight, Household
troops sent home to bed, and constables decided to strike only on the
heads of roughs, rowdies, and burglars. This shows how useful it is to
have a Sheriff on the premises. At Her Majesty's last winter they
had the nearest approach to it, that is, Sheriff's officers on the pre-
mises. . But this is not precisely the same thing, as Sheriff's officers
wear no uniform, and not being permitted to go out of a house when
once it is given into their custody, they, however valiant, are of no
use in a crowd.
Tuesday.—Lohengrin. Regardless of rioters, their Royal High-
nesses again here. Muoh cheered outside on driving away. Yet
crowd in Strand (so we hear) not particularly good-tempered, and
have wrecked a private brougham or two. No effect on Opera,
which goes as well as ever. Rumours that the player of the grosse
caisse has struck at rehearsal are confirmed, he appears in his place
and strikes again, so does the Shakspearian performer "Cymbabne."
Wednesday.—Don Giovanni. 7.ems de Lussan as Zerlina, very
popular. Still a little too like Carmen in appearance. Lassalle
can't be bettered. Great night everywhere. Mile. Melba and Mr.
Edouakp de Reszke taking a little holiday at a concert in Grosvenor
Square, where also are Madame Patey and another Edward yclept
Lloyd, whom Herb Ganz accompanies with his "Sont of Tubal
Cain "—no political allusion to the recent Barrow Election. Opera
comparatively full. Some habitues look in to see how everything's
going on, then go on themselves to Reception in Piccadilly, At
Homes elsewhere, M. P. Q..'s Smoking Concert, and various other
entertainments. Society winding itself up brilliantly. "Rebellion's
dead! and now we '11 go to supper." And so we do. "Again we
come to the Savoy!"
Thursday.—Lucia off-night, but everything and everybody
"going on " as usual. H.R.H. again at Opera.
Friday.—La Favorita. Breathing time before the great Operatic
event of week to-morrow night.
Saturday.—Esmeralda. Too late at last moment to say anything
on this splendid subject, save that the Composer was deservedly
greeted with a storm—of applause!
PURELY A MATTER OF BISLEYNESS.
Private R. Vaic Winkle opened his eyes, and, taking up his
rusty rifle, marched towards the new ranges.
"Dear me!" said he, gazing with amazement at his surround-
ings, "this is not at all like what I saw when I went to sleep."
"No, Rip, it is not," replied Mr. Punch, who happened to be in
the neighbourhood. He had been watching his sweetest Princess
making a bull's-eye at the opening ceremony.
"Wny, it is twice as large as Wimblodon," continued the
astounded warrior.
"You are well within the limit" the Sage assented, "and Bee,
there is plenty of space. No fear oi damaging any of the tenants of
George Ranohr in this part of the country."
"No, indeed 1" exclaimed Private Van Winklb. "Not that I
think His Royal Highness had muoh cause of complaint. The truth
"Let bygones be bygones," interrupted Mr. Punch. "Geobqe
Rasger is no longer your landlord, exoept, in a certain sense, repre-
senting the interests of the Regular Army, and I shall keep my eye
upon him in that capacity."
"An entirely satisfactory arrangement. But where are the fancy
tents, and the luncheon parties, and all the etceteras that used to be
so pleasant at Wimbledon f"
"Disappeared," returned Mr. Punch, firmly. "Bisley is to be
more like Shoeburyness (where the Artillery set an excellent example
to the Infantry) than the Surrey saturnalia."
"And is it to be all work and no play P"
"Thatwill be the general idea. Of course, in the evening, when
nothing better can be done, there will be harmonic meetings round
the camp-fires. But while light lasts, the crack of the rifle and the
ping of the bullet will be heard in all directions, vice the pop of
champagne corks superseded. And if you don't like the prospect,
my dear Rip, you had better go to sleep again."
But Private Van Winkle remained awake—to his best interests 1

ROBERT ON MATRIMONY.
Well, we're jest about going it, at the reel "Grand Hotel," we
are. We had jest about the werry lovliest wedding here, larst week,
as I ewer seed, ewen with my great xperiense. Suoh a oollekshun
of brave - looking men and reel handsum
women as seldom meets together xoept on these
most hintresting occashuns. And as good luok
wood have it, jest as we was in the werry wirl
and xcitement of it all, who should come in to
lunch but the same emminent yung Swell as
cum about a munth ago. And he had jest the
same helegant but simple lunch as before,
with a bottle of the same splendid Champane,
as before, and he didn't harf finish it, as
before, and not a drop of what he left was
wasted, as before; and so, when he paid me
5^=^/-^J) his little account, he arsked me if many of
the werry bewtifool ladies, as I had told nim
of when he came larst, had been to the "Grand" lately, so the bold
thort seized me, and I says to him, "Yes, your , there's
jest a nioe few of 'em here now, and if you will kindly toiler me up
to our bewtifool Libery, and will keep your eyes quite wide open as
you gos along, you will see jest about a hole room full of 'em.
So I took him parst the grand room in which the Wedding Gests
was assembled, and there sure enufi, he seed suoh a collection of
smiling bewty, as ewidently made a great impression on his 's
Art, and one speshally lovely Bndesmade gave him a look, as he passed
by, as ewidently went rite thro it. I scarcely xpecs to be bleeved
wen I says, as nis 's cheeks quite blusht with hadmira-
shun, and he turned round to me and says, says he, "Ah, Mr. Robert,
if there was many suoh reel lovely angels as that a flying about, I
rayther thinks as I shood be perswaded to turn a Bennediotus myself."
I didn't at all know what ne meant, but I thort as it was werry
credittable to him. We got quite a chatting arterwards in the
Libery, of course I don't mean to say as I forgot for a moment the
strornary difference atween us, but he had werry ewidently been
werry muoh struck by the lovely Bridesmade, for he says, "Mr.
Robert," says he, "what's about the rite time for a man to marry?"
Of course I was reglar staggered, but I pulls myself together, and
I says, without not no hesitashun, "Jest a leetle nnder 30, your
, for the Gent, and jest a leetle over 20 for the Lady, and
then the Gent gits just about 10 years advantage, which I thinks as
he's well entitled to." At whion he larfs quite hartily, and he says,
"Why that wood keep me Bingle for another ten years—but I will
think it over;" and, strange to say, jest as we passed Spain by the
room as the Bridal party was in, the same lovely Bridesmade
happend to be near the door, so they ooud both have a good look at
each other, and a hansum cupple they was, if ever I seed one. And
when his wished me good day, which he did. quite in a
frendly way, he added, with his most bewtifool smile, Ten years.
Mr. Robert, seems a long time to wait for such a sweet angel
as that!"
Ah, it's a rum world as we all lives in, and in nothink much
rummer than in the wunderfool power of a bewtifool face, ah, and as
sumbody says, for Wheel or for Wo. jest as it appens, more's the pitty.
I rayther thinks, as I gathers from the tork of the many yung
swells as we has dining here, that they are not altogether what I
shoud call a marrying race; they seems to think as there's alters
plenty of time for that sollem seremony when they 're a good deal
older.
Ah, of oourse it isn't for a poor old Hed Waiter to presume to
adwise young and hemenent swells, but my xperiense of uman life
teaches me, as the werry werry appiest time of a man's life is from
30 to about 40, perwided as he has been lucky enuff to secure for
hisself a yurg, bewtifool, good-tempered, helegant, and ercomplished
Bride, to, as the Poet says, harve his sorrows, and dubble his joys.
Robert.

And what of those fast following behind?
Well-meaning hearts, maybe, all expectation
Of glittering gains upon a perilous road.

Pricked on by poverty's imperious goad;
Hoping,—as who of hope shall be forbidden'?—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAEY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 7.—Cabinet Council on Satur-
day; House begins to think it's time Ministers made up their
minds what they 're going to do with business of Session. But Old
Morality returns customary answer. Ministry still carefully con-
sidering question. Meantime he has nothing to say.
"Except in respect of sex and age, 0. M. reminds me," said Albert
Rollit, "of scene in play recently put on stage by Bkeuboiim
Tree—A Man's Shadow it was called. Daresay you remember.
Toby; there's a murder witnessed through window by wife and
little daughter. They think it's their man that did the deed; but
'twas the other fellow—the Shadow, don't you know. There is police
inquiry; mother and daughter cross-examined; believe the mur-
derer is the husband and father: saw him do it with their own eyes;
but of course not going to peach; little girl pressed to tell all she
knows; makes answer in voice that thrills Gallery, and makes
mothers in the Pit weep,' I have seen nothing, I have heard nothing.'
Never see Old

Measures to me this Session."
Irish Constabulary Vote on; Prince Abthur lounging on Treasury
Bench; prepares to receive Irishry; engagement opens a little Hat,
with speech from John Ellis, oration from O'Picton, and feeble
flagellation from Flynn. Then Prince Arthur suddenly, unex-
pectedly, dashes in. ' Empty benches fill up; stagnant pool stirred
to profound est depths: Arthur professes to be tolerant of Irish
Members, but declares himself abhorrent of connivance of Right Hon.
Gentleman above Gangway. Talks at Mr. G., who begins visibly to
bristle before our very eyes as he tits attentive on Front Bench.
Abthttb in fine fighting trim; Ministerial bark may be labouring in
troubled waters; a suddenly gathered storm, coming from all
quarters, has surrounded, and threatens to whelm it; Matthews
may be sinking under adversity; the Postmen may pull down
Raises; Goschen is gone; Old Mobaltty's cheerful nature is
being soured; there is talk of Dissolution, and death. But if this is
Prince Arthur's last time of defending his rule in Ireland, it shall
not be done in half-hearted way. Come storm, come WTack, at least
he '11 die with harness on his back.
The accused becomes the accuser. Called upon to defend himself,
he turns, and makes a slashing attack on his pursuers, carrying the
war into their camp. Scorning the Captains and Men-at-arms, he
goes straight for Mr. G., and in an instant swords clash across the
table, ana shields are dinted. Nothing more delightful than tn hear
Mr. G. complaining, as he rose, and took bis coat off, that Prince
Abthub had "dragged bim into the controversy." On the whole,
be bore the infliction pretty well, and w«nt for Abthub neck and
crop. Business done.—Irish Votes in Supply.
Tuesday.—"I have teen nothing; I have heard nothing."
Pathetic refrain of Old Mobality murmured again to-night; Mem-

"THE SHADOWLESS MAN."
(Latest Irish Edition of the Old German Romanes.)
[In the course of the Debate laBt Monday week, Mr. Dillon said, "I was never shadowed."]
bers wanted to know about various things; but in Old Morality's
mind, fate of the Tithes Bill, intentions of Government touching
proposed new Standing Order, and allocation of money originally
intended for Publicans, all a blank. "We are still considering,"
says he.
"A most considerate Government," says Wilfrid Lawson.
"Might save time and trouble if they had at table an automatic
machine; Members wanting to know how business is to be arranged,
what Bills to be dropped, and which gone forward with, could go
up to table, drop a penny in the slot, and out would come the
answer—" I have seen nothing; I have heard nothing."^
Seems that Hanbury has exceptional means of obtaining infor-
mation. Old Morality has privately shown him Military Report
with respect to Heligoland. A confidential communication, some-
thing of the kind the Maretbs carried on with the population of
Heligoland. But Hanbury straightway goes and tells all about it in
a letter to one of his Constituents; letter gets into papers. Summers
reads it out to House. Eagerly thirsting after knowledge on military
matters, Summers wants also to see the text of Report. Why should
Hanbuby have it all to himself? Quartermaster-General Summkbs
would like

it, and form-

they could put up with. O'Picton fat morose at the corner seat
below the Gangway. Who was Hanbury, that he should have the
advantage of studying these military documents when the grand-
nephew of Picton of Waterloo was left out in the cold, his martial
instincts unsatisfied, his knowledge of strategical points of the
British Empire un satiated?
Another instance this of the misfortune that pursues the Govern-
ment. Little did Old Morality think, when in moment of weak-
ness he showed this important document to Hanbury, what a
hornet's nest it weuld bring about his unoffending head.
Business done.—Irish Constabulary Vote passed.
Thursday.—At last Old Morality has heard something and seen
something. Heard how things went on to-day in Committee on
Procedure. Worse and worse. Prince Abthub made curious
blunder for one so alert: introduced into draft Report admission of
prinoiple that Lords might, an they pleased, refuse to consider
in current Session, any Bill coming up to them from Commons.
Habcourt saw his opportunity; used it with irresistible skill and
force. Committee adjourned in almost comatose state.
This is what Old Mobality has heard from Joeim, who begins to
think that, after all, life is a serious thing. What he sees is, that
it is impossible to further delay decision about business. Accordingly
announces complete surrender. All, all are gone, the old familiar
faces—Land Purchase Bill, Tithe Bill, and even this later projeot of
the new Standing Order. *' What, all our pretty chioks? cry the
agonised Ministerialists.
"Yes," said Old Mobility, mingling his tears with theirs, "our
duty to our Queen and Country demands this sacrifice. But," he
added, bracing up, significantly eyeing Mr. G., and speaking in
clear solemn tones, "we reserve to ourselves absolute freedom of

action on a future occasion." Opposition shouted with laughter,
whilst Old Morality stood and stared, and wondered what was
amusing them now. New Session is, according to present inten-
tions, to open in November. Will the Land Purchase Bill be taken
first r Mr. G. wants to know.
"Sir," said Old Moralut, "I have indicated the views of the
Government as to the Land Purchase Bill, according as those views
are held at the present time." (Cheers from the Ministerialists.)
Encouraged by this applause, and, happy thought striking him,
went on: "But it is impossible for the Government to say what
circumstances may occur to qualify those views."
Once more Opposition break into storm of laughter; Old Mobility
again regardB them with dubious questioning gaze.
"Curious thing, Toby," he said to me afterwards, "those fellows
opposite always laugh when I drop in my most diplomatic sentences.
It s very well for Machiavelli that he didn't live in these times,
and lead House of Commons instead of the Government of the
Florentine Republic. He would never have opened his mouth with-
out those Radicals and Irishmen going off into a fit of laughter."
Business done.—Announcement that business won't be done.
Friday.—Still harping on Irish Votes. Want to dock Prince
Akthttb.8 salary. Swift MacNeill brought down model of batter-
ing-ram used at Falcarragh; holds it up; shows it in working order;
Committee much interested; inclined to encourage this sort of thing;
pleasant interlude in monotony of denunciation of Prince A lmirit
and all his works; no knowing what developments may not be in
store; the other night had magic-lantern performance just off
Terraoe: that all very well on fine night; but when it's raining must
keep indoors and battering-ram suitable for indoor exhibition.
Havjslock wanted to borrow it, says he would like to show
Schwann how it works; but MacNeill couldn't spare it till Irish
Votes through.
New turn given to Debate by plaintive declaration from John
Dillon that ne has "never been shadowed." "A difficult lot to
deal with," says Arthur, gazing curiously at the Shadowless Man.
"If they are shadowed, they protest; if they 're not, they repine."
Business done.—Irish Votes in Committee.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I
MODERN TYPES.
(By Mr. Punch's own Type Writer.)
No. XVI.—THE HURLINGHAM GIRL.'
It is not so easy as it might appear to define the Hurlingham Girl
with complete accuracy. To say of her that she is one whose spirits
are higher than her aspirations, would he true but inadequate. For,
at the best, aspirations are etherial things, and those of the Hurling-
ham Girl, if they ever existed, have been so recklessly puffed into
space as to vanish almost entirely from view. In any case they
afford a very unsubstantial basis of comparison to the student who
seeks to infer from them her general character. Tet it would he
wrong to assume that she has dispensed with the etherial on account
of her devotion to what is solid. Indeed nothing is more certain
about her than the contempt with which she has been willingly
taught to look upon all the attainments that are usually dignified
with this epithet. History and geography, classics and mathematics,
modern languages (her own ana those of foreign nations), all these
she candidly despises. Let others make their nests upon the shady
branches of the tree of learning. For herself she is fam to soar into
the empyrean of society, and to gaze with undazzled eyes into the
sun of the smart set. She has of course had the advantage of
teachers of all sorts, but the claims made upon her time by thought-
lees parents have usually been so great as to leave her at the end of
her school-room period with a few
brittle fragments of knowledge, which
shift and change in her mind as the
hits of glass might shift in a kaleido-
scope from which the looking-glass
had been omitted. It is enough for
her if, in place of historical dates, she
knows the fashionable fixtures, whilst
Sandown and Eempton, Ascot and
Goodwood, Hurlingham, and the Ra-
nelagh, supply her with a variety of
knowledge infinitely more interesting
and " actual" than the dry details of
population, area, climate, and capital
towns, which may be learnt (by others)
from primers of geography.
Although it is, from their and her
point of view, eminently desirable that
the parents of the Hurlingham Girl
should be rich, yet it is by no means
absolutely necessary. It is, however,
essential that they should possess a
social position which will ensure to
them and to their daughter an easy
entrance into that world which con-
siders itself, not perhaps better, but
certainly good. Her mother has pro-
bably discovered long since that the task of being thwarted by
her daughter is an intolerable addition to her social burdens. She
therefore permits her, with as muoh resignation as she can command,
to take her own course in all those matters that do not conflict
directly with the maternal plans, and she may even come to take a
pride in the bold and dashing independence by which her daughter
seeks to relieve her of all responsibility, if not of all anxiety.
It is naturally during the London Season that the life of the
Hurlingham Girl is at its fullest and best. On week-day mornings
she is a frequent attendant in the Row, the means of her father
being apparently sufficient to provide her with a sleek and showy
Park hack and an irreproachable groom. Thence she hastens home
to rest and dawdle until the hour arrives for luncheon, to which
meal she has invited the youth who happens to be temporarily
dancing attendance upon her, for it is understood in many houses
that luncheon is an open meal for which no formal invitation
from a parent is necessary. In the afternoon there is always a
bazaar, an amateur concert, an exhibition, a fashionable matinee or a
Society tea-party to be visited. For the evening there are dinners,
and theatres, and an endless succession of dances, at which the
flowers, the suppers, and the general decorations possess as much or
as little variety as the conversation of those who overcrowd the
rooms to an accompaniment of dance-music that may once have
been new.
But of course there are distractions. Now and again Society seeks
relief from its load of care by emigrating en masse for the day to
a race-meeting at Sandown or Eempton. There the Hurlingham
Girl is as much at home as though she were native to the spot,
sprung, as it were, from the very turf itself. The interest she
takes or pretends to take in racing is something astounding. For in
truth she knows nothing about horses, their points, their pedigrees,
or their performances. Yet she chatters about them and their raoes,
their jockeys, their owners, the weight they carry, their tempers,
and the state of the betting market, with a glib assurance which is

apt to put to shame even those of her male companions who hav
devoted a lifetime to the earnest study of these supreme matters.
In imitation of these gentlemen she will assure those who care to
listen to her, that she has had a real bad day, not having managed
to get on to a single winner, and that if it hadn't been for a flake
in backing Tantivy, one, two, three, she would have been reduced
to a twopence in the pound condition of beggary. She will then
forget her imaginary losses, and will listen with amusement and
interest while a smooth-faoed lad criticises with as much severity
as he can command in the intervals of his cigarettes the dress,
appearance, and general character of a lady whom she happens to
dislike. On the following day she will visit Hurlingham in order
to be looked at as a spectator at a polo matoh, in which she has no
interest whatever. After this she is entertained at dinner together
with a seleot party, which includes the young married lady who is
her bosom friend and occasional chaperon, by a middle-aged dandy
of somewhat shady antecedents, but of great wealth and undoubted
position. On Sunday mornings she may not always go to Churoh,
but she makes up for this neglect by the perfect regularity of her
attendance at Church parade. In the afternoon she will go to
Tattersall's to inspect nones. Ascot could not continue without
her, and Goodwood would orumble into ruins if she were absent.
This at least is her opinion, and thus the months flit by and leave
her just as wise as they found her. For she never reads a book,
and illustrates by constant practice her belief that the fashionable
intelligence of the Morning Post is a
sufficient mental pabulum for a grown-
up woman.
It is unnecessary to desoribe further
the pursuits and occupations of the
Hurlingham Girl, with regard to
her appearance and dress, it must he
admitted that she displays consider-
able taste. She is always neat, po-
lished, perfectly groomed—in a word,
smart. It may be that it takes nine
tailors to make a man. It is certain
that it takes only one to make a well-
dressed woman. Yet she does not
always, of course, wear tailor - made
costumes, for on the Sundays that she
spends on the river, her impertinently
poised straw hats, her tasteful ribbons,
her sailor's knots, her collars, her
manly shirts, and the general appro-
priateness of her dress, excite the envy
of those who declare that they would
not imitate her for worlds, merely
because nature has made it impossible
for them to be like her. Handsome
she is undoubtedly, with the beauty
that comes of perfect health undis-
turbed by thoughts of the why and the wherefore, or by anticipa-
tions of a troublesome to-morrow. Yet to the casual observer who
beholds this admirably decorated creature, her conversation is dis-
appointing. She revels in slang. Catch-words and phrases which
are not called vulgar only because the better classes use them, oome
trippingly, but never with a pleasant effect from her lips. Nor has
she that sense of reticence which is said to have been the dis-
tinguishing mark of unmarried girlhood at some former period.
That she should talk frivolously on great subjects, if she talks on
them at all, is only to be expected. It would be well if her curiosity
and her conversation left untouched delicate matters, the existence
of which she may suspect but ought certainly to ignore.
After she has thus flaunted her brilliant health and beauty through
several Seasons, she may begin to tire of an existence, which in
spite of its general freedom, is subject to certain restraints. She
therefore decides to emancipate herself by submitting to a husband.
She finds no difficulty, with the assistance of her mother, in discard-
ing the penniless subaltern who has devoted himself to her, and
whom she has induced to believe that she preferred to the
whole world. Having received an offer from a gentleman of pre-
sentable looks and immense possessions, she promptly accepts it,
and gains to her own surprise a considerable reputation for judgment
and discretion. It is quite possible that after a year or two of giddy
married life she may decline gradually into a British Matron,
respected alike on account of her increasing family, and her sub-
stantial appearance.
The Bot the Fatheb of the Man.—The Chairman of the Infant
Insurance Committee, asked a skilled witness, "Is a man his own
child, or another person's child?" This led to an altercation, and
the room had to be cleared while the question was debated. _ On the

Fanatics and faddists will mar
the best schemes.
Unless they 're rt strained from
unholy extremes
By the hand of a strong and
a fair man.
Your lubber, when first he
adventures on wheels,
lias little contiolof his hi ad
or his heels.
With knees on the shake,
and arms shrinking,
He soramhles about on the
slippery floor,
Like a toper at large, or a mad
semaphore, linking.
Half wishing he hadn't gone
But, guided discreetly, sup-
p >rted at need,
The clumsieht novice at last
may succeed, [controlling;
His knees and his elbows
And you, my dear Primrose,
have played such a part.
You have given your promis-
ing pupil a start,
And—fO to speak—set the
wheels rolling.
He ought to do now; let us
hope that he will.
The thaoks mainly due to your
judgment and skill
Mr. Punch, for the Public,

The boy's a bit olumsy,—mott
But, give him fair play, and
he may prove a star,"
In spite of the sneerers and
scoffers.

Well, here you are, my bonny

No doubt you felt regret at
With well-Known Wimble-

But here you look all right,
at starting.
You've not been quite deranged
by Ranges;
Of that there never was much
danger.
Small thanks to Aim .' Well,
well, perhaps;
But never mind. Anger's
too grisly [chaps;
To be long held by such smart
And you oan make B alls'-

And "sheeps'-eyes" seem to

And here you need not fear

But, after all, there's " Com-

And brightly crowned with

Your loyalty of heart and head,
Of love (and lead) I 'm sore

THE PROFESSIONAL GUEST.
ON A HOUSE-BOAT AT HENLEY.
Deak Mr. Punch,
Whbn I received a wire from an old and dear sonool-mend,
saying, "Lucv disappointed; oome for week; wire me, Goldftelds,
H-nley—Kitty," I felt that the Art which I had been so assiduously
cultivating for some time
y> t,

■ past was to be put in prac
tioe at last 1 had long
decided that there was a
grand opening for girls (the
true unemployed) in the
idea, and I had determined
to make a good thing out of
it myself. Kitty's telegram
was somewhat vague, I
admit; but gossip having
thrown a side-light on it, I
knew that it came from
Henley, where she and her
husband (whom I had never yet seen) had a House-boat for the
Regatta week. To answer in the affirmative, pack my box, and catch
the next train to Henley, was small work to a " Professional Guest."
When I arrived, I walked straight out of the station to the nearest
wharf, and, chartering a punt, bad my luggage and myself placed
on board, and then told the email boy, who manned" the craft, to
take me to the Goldflelds. I was not too well pleased when he
threw doubts, not only on her whereabouts, but on her existence.
Neither the small boy nor a big man, nor an old woman standing by,
knew anything about it; and I had determined to take the next
train to Town, when a flannel-clad young man, with a heavy face
and a peevish voice, called out from the bank, "I 've been looking
for you everywhere." It proved to be Kittt's husband, but, as we
were totally unacquainted with each other's appearances, it was not
wonderful that bis search for me had been ineffectual. He seemed
much annoyed, however, and only vouchsafed one remark as we
Fun ted, or, rather, waltzed (for the small boy was a "dry bob,"
think), down stream towards the Goldflelds. "It's sill
Kitty's fault,—Lucy's come." Of course this was awkward, but,
on arrival, Kitty was so hospitable, and Lucy so pretty, that,
though our sleeping and dressing apartment was astonishingly small,
and I made the odd girl out at dinner, I felt I could not mind much,
and I also got over the little contretemps of my dressing-bag being
dropped into the river—" by accident," said Kitty's husband.
Owing to the heat and the unaccustomed noise of the river, neither
Lucy nor I slept much; and, though we were told next morning we
could not have any baths, the whole scene was so bright and sparkling
that nobody (except Kitty's husband, who seemed of a morose dispo-
sition) could with reason have complained of anything. It continue i
to sparkle till the first train came down from town, when our guests
and the rain arrived together. It was a dreadful nuisance, as the
awning, which, with the flowers, had cost us hours to arrange,
speedily got soaked, and had to be taken down. Then, of course,
the sun came out again, and for a time the heat was intense. In fact,
one lady, who would eat her lunch on the roof, grew quite faint, and
had to be helped down to Kitty's husband's room. After lunch, we
all ventured out in various small oraf t, and again I was unlucky in
my waterman. I was sure he had never punted before, and it
proved to be bo; for when I asked him if he had had muoh practice
this season, he answered, the while he wrung the water from his
garments, that " he'd only seen it done, and it looked easy." We
managed, however, by dint of banging on to other people's boats, to
get along very well, until an ill-judged "shove" sent us right out
into the course, jost as the race of the day was coming along. I am
not quite dear as to what then took place; only I know that every-
thing was "fouled." Kitty's husband, who had a bet on, was
furious, and glared at me for the rest of the day—a oondition of
things 1 pretended not to see. That night we had a rat- hunt on
board, but we lost the animal, as Lucy diverted our attention by
falling into the river. It was most inconvenient of her, as she wetted
our mutual sleeping apartment dreadfully.
The second day was almost a replica of the first, varied only by
Kitty's husband fancying he had a sunstroke. The third and Is.*

ODE TO MONEY.
{By a Poptimist.)
Hair that is golden grows

Hopes that are golden decay;
that are bright, and em-
bolden
The tourist to go on his way,
Leaving his gingham tight
folden,
Torn to a drizzling grey.
But gold of the Mint is all-
golden,
Safe in the strictest assay.
Cynics may rail against money,
Spurn its beneficent power;
Bears spurn impossible honey,
Foxes the grapes that are
sour.
Men, who can never be funny,
Scoff at the funny man's
dower;
Land s where it seldom is sunny
Find little praise for a flower.
When a man's safe at his
bankers,
"What does it mean, let us
think—
Freedom from care and its
cankers,
Plenty of victuals and'drink?
Nay, but it opens the garden
Of tender illusion and joy,
Where faults find immediate
pardon, [annoy.
And worrying ways don't
In the light of futurity's
favours [amain,
Fair gratitude burgeons
And the flittermouse Love

dent to the Tarts,—We
see that you are doing your
best to defend the proposed
destruction of the Lincoln's
Inn Gateway in Chancery
Lane. In the course of your
exertions, you have been not
too civil to several worthy
persons, and inaccurate in
your description of the Society
of Antiquaries. Now, do take
our advice. We know you
were a clever "Silk" when
you practised at the Bar, and
we have heard that your fore-
fathers (for a generation or so)
were excellent hands at Bank-
ing; but, in the name of
Lombard Street, do let Arohte-
ology alone!
With the best of wishes,
Yours sincerely,
{Signed) Evebybodt.
day was, however, not the success we could have wished. During
the night the weather turned hot, and the food turned—well, not
good,—and next morning the obligatory sacrifice to Father Thames
was appalling. Then when the necessary viands did not arrive from
London, I in my capacity of "professional guest," and of being
always ready for any emergency, volunteered to forage in Henley
town. Oh! that expedition. I fought at the fishmonger's, battled
at the butcher's and baker's, grovelled at the grocer's, and finally
ended by committing a theft at the butterman's. The number of our
visitors was large, and was much augumented by friends' friends,
who came in battalions. It may have been the extra weight on
board, or it may be that the hunted rat had designed a base revenge,
but during lunch, and just as Kitty's husband was beginning to be
genial, an odd idea seized me that the river was rising. Tes! And
the bank behind us was rising too. And gracious! the water was
flowing over the little promenade place, and running about the floor
of the saloon; and then the Oolafieldi gave a lurch and a shiver,
and settled down in the mud, with a foot-and-a-half of dirty water
downstairs, and nothing but the roof left us to peroh upon.
How we ever recovered our belongings I don't know. All I
remember is, being taken to the station in an old green wherry, and
coming back to town seventeen in a second-class carriage. My last
view of the wreck embraced Kitty, propped up against the railing
of the roof, and making tea on a table, which looked more like
tipping over than standing straight. Kitty's husband was mutter-
ing to himself as he handed round the cups; and, as I moved off
through the crush of boats, I fancied I caught the word " Jonah."

Chance fob Buyers.—Last week, among the Tuesday's arrange-
ments in the Daily Telegraph, was announced:—" Bath Horse
Show." Did this include ''Bath Towel-Horse Showf" Fine
chance for sporting Mr. Blundel Maple. M.P., as a Towel-Horse

The sale of yearlings and the pedigrees would be interesting.
THE TOMATO-CURE FOR DYSPEPSIA.
Don't talk to me of oolooynth or famed cerulean pill,
Don't mention hyoscyamus or aloes when I'm ill;
The very word podophyllin is odious in mine ears,
The thought of all the drugs I've ta'en calls up the blinding tears;
The Demon of Dyspepsia, a sufferer writes to say,
At sight of the Tomato-plant will vanish quite away.
The Faculty will diet you till indigestion stops,
On what have always seemed to me interminable slops:
A dainty dish is sure to be the worst thing you can eat;
The bismuth and the charcoal come like nightmares after me it.
Away with all restrictions now, bring mutton, beef, and veal,
As long as ripe Tomatoes come to supplement a meal.
Hepatic action, doctors say, is very hard to start,
And if you have too muoh of it, that also makes you smart;
And so the fate of many folks, especially in town,
Is first to stir the liver up, and then to calm him down.
Now he can trouble us no more, although we go the paoe;
A diet of Tomatoes keeps the tyrant in his place.
Away with deleterious drugs, for here [s a plant been found,
Worth all the weird concoctions that dispensers can compound:
Get fresh Tomatoes, red and ripe, and slice and eat, and then—
You'll find that you are liver-leas, and not like other men.
Come ye who dire dyspepsia's pangs impatiently endure,
It cannot hurt, and may do good, this new Tomato-Cure.
Sweets to the Acid.—In an excellent speeoh, last week, Mr.
Henry Irving suggested that a Charitable Organisation Society
should be established for the Distribution of Art Relief. He rightly
contended that the Beautiful was as necessary to perfect happiness
as the Severely Useful. Drains (excellent things in their way) are
scarcely on a level with Picture*. This is an idea that the so- called
"goody-goody folk" find a difficulty in accepting; possibly because
most of them personally represent everything that is unlovely.

high-flown and exacting at times. When they marry—(they have
not even met at present, but they will many, the year after next,
unless Mr. Punch's Own Second-sighted Seer grossly deceives
himself)—when they marry, Viola's Unole John will be the
person to present them with the then orthodox phonograph and
appurtenances. But if he could foresee the future as distinctly as
Mr. Punch's Seer has done in the following prophetic visions, he
might substitute a biscuit-box, or a fish-slice and fork, a Tantalus
spirit-oase, or even a dumb-waiter, as likely, on the whole, to inspire
a more permanent gratitude.
Jack. Well, to tell you the truth, my dear, I fancy I left the
evening paper here. Ah, there it is.
[He seizes it, and prepares to go.
Mrs, R. You can read it here, if you like, you know—I don't

Jack (startled). Bless my soul! I thought something had blown
up. "Hallelujah Chorus," is it—or what?
Mrs. R. (coldly). As it happens, it is Mendelssohn's " Wedding
March."
Jack. Sounded familiar somehow. 'Jove! Mendelssohn was
determined to let 'em know he was married!
Mrs. R. That was intended to let people know we were married.
It is our Wedding March.
Jack. Oars? You said it was ifsmnissons's just now! But

[The phonograph begins to click and whirr.
Mrs. M. Nearly twelve, and Jack not in yet—on this of all days,
too! Viola, you will be weak, culpably weak, if you don't speak to

Jack. That beastly cat in the room again! Turn it out quick-
it's going to be ill.
Mrs. R. {laughing a little hysterically). No—no, Jack, it isn't
poor Snowball this time! Wait, and you will hear something.
Mrs. R. (ruefully). I can't, Mother. We 're not on speaking terms
just now, you know.
[The " Voice that Breathed o'er Eden" is suddenly rendered by
an organ and full choir: the remarks of two choristers (who
are having a little difference over a hymn-book), and the
subdued sniffs of Mrs. Mandoline, being distinctly audible
between the verses.
Mrs. M. Then I shall. Fortunately, I am on speaking terms with
him—as he will find out! (A ring.) There he is, at last! Go, my
poor darling, leave me to bring him to a sense of his disgraceful
conduct. (Mrs. R. retires by the back drawing-room.) How shall I

Hullo, the Mum!
Jack. What a thing to ask a fellow Of course I'm not!
Mrs. M. (raising her voice above the clamour). Mum no longer,

Ah, I knew I should frighten you! (The final "Amen" of the
Choir dies away, amid the coughing, rustling, and nasal trumpet-

Jack—shall we put them in next?
Mrs. M. I don't care if they do. I want to touoh your conscience,
if I can, and I still hope—bad as you are—that when the voices of
those bells—so long silent—rung in anticipation of suoh a very
different future—fall upon your ear onoe more, they may

think they'll keep tillnext year. Pity to disturb the effeot of that
last, eh?
Jack (with a sardonic laugh). "So long silent!" 1 like that. Sorry
to disappoint you, my dear Mamma, but that phonograph, as a
domestic stimulant, was played out long ago—it has played me out
often enough! Perhaps you don't know it, but really Viola has
rather overdone it. Whenever we have a tiff, she sets the " Voice
from Eden " at me; if she ohooses to consider herself ill-used, I am
treated to a preserved eoho of our marriage vows, and the Bishops
address; when she is in the sulks, I get the congratulations in the
vestry: and if ever I grumble at the weekly bills, it's drowned in
the " Wedding March!" As for your precious bells. I can't dine
with a man at the Club without hearing the confounded things peal-
ing out the moment I let myBelf in. That infernal phonograph,

which yon seem to fondly imagine will make me burst into tears,
and live happy ever after, has driven me out of the house many a

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Gentlewoman, No. 1, has appeared. It gives, or rather sells,
an overwhelming lot for the money, which is sixpence. Sixpenn'orth
of all sorts. Plenty of readable information. Illustrations not the
best feature in it. CrowdB of adver-
tisements. The menus, if carefully
sustained, may prove very useful to
those who "dinna ken." As to the
of The Gentlewoman, well, the
jt pioture is of Her Imperial Majesty
the Queen, and with this type of the
Gentlewoman we shall all be satisfied,
dicit Baeontus De Book-Worms.
"What a sight o' Books 1" cries the
Baron, remembering the olever Parrot
who uttered a similar exclamation at a
Parrot Competition. First, here is Blossom Land and Fallen Leaves,
by Clement Scott, published, by Hutchinson & Co., which is an
interesting and useful book to those who are able to take a holiday in
Cromer, and marvel at the sunset, and notice how " in the far distance
a couple of lovers advance towards the fading light "—I '11 be bound
that deeply engaged couple didn't catch sight of the "chiel takin'
notes"—and now did he know for certain they were a couple of
lovers? Why not brother and sister P Why not husband and wife?
Why not uncle and aunt ?—but with an experienced eye the canny
Scott made a pretty shrewd guess—and it is'a pleasant companion,
is this book, to those who cannot visit Cromer, or any of the
other places mentioned in Blossom Land, and who reading it at
home will only wish they could do so, and will promptly make
arrangements for paying (the "paying" is the difficult part) a
visit not only to Cromer but also to Caen, Etretat, Cabourg,—care-
fully noting C. S.'s account of his "cruise upon wheels, and his
sensible remarks on Parisianising these otherwise tranquil resorts.
From Havre to Hammersmith is a bit of a jump, but it is from a bustling
port to a peaceful spot—" a Harbour of Refuge" at Nazareth, where
the Baron sincerely trusts the good Little Sisters of the Poor are no
longer Poor-rated £120 per annum, just by way of parochial
encouragement, I suppose, to other charitable persons lor relieving the
parish of an incubus of four hundred." The work of these self-
sacrificing women cannot be over-rated in one sense, but in the
parochial sense (if paroohials have any] they can hardly be rated
enough. Really a delightful book for all comers and goers.
"What have we here P" inquires the Baron—Seven Summers, An
Eton Medley, by the Editors of the Parachute and Present Etonian.
Now, Heaven forgive my ignorance, but I have never seen the
Parachute nor the Present Etonian, so without prejudice I dip into
this book, and am at once muoh interested and amused by a paper 1' On
Getting Up." Not " getting up " linen, or " getting up lessons," but
getting up in the morning, ever a hard-worker's hardestltask. It will
remind many a middle-aged Etonian of the days when he was very
young, and early school was very early. "The Inner Man" is
another amusing paper, and forty years has made no alteration in
the "sock-cad." American slang has evidently tinged Etonian style.
"What in the name of purple thunder," and "in the name of
spotted Moses," and so forth, are Americanisms, and the tone of
these two smart Etonian writers has a certain Yankee ring in it. Why
not leave this sort of thing to Mask Twain, Beet Haute & Co..
who are past masters of their own native slang P Seven Summers will
interest and amuse Etonians of all ages.
And here, attracted by a quaintly-designed cover, the Baron
takes up Ballad* from Punch, and other Poems, by Warham
St. Leo eh, published by David Stott. That a considerable number
of these have appeared in Mr. Punch's pages, by whose kind per-
mission they are reprinted, is quite sufficient guarantee for their
excellence. The Lay of the Lost Critic, The Plaint of the Grand
Piano, are capital specimens of the authors humour, and Christmas
Eve of his true pathos. No influence of American humour visible
in any of these. As a rule, the Baron doesn't recommend betting,
but advises his readers to go in for this St. Leger.
The contents of The Universal Review this month are varied,
interesting, but not sensational. The article on Westminster Abbey,
by Frederick Geoboe Lee, D.D., with its humorous notes and
observations, will have a charm for many readers, and so will that
on the painter Bernardino Luini. The novel entitled, The Wages
of Sin, is now at the first chanter of the fifth book, and there is an
illustration representing a lady in a Victoria pulling up in Waterloo
Place. Underneath is the legend—" She leaned forward smiling,
beckoning as the Victoria drew up against the curb." First, she is
not leaning forward; secondly, she doesn't appear to be "smiling;"
thirdly, she doesn't seem to be " beckoning;" and, fourthly, though
the horse is being pulled back, probably on the "ourb," yet, if the
author means that the carriage is being pulled up against the pave-
ment, then why didn't he say so, and write it "kerbP" I like
being a trifle hyperoritioal just now and then, says
The Baron de Book-Worms.
AN INTERNATIONAL HERO.
There has been recently a discussion in The World as to where Cox
and Box (for which Sir Arthur wrote some of his best music) first
saw the light. It was decided in favour of the Librettist at whose
residence the Triumviretta was given privately, in presence of a dis-
tinguished audience. But there was one person who might have
given invaluable evidence, and that was Box himself. Why did he
not step forward P Where was he? The explanation is given in the
Paris Figaro of Thursday, July 17:—
"M. Box, le nouvcau Ministre d'Haiti a Paris, a Hi recu hier matin par
le President de la Bipublique."
Of course, Cox will receive an appointment. Perhaps M. Box
banks at Cox's. Will Sergeant-Major Bouncer be gazetted to the
Hayti'eth Regiment P Whatever may be in store for these immortal
personages, it is satisfactory to know that, for the present, Box at
least is provided for. It was like his true British nature not to
disguise his identity under some suoh gallioised form of his name as
Boite, or Loos. There is, perhaps, no surname in our language so
truly national as Box. "John Box" might well be substituted for
"John Bull." It is characteristic of our British pugilism.
Vive M. Box!
IN THE KNOW.
{By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)
Various events are approaching, and it is only fair that I should
give the readers of this Journal the benefit of my advice and my
opinions. In good time I shall have something to say about Good'
wood—something that will make the
paleolithic cauliflower-headed dispensers
of buncombe and bombast sit up and
curse the day on which fate allowed
them to be born. There are some who
profess to attach importance to the goose-
billed moutbings and vapourings of the
butter-brained crew who follow in the
wake of the most notorious professor of
humbugging pomposity that even this
age, rich as it is in putty-faced impos-
tors, has ever produced. Well, let
them. For my own part I follow the advice of the French King to
the beautiful Marquise de Cent amours. "Sire." the Marquise is
reported to have said, "quelle heure est-ilt" To which the witty
monarch at once replied, "Madame, si vous avez besoin de savoir
I'heure, allez done la demander au premier gendarme f" The story
may be found with others in the lately published memoirs of Madame
de Sansfaqon. In a similar spirit I answer those who pester me
about horses.
I understand that Barrister Bill, Sidesplitter, and Fiery Harry,
showed up excellently at Newmarket last week. I have always
prophesied well of these three splendid animals, who take their feeds
as regularly, and with as much gusto as they gallop a mile on
heather when the barometer points to set fair. At the same time I
consider that only a papoose, made of string and sawdust, would give
more than £10,000 for any one of them.
Complaints have reached me that some of my remarks have given
pain in an exalted quarter. It is the common lot of those who are
honest to be misunderstood, and, for myself, I wish to claim no
exemption from the rule. My one aim is to benefit my readers, and
to advance truth. For this I would sacrifice 'the smiles of Courts,
and incur the shallow sneers of the grovelling, chowder-headed
horde of flunkeys who sit in high places. My work bears witness to
my merit. Need I say more P

"TOO MANY COOKS!"
A Srtt-Harteuh Ballad.
Moral Bill Buttons sings: —
I bbstdk at Greenland* (Henley), and my name is Moral Bill;
I'm a model of well-meaning, which makes up for want of skill;
And I '11 tell, in simple language, what I know about the shine
Which demoralised our kitchen, and which bust up our Big Dine.
Bat first I would remark that it is not a prudent plan
Tor any culinary gent to flout his fellow-man;
And, if a colleague can't agree with his peculiar whim,
IV yait on that same colleague, and trip up the heels of him.
Now nothing could be nieer, or more beautiful to see.
Than the first three years' proceedings of our Cooks (and we had
Till Joachim (of Goshen) made a dish (of devilled bones), [three),
Which he flaunted in the face of Arthur B. with swelling tones.
Then Arthur made an entrSe; he constructed it with care,
And he vowed that e'en Apicius would have owned it rich and rare.
And when Joachim protested that V soup first" was a fixed rule,
Arthur B. insinuated that his colleague was a mule.
And then he smiled a languid smile; sneering was Arthur's fault,
And he had one squinny snigger which was worse than an assault.
He was a most sarcastic man, this languid Arthur B..
And he aimed at being Chef, whioh Jokim said was fiddlededee.
Now I hold it's not the duty of a culinary gent
To say his colleague is a Moke—at least to all intent;
Nor should the individual who happens to be meant
Reply by chucking crockery to any great extent.
Then Number Three Cook tried to raise an ill-done rati, when
He tripped o'er Arthur's heels, and fell upon his abdomen;
And presently the various plats were mingled on the floor;
And the subsequent proceedings let us draw a curtain o'er.
For in less time than I write it every Cooky dropped his dish,
And our menu was as muoked as our worst enemy could wish;
And the way those Cookies chivied in their anger was a sin,
And the only dinner left 'em was the cheese—which I took in.
And this is all I have to say concerning this sad spill;
For I live at Greenlands (Henley), and my name is Moral Bill;
And I've told in simple language all 1 know about the shine
That demoralised our kitohen, and upset the year's Big Dine!
A SWEET HOME FOR NANCY.
Dear Mr. Punch,—The other evening, wishing to enjoy a little
music, I went to the Lyric Theatre, and found that the opera chosen
for performance was called Sweet Nancy, founded upon a novel
with some similar title by Miss Rhoda Bboughton. The prettiest
tune I heard was one that I fancy had been played before, and my
belief is the stronger as Mr. Henry Neville referred to it as "a
dear old song." It had to do with "Darby and Joan," and
reminded me of J. L. Molloy's delightful song with that title. The
rest of the music was not very striking. Even to those who hold
that the plot of an Opera is only of secondary importance. Sweet
Nancy could not have appeared to be exactly teeming with incidents
However, it was very nioely played by Miss Hughes, and that now
mature Lancashire Lad, the aforesaid Henry Neville. Without
declaring that I should like to see it every evening for a thousand
years (whioh I believe is a facon de parler even in China), I
certainly could sit it out again. If I wished to be a fault-finder I
should say that the pieoe is too long, and seems all the longer because
some of the characters are supposed to represent sohoolboys, and a
girl of thirteen. The adapter is Mr. Buchanan—a poet and a play-
wright. This gentleman. I believe, has made many other pieces
(more or less) his own, with (more or less) success. He seems to have
a knack of turning old plays into new ones. I live in hope that
when I next visit this great Metropolis I shall find that he has
re-written the School for Scandal, and brought Hamlet up to date.
Yours always, A Critic from the ConirrRY.

THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.
Monday to Saturday.—Nothing particular this week. Second
July Meeting at Newmarket took a lot of people away, and the
thunder, haiL and rain frightened a lot more away on Thursday, so
may as well discuss Esmeralda, which I hadn't time to do last week.
Bather a mixed affair to start with when you have a Frenoh libretto,
set by an English Composer, and played at the Royal Italian Opera,

The Hanging Committee.
Covent Garden. No matter. A big suooess for everyone concerned,
from Dkdkiolantjs downwards. No one could have wished for a
better Es m eraldi i than Madame Mem a, though she did not make
the most of that first charming song, 12 Hirondelle." One
Swallow, however, doesn't make an Opera, and Madame Melba
scon pulled herself together, and threw herself into the work when
she saw Mons. J fa n t>e Res zee, as Phoebus, winning fresh laurels.
The Quasimodo of M. Dufriche, of the Vibrato school, was
dram atically good, but not great; but Claude Frollo was both great
and good. These two have been defrauded of their rights by the
undramatic Librettist, who has _ done about as little as possible
with the excellent materials at his command. What a scene might
have been the final one between Quasimodo and Claude, when
Claude Frollo is pitched over the battlements. I forget what
becomes of Quasi; but if he stabs himself, or is stabbed, that would
be quite sufficient for dramatic justice and effect. Then, of course,
the absurd ceremony used by Clopin, and the real unwillingness of
Esmeralda to become Qringotre's wife, would dispose of the marriage,

How it Ought to have Ended.
Mr. Justice Butt pronounces a decree of divorce. Phoebus marries Esmeralda.
Claude Frollo is smashed, and Quasimodo is stabbed.
unless Oringoire were previously got rid of (for I don't remember
how the novel ends) and Esmeralda would be united ,to Phmbus,
while Fleur-de-Lys could marry He Chevreuse, or anybody else.
The Goat, too, has a wretched part: to be left out after the first
scene is too bad. Something might have been done with him, if
he had only been put into a chaise; but perhaps Esmeralda and
Phoebus reserve him for further use in the course of a couple of
years or so, when Djali, drawing a goat-chaise containing a little
Esmeralda and a little Phmbus, followed by a nurse and Papa and
Mamma, would make a sensation at some fashionable seaside resort.
Mons. Montariol played and sang well as Oringoire, and Mons.
WrsociBADOFF was most artistic as Clopin. Amusing to see Mons.
Lumu as Claude Frollo, melodramatically hiding behind the
window-curtains, just as Phmbus enters the room followed by
Esmeralda. So evidently was the curtain shaken, that Phmbus
would most cer-
tainly have de-
tected the sneak,
or he might have
asked Esmeralda,
"What's that?'1
and have asserted
his belief that it
could not possibly
be the cat, but he
might have ac-
cepted her ex-
planation had she
informed him that
it was the Goat.
What a chance
here lost for a
situation of the
Goat behind cur-
tains butting
Claude Frollo!
However, it was
all "purtendin',"
and Jean be
Rebzke as
Phmbus didn't
see what he would
most certainly
have noticed immediately had he been himself. Magnificently got up;
mise-en-scene excellent; band and chorus all that could be wished.

The Qoat. "I ought to have the second principal part
in this Opera. If they don't produce Dinorah, I snail
give notice. Too bad of Goring Thomas. If I see him
alone, I '11 show him what' Butting' Thomas is."
BULLY FOR THE COLONEL!
"The Hon. Member had availed himself of the privilege accorded to
Members of Parliament in debate to fire a shameful barbed arrow at Colonel
Caddell, in order that some of the mud might stick."—Colonel Saunderson
in the House of Commons.
Come, listen to my story; it's a sort of shilling-shock tale,
With no end of fire and fury, and a modicum of blood,
And a Colonel who mixed metaphors as Yankees mix a cocktail,
And a quiverful of arrows, shameful arrows, barbed with mud.
It was Dillon who had used them, and he spoke of Tipperary,
Tipperary new and rentless, where the tenants have combined.
And the Parnellites were gathered like the chicks of Mother Caret,
When they feel the tempest rising, and give warning of the wind.
And the pale and angry Tories sat impatient of the battle.
And the benches of the Commons, where they love a fight, grew
full;
And, although they knew 'twas better not to hurry people's cattle,
They implored their fiery Colonel to oblige them with a bull.
But the Colonel needs no prompting, straight rises to address them,
And his eye now flames in fury, and now twinkles like a star;
And he turned on Mr. Parnell's men, and didn't rightly bless
_ them,
This flashing, dashing, slashing militaire from North Armagh.
And before a man could whistle there were ructions and denials,
Shouts and oountershouts of anger—quite a House of Commons
scene;
While the Colonel, who had bottled all bis wrath, poured out the vials
On the heads of Irish gentlemen whose wigs were on the green.
'T was in vain they sought to daunt him; like a flock of noisy sparrows
When a hawk comes grimly swooping, or like moths that tempt
the wick,
So they scattered when the Colonel told the House of shameful arrows,
Which were fired (I quote the Colonel) in the hope that mud might
stick.
When Sir Boyle, the ever famous, smelt a rat (you've heard the
story)—
Saw it floating in the air. he promptly nipped it in the bud;
But I think our modern Colonel gets the greater share of glory
For inventing shameful arrows that could only spatter mud.
And, oh, ye sons of Erin, when the coat-tails next are trailing,
Make your weapons on this pattern, think of S atjndebson, his bull;
And no mother's son will suffer, though the missiles should come
hailing,
If you only use mud-arrows, or shillelaghs made of wool I
Devotjt Wish of Irish Landlords for Mr. Baxfoub,—'
his shadowing never grow less!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A New Subscriber to The
Morning Pott.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FEOM THE DIABT OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 14. — Government Main
narrowly escaped defeat. Last time it was Ascot; this time Marl-
borough House Garden Party. "This Session," says T. Harring-
ton, "I've taken to subscribing' to
The Morning Post; study its fashion-
able news; look out for arrangements
likely to draw men away from House;
then me and Saor put our heads to-
gether; arrange for Division; take it
smart, and Government left in lurch."
To-day opportunity found in Motion
for Select Committee on constitution
of Scotch Committee. Akfrs-Pouglas
proposed twenty-one members, all Scotch
but one. "Let us have the lot Scotch,"
says Robertson; moves Amendment
accordingly. House pretty full, know-
ing crisis at hand; Government Whips
scouting for Members.
"Tell you what I'll do," says Pbn-
bosb Fitzgerald to Akkrs-Docglas;
"I hate garden-parties and that sort
of thing, but as we shall he in a hole
if Division now rushed. I'll take cab,
run up to Marlborough House, fetch
down some men; inconvenient, you
know; works against grain; would
rather be down here helping you than
mingling in glittering throng; but, as
the Governor says, duty is our load-
star; say the word, and I'll go off to
Pall Mail and fetch a lot down."
"FlTZGEBALD," Said AKEBS-DorGLAS,
wringing his hand, "(you're a brick.
You always think of the right thing,
and are ready to do it."
Douglas paused to wipe away tear
drawn from his sensitive glands by this evidence of self-saorifioe,
When he *'
ing figure
pants; white waistcoat; me snort "reeter," tamUiar in the Lobby,
oast aside for the courtly frock coat: observed him as he strode
forth, producing pair of lavender kid gloves.
"Odd," said Douglas, reflectively. "Fitzgerald never expected
to go to Garden Party; down here to help me; sudden emergenoy,
and spirit of self-devotion, suggested to nim to run over, and see
what could be done'; happy chance to find him, by exception, in the
right rig. It would never have done for him to rush over to Marl-
borough House to meet the Queen in his 'reefer.' Curious, when
I come to think of it. Hope there's not
more in it than meets the eye."
But there was.
Debate on Robertson's Amendment
abruptly closed; Division rushed; position
of Government critioal; Akbbs-Douglajs
anxiously on look-out for Fitzgerald and
the Malborough House relief party; but
they came not, and on Division Govern-
ment saved by skin of teeth and eight votes.
An hour later, Penrose Fitzgerald re-
turn rdJto Lobby with guilty look; carefully
avoided Akebs-Douglas; that able captain
too broken-hearted at the perfidy to be
angry; "Noah's dove didn't treat
him so," he said to himself; but all
he said to Fitzgebald was, " Pleasant
Party at Malborough House, I sup-
pose?" "Yee-es," said Fitzgbbalb;
rather; couldn't get back quite as
soon as I expected."
Business done, — Irish Votes in
Supply.
Tuesday,—Regular set-to of Irish
Members on Prince Arthur. Mad-
den gallantly threw himself across
body of his chief, but got such
fearful pummelling retired into silence for rest of sitting. What
made it worse for Arthur was Chairman's ruling; pulled him
up more than once amid loud cheers from Opposition. Trie Hbalt
on war-path; quotes Tbnnyson with odd variation; represents Prinoe
Abthub as saying of Irish Members, "You have not got the pose

lively; grow a little monotonous after first five hours. Met Stuart
hurrying off, humming to himself the air, "Haste to the Wedding,"
"Aren't you going to stay for division Y" I asked.
"No," said he. "I mustered; strikes only on the box; when you
ask for it, see that you get it; none other genuine. Have an im-
portant engagement to-morrow morning. If you 're waking Colman
early, Colm an early, Toby dear."
Stared at this incoherent speech; thought at first he was mad Or
had dined. 'Then I remembered that to-morrow, at Norfolk, he
marries Miss Colm an.
Business done.—More Irish Votes.
Thursday,—E pur si muove: that is to say, it will move; they '11
all move, in spite of Bra m. well. London, probably, the only popu-
lation in the world that possesses the supernatural patienoe necessary
to submit to having its movements obstructed by bars and gates put
up across some of its principal thoroughfares. Oddly enough, they
oongregate round congeries of Railway Stations in the North. To-
day, Rosbbebt in Lords moves Second Reading of Bill designed
to nave them swept away. B ram well protests. "Speaking,"
he said. "in name of over two hundred people who live in district
affected by the Bill, I ask your Lordships to reject it." This
too much even for House of Lords. That alleged luxury of two
hundred people should weigh against convenience of the population
of London was a little monstrous. B ram well kept his countenance
admirably. Lord Chancellor looked on admiringly.
"That's the man for me, Toby," he said. "If we could only have
a House of Lords all B ram wells, with me on Woolsack, we 'a make
Old England onoe more a merry spot."
Rest of House, however, would not enter into joke. Makkiss
admitted that, being a constant passenger by Great Northern Rail-
way, he generally said a dam" when passing these gates. This
felt to be a shocking state of things. Gates and bars must be bundled
off, if only to prevent use of bad language by Prime Minister.
Bramwell reluctantly admitted this, still pleading with touching
eloquence for preservation of the obstruction.
"My Lords," he said, "think of what you're doing to this great
capital, of which we are all so justly proud. The Tower has become
a disused place, and its historic nill no more reverberates to the merry
chopping of the headsman's axe. Temple Bar has gone, and long
ago have vanished the heads that used to look wistfully down on the
passing chairmen. The chairmen themselves have sped into eternity,
and in their place circles the Hansom
cab. No more does the lovely, lonely
oil lamp swing at the corners of our
streets. Your Lordships can wend
your way homeward as far West as
Kensington, or as far North as High-
bury, without meeting the casual
footpad. The town is drained; the
river is embanked; our streets are
paved; and we have a penny post.
Almost all that is left to us of the
good old times -are these bars, arbi-
trarily set up across our thoroughfare,
watched by a gentleman in a seedy
suit, and a rain-beaten hat girt with
tarnished golden lace. I beseech your
Lordships, by your memories of in-
fancy, by your love of our old Con-
stitution, by the faith of your Order,
by your fidelity to your Sovereign, to
spare these last lingering relics of the
London that helped to make our
Empire great."
House plainly touched at this out-
burst of eloquence. Lord Bangor
closed his eyes, and clasped his hands,
as if in Church. If there can be any
arrangement made in Committee by
which the gates and bars, after removal, may be placed in con-
venient order round Bramwell's residence, so that he shall be forced
to make ditours as he goes about his daily business, it shall be done.
With this understanding, Amendment withdrawn, and Bill read
Second Time.
Business done,—In Commons, more about Irish Votes.
Friday.—Vote for Irish Prisons Board on in Committee of Supply.
Interesting conversation between Prinoe Abthub and recent inmates
of the prisons. 0' Bbi kn protests that the treatment was abominable.
Prince Abthub cites O'B. 8 personal appearance in proof that things
are not so bad as they are painted. "Four times you've been in
prison," he urged, "and see how well you look." Dillon takes
objection to the prison garb; discloses strong yearning to see Prinoe
Abthub arrayed in it. Abthub quite content with his present
tailor. SnAw-Lf j evre joins in conversation; Abthub looks at him
longingly. "They say we shan't be in (ffloe another year, Toby,"

"As if in Church."

A SPORTING STYLE.
(With Examples.)
Prefatory Note.—It is a common mistake to suppose that the
§resent generation frowns upon the literary achievements of the
esoriptive reporter who chronicles the great deeds of athletes, oars-
men, pugilists, and sportsmen generally.
On the contrary, if we may pretend to
judge from a wide and long-continued
study, we should say that the vales tacer
of the present day, though he may not
^ • yf f rival his predecessors in refinement and

classical allusion, is by no means inferior
to them in wealth of language and
picturesque irrelevancy. Sporting re-
porting, in fact, was never more of a
fine art, and on the whole has rarely
been better paid, than it is at the
present day. In the hope that many a young journalist may be
helped in his struggle for fame and fortune, Mr. Punch proposes to
publish a short manual of sporting reports, with examples and short
notes, that may explain the technique of the business to the aspirant.
Rules.
1. Always remember that you are a sporting reporter, and be as
sportive as you can. The dig-in-the-ribB and ohuok-her-under-the-
ohin style is always effective.
2. Speak of everybody by his Christian name or his nick-name.
3. If you think a man ought to have a nickname, invent one for him.
4. Employ stock quotations wherever they are least required, and
give a music-hall flavour to every report.
5. If possible, misquote.
6. Avoid all simple language.
7. Patronise all titled sportsmen, and pat wealthy bookmakers on
the back.
8. Never miss an opportunity of showing that you are on familiar
terms with the sun, moon, rain, wind, and weather, in general. Do
this, as a rule, by means of classical tags vulgarised down to the
level of a costermonger's cart.
9. Spin out your sentences.
10. Mix up your metaphors, moods, tenses, singulars, plurals, and
the sense generally.
11. Refer often to "the good old days" you don't remember, and
bewail the decadence of sport of all kinds.
12. Occasionally be haughty and contemptuous, and make a parade
of rugged and incorruptible honesty. In short, be as vain and offen-
sive as you can.
13. Set yourself up as an infallible judge of every branoh of sport
and athletics.
First Example.—Event to be reported: An American pugilist
arrives at Euston, and is received by his English friends and sym-
pathisers.
O'FLAHERTY IN ENGLAND.
Arrival of the Champion. His Reception.
What he Thinks of England.
It was somewhere towards "the witching hour of noon" that the
broad and splendid artery of commerce, to wit, the Euston Road,
became, for the nonce, a scene of unwonted, and ever-increasing
excitement. Old Flu* had promised, as per Admiral Fitzroy's
patent hocus-pocusser, to give us a taste of his quality ; and it is un-
necessary, in this connection, to observe that the venerable disciple
of Swithin the Saint was as good as his word. But Britons never
never shall be slaves. England expected every man to do his duty.
Forward the Light Brigade, and so on to where glory and an express
train were waiting, or would be waiting, before you had time to
knock a tenpenny nail on the head twice. The company on the
platform comprised the elite of the sporting world. "Bluff" Tommy
Pofpin, the ever courteous host of "The Chequers," "Bill"
Tootwon, by his friends yclept the Masher, Jake Rt/mbelo, the
middle-weight World's Champion, were all there, wreathed in Bilvery
smiles, and all on the nod, on the nod, on the nod, as the poet hath
it, though why "hath it" no man can tell, in words that will last
while Old Sol, the shiner, drives his spanking tits along the azure
road. Punctual to the moment the train steamed into the station,
and the giant form of O'Flahertt. the "man in a million," leaped
out of the railway carriage, amid the plaudits of all the blue blood
of England's sports. In answer to inquiries the Champion laughingly

said, "he guessed this was a mighty wet country for a dry man,"
and proceeded to the refreshment-room, where he "asked a p'leece-
man"—oh no, not at all, but, "Deep as the rolling Zuyder Zee, he
drank the foaming juice of Grapes. Thence a move was made to
the palatial office of the Sporting Standard, where the Champion
was introduced to the Staff. Hands all round followed, and a
glorious day wound up with a visit to the theatrical resorts of the
latter-day Babylon, in company with some of the right sort, though
these be getting both fewer and farther between than in the good
old days.
AUSTRALIA AT ST. PAUL'S.
[On the 17th of July the Earl of Rosebery unveiled a Memorial erected
in St. Paul's Cathedral to the late Right Hon. William Beds Dallet, of
New South Wales, mainly through whose personal exertions, when Chief
Secretary to the Ministry there, the Colonial Contingent was dispatched to the
aid of England in the Soudan. This, as Lord Rosebery said, is the first Me-
morial which has been erected to a Colonist in our Metropolitan Cathedral.]
The mighty Empire reared upon the main, _
He "cherished, served, and laboured to maintain."
And who will doubt the claim by this made good
To neighbouring Nelson, and our Collinqwood?
His country holds her loyal son's remains;
But here, whilst Wren's huge dome rolls back the strains
Of the great organ's golden mouths, or while
Pcean or requiem sounds along the aisle
Sacred to mighty memories, Dalley's name

YERY MUCH AT SEA.
As there appears to be some confusion with regard to the exact
nature of the programme scheme for the forthcoming Naval Autumn
Manoeuvres, the following sketch, gleaned from recent inquiry on
the subject made at Whitehall,
may, if he can manage to follow
it, possibly serve to enlighten the
uninitiated outsider.
An enemy's fleet, having, it is
supposed, escaped the vigilance of
the Channel Squadron, consisting
of H.M. First-class Battle-ship
Blunderer, accompanied by the
third-class cruiser Jack-att, and
the torpedo-boats Corkscreio and
Tooth-brush, whioh, also it is
supposed, represent a fleet of
thirty-six iron-clads, twenty-six
armoured cruisers, attended by
fifty torpedo vessels, have sailed
victoriously up the Thames, and,
having seized the Serpentine,
command the, equally supposed, Milk Supply of Bayswater, Pad-
dington, and the whole of the North of London. This news having
been oonveyed to another fancied fleet that is covering a oonvoyof
ships, imagined to be attempting to land corn, that they have brought
from ports across the Atlantic, simultaneously at Peg well Bay,
Margate, and the Isle of Dogs, it is again supposed that, acting
under sealed orders, they elude the enemy, and dividing their forces,
make for Gravesend, Liverpool, Dundee, "The Welsh Harp" at
Hendon, and Yarmouth. The problem, therefore, presented to
Admiral Flyoff. who is in command of the defending squadrons,
will be, after utilising the supposed coast defenoes, and mining the
Serpentine, to force the enemy to accept the issue of an open action
on the Regent's Canal, and the Ornamental Water at the Crystal
Palace. Failing this, it will be left to the Umpires, who, being sup-
posed to be in several places at the same time, will be provided with
a tricycle, fog-horn, and telescope, to enable them to adiudge the
exact amount of success or failure following respectively on each
effort, with as near a resemblance as is possible to the probable issues
in real warfare. Any matters remaining in dispute and undecided,
will be ultimately settled by the First Lord, who will toss up with a
two-headed halfpenny, specially provided for, in the Estimates, for
the purpose.
A glance at the above will show that the scheme, though simple in
conception, may easily beoome complicated; but if kept in view,
with an accompanying reference to the daily letters of the Corre-
spondents of five Penny Papers, by anyone, who will further pick
out the names and positions of plaoes named, and mark them with
pins on the Railway Map attached to BradthauPt Guide, it may
serve to throw some light on the course of events, and leave the
inquiring investigator, though still very much at sea, yet in
sion of some scraps of useful information.

EGBERT'S AMERICAN ACQUAINTANCE.
Mr akwaintance among eminent selebraties seems to be rapidly
en creasing. Within what Amlet calls a week, a little week, after
my larst intervue with the emenent young Swell as amost lost his
art to the pretty Bridesmade, I have been onored with the most
cordial notice of a werry emenent Amerrycane, who cums to Lundon
wunce ewery year, and makes a good long stay, and alius cums to
one or other of our Grand Otels. He says he's taken quite a fansy
to me, and for this most singler reason. He says as 1 'm the ony
Englishman as he has ewer known who can alius giv a answer rite
off to ewery question as he arsks me! So much so, that he says as
how as I ort to be apinted the Guide. Feelosofer, and Frend of
ewery one of the many Wisiters as we alius has a staying here!
Well, all 1 can say is, that if I affords the heminent Amerrycane
jest about hart the fun and emusement as he does me, I must be a
much cleverer feller than I ewer thort myself, or than my hotter harf
ewer told me as I was. Ah, wouldn't he jest make her stare a bit
if she herd sum of his most owdaoious sayings. Why, he acshally
says, that the hole system of marrying for life is all a mistake, and
not consistent with our changable nature! And that we ort to
take our Wives on lease, as we does our houses, wiz., for sewen or
fourteen years, and that in a great 'majority of cases they woud
both be preshus glad when the end of the lease came! And he tries
werry hard to make me bleeve, tho in course he doesn't succeed,
that in one part of his grate and staggering Country, ewery body
does jest as he likes in these rayther himportant matters, and has
jest as many Wives as he can afford to keep, and that the King of
that place has about a dozen of 'em! Ah, if you wants to hear a
reel downright staggerer as nobody carnt posserbly bleeve, don't
"ask the Pleaceman," but arsk an Amerrycane 1
He wanted werry much to go to Brighton, and see our new Grand
Metropole Otel opened last Satterday; so I spoke to our most gentle-
manly Manager, and he gave him a ticket that took him down first-
class, and brort him back, and took him into the Otel, and supplied
him with heverythink as art ooud wish for, or supply, and as muoh
Sham pane as he could posserbly drink—and, when there ain't
nothink to pay for it, it's reelly estonishing what a quantity a
gennelman can dispose of ;and the way in which he afterwards
told me as he showed his grattitude for what he called a reel first-
dasB heavening's enjoyment was, to engage a delicious little sweet of
apartments for a fortnite, so we shall see him no more for that
length of time. He told me as he had seen all the great Otels of
I'rope and Amerrykey, but he was obligated to confess, in bis own
emphatic langwidge, that the Brighton Metropole "licked all
creation!" I didn't quite understand him, but I've no doubt it
was intended as rayther complimentary. He rayther staggered me
by asking what it cost, but I was reddy with my anser, and boldly
said, jest exaoly a quarter of a million.
He told me that, in his own grand country, he was ginerally re-
garded as a werry truthful man, which, of course, I was pleased to
hear, for sum of his statements was that: staggering as wood have
made me dowt it in a feller-countryman. For hinstance, he acshally
tried to make me bleeve that his Country is about 20 times as big as
ours 1 Well, in course, common politeness made me pretend to
bleeve him, speshally as he's remarkable liberal to me, as most of
his countrymen is, but I coudn't help thinking as it woud have been
wiser of him if he had made his werry long Bow jest a leetle shorter.
He's a remarkabel fine-looking gennelman, and his manners quite
comes up to my description. Robert.
A LYRIC FOR LOWESTOFT.

Henry Irving, will the Master feel the fierce and bracing breeze,
As you wander by the margin of the restless Eastern seas?
Save the seagull slowly swirling

Learn how dark the life that ended in
the fatal "Kelpie's Flow."
'Mid the murmur of the ocean you will
tell how Edgar felt
When his Lucy broke her troth-plight,
and he flung down Craigengelt.
Fitting place for actor's study, all that
long and lonely shore;
Yonder point methinks [as Wolfs Crag
should be known for evermore.
Henceforth will the place be haunted
when the midnight hour draws nigh:
Men shall see the Master standing stem
against the stormy sky.
Faint, impalpable as shadow from the cloudland, Lucy there
Shall keep tryst; the moon's effulgence not more golden than her hair.
And, in coming nights of Autumn, when the vast Lyceum rings
With reverberating plaudits, and the town thy praises sings,
Memories of the sands at Lowestoft shall be with you ere you sleep;
In your ears once more shall echo diapason of the deep.

A leader on

In this hard

Remember-
ing these
strange
tales
Of woman's miseries in every land,
I saw wherever poverty draws breath
Woman and anguish walking hand in hand,
The dreary road to death.
Those pallid tempstresses of Hood's great
Bong
Peopled the hollow dark, not now alone,
And 1 heard sounds of insult, shame, and
wrong,
And griefs sad monotone,
From hearts, like flints, beaten by tyrant
hoofs;
And I saw orowds in sombre sweating-dens,
With reeking walls and dank and dripping
roofs—
Fit scarce for styes or pens.
Heath at home's sin-stained threshold;
honour's tall [hold pet,
Dislodging from her throne love s house-
And wan-faced purity a tyrant's thrall,
With wild eyes sorrow-wet.
And unsexed women faoing heated blasts
And Tophet fumes, and fluttering tongues
of fire;
And virtue staked on most unholy oasts,
And honour sold for hire:
Squidrons and troops of girls of brazen air,
Tramping the tainted city to and fro,
With feverish fUuntings veiling chill despair
And deeply-centred woe.
So shape chased shape. I saw a neat-garbed
nurse,
Wan with exoessive work; and, bowed
with toil,
A shop-girl sillily, of the primal curse
Eich looked tha helpless spoil.
Anon I saw a lidy, at night's fall
Stiller than chiseled marble, standing
there;
A daughter of compassion, slender, tall,
And delicately lair.
Her weariness with shame and with surprise
My spirit shooked: she turning on my face
The heavy glances of unrested eyes,
Spoke mildly in her place.
"I have long duties; ask thou not my name
S>me siy I fret at a fair destiny.
Many I have to tend; to make my claim
Some venture: we shall see."
"I trust, good lady, that in a fair field,_
The case 'twixt you and tyianny will be
tried,"
I sai 1; then turning promptly I appealed
To one who stood beside.
Sha said, "Poor pay, .and plenteous fines,
and worse,

To insubordination I'm averse,
But have I not good oause?
"We are out off from hope in our hard place,

We strike for justice. Man might show some

Turning I saw, ranging a[flowery pile,
One sitting in an entry dark and cold;
A girl with hectic cheeks, and hollow smile;
Wired roses there she sold,
Or strove to sell; but often on her ear
The harrying voice of stem polioeiom
struck,
And chased her from her vantage, till]a tear
Fell at her "wretched luok."
Again I saw a wan domestic drudge
Scuttering across a smug suburban lawn;
Tired with the nightly watch, the morning
trudge,
The toil at early dawn.
And then a frail and thin-olad governess,
Hurrying to daily misery through the rain.
Toiling, with scanty food, and scanty dress,
Long hours for little gain.

To her dull garret-home through the chill

sound. As I said before, the only

structed in the game by a cele-
brated Midland half-back As in

of a foot-ball, use a fresh human
head, and in a scrimmage leave
half their number dead on the
field, by having recourse to the
'Kogo' or Spine Splitting
Stroke,' introduced from a local
athletio game, some excitement
will no doubt be manifested in
sporting circles when they m»et
the Clapham Hovers, as I believe,
it is arranged they shall do at the
Oval, early in November next."
Hats of the style of the earliest
portion of the Saxon Heptarchy
will not, after all. be seen in the
Row during this Season, though
several male leaders of fashion are
stated to have given orders for
them on an approvtd model.
MINE AND THINE.
[In a recent cave, a promoter of Gold Mining Companies was aaked if any of
lua Companies had ever paid a penny of dividend. His answer was, "You
cannot know much about gold minea to aak «uch a question." He admitted,
h"wcr. r, that he himself hud made some £50 000 out of them. "Tnis," he
said, "is not profit; it is the realisation of property."]
Take a patch of land in Africa and multiply by ten,
Then extract a ton of metal from an ounce or two of sand;
Write a roseate prospectus with a magnifying pen,
Making deserts flow with honey in a rich ana smiling land.
Take some crumbs of truth, and spread them with a covering of bosh,
And conceal them in a pie-crust labelled "Promises to pay ";
Hide away all dirty linen, or remove it home to wash.
And then begin the process which the wise ones call " Convey."
Next collect a band of brothers, all inspired by one desire.
To subserve the public interest, single-hearted men and true;
Stuff with shares, and thus permit them in your kindness to acquire,
At a price, the vendor's property,—the vendor being you.
Then, since you must make a profit, call the pnblic to your aid;
Let them give you all their money, which they think they only
And of course you mustn't tell them, till the fools have safely paid,
Mines were made for sinking money, not for raising dividend.
And the olergy bring their savings, the widows bring their store,
And they push to reach your presenoe, and they jostle and they
fall,
And at last they pile their money in a heap before your door;
And, just to make them happy, you accept and keep it all.
So you make your mine by begging—(modern miners never dig),—
And jcu float a gorgeous Company. The shares go spinning up;
But you never "rig the market." (What an awkward word is
"rig"!)
And you drain success in bumpers from an overflowing oup.
Then one day the thing gets shaky, and it goes from bad to worse,
And the public grasps a shadow where it tried to hold a share;
And in vain the oountry olergy most unolcrically curse,
You have "realited your property," and end a millionnaire.
COMING 8EA-SCRAPE3 AT CHELSEA.
{Drawn by an Insider.)
Mr. Po-nch, Sib,
That the sister Service should also have its turn at Chelsea
I reckon I can understand, and the Show ought to be popular; but
if the Admiralty want to make a further "exhibition" of them-
selves, they won't have to go very far a-field for material. Here are
one or two exhibits that come to hand at once. First, there's those bi g
guns which it ain't safe to fire nohow, and which, if you do load with
half a charge, crack, bend, and get sent back to be "ringed" up,
whatever that means, and are not safe, even for a salute, ever after-
wards. Then, in another case, they might show a foot or two of
that blessed boiler-piping which is always leaking, or splitting, or
bursting, just when it shouldn't. In a third they might display a
ohop that bad been cooked from lying exposed in one of those famous
stokeholes where the poor beggars of sailors are expected to pass their
time without getting roasted too. Then there might be, as a sort of
prize puzzle, a plan of these here recent manoeuvres, with the
Umpire's opinion of the whole blessed jumble tacked on to it. Then,
to enliven the proceedings. Lord George might take his turn with
the rest of the Admiralty Board, and give us, every half hour or so,
a figure or two of the Hornpipe, just to let the public see that they
have got some sort of nautical " go" about them to warrant them in
drawing their big screw. Bless you, Mr. Punch, there's lota to
make an Exhibition of at Chelsea next year if you come to calculate.
Leastways that's the opinion of your humble servant and admirer,
A Tax-paying Landlubber.

There he stood in his evening dress, with a half-smoked cigarette
between his lips. He had been knocking abont Piccadilly all day,
had dined at the Junior, looked, in at the Opera, and finished at the

most casual observer would have declared that
he could never have seen the inside of a barrack-
yard. So no surprise was expressed when the
question was asked him.
"What am I?" he repeated, languidly, and
then he replied, with a yawn, "Can t you see.
old Chappie? Why, an Officer in the Guards!"
The Good Form op thb Future.
There he stood in his neat, serviceable undress
uniform, with a cigar between his lips. He had
abandoned the swagger frogged coat] and silk
Bash for the unpretending patrol iaoket of his
brethren in the Line. He had been hard at
work all day in barracks, inspecting meals,
visiting the hospital, attending parades. He
had paid his company personally, had seen
every man, and found that there were no complaints. He had
attended a mesB meeting, and had dined at mess^playing a rubber
afterwards (sixpenny points) in the ante-room. He knew as muoh
about the internal economy of the Battalion as the Colonel, the
Adjutant, or the Sergeant-Major. He seemed a soldier of soldiers.
The most casual observer would have declared that he was acquainted
with every inoh of the barrack-yard. So general surprise was
expressed when the question was asked him.

—your delightful Sabrina!
Mr. T. Most gratified to hear it, I'm sure. I'm told there'a a
growing demand for it.
Mrs. M. G. Suoh a hopeful sign—when one was beginning quite
to despair of the puhlio taste I
Mr. T. Well, I've always said—So long as you give the Public
a really first-rate article, and are prepared to spend any amount of
money on pushing it, you know, you're sure to see a handsome
return for your outlay—in the long run. And you see, I've had
this carefully analysed by oompetent judges
Mrs. M. G. Ah, but you can feel independent of criticism, can't
you?
Mr. T. Oh, I defy anyone to find anything unwholesome in it—
it's as suitable for the most delioate ohild as it is for adults—nothing
to irritate the most sensitive
Mrs. M. G. Ah, you mean certain critics are so thin-skinned—
they are indeed 1
Mr. T. (warming to his subject). But the beauty of this particular
composition is that it causes absolutely no unpleasantness or inoon-
venienoe afterwards. In some cases, indeed, it aots like a charm.

pletely cured.
Mrs. M. G. (pother at sea). How gratifying that must be. But
that is the magio of all truly great work, it is suoh an anodyne—it
takes people so completely out of themselves—doesn't it?
Mr. T. It takes anything of that sort out of them, Ma'am. It's
the finest discovery of the age, no household will be without it in a
few months—though perhaps I say it who shouldn't.
Mrs. M. G. (stM more astonished). Oh, but I like to hear you.
I'm so tired of hearing people pretending to disparage what they
have done, it's such a pose, and I hate posing. Real genius is never
modest. (If he had been more retiring, she would have, of course,
reversed thts axiom.) I wish you would come and see me on one
of my Tuesdays, Mr. Tablett, I should feel so honoured, and I
think you would meet some congenial spirits—do look in some
evening—I will send you a card if I may—let me Bee^—could you
come and lunoh next Sunday? I've got a little man coming who was
very nearly eaten up by cannibals. I think he would interest you.

Phil, /never said he had written a book.

I've been praising it to him, entirely on your recommendation.
Phil. No, no—your mistake. I only asked you if you'd read
Sabrina's Uncle's Other Niece, and, as I made up the title on the
spur of the moment, I should have been rather surprised if you had.
He never wrote a line in his life.

Mr. Tablett, with her prettiest penitence, that she has only
just recollected that her luncheon party is put off, and that her

THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.
(Last Week of Opera.)
Monday.—Hamlet. Music by Ambroise Thomas, and libretto by
Messieurs Carre and Barrier, who seem to have read Hamlet once
through, after which they wrote down as a libretto what they remem-
bered of the story. It would be difficult to mention any Opera
less dramatic than this. The
question arises at once, adapting
the immortal phrase of Jakes
le Siffleub, "Why lug in
Hamlet t" Why not have oalled
it Ophelia t Whatever interest
there may be in the Opera—and
there is very little—is centred
entirely in Ophelia. The Ghost
is utterly purposeless, but of dis-
tinguished appearance as a robust
spectre, marching in at one gate,
and out at another, or hiding
behind a sofa, and popping up
suddenly, in order to frighten
an equally purposeless Hamlet.
Like father, like son. M. La s-
salle is a fine, substantial, bari-
tonial i Hamlet, who is always
posturing, weeping, calling out
ma mere, and blubbering on the
ample matronly bosom of his
mother, Madame Richard (" 0
RiciiArd! O ma Peine!") like a big, blubbering, overgrown
schoolboy. Were I inclined to disquisitionise, I should say that
Messieurs Carre and Barrier have actually realised Shakspeare's
own description of his jelly-fleshed hero, whose mind is as shaky as
his well-covered body. Hamlet was—as Shakspeare took care to
emphasise—"fat, and scant of breath"—which was the physical
description of the actor who first impersonated the leading role of
this play; and the French author's idea of Hamlet was, accordingly,
a fat youth, very much out of condition, home from Wittenberg
College, in consequence of his father's recent decease.
Some of the lighter musical portions of the Opera are oharming, and
the Chorus at the end of Act I. might have been written by Offenbach.
But what is there of the story P Nothing. The King is not killed:
the Queen isn't poisoned: Polonius is not stabbed behind the arras,
having been, perhaps, killed before the Opera commenced, since his
name appears in the book but not in the programme, and the only
person on the stage that I could possibly associate with that dear
old Lord Chamberlain was M. Miranda, who had donned a white

beard and a different robe from what he had been previously wear-
ing as Horatio in the First and Second Acta, in order to enter and
lead the King away, in an interpolated and ineffective scene which
was not in the book. A very hard-working Opera for the principals,
and a thankless
task. Hamlet's
drinking song
fine,* and finely
sung. But the
whole point of the
Opera is in the
last Act, where
there is a ballet
that has nothing
to do with the
piece, but pretty
to see little Pal-
ladino in short

in a forest glade,
among the nappy
peasantry, to
whom comes
Ophelia, mad as
several hatters,
and after a lunatic scene, charming, both musically and'dramatically,
throws herself into the water, and dies singing.
Here is a suggestion for the effective compression and reduction
of the Opera, and if my plan be accepted, Druriolanus will earn
the eternal gratitude of those who would like to hear all that is
good in it, and to skip, as Palladino does, the rest. Thus:—
ACT I.—Enter Hamlet. Solo. Exit. Enter Ophelia. Solo.
Re-enter Hamlet. Ophelia and Hamlet love-duet. Exit Ophelia.
Hamlet's Friends come in, and he sings them a Drinking Song with
Chorus. All join in Chorus and Dance. Curtain.
ACT II.—Opening Chorus (anything; it doesn't matter if it's only
pretty and bright). Enter Hamlet. Solo. "Etre, ou ne pas etre.
Enter Ophelia with book, pretends not to see Hamlet. Solo. Enter
Queen. Ophelia complains to her that Hamlet isn't behaving like a
gentleman, Queen upbraids Hamlet: so does Ophelia

Hamlet is out of it in the last Act. Why wasn't he
brought into the Ballet?

depressed. Exit Queen r.h. Exit Ophelia l.h. Hamlet remains,
evidently going mad. Palladino looks in. Dances. Hamlet joins
her. Enter Friends, Courtiers, Peasants, and other Friends. All
join in ballet, Hamlet included. Enter Keepers, and Hamlet is taken
off to Hanwellhagen, Ophelia rushes in, faints. Curtain.
ACT III.—Meadows near Hanwellhagen, in Denmark. Dance of
Lunatics, out for a holiday. To them enter Ophelia. All the
charming music, delightful, and, this being finished, she chucks her-
self away into the stream. Curtain.
Great call for everybody concerned. And, if the above scheme be
adopted, the Opera would be over before eleven, having begun at nine.
I present this with my compliments to Drubiolant/s and Ambroise
Thomas; and, if he is not'' a doubting Thomas," he will try this plan.
The remainder of the week passed away happily, so I hear, but
was not able to be in my place, as I was at somebody else's place
far, far away. The Opera has been, from the first, a big success.
Should like t o hear Masaniello once again. Perhaps that is a treat
in store for all of us. Thus ends the Opera-goer's Diary for 1890,
and everybody is highly satisfied and delighted. Curtain.

THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.
(Before Mr, Commissi oxer Punch.)
An Anglo-Indian Gentleman introduced.
The Commissioner. "Well, 8ir, What can I do for you?
Anglo-Indian. I wish respeotfully to call your attention. Sir, to
our ease, which is now before a Parliamentary Committee. I am an
Indian Civil Servant. I am called a
member of the Unoovenanted Service,
but I contend that such a term is a
misnomer. Originally the Unoove-
nanted Service consisted of Natives of
India, who were employed, without
covenant, to do subordinate official
work, under the direction of the Cove-
'nanted CM1 Service. The bulk of
v jyflffjjj^ these persons were overseers and tax-
aS fPfjp^" -^B^' collectors.
The Com. Has there been any altera-
tion of late years? I see you lay a
stress upon originally.
Anglo-In. At this moment there are
in the Service, in one department
alone — the Educational — a Senior
Classic, a Second Wrangler, several
other Wranglers, and many, Fellows of
Oxford and Cambridge, who took high honours with their degrees.
The Service now requires great technical knowledge, as it has to deal
with Archaeology, Finance, Geological Survey, Public Works, and
Telegraphy, and can only be entered by Europeans, who have been
selected by nomination, or after competition, either by the Secretary
of State for India, or the Government of India. It is not an Un-
oovenanted Service, as we now enter it with the prospect of a
pension; and one of our grievances is, that that prospect has become
lees favourable through the recent action of our employers.
The Com. Be kind enough to explain.
Anglo-In. Certainly, Sir. "When we entered the [Service our
Sernion, after serving thirty years, was stated by the Secretary of
tate to be £500. Naturally this was taken to mean gold, but
because years ago the Service consisted of Natives, the Government
hit upon the plan of paying us in silver, which at the present rate
means a loss of £150 in the £500.
The Com. Are the members of the other Indian Services, Civil
and Military, treated in like manner P
Anglo-In. No, they are paid their pensions in gold.
The Com. Well, considering the class of men who now enter your
Service, I do not see why you should be put at so great a disadvan-
tage. Have you any other grievances?
Anglo-In. \Vell, thirty years is a long time to have to serve in a
climate as trying as the tropics, especially when we are not allowed
to count furlough as service.
The Com. I think so, too. Then I may sum up your grievances
thus. You are educated men, and therefore deserve fair treatment.
Ton would consider fair treatment, payment of pensions in gold,
and the lessening of the years of service necessary to earn the right
of retirement?
Anglo-In. Exactly, Sir; and I cannot thank you sufficiently for
putting our case so plainly.
The Com. Not at all. Should you receive no redress within a
reasonable time, you may mention the matter to me again.
L The Witnett with a grateful boto then withdrew.
THE SHADOW OF A CASE!
(To the Editor of Punch.)
Dear Sib,—As the leading forensic journal of this great 'country
(your contemporary Weekly Notes runs you pretty close occasionally
in some of its reports), I address you. It was my painful duty a few
days ago (I had to "take a note" for a colleague, an occupation more
honourable than lucrative), to be present at a cause that was heard
before the President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division
of the High Court of Justice and a Special Jury. The trial created
considerable interest, not only amongst the _ general publio, but
amongst that branch of our honourable Profession represented by the
Junior Bar, no doubt, because certain points of law, not easily re-
cognisable—I frankly confess, I myself, am unable to recount them
—were no doubt in question, and had to be decided by competent
authority. The Counsel directly engaged were some of the brightest
ornaments of Silk and Stuff. Amongst the rest were my eloquent
and learned friend, Sir Charles Russell, my erudite and learned
friend Mr. Inderwick (whose Side- lights upon the Stuarts, is a
marvel of antiquarian research), and my mirth-compelling and
learned friend Mr. Frank Lockwood, whose law is only equalled
(if, indeed, it is equalled) by his comic draughtmanship. _ As the
details of the trial have been fully reported, there is no necessity to go
into particulars. However, there was a feature in the case that the
passing notice of an article in one or more of the leading journals is
scarcely sufficient to meet.
It was proved that the detective part of divorce (if I may use the
expression) may be conducted in a fashion, to say the least, of not
the most entirely satisfactory character. A talented family were
called before us, whose performances were, from one point of view,
extremely amusing. But, Sir, although (as you will be the first to
admit) laughter is a most excellent thing in its proper place, the
sound of caehinnation is seldom pleasing in the Divorce Court.
Under these circumstances I would propose that, in future, Divorce
Shadowing should be put under the protection of the State. There
should be a special department, and the Shadowers should be of the
distinguished position of Mr. McDougall of the London County
Council, and the like. The office of the rank and file of the Shadowers
should be honorary, as the pleasure of following in (possibly) un-
savoury steps in the cause of virtue, would be to them, I presume,
ample reward for any trouble the labour might entail. I would
willingly myself undertake the responsibilities attaching to the post
of Director-General, of course on the understanding that a suitable
provision were made, not only as compensation for the loss of my
practice, but also that I might perform the duties of the office with
suitable dignity. But when I say this, I would add, that I should
reserve to myself the right of seeking the supplementary services
of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Mr. Sheriff Augustus Harris.
as assessors in assisting me to distinguish between innocence and
vice, and guilt and virtue.
Believe me, with an expression of all necessary respect for " the
Nobility" connected with the case to whioh I nave referred, and
admiration for the courage of a certain Militiaman, exhibited by his
entering the witness-box, and there facing the cross-examination
he so riohly deserved, I remain, Yours truly,

Poet and Prophet are nearly allied. Mr. Alfred Austin is an
illustration of this, in his recently published English Lyrics
(M acmillan) all of whioh he must have written
in utter ignorance of the doings of the Chair-
man of the County Council. Yet, hath the
Prophetic Poet these lines:—
"Primrose, why do you pass away?"
And the Primrose's return:

"Nay, rather, why should we longer stay?"
But the Conservative bias of the Poet is shown
in the next line:
"We are not needed," &o.
The commencement of the poem, however,
as here quoted, is evidently an inspiration
for which the Poet was not responsible. It
is a charming little volume of charming verse. It is good poetic
wine, which needs not the bush provided by Mr. William Watson
in the shape of a thickset introduction. What, asks W. W., is the
attitude of Alfred Austin towards NatuTe? This recalls a well-
known scene in Nicholas Nickleby—" She's a rum 'un, is Natur',"
said Mr. Squeers. "She is a holy thing, Sir," remarked Mr. Snaw-
ley. "Natur*," said Mr. Squeers, solemnly, "is more easier con-
ceived than described. Oh, what a blessed thing, Sir, to be in a
state of natur'!" And these observations of Messrs. Snawley and
Squeers pretty accurately sum up all that the ingenious William
Watson has to say about Natur' and Alfred Austin. The moral
of which lies in the application of it, whioh is,—Bkip the preface, and
make plunge into the poetry.
A good deal has been written in olden time and of late about the
Oberammergau Passion Play. Nothing has been better done than
the work by Mr. Edward R. Russell, formerly M.P. for Glasgae,
who visited Oberammergau this year. His account is instinct with
keen criticism, fine feeling, and reasoning reverence. Moreover,
whilst other works are padded out into bulky volumes, he says all

EXTRACTBD FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 21.—
Ritchie got another Bill through; not a
measure of high imperial polioy; nothing to
do either with Heligoland or Zanzibar; only
f>roposes to improve in various ways thedwel-
ings of the industrial classes. Still, as Jokih
has shown in connection with one or two of
his little Bills, it is quite possible nearly to
wreck a Ministry even on matter-of-fact
business arrangements. But Ritchie isn't
Joeih, and so his Bill pisses to-night, taking
two steps at a time, both sides uniting in
congratulation and cheers. Walter Foster,
rising, salutes the Minister with a quite touch-
ing bless-you-my-ohild attitude. Foster
rather hints that the Bill everyone is so
pleased with, is really his. True, Ritchie's
name is on back, and he took charge of it in
its passage through Committee and House.
But the real man was Foster; his Amend-
ments had made the Bill; he had moulded
it in Committee, and now here he was to give
it his blessing. Rather delicate position;
sort of cracking up himself, which Foster
would not do for the world; blushed a little,
as he praised the Bill; otherwise accom-
plished nis task with ease and grace, whilst
Ritchie, listening, twitched his eyebrows,
and thought unutterable things.
"I wish," said Old Morality-, "we had
an embarrassment of Ritchies, or even two or
three more like him."
Old Moralitt bfen rather worried to-
night; a hail-storm of questions on all sorts
of subjects; amongst others, Tim Healt and
Wilfrid Lawson badgering him about the
I>ocal Taxation Bill. When is it really in-
tended to take it? Lawson asks Old
MoHALrrr back at the table again fortwentieth
time; literally gasping for breath; looked
round House with anguishei expression;
then happy thought strikes him; "Mr.
Speaker, Sir," he says, "it is really im-
possible to do more than one thing at a
time."
The pathetic earnestness with which this
axiom was advanced, the sudden swift spasm

mind, his certainty of the soundness of the assertion (paradoxical
though it might appear), and his hasty, anxious glance below the
Gangway opposite, apprehensive that that quarter would peradven-
ture furnish a person capable of controverting it, all filled the House
with keen delight. Laughed for full sixty seconds by Westminster
clock; Old Morality standing at table looking round and wondering
what on earth he'd said now.
Business done.—Census Bills read Second Time.
Tuesday.—Pretty quiet sitting, till Dimbdai.k craftily crept upon
the scene. Don't often bear from
this distinguished member of the
Order of Noble Barons; generally
content to serve his country by
voting for the Government. To-
night stirred in sluggish depths
by omission of Government in
preparing Census Bill to provide

Baron moves Amendment designed
to authorise Religious Census.
Opposition Benches nearly empty;
those present listen listlessly;
know it's all right; Government
are pledged against Religious Cen-
sus; no harm in the Noble Baron
moving his Amendment and mak-
ing his speeoh; the Bill as intro-
duced is safe.

dale and his Amendment. It was, he explained, only Ritchie's
fun in saying Ministerialists were free to vote as they pleased on
this matter. The Government were against the Amendment, and of
course good Ministerialists would vote with Ministers. So they did,
and Dimsdale's rising hopes crushed by majority of 288 against 69.
Business done.—English Census Bill passed through Committee.
Wednesday.—Came aoross Nicholas Wood in remote corner of
Corridor; had the depressed look familiar when he has been wrest-
ling with great mental problems and finds himself worsted.
What s the matter now, Nicholas P Thinking over what Old
Morality said yesterday about impossibility of doing more than one
thing at a time?"
"No, Toby," he said, wearily; "it's not that; gave that up at
once. Old Morality's a good fellow, but he's too subtle for me.
It's this Police Question that bothers me; give up a good deal of
time to mastering it. Sort of thing seemed likely to suit me; heard
all Matthews' speeches; tried to follow Cunninghame Graham;
oourted Contbeare's company, and pursued Pickersgill with
inquiries. Thought I'd got a pretty dear notion of what it all meant;
and now it turns out all to have led. up to making Puleston Constable
of Carnarvon. Never heard his name before in connection with the
Police Question. He took no part in discussions; had nothing to do
with it I ever heard of; just when I was comfortably getting on
another tack, the whole question centres on Puleston. It seems he
was the Police Question, and now he's Constable of Carnarvon. Why
Carnarvon? Why not stationed! in the Lobby or the Central
Hall where he would be with old friends? Suppose he '11 wear a blue
coat, bright buttons, and a belt, and will shadow Loyd-Geobqe who
now sits for Carnarvon P If you write to him must you address your
letters " P.C. Puleston "? and shall we have to ohange refrain1 of
our latest National Hymn P instead of singing' Ask a Policeman t'
shall we have to chant 'Ask a Puleston P' These are the new
problems; suddenly rushed in, bothering me to death when I thought
I'd got pretty well through Session, Recess close at hand and no more
difficult points coming up. Don't think, Toby, I was cut out for
politics; perhaps I take them too seriously; but like to know things,
and there are so many things to know."
Try to cheer up Nicholas; suggest to him that he should put his
questions down on the paper; might address them to Ferguson; a
little out of the way of Foreign Affairs; but a conversation publicly
conducted between Nicholas and Ferguson would be interesting.
Business done.—Votes in Supply.
Friday.—House in rather strange condition to-night; things all
sevens and sixes; Motion is that Anglo-German Agreement Bill be
read Second Time. Opinion very mixed on merits of measure; on
the whole, no particular objection to it, even though with it goes
Heligoland. Still, an Opposition must oppose; but where is the
Opposition? Mr. G. came down last night; said he'd no particular
objection to Treaty, but didn't like the process of confirming it; so
publicly washed his hands of the business. Since the announcement
appeared in papers, Herbert tells me his illustrious father's life has
been a burden to him. Every post brings him letters from rival
advertising soap manufacturers, making overtures of business
transactions.
''Sir," runs one of these epistles, "alluding to your statement in
the House of Commons last night that you' publicly washed your
hands of participation in the Anglo-German Treaty, would you nave
any objection to our stating that the substance used was our cele-
brated Salubrious Savon P Anticipating your favourable reply, we
assume that you would have no objection to our publishing a portrait
of you using our soap, with its familiar label,'Does not wash collars.'
We have only to add that in the event of your favourably accepting
this suggestion, we shall esteem it a favour to
be allowed to gratuitously supply you and
your family with specimens of our art for the
term of your natural lives."
This is merely an incident in the struggle,
illustrating one of the embarrassments it has
evolved. Only man thoroughly
happy is Habcoubt. He invented
tho line of attack on ground of
breach of constitutional usages;
put up Mr. G. to make his speech:
supplied him with authorities, and
in supplementary speech amazed
House with his erudition. Made
stupendous speech last night;
literally gorged the House: to-
night picks up fragments and pro
vides another
feast: six baskets
wouldn't hold it.
"Wish. Toby,
dear boy," he said,
sinking hack in his
seat after deliver-
ing his second
speech, cunningly
grafted on an
Amendment, "we
could carry this
over next week. I could easily make a speech a day. Remember
when I was once in Ireland, asked a tenant how he liked the new
agent, who was reputed to be very able business man. 'Well,' said
my acquaintance, I don't know about his business daylings, bat for
blasphaymious language, he's au revoir.' On constitutional ques-
tions, Toby, I may, with all modesty, say I'm au revoir,"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FIRST AID TO TOMMY ATKINS.
8m,—I visited the Military Exhibition the other day according
to yonr instrnotions, my bosom glowing with patriotic ardour. If
anything besides your instructions and the general appropriateness
of the occasion had been necessary to make my bosom glow thus, it
would have been found in the fact that
I formerly served my country in a
Yeomanry Regiment. I shall never for-
get the glorious occasions on which I
wore a cavalry uniform, and induced
some of my best friends to believe I had
gone to the dogs and enlisted. How-
ever, to relate my Yeomanry adventures,
l\ whioh included a charge by six of us
'upon a whole army, would be to stray
from my point, which is to describe
what I saw at the Military Exhibition.
I was lame (oh, dear no, not the gout,
a mere strain) and took a friend, an
amiable young man, with me to lean upon.
"There's one plaoe I really do know,"
he had said to me, "and that's this
bally plaoe."
I therefore felt I was safe with him.
We arrived, i"We entered. "Take me," I said, "to the battle-
pictures, so that I may study my country's glories."
"Right!" he answered, and with a promptitude that does him
immense credit, he brought me out into a huge arena in the open
air with seats all round it, a grand stand, and crowds of spectators.
The performance in the arena so deeply interested me that I forgot
all about the pictures. I saw at once what it was. Detachments
of our citizen soldiers were going through ambulance drill. The
sight was one whioh appealed to our common humanity. My daring,
dangerous Yeomanry days rose' up again before me, and I felt that
if ever I had had to bleed for my Queen I should not have bled
untended. Even my companion, a scoffer, who had never risen
above a full privacy in the Eton Volunteers, was strangely moved.
There were, I think, ten detaohments, each provided with a stretcher
and a bag containing simple surgical appliances. All that was
wanted to complete the realism of the picture was the boom of the
cannon, the bursting of shells, and the rattle of musketry. In
imagination I supplied them, as I propose to do, for your benefit,
Sir, in the following short account.
It was a sultry afternoon; the battle had been raging for hours;
the casualties had been terrible. "Dress up, there, dress up!" said
the Sergesvnt in command, addressing detachment No. 2, "and you,
Jenkins, tilt your forage-cap a leetle more over your right ear;
Bbown, don't blow your nose, the General's looking; God bless my
soul, Thompson, you've buokled that strap wrong, undo it and
re-buckle it at once." With suoh words as these he cheered his
men, while to right and left the death-dealing missiles sped on
their course. "Stand at ease; 'shon! Stand at ease! 'shon!" he
next shouted. A Corporal at this point was out in two by a ball
from a forty-pounder, but nobody paid any heed to him. Stiff,
solid, and in perfect line, stood the detachments waiting for the
word to succour the afflicted. At last it came. In the midst of
breathless excitement the ten bent low, placed their folded stretchers
on the ground, unbuckled and unfolded them, and then with a
simultaneous spring rose up again and resumed their impassive
attitude. "Very good," said the Sergeant, "very good. Thompson
you were just a shade too quick; you must be more careful. Stand
at ease 1 " and at ease they all stood.
But where were the wounded? Aha! here they come, noble, fear-
less heroes, all in line, marching with a springy step to their doom.
One by one they took their places, in line at intervals of abont
ten yards, and lay down each on his appointed spot to die, or be
wounded, and to be bandaged and carried off. But now a terrible
question arose. Would there be enough to go round t I had only
counted nine of them, which was one short of the necessary comple-
ment, but at this supreme moment another grievously wounded
warrior ran lightly up and lay down opposite the tenth detachment.
We breathed again.
And now began some charming manoeuvres. Each detachment
walked round its stretcher twice, then stood at ease again, then at
attention, then dressed up and arranged itself, and brushed itself
down. All this while their wounded comrades lay writhing, and
appealing for help in vain. It was with difficulty that, lame as I
was, I could be restrained from dashing to their aid. But at last
everything was in order. Stretchers were solemnly lifted. The
detachments marohed slowly forward, and deposited their stretchers
each beside a wounded man. Then began a scene of busy bandaging.
But not until the whole ten had been bound up, legs, arms, heads,
feet, fingers &e., was it permissible to lift one of them from the
cold cold ground which he had bedewed with his blood.
"Now then," said the Sergeant, "carefully and all together.
lift!" and all together they were lifted and placed in their stretchers.
More play with straps and buckles, more rising and stooping, and
then the pale and gasping burdens were at last raised and carried in
a mournful procession round the ground. But when they arrived at
the place where the ambulance was supposed to be, they had all
been dead three-quarters of an hour. "Dear me," said the Sergeant.
"how vexing. Kobinson, your chin-strap's gone wrong. Now, all
together. Drop 'em!" And so the day ended, and the pitiless sun
sated with, &c, &c, &o.
I afterwards visited the Field Hospital to see a number of wax
figures in uniform, cheerfully arranged as wounded men in all the
stages of pain and misery. How encouraging for Tommy Atkins,
I thought to myself; but at this moment my supporter informed
me that he had remembered where to find the battle-pictures, and
thither therefore we proceeded, thankful in the knowledge that if
either of us ever happened to be struck down in battle he would be
well looked after by an admirably drilled body of men.
I am, Sir, Yours as usual, Lx Petit Shows.
THE PROFESSIONAL GUEST
AT A COUNTRY HOUSE.
Deab Me. Punch,
Teustino that you take some interest in my fate, after the
more or less pleasant (?) week I spent at Henley, I hasten to let you
know that I am again visiting friends, though this time on terra
flrma, and that the customary trials of the "Professional Guest"
are once more my portion. The very evening of my arrival, I dis-
covered that a man with whom I had not been on speakiug terms for
years was to be my neighbour at dinner, and that a girl (who really
I cannot understand any one asking to their house) with the
strangest coloured hair, and the most unnaturally dark eyes, was
taken in by the host, and called "darling" by the hostess. After
dinner, whioh, by reason of the "range" being out of order, was of
a rather limited type, they all played cards. That is a form of
amusement I don't like—I can't afford it; and this, coupled with
the faot that I was not asked to sing, somewhat damped my ardour
as regards visiting strange houses.
A hard bed, and a distant snore, kept me awake till break of day,
when, for a brief spaoe, I BUOoesBfully wooed Morpheus. I think I
slept for seven minutes. Then a loud bell rang, and, several doors
//f1fr on an upper floor were heavily banged. I
heard the servants chattering as they went
down to breakfast. Then there was silence,
and once more I compoaed myself to rest, when
the dreadest sound of all broke on my ear.
The baby began to cry. Then I gave it up as
hopeless, but it was with a sensation of being
more dead than alive that I crawled down to
breakfast—late, of course. One is always late
the first morning in a strange house—one can
never find one's things. I bore with my best
professional smile the hearty chaff of my host
(how I hate a hearty man the first thing in
the morning) and the audible remarks of the
dear children who were seated at intervals round the table. But
my patience well-nigh gave way when I found that our hostess had
carefully mapped out for her guests a list of amusements (save the
mark!) which extended not only over that same day, but several
ensuing ones.
I am not of a malice-bearing nature, but I do devoutly pray that
she, too, may one day taste the full horror of being tucked into a
high dog-cart alongside of a man who you know cannot drive; the
tortures, both mental and physical, of a long walk down dusty roads
and over clayey fields to see that old Elizabethan house " only a mile
off; "or the loathing induced by a pic-nio among mouldering and
utterly uninteresting ruins. All this I swallowed with the equa-
nimity and patience born of many seasons of country-house visiting;
I even interviewed the old family and old-fashioned cook, on the
subject of a few new dishes, and I helped to entertain some of those
strange aboriginal creatures called "the county." But the announce-
ment one afternoon, that we were to spend the] next in driving ten
miles to attend a Primrose League Fete in the private grounds of a
local magnate, proved too much for me. Shall you be surprised to
hear that on the following morning I received an urgent telegram re-
calling me to town? My hostess was, or affected to be, overwhelmned
that by my sudden departure I should miss the fete. I knew, how-
ever, that the "dyed" girl rejoiced, and in oompany with the
objectionable man metaphorically threw up her hat.
As I passed through the Lodge-gates on my way to the station I
almost vowed that I would never pay another visit again. But even
as I write, an invitation was brought me. It is from my Aunt. She
writes that she has taken charming rooms at Flatsands, and hopes I
will go and Btay with her there for a few days. She thinks the sea air
will do me good. Perhaps it will. I shall write at onoe and accept,

A METROPOLITAN METAMORPHOSIS.
The Awful Result of Persistent " Crawling."
THE DYING SWAN.
[Latest Version, a long way after the Laureate.)
•'Thames '8wan Ufpino.'—The Qubi-n's
swanherd and the officials of the Dyers' and Vint-
ners' Companies arrived at Windsor yesterday on
thtir annual * swan-upping' visit, for tbe purpose
of marking or 1 nicking' the swans and cy gnets
belonging to Hsu Majesty, and the Companies
interested in the preservation of the birds that
haunt the stream between Loudon and Henley. It
is said that the Thames swans are steadily de-
creasing owir g to the traffic on the upper reaches
of the river, and other causes detrimental to their
breeding."—The Times.
I.
Jr/LT was wet,—a thing not rar«—
With sudden ground and chilly air;
The sky presented everywhere
A low-pitch*d rwf of doleful grey;
With a rain-flasht flood the river ran;
Adown it floated a dying Swan,
And loudly did lament.
It was the middle < f the day,
The " Swan herd" and his men went on,
".Nicking " the cygnets as they went,
n.
The " 8 wan herd " showed a blue-peaked nose,
And white against the cold white sky
Shone many a face of those
Who o'er the upper reaches swept,
On swans and cygnets keeping an eye.
Dyers and Vintners, portly, mellow
Chasing the birds of the jetty bill
Through the reed clusters green and still;
And through the osier mazes crept
Many a cap-feathered crook-armed fellow.
m.
The lone Swan's requiem smote the soul
With the reverse ot joy.
It spake of sorrow, of outfalls queer,
Dyeing the floods onoe full and clear;
Of launches wildly galumphing by,
Washing the banks into hollow and hole;
Sometimes afar, and sometimes a-near.
AU-marring 'Akhy's exuberant voice,
With music strange and manifold.
Howling out choruses loud and bold
As when Bank-holidayites rejoice
With concertinas, and the many-holed
1 Shrill whistle of tin, till the riot is rolled
Through shy backwaters, where swan-nests
are;
And greasy scraps of the Echo or Star,
Waifs from the cads' oleaginous feeds,
Emitting odours reekingly rank,
Drift under the clumps of the water-weeds,
And broken bottles invade the reeds,
And the wavy swell of the many-barged tug
Breaks, and befouls the green Thames' bank.
And the steady decrease of the snow-plumed
throng
That sail the upper Thames reaches among,
Was prophesied in that plaintive song.
DOING IT CHEAPLY.
A re-action against the extravagance
which marked the entertainments of the
London Season of 1890 having set in, the fol-
lowing rules and regulations will be observed
in the Metropolis until further notice.
1. Persons invited to dinner parties will be
expected to furnish their own plate and linen,
and some of the viands and wines to be used
at the feast.
2. To carry out the above, a menu of the
proposed meal will form a part of every card
of invitation, whioh will run as follows:—
"Mr. and Mrs. request the honour of
Mr. and Mrs. 's company to dinner, on
when they will kindly bring with them
enough for twelve persons of the dish marked on the accompanying Menu, P.T.O."
3. Persons invited to a Ball will treat the
supper as a pio-nio, to which all the guests
are expected to contribute.
4. On taking leave of a hostess every guest
will slip into her hand a packet containing a
sum of money sufficient to defray his or her
share of the evening's expenses.
5. Ladies making calls at or about five
o'clock, will bring with them tea, sugar, milk,
pound-cake, cucumber sandwiches, and bread
and butter.
6. As no bands will be furnished at even-
ing parties, guests who can play will be ex-
pected to bring their musical instruments
with them. N.B. This does not _ apply to
pianofortes on the premises, for which a small
sum will be charged to those who use them.
7. Should a cotillon be danced, guests will
provide their own presents, whioh will become
the perquisites of the host and hostess.
8. and lastly. Should the above rules, com-
piled in the interest of leaders of Society, be
insufficient to keep party-givers from appear-
ing in the Court of Bankruptcy, guests who
have partaken of any hospitality will be ex-
pected to contribute a gratuity, to enable the
Official Receiver to declare a small and final
ividend.

"NOBLESSE OBLIGE 1"
(Latest Reading.)
Xoblesse oblige! And what's the obligation,
Read in the light of recent demonstration?
A member of our old Nobility"
May be " obliged," at times, to play the spy,
Lay traps for fancied frailty, disenthrall
"Manhood" by "playingfor" a woman's fall;
Redeem the wreckage of a " noble" name
By building hope on sin, and joy on shame;
Redress the work ot passion's reoklessboldness
By craven afterthoughts of oynio coldness;
Purge from low taint "the blood of all the

By borrowings from the code of oads and
Noblesse oblige t Better crass imbecility
Of callow youth—with pluck—than such
"nobility"!
_ Home-dig.—Dr. Babnabdo's delightfully
simple plan of getting a little boy to sign an
affidavit to the tflvct that he was so happy at
Dr Babnabdo's Home, Sweet Home, and that,
wherever he might wander, there was really
no place on earth like Dr. Babnabdo'h Home,
may remind Dickensian students of a some-
what analogous method apparently adopted
by Mr. Squeers, when, on his welcome return
to Dotheboys Hall, he publicly announced
that " he had seen the parents of some boys,
and they 're so glad to hear how their sons
are getting on, that there's no prospect at all
of their going away, whioh, of course, is a very
pleasant thing to reflect upon for all parties."
The conduct of such parents or relatives
who send children or permit them to be sent
to Dr. Baknakdo's Home, Sweet Home, where,
at all events, they are well fed and cared for,
bears some resemblance to that of Oraymarsh's
maternal aunt, who was "short of money,
but sends a tract instead, and hopes that
Qraymarsh will put his trust in Providence,"
and also to that of Mobb's mother-in-law,"
who was so disgusted with her stepson's con-
duct (for Dickens meant step-mother when he
wrote "mother - in - law —an odd lapsus
calami never subsequently corrected) that she
"stopped his halfpenny a-week pocket-
money, and had given a double-bladed knife
with a corkscrew in it to the Missionaries,
which she had bought on purpose for him."
We don't blame Dr. Barnakdo—much; but
we do blame these weak-knee'd parents and
guardians, who apparently don't know their
own minds. In the recent oa*e which was
sarcastically treated by the Judge, Dr. B.
found that he could buy Gould too dear.

10 a m .—As I suspected, from the first, there has been a disturbance.
I thought it must be so, as I could not otherwise understand why my
cabin should have been blown into the air, while passing through a
mined street on the road here. I am now at the Head Quarters of
the Oniononi, who seem to be in great strength. They appear to be
very pleased that the fleet should have joined them, and aocount for
the action by saying that the sailors, as bad shots, would naturally
blaze away at the biggest target—Government House. So far, the
disturbances have caused little inconvenience. I date this 10 a.m.,

carried away by a new kind ot land torpedo.

with gas, and used it as a balloon. I found it most valuable in crossing

The artillery are now reducing the entire town to atoms, under the
personal supervision of the Minister of Finance, who deprecate*

buried. As I can get no corroboration of this statement, I publish
it under reservation. I confine myself to saying that it may be true,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Who remembers a certain story called, if I remember aright,
The Wheelbarrow of Bordeaux, that appeared in a Christmas
Number of the Illustrated London Newt some years agoP If no
one else does, I do, says the Baron; and that sensational story was
a sensational sell, wherein
the agony was piled up to
the "n'V' and J^t 48 the
secret was about to be dis-
closed, the only person who
knew it, and was on the
point of revealing it, died.
This is the sort of thing
that Mr. Rudyard Kipling
has just done in this month's
Lippincutt't Magazine. It
is told in a plain, rough and
ready, blunt style, but so
blunt that there's no point in it. And the idea,—that is if the idea
be that the likeness of the assassin remains on the retina of the victim's
eye. and can be reproduced by photography,—is not a novelty.
Perhaps this story in Lippincott comes out ot one of Mr. Runyard
Kipling's pigeon-holes, and was just chucked in haphazard, because
Editorial Lippincott wanted something with the name of the Kipling,
"bright and merry," to it. It's not very " bright," and it certainly
isn't merry."
Black's Guide to Kent for 1890, useful in many respects, but
not quite up to date. The Baron cannot find any information about
the splendid Golf Grounds, nor the Golf Club at Sandwich; it
speaks of Sir Moses Montk fiork's place on the East Cliff of Ramsgate
as if that benevolent centenarian were still alive; and it retains an
old-fashioned description of Ramsgate as " The favourite resort of
superior London tradesmen"—" which," says the Baron, "is, to my
certain knowledge, very far from being the case." It talks of the
"humours of the sands," and alludes to what is merely the cheap-
trippers' season, as if this could possibly be the best time for Ramsgate.
The Guide knows nothing, or at least says nothing, of the Winter
attractions; of the excellent pack of harriers; of the delightful climate
from mid-September to January; of the southern aspect; of the pure
air: of the many excursions to Ash, Deal, Sandwich, Ickham, and
so forth; nor can the Baron discover any mention of the Granville
Hotel, nor of the Albion Club, nor of the sport for fishers and
shooters; _ nor of the Riviera-like mornings in November and in the
early Spring, which are the real attractions of Ramsgate, and make
it one of the finest health-resorts in Winter for all" who love life, and
would aee good days." It reminds me," says the Baron, puffing off
his smoke indignantly, " of Mr. IaviNGjand a certain youthful critic,
who, in his presence at supper, had been running down Macbeth, finding
fault with the Lyceum production of it, and ridiculing Suakspearb
for having written it. When he had quite finished, Henry Irving,
'laying low' in his chair at the table, adjusted his pinoe-nez, and,
looking straight at the clever young gentleman, asked, in the mildest
possible tone, 'My dear Sir, have you ever read Macbeth t' So,"
resumes the Baron, "I am inclined to ask Mr. Black's young man,
'Do you know Ramsgate P' And of course I mean the Ramsgate
of 1890."
From the specimens of London City that have been sent for inspec-
tion by Messrs. Field & Tuer, of the Leadenhall Press, who are bring-
ing it out, the Baron augurs a grand result, artistically and financially.
It is to be published at forty-two shillings, but subscribers will get
it for a guinea, so intending possessors had evidently better become
subscribers. The history of the Great City is to be told by Mr. W.
J. Loftik, so that it starts with an elevated tone and the loftiest
principles, and the illustrations will be by Mr. Wm. Lukbr, a
talented draughtsman who, as a Luker-on has seen most of the
games in the City. In consequence of some piratical publisher
having attempted to bring out a work under the same title, intended
to deceive even the elect, Messrs. Field & Tueh have secured
the copyright of the title London City, by the ingenious device of
publishing, for one farthing each, five hundred copies of a miniature
pamphlet Dealing this title, and containing the explanation. The
value of these eccentric farthing pamphlets may one day be thou-
sands of pounds. Mem.—Twopence would be well invested in pur-
chasing four of them.
Salads and Sandwiches is an attractive title, specially at this
season. The arrangement of the book is, like the salad, a little
mixed. When, however, the knowing Baron finds that abomination
known as salad dressing, or "salad mixing," which is sold at the
grocer's, recommended by a writer who professes to teach salad-
making, then he closes the book, and reads no more that day. This
author, who is in his salad days, might bring out a book entitled How
to Suck Eggs; or, Letters to my Grandmother. It is a suggestion
worth considering, says
Tex Baron he Book-Worms.
TO PTRRHA ON THE THAMES.
0 Pyrrha! say what youth in "blazer"
drest,
Woos you on pleasant Thames these
summer eves;
For whom do yon put on that dainty
vest,
That sky-blue ribbon and those gigot
sleeves.
"Simplex munditiis," as Horace wrote,
And yet, poor lad, he '11 find that he is
rash;
ij To-morrow you '11 adorn some other boat,
And smile as kindly on another " mash."
As for myself—I'm old, and look askance
At flannels and flirtation; not for me
Youth's idiotio rapture at a glance
From maiden eyes: although it comes from thee.

IN THE KNOW.
{By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)
I am a modest man, as well as an honest one. Censure cannot
move me by one hair's breadth from the narrow path of rectitude;
praise cannot unduly puff me up. Had I been other than I am, this
last week would have gone fatally near to ruining that timid and
shrinking diffidence whioh (I say it without egotism) marks me off
from the poisonous, pestilential, hydrocephalus, putty-faced, suet-
brained reptiles who disgrace the profession to which I belong. _ All
I wish now to do is to point out that lam the only prophet who indi-
cated, without any beating about the bush, that Marvel would win
the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood. My admirers have recognised the
fact, and my private residence has been ohoked by an avalanche of
congratulatory despatches, including two or three from some of the
highest in the land. H. S. H., the Grand Duke of Pfeifbntopf
says:—" You have me with your writings much refreshed. I have
the whole revenues of the Grand Duchy against one thousand
flaschen of lager bier gebetted, and I have won him on your noble
advice on Marvel. I make you Commander of the Honigthau
Order." I merely cite this to snow that my appreciators are not to
one country confined—I mean, confined to one country.
What did I say last week, in speaking of the Stewards' Cup
horses? By the well-known gram-
matical figure known as the hyste-
roproteron, I mentioned Marvel
last, intending, of course, as even
a buffalo-headed Bedlamite might
have seen, that he should be first.
And he was first. But to make
assurance doubly sure, and to bring
prophecy down to the intellectual
level of a bat, I added, in speak-
ing of the winner, that he "would
certainly be a Marvel." I say no
more. As the great Cardinal once
observed to his chief of police, "Je
te verrai souffle d'abord," so I
reply to those who wish me to re-
veal the secret of my success. _ Mr.
J. knows it not, and no single
member of the imbecile, anserous,
asinine, cow-hooked, spavin-brained, venomous, hugger-mugger
purveyors of puddling balderdash who follow him has the least con-
ception of my glorious system. But I am willing to teach, though I
have nothing to learn. For six halfpenny stamps those who desire
to know, shall receive my pamphlet'on "Book-making." Every
applicant must send his photograph with his application, not
necessarily for publication, but as a guarantee of good faith.

Sur ls Tapis."—It was a carpet that ostensibly parted an
eminent firm of composer, author, and theatrical manager. W. S. G.

"Bkwabe!" 'Tis a voice from the shades,
from the dark of three thousand long

But it falls like the red blade of Ra, and
should echo in Tyranny's ears
With the terror of overhead thunder; from
Nile to the Neva it thrills,
And it speaks of the judgment of wroDg, of
tin doom of imperious wills.
When Pbntaoub sang of the Pharaoh, alone
by Orontes, at bay,

Of tyranny born out of time, of oppression

from the scourge and the chain;
Fur the days of the Pharaohs are done, and
the laureates of tyranny mute.
And the whistle of falchion and flail are not
set to the chorda of the lute.
True, the Hebrew, who bowed to the lash of
the Pyramid-builders, bows still,
For a time, to the knout of the Tsab, to the
Muscovite's merciless will;
But four millions of Israel's children are not
to be orushed in the path
Of a Tsab, like the Hittites of old, when great
Rimeses flamed in his wrath
Alone through their numberless hosts. No,
the days of the Titans of "Wrong
Are past, for the Truth is a toroh, and the
voice of the peoples is stronr.
Even Pkntaocb, the poet of Might, spake in
pity that rings down the years
Of the life of ,vthe peasant that tills " of his
tf rrible toil and his tears;
Of the rats and the locusts that ravaged, and,
worse, the tax-gathering horde
Who tithed all his pitiful tilth with the aid
of the stick and the cord;
And the splendour of Rameses pales in the
text of the old Coptic Muse,
And—one hears the mad rush of the wheels
that the fierce Red Sea billow pursues!
0 Muscovite, blind in your wrath, with
your heel on the Israelite's neok,
And your hand on that baleful old blade,

Lo, the Pyramids pierce the grey gloom
Of a desert that is but a waste, by a river
that is but a tomb,
Yet the Hebrew abides and is strong.
Amk.neman is gone to the ghosts,
He the prince of the Coptic police who bo
harried the Israelite hosts
When their lives with hard-bondage were
bitter. And now bitter bondage you'd try.
Proscription, and exile, and stern depriva-
tion. Beware, Sire I Put by
That blade in its blood-rusted scabbard. The
Pharaohs, the C.ksaks have found
That it wounds him who wields it; and you,
though your victim there, prone on the
ground,
Look helpless and hopeless, you also shall find
Persecution a bane
Which shall lead to a Red Sea of blood to
o'erwhelm selfish Tyranny's train.
"Beware!" Tis the shade of Meheptha

tale. I love to hear of that august Assembly

which my Mother's honoured voice is raised!
C's. M. [gratified). Learn, Conrad, then,
that, after many months of patient "lobby-
ing" (you've heard the term?) the measure
by my foresight introduced has triumphed by
a bare majority!
Con. My bosom thrills with dutiful delight
—although I yet for information wait as to
the scope and purpose of the statute.
C's. M. Tou show an interest so intelligent that well deserves it
should be satisfied. Be seated, Conrad, at your Mother's knee, and
you shall hear the full particulars. You know how zealously I
advocate the sacred cause of Nursery Reform? How through my
efforts every infant's toys are carefully inspected onoe a month?
Con. (wearily). Nay, Mother, you forget—I have no toys.
Cs. M. Which brings you under the exemption clause. But—to
resume; how Nursery Songs and Tales must now be duly licensed
by our Censor, and any deviation from the text forbidden under
heavy penalties? All that you know. Well; with concern of late,
I have remarked among our infancy the rapid increase of a baneful
habit on which I scarce can bring my tongue to dwell. (The Stage

—think of it I—so lost to every sense of deoency that, in mere
wantonness or brainless sloth, they obstinately suck forbidden
thumbs! (Conrad starts with irrepressible emotion.) Forgive me
if I shock your innocence! (Sadly.) Such things exist—bat soon
shall cease to be, thanks to the measure we have passed to-day!
Con. (with growing uneasiness). But how can statutes check such
practices?
C's M. (patting his head). Right shrewdly questioned, boy! I
come to that. Some timid sentimentalists advised compulsory
restraint in woollen gloves, or the deterrent aid of bitter aloes. I
saw the evil had too deep a seat to yield to such half-hearted

relieved at its departure. Loud knocking without. Both
start to their feet.
C's M. Who knocks so loud at such an hour as this?
A Voice. Open, I charge ye. In the Council's name!

The S. (with approval). Right! Step with
me into the outer hall, and have the business

C's. M. (throwing herself between them).

Con. Must I teach a parent laws were meant to be obeyed?

may I trouble you?

door is shut and fastened from without. C's. M. rushes to

Con. (with chilling composure). Yes, Madam, for between us

[Da. Jaynk, Bishop of Cheater, at
a Conference of the Girl's Friendly
Society, at Chatter, said that until
they were prepared to introduce basket-
making into London Society as a sub-
stitute for quadrilles and waltzes, he
was not disposed to accept it as an
equivalent for balls and dances among
girls of other classes.]

My pithy Jayne, my plucky

Punch fancies you looked sly
When you met them, met them

And gave them "one in the

Bigotry's waning fast, my boy,
But Cant we sometimes hear,
And Chester cant is pestilent cant,
My Lord, that's pretty clear.
Then pithy Jayne, my plucky
Jayne,
Of smiting don't be shy;
But meet them, meet the moon-

And tell them it's all my eye.
'Tis only play, and harmless play,
Like kissing in the ring,
When lads and lasses of spirits
gay
Dance like young lambs in
Spring.
That Spring will wane too fast,
alas!
But while it yet is here,
Let youth enjoy, or girl or boy,
The danoe to youth so dear.
Then pithy Jayne, my plucky

Don't heed the bigot's ory,
But meet them, meet them down

And teach them Charity!
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DI&RY OF TOBT, M.P.
Houte of Commons, Monday, July 28.—Stratheden and Camp-
bell are amongst the most regular visitors to our lobby from House
of Lords. Ravensworth and Umbbella run
them pretty close, but oome inonly a good second.
Moreover, whilst Ravensworth and Umbrella
rarely go beyond the lobby, Stkatbeskn and
Campbell press forward into Gallery reserved
for Peers, and there sweetly go to sleep, " Like
Babes in the Wood." says Colonel Malcolm,
turning over leaves of Ordere as if he would like
to complete the simile by acting the part of the
birds. To-night Stratheden and Campbell
leave us forlorn. They have business in their
own House; been long concerned for interests
of State as affected by the Mabkiss'b persistence
in combining office of Premier with that of
Foreign Secretary.
"It would be too much even for us," said
8tbatheden, in conversation we had before
House met; "and," he continued, "though I
say it what shouldn't, I don't know any arrange-
ment that would be happier or more complete
than if we undertook the job. What do you
say, Campbell? Would you be Premier, or
would you take the Foreign Seals?"
"The Premier plaoe is yours," said Camp-
bill, gallantly; "at least, it is now. When
we first started in life we used to call ourselves
Campbell and Stbatiif.den. You '11 find it so
in the Peerage* of earlier date; now it's the
other way about, and Stratheden takes the
pat."
"That was entirely your doing, Cam thill, Turning over
said Strathbden; "so modest, so retiring, so thoughtful! After
we'd been known as Campbell and Stbatheden for good many
years, you came to me and said it was my turn now. 1 objected;
you insisted; and here we are, a power in the State, an object of
interest in the Commons. Stbatheden and Campbell in the Lords."
A little awkward, don't you think," I ven-
tured to say, edging in a word, "for yon two
fellows to take this strong stand against
duality?"
"Not at all," said Stratiiedf.n and Camp-
bell, both together; "we are authorities on
the subject, and we say that the Makk iss cannot
in his single person adequately perform the
dual duties pertaining to his high offices; there-
fore we shall go and move our resolution pro-
testing against arrangement."

name now; Compensation Clauses dropped; but Jokim 1 inils it'dreary
work dragging the wreck along.
"Seems to me, Tobt," he said, with a soh in his voice, "that
whatever I do is wrong. This Bill has gone through various trans-
mogrifications since, with a light heart, I brought it in as part of
Budget scheme. But it's all the same. Hit high or hit low, I can't
please 'em. Begin to think if there were any other business open
for me, should cnuok this up."
"Ever been in the carpet-cleaning line?" said Maflx-Blukdell,
in harsh voice, and with curiously soured face. Generally beams
through life as if it were
all sunshine. Now cloud
seems to have fallen over
his expansive person, and
he is as gloomy as Jokim.
"It's all very well for
you," he continues, glower-
ing at Jokim, " to complain
of your lot; but till you go
into the carpet-cleaning
line you never know what
vicissitudes mean. One
day, alighting from your
four-in-hand, and happily
able to spare to Tottenham
Court Road a few moments
from direction of national
affairs, you look in at your
shop; enter a lady who
says she wants a carpet
cleaned. 'Very well,' you
say rubbing your hands,
and smiling blandly; 'and
what will be 'the next
artiole.' Nothing 'more.
Only this blooming carpet,
out of which, when the job
is finished and it is sent
home you make a modest
five bob. Your keen insight into figures, Jokim, will convince
you that the coin colloquially known as five bob won't go far
to enable you to cut a figure in Society, drive four-in-hand, give
pio-nios in your park to the Primrose, League, and subscribe to
the Carlton Fund. However, there it is; carpet comes; you Bend
it out in usual way, and what happens? Why it blows itself up,
kills two boys, lames a man, and then you discover that you've been
entertaining unawares a carpet worth £1000 which you have to pay.
Did that ever happen to you at the Treasury?" Mafle-Blundell
tiercely demanded. Jokim forced to admit that his infinite sorrows
had never taken that particular turn.
"Very well, then," snapped Mafle-Blundell, "don't talk to me
about your troubles. As far as I know this is the only carpet in the
world valued at £1000; it is certainly the only one that ever went off
by spontaneous combustion; and I had this particular carpet in
oharge, at the very moment when it
was ready to combust spontaneously."
"Yes, said Jokim, softly, as
Matlk-Blundell went off, viciously
stamping on the carpet that covers
the Library floor, "we all have our
troubles, and when I think of Mafle-
Blunbkll and his combustible carpet
I am able the better to bear the woes
I have."
Business done.—In Committee on
Local Taxation Bill.
Thursday.—" True, Tobt," Old
Moralttt said, in reply to an obser-
vation, "I am a little tired, and
naturally; things haven't been going
so well as they did; but I could get
along well enough if it wasn't for
Summers. Cohtbkare's cantan-
kerous; Story is strenuous; Tanner
tedious; and Dillon denunciatory.
But there's something about Sum-
mers that is peculiarly aggravating.
In the first place, he is, as far as
appearances go, such a quiet, amiable,
inoffensive young man. Looking at him, one would think that
butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, much less that Mixed Marriages
in Malta should keep him awake at night, and the question of Inter-
national Arbitration should lower his appetite. Yet you know how
it is. He seems to have some leisure on his hands; uses it to formu-
late conundrums: comes down here, and propounds them to me.
Just look at his list for to-night. Lintobn Simmonds's Mission to

the Pope; Customs' Duty in Algeria; International Arbitration:
Walfish Bay, and Damara Land, together with the view the Cape
Colonies may take of the Anglo-German Agreement. That pretty
well for one night; but he's gone off now, to look up a fresh batch,
which he '11 untold to-morrow. Now is the winter of our discontent,
which is chilly enough; but, for my part, I often think that life
would be endurable only for its Summers."
Haven't often heard Old Mobalitt speak so bitterly; generally,
even at worst time, overflowing with geniality; ready to take
kindest view of circumstances, ana hope for the best. But Summers,
surveying mankind from China to Peru in search of material for
fresh conundrum, too muoh for mildest-mannered man. _ Old
Mobalitt, goaded to verge of madness, jumps up; hotly declines to
reply to Summers; begs him to address his questions to Ministers to
whose Department, they belonged.
Business done.—Local Taxation Bill through Committee.
Friday.—Still in our ashes live our wonted fires. Dwelling just
now amid ashes of expiring Session; everything dull and deadly;
pounding away at Local Taxation Bill; Scotch Members to the fore,
for the fortieth time urging that the £40.000 allotted them in relief
of school fees shall be made £90,000. House divides, and also for
fortieth time says "No ;" expect to go on with next Amendment;
when suddenly Harcourt springs on Old Morality's back, digs hi*
knuckles into his eyes, bites his ear, and observes that he " has never
seen a piece of more unexampled insolence." Old Mobalitt, when
he recovers breath, goes and tells the Master—I mean the Speaker.
Speaker says Harcourt shouldn't use language like that; so Har-
couRT-subsiaes, and incident closes as rapidly and suddenly as it opened.
A little later Compton goes for Raikes; hints that he sub-edited
for Hansard portions of a speech delivered in House on Post Office
affairs. Raikes says "Noble Lord charged me with having deliber-
ately ifalsified my speech." Compton says he didn't. "Then,"
said Raikes, with pleading voice that went to every heart, " I wish
the Noble Lord had the manliness to charge me with deliberate falsi-
fication." Compton refused to oblige; Raikes really depressed.
"Don't know what we're coming to, Tobt," he said, " when one
almost goes on his knees to ask a man to charge him with deliberate
falsification, and he won't do it. Thought better of Comptox: see
him in his true light now." Business done.—A good deal.
A SPORTING STYLE.
Our next example of a true sporting style will be com
the basis of Nos. 11, 12, and 13 of the Rules. These, it will be
remembered, require the writer to refer to "the good old days ;" to
be haughty and contemptuous, with a parade of rugged honesty; to
be vain and offensive, and to set himself up as an infallible judge of
every branch of sport and athletics. This particular variety of style
is always immensely effective. All the pot-boys of the Metropolis,
most of the shady bookmakers, and a considerable proportion of the
patrons of sport Bwear by it, and even the most thoughtful who read it
cannot fail to be impressed by its splendour. This style deals in para -
graphs. Second Example.—Event to be commented on: A Regatta.
I am led to believe by column upon column of wishy-washy
twaddle in the morning papers, that Henley Regatta has actually
taken place. The effete parasites of a decayed aristocracy who
direct this gathering endeavour year after year to make the world
believe that theirs is the only meeting at which honour has the least
chance of bursting into i flower. I nave my own opinions on this
point. Really, these tenth transmitters of foolish faces become more
and more brazen in their attempts to palm off their miserable two-
penny-halfpenny,, tin-pot, one norse Regatta as the combination of
cardinal vi
all the (
I virtues.
These gentry presume to dictate to rowing men what shall
;ute the status of the Amateur. For my own part (and the
will acknowledge that I have done some rowing in my time) I prefer
the straight-forward conduct of any passing rag-and-bone merchant
to the tricks of the high and mighty champions of the amateur quali-
fication in whose nostrils the mere name of professional oarsman seems
to stink. These pampered denizens of the amateur hothouse would,
doubtless, wear a kid-glove before they ventured to shake hands with
one who, like myself, despises them and their absurd pretensions.
As for the rowing, it was fantastic I wasn't there. Indeed, those
who know me, would never think so meanly of me as to suppose that
I would attend this Regatta pour rire. But I know enough to be
sure that the Eights were slow, the Fours defioient in pace, the pairs
on the minus side of nothing, and the scullers preposterous. Rowing
must be in a bad way when it can boast no better champions (save the
mark!) than those who last week aired their incompetence, and
impeded the traffio of the people upon the Thames. Time was when
an oarsman was an oarsman, but now he is a miserable oross between
a Belgravian flunkey and a riverside tout. Which is all I o»re to
say on an unsavoury matter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MODERN TYPES.
(By Mr. Punch's own Type Writer.)
No. XVII.—THE SPURIOUS SPORTSMAN.
Therk is in sport, as in Society, a class of men who aspire
perpetually towards something as perpetually elusive, which ap-
pears to them, rightly or wrongly, to be higher and nobler than
their aotual selves. But whereas a man may be of and in Society,
without effort, by the mere aooident of birth or wealth, in sport,
properly understood, achievement of some kind is necessary before
admission can be had to the sacred circle of the elect. What the
snob is to Society, the Spurious Sportsman is to sport; and thus
where the former seeks to persuade the world that he is familiar
with the manners, and accustomed to the intimate friendship of the
great and highly placed, the latter will hold himself out as one
who, in every branch of sport has achieved many notable feats on
innumerable occasions.
Such a man, of course, is not without knowledge on the matters of
which he speaks. He has probably hunted several times without
pleasure, or fished or shot here and there
without sucoess. But upon these slender
foundations he could not rear the stupen-
dous fabric of his deeds unless he had read
much, and listened carefully to the narra-
tions of others. By the aid of a lively
and unscrupulous imagination, he gradually
transmutes their experiences into his own.
What he has read becomes, in the end,
what he has done, and thus, in time, the
Spurious Sportsman is sent forth into the
world equipped in a dazzling armour of
sporting mendacity. And yet mendacity
is, perhaps, too harsh a word; for it is of
the essence of true falsehood that it should
hope to be believed, in order that it may
deceive. But, in the Spurioua Sportsman's
ventures into the marvellous, there is
generally something that gives ground for
the exercise of charity, and the appalled
listener may hope that even the narrator
is not so thoroughly convinced of the reality
of his exploits as he would, apparently,
desire others to be. And there is this also
to be said in excuse.lthat sport, which calls
for the exercise of some of the noblest
attributes of man's nature, not infrequently
leads him into mean traps and pitfalls.
For there are few men who can aver, with
perfect accuracy, that they have never added a foot or two to their
longest shot, or to the highest jump of their favourite horse, and
have never, in short, exaggerated a difficulty in order to increase
the triumph of overcoming it. But the modesty that oonfines most
men within reasonable limits of untruthfulness has no restraining
power over the Spurious Sportsman, to whom somewhat, therefore,
may be forgiven for the sake of the warning he affords.
He is, as a rule, a dweller in London, for it is there that he finds
the largest stock of credulity and tolerance. To walk with him in
the streets, or to travel with him in a train, is to receive for nothing
a liberal education in sport. No man has ever shot a greater number
of rocketing pheasants with a more unerring accuracy than he
has—in Pall Mall, St. James's Street, or Piccadilly. He will point
out to you the exact spot where he would post himself if the birds
were being driven from St. James's Square over the Junior Carlton
Club. He will then expatiate learnedly on angle, and swing, and
line of flight, and having raised his stick suddenly to his shoulder,
by way of an example, will knock off the hat of an inoffensive
paster-hy. This incident will remind him of an adventure he had
while shooting with Lord X.—"A deuoed good ohap at bottom; a
bit stiff at first, but the best fellow going when you really know
him"—through the well-known coverts of his lordship's estate.
When travelling safely in a railway-carriage, he is the boldest cross-
country rider in existence. He will indicate to you a fence full of
dangers, and having taught you how it may best be cleared, will
add, that it is nothing to one that he jumped last season with the
Quytchley. "My dear Sir," he will say, "a man who was riding
behind me was so astounded that he measured it then and there with
a tape he happened to have with him; Six foot of post and rail as
stiff as an iron-clad, and twenty foot of gravel-pit beyond." He
will also speak with infinite contempt of those who crane" or
stick to the roads. It will sometimes happen to him to get invited—
really invited—to an actual country house where genuine sport is
carried on. Here, however, he will generally have brought with
him his wrong gun, or his idiot of a man" will have paoked the
wrong kind of cartridges, or his horse will have suddenly developed
"' i_ble triok of refusing, which results in a crushed nat
and a mud-stained coat for his rider. These little accidents will by
no means dash his spirits, or impair his volubility in the smoking-
room, where he may be heard conducting a dull discussion on
sporting records, or carrying on an animated controversy about
powder, size of shot or bore, choke, the proper kind of gaiter, or the
right stamp of horse for the country. Having shot with indifferent
results on a very big day through coverts, he will afterwards aver
that such sport is very poor fun, and that what he really oares
about is a tramp over heather or turnips, and a small bag at the
end of the day; but if he should ever be found on a grouse moor,
or a partridge shooting, he will sneer at the inferior quality of a
sport which requires that a man should exhaust himself with useless
walking exercise before he gets near his birds. Covert-shooting
is the game, my boy;" he will say, "most difficult thing in the
world when the pheasants are tall, and the finest test of a real
sportsman," and with that he will miss his twentieth grouse, and
call down imprecations on the dogs, the light, the keeper, and his
own companions.
The Spurious Sportsman is often an officer of the auxiliary forces.
He knows by heart every button of the British Army, talks much
upon questions of discipline, and has a more
sharply defined and more permanent mark
of sunburn across his forehead than any
regular officer. He is also a great stickler
for etiquette, and prefers to be addressed
as Major or Colonel, as the case may be.
He bears his rank upon his visiting-cards,
and frequents a military Club. In the
society of other Spurious Sportsmen he is
at his best and noblest. They gather to-
gether at their resorts, each with the
sincere oonviction that every other member
of the little coterie is a confirmed hum-
bug. Yet they never fail to bring their
store of goods, their anecdotes, their expe-
riences, their adventures, and their feats, to
a market where admiration and applause are
paid down with a liberal hand; for though
all iknow their fellows to be impostors,
they are content to sink this knowledge in
the desire to gain acceptance and credence
for themselves, and thus there never comes
a whisper of doubt, hesitation, or disbelief
to mar the perfect harmony in which the
Spurious Sportsmen live amongst them-
selves. Yet, when they have separated, they
never fail to hold one another up to ridicule
and contempt.
The Spurious Sportsman thus spends the
greater part of his life in building up a reputation ont of nothing.
As time goes on, he becomes more and more anecdotically expe-
rienced, and. if possible, even less actual. He will have lost his
nerve lor riding, and a sight which gets daily weaker will have
oaused him to abandon even the pretence of handling his gun; but

he will seek a recompense by becoming a sporting authority, and
will pass a doddering old age in lamenting over the decay of all
those qualities which formerly made a sportsman a sportsman, and
a man a man,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [August 16, 1890.
'ARRY ON THE 'OLIDAY SEASON.
Deab Charlie,—'Ow are ycr, my pippin?
'Ere's 'oliday season come round.
And I'm 08 on the galoot somewheres, and
that pooty soon, you be bound;
But afore I make tracks for dear Parry, or
slope for the Scheldt or the Rhine,
My 'art turns to turmuts and you, and I feel
I mutt drop yer a line.
You gave me a invite this
season. 1 know, my dear
boy. Well, yer see
It's thit way. The green
tooral-looral's all right,
but it 'ardly suits Me!
When you're well in the
swim, my dear Charlie,
along o' the reglar eleet,
You must do as they do,
for a swell, like a Bobby,
must stick to his beat.
It's expected, old man, it's
expected. Jest fancy me
slinging my '00k
For old Turmutshire, going
out nuttin', or bobbing
for fish in a brook 1
Not der wriggle, dear boy,
I assure y ou. Could stars
of Mayfair be content
To round upon Rome or the
Riggi, and smug up in
Surrey or Kent?
No fear! Cherry orchards
is jxwty, and 'ops 'as ad-
mirers, no doubt;
But it's only when sport
is afoot as the country 's
worth fussin' about.
Your toff likes the turmuts
or stubbles when poultry
is there to be shot.
Bat corn-fields and cab-
bage-beds, Charlik?
Way oh I that's all middle-
class rot.
There wos a time, Chablie,
I own it, when Richmond
'ud do me to rights.
And a fortnight at Margit
meant yum-yum to look
for and dream on o'
nights;
I j was inneroent then, a
young geeser, too modest
for this world, dear boy;
Didn't know you'd to do
wot was proper, and not
what you think you'd
enjoy.
Ah! NobbUs obliges, old
pardner, and great is the
power of " form";
Rads may rail at "the
clarses like ginger, but
all on us likes to be
"warm,"
And rub shoulders with
suckles more shiny. Wy,
life's greatest pulls, dont-
cherknow,
Are to look up to sparklers
above us, and down on
poor duffers below.
'Ardly know wioh is lummiest, swelp me!
It's nuts to '00k on to a swell,
Like I did at a Primrose meet lately with
sweet Lady Clabe Caramel.
When her sunshade shone red on my face,
mate, me givin' my arm through the crush,
Wy I felt like Mong Blong in the mornin',
and looked like a bride, one big blush.
Noddy SrBiGGiNS.'Ae spotted me, Chablie,—
him being left out in the cold,—
And to see him sit down on his topper, and
turn off as yaller as gold,
Wos as good as a pantermime. Oh! if there's
one thing more nicer than pie,
It's to soar like a bird in the sight of the
flats as can't git on the fly.

'ARRY ON THE BOULEVARDS.
But I'm wandering, Chablie, I'm wander-
ing. 'Oliday form is my text.
Last year it was Parry and Switzerland;
'ardly know where to go next.
I should much like to try Monty Carlo, and
'ave a fair flatter for onoe,
But I fear it won't run to it, pardner; my
boss is the dashdest old dunoe.
Won't raise me to three quid a week, the old
skinflint. Though travelling's cheap.
It do scatter the stamps jest a few, if you
don't care to go on the creep.
Roolette might jest set me up proper, bat
then, dontcherknow, it might not,
And I fear I should come back cleared out,
if my luck didn't land me a pot.
Oh, dash them spondu-
licks! The pieces is all
as I wants for my 'elth.
And then them darned
Sosherlist jugginses 'owl
till all's blue agin
Wealth.
It gives me the ditherums,
Chablis; it do, dear old
man, and no kid.
Wy, they'd queer the best
pitches in life, if they
ki boshed the Power of
the Quid 1
There's Venice again! I
could start this next
weekwithacoupleo' pals;
But yer gondoler's 'ardly
my form, and I never
wos nuts on canals.
Waggles saystAey're not
like the Grand Junction,
as creeps sewer - like
through our parks;
Well, Waggles may sniff;
I'm not sure, up to now,
mate, as Venice means
larks.
'Arf a mind to try Parry
once more. It 'a a place
as you soon git to love;
There is always some fun
afoot there, as will keep
a chap fair on the shove.
Pooty scenery's all very
proper, bat glaciers and
snow-peaks do pall,
And as to yer bloomin'
Black Forests, the Bor
der Bouhmg beats 'em all.
After all, there is something
quite 'ome-like in Parry
—so leastways I think;
It's a place where yon
don't seem afraid to larf
'arty, or tip gals the wink;
Sort o' tan janey feeling
about it, my pippin'—
you know wot 1 mean.
You don't feel too fur from
old Fleet Street, steaks,
"bitter," and "God
Save the Queen.'"
When your Britisher tra-
vels, he travels, but likes
to be Britisher still;
With his Timet and his
"tub" heis'appy; with-
out 'em he's apt to feel ill.
Wy, when I was last year
in Parry, I went for a
Bully vard crawl
One night arter supper,
when who should I spot
but my pal Bobby Ball.
He wos doin' the gay at a Caffy, was Bob,
petty vair, and all that,
Togged up to the nines with his claw-hammer,
cuff-shooters, gloves, and crush-hat.
"Wot oheer, Bobbt, old buster I" I bellered;
and up from his paper he looks.
Ah! and didn't we 'ave a rare night on it,
Charlie! We both know our books.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The paper'on "Old 0.," in the Gentleman''» Magazine, by
Edward Walford, M.A., is interesting up to a certain point, but
after that disappointing. "Oliver," says the Baron, impersonating
Oliver for the time being, "asks for more." And
much the same observation have I to make on
another paper about Irish Characters in English
Dramatic Literature, by W. J. LAWRENCE.
Although the writer ranges from Shakspearb to
Boucicault, and mentions authors, plays, and
aotors, yet he has omitted Hudson who, after
Poweb and, before Boucicault, was, in his own
particular line, one of the best delineators of Irish
character on the stage. He played chivalrous
parts that Boucicault would not have attempted.
There are historical Irish types still to be repre-
sented; and when Irish melodrama, with its
secret plots, murders, wicked land-agents, jovial
musoular-christian priests, comic male peasants,
and pretty and virtuous female ditto, shall have
taken a rest for a while, Irish Comedy may yet
have its day.
"Am Loeca." The very best letter I have ever seen on this
important subject appeared August 9th, written by that eminent
author, who makes a vain attempt at concealing his identity under
the signature of "Archimellion," and addressed to the Great
Journalistic Twin Brethren, the Editorial Proprietors and Pro-
prietorial Editors of The Whirlwind, whose Court Circular reporter
(this by the way) might appropriately adopt the historic name of
"Blastus, the King s Chamberlain." The argument in Abchi-
suluon's remarkable letter is decidedly sound. Bat surely he is
wrong in supposing that the astral reverberation of the podasma
(one in six) could possibly be ratiocinated on the coleoptic intensity ■'
Perhaps he will deny that he ever said so. But did he mean it t
To me this has been the sweet familiar study of a lifetime, and,
without boastful egoism, I may say I am considered, by all who

The Intelligent Foreigner carefully picked his way amongst the
ruins to Downing Street, and was soon in consultation with the
Premier.
"This merely is a call of courtesy," he observed; "of
am not in the least bound to give you
notice, but think it civil to do so."
The British Premier bowed, as if in-
viting further particulars.
"Well, O-Hano-Hit and I have settled
everything," continued the Visitor; "he
takes the Isle of Wight, while I assume
the Protectorate of Scotland, India, and
the Channel Islands."
"What!" exclaimed the British
Premier, aghast at the information.
"And what if we resist?"
"Resist I" laughed the New Zealander, "Why that would cost
a halfpenny in the pound more Income Tax, and your rate-payers
would never submit to that I Besides, our disease-spreading tor-
pedoes (to which our own people are acclimatised) would Boon silence

"Oh, you don't come in at all. But don't be alarmed, we are
only contributing our quota to the glorious cause of Peace!" And

the Jews has just begun again. Cruel shame, but I daren't say this

Really humorous that, I 'm sure, and 19,000 miles from England.
To-day—I don't know what to-day is, having lost all count of

word, they say, and as to reading their letters—I mean the letters
of their alphabet—that is if they've got one, which I very muoh
doubt,—why I might as well be a blind man for all I can make out.
Somehow I rather think that it' s the Emperor's birthday. Guns and
bells all over the place. Guns going off, bells going on. Tremendous
crowds everywhere. "I am never so lonely," as somebody said, "as
when I'm in a crowd." That's just what I feel, especially when
the crowd doesn't talk a single word of English.
The Russians are not ill-favoured but ill—
flavoured, that is, in a crowd. I cheered with
them, "Hiphiphurrahski! Hipski! Hurrah-

AUTOMATIC PROGRESS.
The Proprietors of the " Automatic Chair " having had reason to
think their invention such a success that they have turned it into a
Company, a stimulus has been given to ingenuity in this direction,
with the result that the following prospective advertisement, or some-
thing very much like it, may shortly be expected to see the light:—
THE AUTOMATIC FURNITURE SUPPLY ASSOCIATION,
started for the purpose of meeting the daily-increasing demand
for self-acting and trouble-saving appliances in the _ domestic
arrangements of the modern household, beg to inform their patrons
that they are now able to supply them with

THE AUTOMATIC FOUR-POSTER. — This ingeniously con-
structed piece of furniture will tuok up the occupant, rook
him to sleep, and pitch him out on to the floor at a given hour in the
morning, thoroughly waking him by the operation, when it will of
its own accord fold itself up into a conveniently-shaped parcel, not
bigger than an ordinary carriage umbrella. The Association further
desire to inform their patrons that they have also invented a
PATENT AUTOMATIC SHOWER-BATH AND WA8H-
HAND-STAND, that will forcibly seize the user, thoroughly
souse him from head to foot, sorub, wash, and dry him. Finally
folding itself up into a convenient lounge, on which he can complete
his toilette at leisure. They also are prepared to supply their
AUTOMATIC DINNER-TABLE AND APPETITE COM-
BINED, upon taking a seat at whioh, the diner will be
immediately served with a course consisting of soup, fish, joint, and
vegetables, choice of entries, sweets, cheese, and celery, with an
appetite to enable him to relish the repast as it proceeds. After-
dinner speeches, phonographioally introduced, can be supplied at a
slight additional charge. They, moreover, have in hand an
AUTOMATIC BUTLER-DETECTING SIDEBOARD, which,
by an ingenious contrivance, on the Butler opening it for the
purpose of helping himself to a glass of wine, instantly blows up
with a loud explosion, that obliges him to desist in his design. But
their chief triumph is their
AUTOMATIC AND MECHANICAL SHAREHOLDER,

last the Association regard as a great success, but they have several
other startling novelties in active preparation.

STARS IN THE STRAND; OR, THE HORSE AND THE LADY.
My Dk4k Mb. Punch,
One of the greatest attractions in Town to the Country
Cousin I need scarcely say is the Theatre. Speaking for myself, it is
the place I earliest visit when I get to London, and consequently I
was not surprised to find myself the other evening in the Adelphi, on
the first night of a new play. As an Irishman might guess, from
its name (The English Rote), the piece is all about Ireland. Both State
and Church are represented therein—the former by a comio sergeant of


not quite convincing. It was a very good part. In the First Aot she
had to coax her papa, and flirt with her cousin; in the second, to
respond to a declaration of love with a burst of womanly feeling:
and, in the third, to play the hoyden, and dance a breakdown. All
this was done to perfection, but not by a young lady of eighteen.
Miss Ada Rkhan was charming, but looked, and I fanoy felt, many
years older than her legal majority. I question whether she was an
ingenue at all, but, if she were, she was an ingenue of great and
varied experience. When Mrs. Bancboft appeared as the girl-pupil
in School, she was the oharacter to the life; but when Miss Rehan
calls herself Etna, throws herself on sofas, and hugs a man with
less inohes than herself, we cannot but feel that it is very superior
play-acting, but still play-acting. Take it all round, I was
delighted with the lady at the Lyceum, and the horse at the Adelphi,
and nearly regret that, having to leave town, I shall not have the
opportunity of seeing either of them again.
Yours faithfully, A Critic from the Country.
A HOLIDAY APPEAL.
Eisino to tub Situation!
{Scene from a well-mounted Drama.)
the Royal Constabulary, and the latter by a priest, who wears a hat in
the first Act that would have entirely justified his being Boycotted.
The plot is not very strong, and suggests recollections of the Flying
Scud, Arrah Na Pogue, and The Silver King. The acting is
fairly satisfactory, the cast including a star, supported by an
efficient company. The star is a horse that pranced about the stage
in the most natural manner possible, carefully avoiding the orchestra.
In spite, however, of his anxiety to keep out of the stalls, suggestive
as they were (but only in name) of the stable, some little alarm was
created in the neighbourhood of the Conductor, which did not entirely
subside until the fall of the curtain. But the sagacious steed knew
its business thoroughly well, and was indeed an admirable histrion.
Only once, at the initial performance, did this intelligent creature
remember its personality, and drop the publio aotor in the private
individual. The occasion was when it had to put its head out of a
loose-box to listen to the singing of a serio-comic song by a lady,
dressed as a " gossoon." For a few minutes the talented brute made a
pretence of eating some property foliage, and then, catching sight of
the audience, it deliberately counted the house! I regret to add that,
in spite of the valuable support afforded by this useful member of
the Messrs. Gatti's Company, its name did not appear in the playbill.
A few evenings later I had a second time the advantage of being
present at a first night's performance. The occasion was, the pro-
duction of The
Great Unknown,
by Augustin
Daly's Company
of Comedians. I
found the pieoe
described as a
"new eccentric
Comedy," but,
beyond a certain
oddnesB in the
distributionof
the characters of
the oast, did not
notice much
novelty or eccen-
trioity. The life
and soul of the
evening's enter-
tainment was
Miss Ada Rehan,
a talented lady,
who (so I was
A Breakdown at the Lyceum! told) has made
(Importedfrom the Gaiety.) her mark in
Rosalind, in At You Like It, and Katharina, in the Taming of the
Shrew. I can quite believe that Miss Rku an is a great success in
parte of the calibre of the Shakspearian heroines I have mentioned:
nay, more, I fancy she would do something with Lady Macbeth, ana
be quite in her element as Emilia^ in Othello. But, as she had to
play an ingtnue, aged eighteen, in The Great Unknown, she was

to continue this unquestionably excellent work.]
It is Holiday Time, and all suoh as can pay,
For the Summer-green oountry are up and away;
But what of the poor pale-faced waifs of the slums?
Oh, the butterfly flits, and the honey-bee hums
O'er the holt and the heather, the hill and the plain,
But they flit and they hum for Town's children in vain;
Unless—ah I unlets—there is hope in that word 1—
Mrs. Jeune's kindly plea by the Public is heard.
Heard? Everyone feels 'tis a duty to listen.
The eyes of the' children will sparkle and glisten,
In hope of the beauty, at thought of the fun,
For they know their kind champion, and what she has done,
And is ready to do for them all once again.
If folks heed her appeal. Shall she make it in vain?
Three weeks in the country for poor Bob and Bess!
Do you know what that means, wealthy cit? Can you guess,
Dainty lady of fashion, with dots " of your own,
Bright-eyed and trim-vestured, well-fed and well-grown?
Well, Bobby 's a cripple, and Bess has a cough,
Whioh, untended, next winter may " carry her off,"
As her folks in their unrefined diction deolare;
They are dying, these children, for food and fresh air,
And their slum is muoh more like a sewer than a street,
Whilst their food is—not such as your servants would eat;
Were they housed like your horses, or fed like your dogs.
They would think themselves lucky; that's how the world jogs!
But three weeks in the country! Why, that would mean joy,
And new life for the girl, and fresh strength for the boy.
The meadow would heal them, the mountain might save,
Won't you give them a chance on the moor, by the wave?
Why, of course! Fbu'have only to know, Punch to aBk,

To those who are fond of glitter tempered
with good taste, something suitable to
their requirements is sure to be found

rather, every evening at 10"30 and 9)
there are two excellent ballets being
played there, called respectively Cecile
and the Dream of Wealth. The first
is dramatic in the extreme, and the last,
with its precious metals and harmonious
setting, is worth its weight in notes—
musical notes. There is plenty of poetry
in both spectaoles—the poetry of motion. Further, as containing
an excellent moral, it may be said that this pair of spectacles is
suitable to the sight of everyone, from Materfamilias up from the
oountry to Master Jacky home for his Midsummer holidays,

At the last General Meeting of the L. C. & D., their Chairman
made one of his best speeches. Prospects were bright, and hearts
were light, just to drop into poetry. Sir E. Watktjt, alias 8. Eastern
Watkin, had some time ago been assured judicially of the faot that
Folkestone meant Folkestone as clearly as Brighton means Brighton,
or Ramsgate means Ramsgate, and the two great Companies were,
it was hoped, soon to come to an agreement and live happily ever
afterwards. Among other plans for the future, the popular and astute
Chairman more than hinted that the day was not far distant when,
in consequence of the increasing patronage bestowed on the im-
proved third-class carriages, the trains of the L. C. & D. Company
would be made up of first and third, and the middle class would
be out of it altogether. This will be a blow to those whose travel-
ling motto has hitherto been "In medio tutissimus ibis." But, on
the other hand, if the second-class be dropped, the L. C. & D. can
adopt the proud motto, " Nulli Secundus." Mr. Punch, Universal
Managing Director, in charge of thousands of lines, wishes them the
benefit of the omen.

Last week I published a dispatch conveying to me the exalted
approval of H.8.H. the Grand Duke of Pfeifentopf. The closing

said that, with one aged attendant, he mounted the topmost tower,
prepared, if no sign of succour showed itself, to cast himself to the
ground or perish in the attempt. But juBt as he had hurled Mb
seneschal over the battlements, in order, as he playfully observed,
to make the falling softer, his eye was arrested by a wreath of smoke
in the middle distance. "May I perish," said the gallant but sorely-
reduced Teuton warrior, "if that be not the war-sign of my unole
Pfeifentopf." Hastening downstairs, he apprised Mb followers
that succour was at hand. Armed with klehs, they made a desperate
sally, and, having taken the Zig-'arets between two fires, utterly
extinguished them. That night Hundsvbtteb's only daughter, the
lovely and accomplished Breia, was solemnly married by the Aroh-
bishop of Tandstickob, assisted by the Rev. Wilhelm Schwanz-
pddel and the Rev. Conbad Rattenzahn, cousin of the bride, to the
K. K. Obebpotztausendee von Tht/twbh, the leader of Pfeifen-
topf's advance-guard. The bride's going-away dress was composed
of a simple bodice of best Sheffield steel, with a gown of Bessemer
composite to match, and, in honour of the event, the Honigthau
Order was ceremoMously founded.
I have cited tMs tale at length, because some carping, malevolent
scribes have dared to insinuate, aotually to insinuate in print, that
the Grand Duke and Ms Order have no existence. To these jelly-
faced purveyors of balderdash I only say tMs :—How, if Sis Serene
Highness be a myth, could I receive from him the letter I published
last week? But, to make assuranoe doubly sure, I sent the following
dispatch to the Grand Duke:—" Moonoalves cast anserous doubts on
your serene existence, and on that of Order. Kindly make me Grand
Cross, and send decoration in diamonds." To this I have reoeived
the following reply:—"You are Grand Cross made. Order mit
diamenien undperlen now is being at the post-offioe by my Grand
Chamberlain for transmission abroad registered."
This should strike detraction dumb. I propose also to publish a
selection of congratulations from other Continental potentates, but
of tMs, as Shaxspbabb says, Anon, anon 1
Permit me, in the meantime, to go half-way towards revealing my
identity by, adopting a pseudonym drawn from an immortal work,
and suMcribing myself prophetioally yours (and the publio's),
Tippoo Tip.
A NEW PLAQUE.
Sib,—I understand that those who suffer oppression are permitted
to turn to you for relief, and I am told further, that there is no wrong
wMoh you are unable to remedy. Listen for a few moments to my
tale of woe, and then say if you can strike a blow on my behalf. I
am an author, that is to say, I have written a book, and have lately
published it at my own expense. I.was told by a friend of mine,
who has some experience in these matters (he is the Sporting
Correspondent of the Fortnightly Glass of Fashion), that it would
be well for me to make some arrangement with my publishers as to
Royalty. I therefore gave orders that presentation copies, suitably
bound, were to be forwarded to Her Graoious Majesty and the rest
of the Royal Family, including, of course, the Duke of Clabencb.
My publisher seemed surprised, but offered no objection, and I was
therefore able to congratulate myself on having successfully smoothed
over a difficulty wMoh, if I am to believe Mr. Walteb Besant, too
often troubles the young author. This, however, is neither here
nor there. I merely mention the incident to show that I am not
altogether laoking in savoir faire.
As I said, I am an author. My book is a romance entitled, The
Foundling's Farewell. Of course you have" heard of it. It is blood-
curdling but sympathetic, romantic but realiBtio, pathetio and
sublime. The passage, for instanoe, in wMch the Duke of Babtlbmy
repels the advances of the orphan charwoman is but you have
read it, and I need not therefore enlarge further upon it. After it
had been published two days, I began to look eagerly into all the
daily and weekly papers for critical notices of my magnum opus.
I persisted for a fortnight, and failing to see any, wrote an angry
letter to my publishers. On that very day the last post brought
me three letters in unknown hands. I opened the first listlessly, I
read what it contained, and (may an author confess his weakness P)
gave a wild shout of triumph when I found that one of the enclosures
was a newspaper extract referring to my work. Here it is, as it
appeared on the form enclosed:—
The United Association of Combined Paragraphists.
MK. WILLIAM WHORBOYS.
(From the Pimlico Potterer. July 6th.)
"Amongst the books of the month we may notioe The Foundling's
FarewellToj Mb. William Whobbots, an author whose name we
have not hitherto met with. It is a romanoe of surpassing interest,
the subject being treated with all the oonvinoing'power of a master-
hand. We shall look forward eagerly to Mb. Whobboi's next
work."
With this there came a polite letter from the U. A. C. P., asking
me to allow them to supply me with all newspaper cuttings referring
to me or to my book from "tile entire English, American, and
Continental Press." Another leaflet stated the terms on wMoh they
were prepared to take this immense trouble on my behalf.
Here, at last, thought I to myself, is Fame. The other two
letters contained the same extract, and similar requests from "The
Universal Notioe-Mongers," and "The British Cutting Company
(Limited)." I decided in favour of the U. A. C. P., sent them two
guineas, and waited. TMee days afterwards there came a scrubby
little roll of paper, with a halfpenny stamp on it. I saw the magio
letters U. A. C. P. upon it, and tore it open. It oontained a news-
paper cutting, which nothing but my desire to be truthful would
force me to publish. But here it is:—" The stuff that is palmed off
upon a hapless public by aspiring idiots, who are vain enough to
imagine that they are novelists, is astounding. The latest of these
is a certain William Whobbots, whose book, The Foundling's
Farewell, is remarkable only for its ungrammatical dulness, &c, &o."
The next post brought me the same cutting, sent gratuitously, out
of spite, I suppose, T>y the two Extract CompaMes to whom I had
preferred the U. A. C. P., and from four others who desired my
custom. During the following week not a day passed without the
receipt of that accursed cutting from some new extraot company.
Sinoe then I have waited some months, but nothing more has
appeared. My subscription, I find, has only a year to run. The
question is, what can I do? My life has been blighted by the
U. A. C. P., poisoned by " The UMversal Notice-Mongers," and the
cup of happiness has been dashed from my lips by " The British
Cutting Company (Limited)."
I know I am not alone in this. My friend Habtvig, who is_ an
actor, has been similarly treated. He gets all the insulting notices
of his great performances with extraordinary regularity, but never
a favourable one. Buncombe, who is standing lor Parliament, reoeives
bushels of extracts from the local Radical paper, he being a Tory
Democrat. We intend to combine and do something desperate. Is
there not some method of winding up Companies, or putting them
into liquidation, or appointing reoeivers? Pray let me know, and
oblige yours in misery, William Whobbom,
Author of" The Foundling's Farewell."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RUMOURS FOR THE RECESS.
Monday.—Wo hear, from a source which cannot possibly ho
mistaken, that a thorough reconstruction of the Cabinet is imminent.
Mr. Sm-th goes at once to the Upper House. Mr. B-if-r becomes
First Lord, and Leader of the Commons. A position will be found
for Mr. G-8CH-N somewhere on the Gold Coast, and thus room will
be made for Lord R-nd-lph Ch-rch-ll, whose popularity in
official Conservative oiroles is undiminished. Lord H-rt-ngt-n will
probably not become Prime Minister just yet.
Tuesday.—Since yesterday, some slight modifications in Ministerial
arrangements have been made. Mr. Sm-th, for example, does not
go to the House of Lords, nor Mr. G-sch-n to the Gold Coast.
Moreover, no attempt has been made to induce Lord R-nd-lph to
enter the Cabinet, and Mr. B-lf-r is not to be Leader of the House.
Otherwise, the rumoured reconstruction was quite correct. _ Lord
H-rt-ngt-n's acceptance of the post of Prime Minister is considered
to be merely a matter of time.
Wednesday.—No fresh reconstruction is announced to-day, as
Ministers are mostly out of Town. Lord IT-rt-ngt-n declines to
be interviewed on the subject of the Premiership.
Thursday.—An entirely fresh readjustment of Ministerial forces
is on the tapis. Great excitement prevails at Westminster. Nobody
exactly knows why, but it is expected that substitutes will be found
for Mr. G-sch-w, Mr. Sm-th, Mr. B-lf-b, Mr. M-tth-ws, Mr.
R-tch-e, and Lord H-lsb-bt. Lord H-bt-not-n is said to have
referred all persons who questioned him about his acceptance of the
Premiership, to Lord 8-l-sb-by.
Friday.—Mr. M-tth-ws has been offered the Governorship of
Madras, and has declined. He has been sounded as to whether he
would accept the High Commissionership of the unexplored parts of
Central Africa, and has replied evasively. Two prominent Members
of the Cabinet are said not to be on speaking terms, and are
practising the dumb alphabet in consequence. It is positively
asserted, that the Lord Advocate will be the next Leader of the
House of Commons. Lord H-bt-ngt-n's chances of the Premier-
ship have not improved.
Saturday.—A total and absolutely fresh reconstruction of the
Cabinet, giving everybody a new place, and every place a new
holder, is expected immediately. Details will follow shortly. For
the present Lord H-bt-hgt-it remains outside the Cabinet, and has
gone to Newmarket.
WEEK BY WEEK.
We have often been asked how we contrive to put together every
week the delightful paragraphs which appear in this column. The
system is really wonderfully easy, and, with proper instruction, a
child could do it. The first point is to select an item of intelligence
about which few people care to hear. This must be spun out very
thin and long, and adorned with easy extracts from Tcpper, the
copy-books, or Mr. W. H. Smith's speeches. iThen wrap it up in a
blanket of humour, sprinkle with fatuousness, and serve cold.
For instance, you hear that grey frock-ooats are very much worn.
On the system indicated above you proceed as follows:—It is curious
to observe how from year to year the customs and fashions of men
with regard to their wearing apparel change. Last year black frock
coats were de rigueur. This year, we are informed by a Corre-
spondent who has special opportunities of knowing what he is writing
about, various shades of grey have driven out the black. No doubt
it is every man's duty to himself and his neighbours to array himself
becomingly, according to the fashion of the hour, but we are inclined
to doubt the wisdom of this latest move. It is often said, that the
grey mare is the better horse, but when the hone itself has a grey
coat, the proverb seems inapplicable.
The rest of the space allotted can be filled with political gossip and
personal items, with here and there some inspired twaddle about
foreign personages, of whom no one has ever heard before or desires
to hear again.
We beg to state that we offer this information gratis to all intend-
ing journalists. If they follow our system they must succeed.

"Sat 1 "—Speaking of the relations between England and France
in Africa, and of the proposed Bill for a Sahara railway, connect-
ing Algeria with Lake Tchad, the Times' Paris Correspondent says:—
England, it is explained, agrees not to go beyond Say, on the
Niger." This sounds ominous. It was Lord Granvillk's indispo-
sition to go beyond "Say" (and to shrink when it came to " Do")
which got us into hot water in Africa before. Mr. Punch hopes,
despite this disquieting sentence, that Lord Salisbury, after his
excellent speech at the Mansion House, is unlikely to fall into the
same fatal error.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FEOM THE DIARY OF TOBT, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, August 4.—George Campbell been
with us many Sessions; heard and seen a good deal of him, but really
seems only now to be coming out. Has taken up the Police Bill,
"and I wish," says Henby Matthews, sotto voce, the Police would
in return take Aim up."
George literally over-
whelms the place, breaks
out everywhere; began
at earliest moment with
question of precedence.
Cardinal Manning been
granted precedence on
certain Royal Commis-
sions. "Why should the
Cardinal be thus hon-
oured f" Geoboe wants
to know. "There is the Modera-
tor of the Sootoh Free Church.
Why shouldn't he, too, have
princely rank?"
Lobs Advocate snubs Camp-
bell, and he momentarily re-
sumes his seat. Ten minutes
later shrill ory of pibroch heard
again. Everyone knows that
Campbell is coming, and here
he is, tall, gaunt, ieen-faoed,
shrill-voiced, wanting to know
at the top of it whioh of Heb
Majesty's Ministers advises
Heb Majesty on questions of
precedence?
"There is," said Gobst, re-
flectively gazing on his manly
form, "one precedence we would
all concede to Campbell. We
would gladly write on the bench
where he usually sits— The C impbell is speaking, oh dear, oh
'Not lost, but gone before.'" _, dear! . „ . ,. . a i.

but Geobge has a little way of pleasantly surprising the House.
Members looking across see this Bench empty. "Ah! ah!" they
say to themselves,
"the Campbells
are gone. Now
we '11 have a few
minutes' peace
and get on with

denly, d propos

from below the

makes answer.

cry is uplifted, and, without looking: np, men know Campbell is
making his fifteenth speech.
"On the whole," says Plunxet, "I'm not sure that the habits
of Pof.'s raven were not less irritating. It is true that on its first
arrival it hopped about the floor, wherein it resembles our honour-
able friend: but afterwards, having once perohed upon the pallid
bust of Pallas, it was good enough to remain there. Bad enough,
I admit; hut surely that situation preferable to ours, not knowing
from moment to moment from
what particular quarter Camp-
bell may next present him-
self."
Business done.—Police Bill
obstructed.
Tuesday. — Hanbury came
down to-day full of virtuous
resolution and stern resolve.
Privileges of House of Com-
mons have been struck at, and
through him; Dartmouth,
Lord-Lieutenant of Stafford-
shire, has been writing things
in the papers; rebukes Han-
bt/bt, as a Magistrate for
Staffordshire," for having
made certain speech in Com-
mons about Grenadier Guards.
Hanbubt hitherto said no-
thing in public on the matter;
has been in communication
with Dartmouth by post and
telegram; has boldly vindi-
cated privileges of Commons;
has brought the insolent Lord-
Lieutenant to his knees; but
till this moment has made no
public reference to the part he
played. Has borne, unsoothed
by companionship, the sorrow
of the House of Commons.
Now hour has struck; he
may come to the front, and,
with habitual modesty of mien,
indicate rather than describe
the imperishable service he
has done the Commons. House,
all unconscious of what is in
store for it, wantons at play.
Innumerable questions on
paper. Summers coming up
fresh with batch of new con-
undrums. Patrick O'Brien
"having had his attention
called" to some verses by
Swinburne, proposes to read
them. House wickedly delighted at prospect of Swinburne being
haltingly declaimed with North Tipperary accent localised by com-
panionship with the Town Commissioners of Nenagh; Speaker thinks
it might be funny, but wouldn't be business; so Patrick having
begun, "Night brings but one red star—Tyrannicide," is sternly
pulled up. Old Morality says he's never seen "the publica-
tion ;" has asked friends near him, and everyone says he has neither
seen, heard, nor read of it. "The House," says the Speaker, by way
of crushing ignominy, "has no control over the poet Swinburne."
So House deprived of its anticipated lark; all the while Hanbury,
with hands in pockets, sits staring gloomily forth, rather pitying than
resentful. House of course does not know what is in store for it;
still this trifling at the very moment when, though all unconsciously,
the Commons have been saved from contumelious outrage, racks the
soul that carries with it the momentous secret.

W. H. SMITH AS "THE ROVER OF THE SEAS."
"Once more on board the Luoobb, and I a m Free!"
At last Hanbury's opportunity comes I Rises slowly, solemnly, to
full height; in deep base tones, asks permission to make personal
statement. House instantly alert, and attentive; baulked of its
fun with Patrick, here is promise of fresh larks. Hanbury, his pro-
found base notes sometimes trembling with emotion, proceeds to
unfold his story; reads long letter from Dartmouth; Members, dis-
covering that the portentous business relates to some trumpery
correspondence in the newspapers, begin to cough, shuffle their feet,
and even cry "Agreed!
Hanbury stops aghast. Can
it be possible f When he has
been vindicating privileges of
Commons, can Members thus
lightly treat incident? But
he will read them another
letter, one he wrote to Lord
Dartmouth. Anguished roar
burst forth from House; londer
ories of "Agreed! Agreed I"
Hanbury, gasping for breath,
looks round from side to side.
They cannot understand; will
read them another letter;
begins; storm increases; Han-
bury persists. Surely House
will he delighted to near his
final rejoinder to Dartmouth?
On the contrary, House will
have no more; and Hanbury,
Earned and panting, resumes
is seat, and business goes
forward as if he had not in-
terposed.
Business done. — A sudden
rush. All contentious Bills
through final stage.
Saturday.—Session suddenly
oollapsed. "Like over - ripe
tree," says Prince Arthur,
dropping into poetry, "the
fruit has fallen in a night."
Benohes nearly empty; Votes
passing in basketsful; pro-
rogue next week; to-day,
practically, last working time.
Old Morality iust come in,
in serge suit; left his straw
hat in his room: off shortly
on oruise in Pandora; already
shipped store of nautical
phrases. Putting his open
hand to the side of his mouth,
he (when George Campbell
was making one of his last
speeches), shouted out, "Belay
there!" Speaker pointed out that this was not Parliamentary
Ehrase. If Right Hon. Gentleman wanted to move the Closure,
e should do so in the form provided. Old Morality, standing
up, hitching his trowsers at the belt, scraping his right foot behind
him, and pulling his forelook, retorted
"I ask your honour's pardon; but these lubbers are so long-
winded." "Order! Order!" said Speaker.
Said good-bye, wishing him luok on the voyage; at parting
pressed on my acceptance a little book; found it a copy of the
Golden Treasury Edition of Sir Thomas Brown's Religio Medici:
page 167 turned down; passage marked; read these words:—
Though vicious times invert the opinions of things and set np a
new ethics against virtue, yet hold thou fast to Old Morality."
"I will," I said; and pressing his hand sheered off.
Business done.—All.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Invalid Touring Opportunity.—Tour idea of personally con-
waters in Europe, strikes us as quite admirable, and the further
advantages you offer in the shape of your being accompanied by six
Bat h-chairs, a donkey, a massage doctor, a galvanising machine,
tire-escape, and a hearse, seem to meet the demands !of the most
nervous and exaoting patients more than half way. Your provision,
too, for the recreation of your party—suoh an important consideration
where the nerves have been shattered and the health feeble—by the
engagement of a Learned Musical and Calculating Pig, and a couple
of Ethiopian Pashas, who can munch and swallow half-a-dozen wine-
glasses, and, if requested, remove their eye-balls, seems to offer a
prospect of many an evening's startling and even boisterous amuse-
ment; and if the Pig should have been palmed off on you by fraud,
you not having found it able to "calculate " at all, or even select
with its snout a number not previously fattened to a piece of onion,
though assisted in its selection, according to the directions, "with a
smart prod with a carving-fork," there still, as you truly say,
remains the alternative of disposing of it advantageously to some
German sausage-maker. As to the Ethiopian Pashas, if their feats,
as is just possible, shook and horrify, rather than divert and amuse
your invalid audience, you can, as you suggest, easily leave them
behind on your way, in settlement of one of your largest hotel bills.
Let us know when you start. Your "half-dozen paralytica " being
let down in a horse-box by a crane on to the boat, ought to oreate
quite a sensation, and we shall certainly be on the look-out for it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NOVELTY UP TO DATE.
The originality of the plot of The English Rose (the new play at
the A del phi) having been questioned, the following Scotch Drama is
published with a view of ascertaining if it has been done before.
Those of our readers who think they recognise either the situations

or any part of the dialogue, will kindly remember that treatment is
everything, and the imputation of plagiarism is the feeblest of all
charges. The piece is called Teltnah, and is written in Three Acts,
sufficiently concise to be given in full:—
Act I.
The Horse Guards Parade, Elsinore, near Edinburgh.
Enter MacClaudius, MacGebtbude, Brilliant Staff, and Scotch
Guards. The Colours are trooped.
Then enter Telmah, who returns salute of Sentries.
Mac Claudius. I am just glad you have joined us, Telmah.
Telmah. Really! 1 fancied some function was going on, '.but
thought it was a parade, in honour of my father's funeral.
Mac Gertrude (with a forced laugh). Don't be so absurd! Tour
poor father—the very best of men—died months ago.
Telmah [bitterly). So long!
Mac Claudius (aside). Ma gracious! He's in one of his nasty
tempers, MacGebtbude. Come away! (Aloud.) Believe me, 1
shall drink your health to-night, in Perrier Jouet of '74. Come!
[Exeunt with Queen and Guards.
Telmah. Oh! that this too solid flesh would melt! (Enter Ghost.)
Hallo! Who are you?
Ghost (impressively). I am thy father's spirit! List, Telmah,
oh, list!
Telmah. Would, with pleasure, were I not already a Major in
the Army, and an Hon. Colonel in the Militia.
Ghost (severely). None of your nonsense! (More mildly.) Don't
bo frivolous! (Confidentially.) I was murdered by a serpent, who
now wears my crown.
Telmah (in a tone of surprise). 0 my prophetio soul! Mine uncle?
Ghost. Right you are! Swear to avenge me!
Telmah (after an internal struggle). I swear!
[Solo for the big drum. Re-enter troops, spectral effect, and
tableau.
Act II. — Interior of the Palace of Elsinore, near Edinburgh,
arranged for Private Theatricals. MacClaudius, MacGkb-
tkcdk and Court seated, with Telmah acting as Prompter.
Mac Claudius (aside to MacPolonius). Lord Chamberlain, have
you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
MacPolonius. Well, Sire, as I understand it is not intended for
publio representation, I have not done more than glance at it. I am
told it is very clever, and called " The Mouse-trap."
Mac Gertrude. Rather an idiotio title! (Contemptuously.) "The
Mouse-trap!"
[Business. A King on the mimic stage goes to sleep, and a
shrouded figure pours poison'Jnto his ear. MacClaudius
rises abruptly.
Telmah (excitedly). He poisons him for his estate. His name's
MacGonzago. The story is extant, and writ in choice Italian. You
shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of MacGonzago's
wife!
Mac Claudius (angrily to MacPolonius). Chamberlain, we part this
day month! Ma gracious! \_Exit, followed by Queen and Court.
_ Telmah (exultantly). Now could I drink hot blood, and do such
bitter business as the day would quake to look on I
Ghost (entering abruptly). Well, do it! What's the good of all
this play-acting r Cut the ranting, and come to the slaughtering!
(Seizes Telmah by the arm.) If you are an avenger, behave as suchI
[Telmah greatly alarmed, sinks on his knees before Ghost, and
the Curtain falls on the tableau.
Act 111. — The Military Tournament at the Agricultural Hall,
Elsinore, near Edinburgh, Telmah, and MacLaebtes, dis-
covered fencing.
Captain MacOsric, R.A. (Superintendent of the Circus). A hit,
a palpable hit! (Telmah and MacLaebtes engage a second time,
and MacLaebtes wounds his opponent.) One to white! (Points out
MacLaebtes with a small flag. Another round, when Telmah
wounds MacLaebtes.) One to black!
[Touches Telmah with hisflag.
Mac Clan dius (pouring out a glass of cheap champagne). Here,
Telmah, you are heated, have a drink!
Telmah. I '11 play this bout first. Set it by awhile. (Aside to
Mac-Horatio, who smiles.) I know his cellar!
MacGertrude. I will take it for von, dear I (Impatiently.) Give
me the cup? (Seizes it.) The Queen carouses to thy fortunes,
Telmah! [Drinks eagerly and with gutto.
MacClaudius (aside). The poisoned oup at eighteen .-hillings the
dozen! It is too late! Ma gracious! [Quekn dies in agonies.
MacLaertet. Tklm»h, I am slain, and so are you—the foils are
tipped with poison! (Speaking with difficulty.) Prod the old 'nn!
[Dies.
Telmah. The point envenomed, too! Then venom do thy work!
[ Stabs King and dies.
Ghost (entering in blue fire, triumphantly to MacClaudius).
Now, you '11 remember me! [MacClaudius dies.
[Soft music. Scene sinks, discovering magn'fictnt funeral cere-
mony at the Abbey, Elsinore, near Edinburgh. A solemn
dirge (specially composed for this new and original piece) is
sung. Slow Curtain.

PROS AND CONS OF FOREIGN TRAVEL.
(By a Hesitating Trippist.)
Antwerp.—Lots of Rubens, but the Harwich route is objection-
able in " dusty " weather.
Boulogne.—Great attraction this year— Ex-Queen of Naples
installed—but the port, at low tide,
requires all the perfumes of Araby,
ana more.
Cologne. — Cathedral finished, but
local scent is accurately expressed by
"Oh!"
Dieppe.—Casino cheery, but the pas-
sage from Newhaven to French coast
at times too terrible for words.
Etretat.—Amusing society, but the
sanitary arrangements are rather ffcs^.
shady. •
Florence.—The Capital of Art, but at its worst in the dog days.
Geneva.—Within reach of Mont Blano, but hotels indifferent, even
when under " Royal Patronage."
Heidelberg.—Magnificent view from the Castle, but too many
Cooks spoil the prospect.
lnterlaken.—Jungfrau splendid, but not free from 'Abbtes and
'Abbiktts.
Jerusalem.—Interesting associations, but travelling on mule-back
is a trial to born pedestrians.
Kissingen.—Out of the beaten track, but query rather too much so.
Lucerne.—Lovely; but oomfort takes a back seat if the Sohweitzer-
hoff is full.
Madrid.—Plenty of pictures, but cholera in the neighbourhood.
Naples.—Famous Bay never off, but soarcely the place to face an
epidemic
Ouchy.—Beau Rivage beyond all praise, but environs uninteresting.
Paris.—Always pleasant—tare in August.
Quebec.—Possibly attractive to the wildly adventurous, but
soarcely worthy of a jaunt across the Atlantic
Rome.—The City of the Popes and the Gesare, but not to be
thought of before the early winter.
St. Malu.— Quaint old Breton port, but journey from Southamp-
ton frequently dangerous, and always disagreeable.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
VOCES POPULI.
COCKNEY COQUETKY: A STUDY IN REGENT'S PABK.
Scene—Near the Band-Stand. Time—7 p.m. on a Sunday in August.
CHARACTERS.
Polly (about 22; a tall brunette, of the respectable lower middle-class,
tcith a flow of light badinage, and a taste for tormenting).
Fm (18; her friend; shorter, somewhat less pronounced in manner;
rather pretty, simply and tastefully dressed: milliner or bonnet-
maker's apprentice).
Mr. Ernest Hawkins (otherwise known as " Ernie 'Orktjns "; 19 or
20; short, sallow, spectacled; draper's assistant: a respectable
and industrious young fellow, who chooses to pass in his hours of
ease as a blase misogynist).
Alfred (his friend; shorter and sallower; a person with a talent for
silence, which he cultivates assiduously).
Polly and Flo are seated upon chairs by the path, watching the crowd
promenading around the enclosure where the Band is playing.
Polly (toFlo). There's
Ernie 'Orkins; — he
doesn't see us yet. 'Ullo,
Ernie, come'ere and talk
to us, won't you?
Jib. Don't,Polly. I'm
sure / don't want to talk
to him!
Polly. Now you know
you do, Flo,—more than
I do, if the truth was
known. It's all on your
account 1 called out tohim.
Mr. Hawkins (coming
up). 'Ullo! so you're'ere,
are you?
[Stands in front of their
chairs in an easy atti-
tude. His friend looks
on with an admiring
grin in the background,
unintroduced, but quite
happy and contented.
Polly. Ah, we're 'ere
all right enough. 'Ow
did you get out?
Mr. H. (his dignity
slightly ruffled). 'Ow did
I get out? I'm not in
the 'ahit of working Sun-
days if I know it.
Polly. Oh, I thought
p'raps she wouldn't let
you come out without 'er.
(Mr. H. disdains to notice
this insinuation.) Why,
how you are blushing up,
Flo! She looks quite nice
when she blushes, don't
she?
Mr. II. (who is of the
same opinion, but con-
siders it beneath him to
betray his sentiments). Can't say, I'm sure;
blushing myself. I've forgotten now it's done,
Polly. An! I dessay you found it convenient to forget. (A pause.
Mr. H. smiles in well-pleased acknowledgment of this tribute to his
brazen demeanour.) Did Arthur send you a telegraph P—he sent
Flo one. [ Thin is added with a significance intended to excite Mr.
H.'s jealousy.
Mr. H. (unperturbed). No; he telegraphed to father, though. He's
gettin' on well over at Melbun, ain't he? They think a lot of him
out there. And now gettin' his name in the paper, too, like that,
why
Flo. That '11 do him a lot of good, 'aving his" name in the paper,
won't it?
Mr. H. Oh, Arthur 'sgettin' on fine. Have you read the letters
he's sent over? No? Well, you oome in to-morrow evening and
have a look at 'em. Look sharp, or they '11 be lent out again; they've
been the reg'lar round, I can tell you. I shall write and blow 'im
up, though, for not sending me a telegraft, too.
Polly. You! 'Oo are you t You re on'y his brother, you are.
It's different, his sending one to Flo.
Mr. H. (not altogether relishing this last suggestion). Ah, well, I
dessay I shall go out there myself, some day.
{Looks at Miss Flo, to see, how she likes that.

Flo. Yes, you'd better. It would make you quite a man, wouldn't
UP [Both girls titter.
Mr. H. (nettled). 'Ere, I say, I'm off. Good-bye 1 Come on, Alf!
[Fausse sortie.
Polly. No, don't go away yet. Shall you take 'er out with you,
Ernie, eh P
Mr. H. What 'er? I don't know any 'er.
Polly (archly). Oh, you think we 'aven't 'eard. 'Er where you
live now. We know all about it!
Jkfr. H. Then you know more than what I do. There's nothing
between me and anybody where I live. But I'm going out to
Ostralia, though. I've saved up 'alf of what I want already.
Polly (banteringly). You are a good boy. Save up enough for me
too!
Mr. H. (surveying her with frank disparagement). You t Oh,
lor! Not if I know it!
Flo (with an exaggerated sigh). Oh dear, I wish I was over there.
They say they're advertising for maidservants—fifteen shillings a
week, and the washing put out. I'd marry a prince or a lord duke,
perhaps, when I got there. Arthur sent me a fashion-book.
Mr. H. So he sent me
one, too. It was the
Autumn fashions. _ They
get their Autumn in the
Spring out there, you
know, and their Christ-
mas Day comes in the
middle of July. Seems
rum, doesn't it?
Flo. He sent me his
photo, too. He has im-
proved.
Polly. You'go out there,
Ernie, and p raps you'll
improve. [Flo giggles.
Mr. H. (hurt). There,
that'senough—good-bye.
[ Fausse sortie No. i.
Polly (persuasively).
'Ere, stop! I want to
speak to you. Is your
girl here?
Mr. H. (glad of this
opportunity). My girl?
I ain't got no girl. I
don't believe in 'em—a
lot of
Polly (interrupting). A
lot of what? Go on—
don't mind us.
Mr. H. Itdon't matter,
/know what they are.
Polly. But you like
MisB Pinkney, though,
—at the shop in Queen's
Road,—you know.
Mr. H. (by way of pro-
claiming his indifference).
Miss Pinkney? She
ought to be Mrs. Some-
body by this time,—she's
getting on for thirty.
Polly. Ah, but she
don't look it, does she: not with that lovely ooloured 'air and com-
pletion P You knew she painted, I dessay? She don't look—well,
not more than thirty-two, at the outside. She spends a lot on her
'air, I know. She sent our Georgy one day to the 'air-dresser's for
a bottle of the stuff she puts on, and the barber sez: "What, do
you dye your 'air P" To little Gxorqy! fancy 1
Mr. H. Well, Bhe may dye herself magenter for all I oare.
(Changing the subject.) Abthub's found a lot of old friends at
Melbun,—first person he oome upon was a policeman as used to be
at King Street; and you remember that Miss Lavender he used to
go out with? (Speaking at Flo.) Well, her brother was on board
the steamer he went in.
Polly. It's all right, Flo, ain't itP so long as it wasn't Miss
Lavender herself! (To Mr. H.) I say, ain't you got a moustarsh
oomin'!
Mr. H. (wounded for the third time). That'll do. I'm off this
time! [ The devoted Alf once more prepares for departure.
Polly. All right! Tell us where you '11 be, and we may come and
meet you. I daresay we shall find you by the Outer Circle,—where
the children go when they get lost. I say, Ernie, look what a short
frock that girl's got on.
Mr. H. (lingering undecidedly). I don't want to look at no girls,
I tell you.
AN OBJECT OF COMPASSION.

Mr. H. Not one. Plenty of 'Abblets! [Scornfully.
Flo. Ah! and 'Abbies too. There's a girl looking at
you, Ernie; do turn round.
Mr. H. (loftily). I'm sure I shan't look at her, then.

now.

Mr. H. (with a feeling that ne it doing himself an
injustice). Not but what I taught him one or two things
he didn't know, when he was with me at Wandsworth.
(Thinks he won't go until he has dropped one more hint
about Australia.) As to Ostralia, you know, 1 've quite
made up my mind to go out there as soon as I can.
I ain't said nothing, but I've been meaning it all along.
They won't mind my going at home, like they did
Abthub 's, eh?
Flo (in a tone of cordial assent). Oh no, of course not.
It isn't as if yon were 'im, is it?
Mr. H. (disappointed, but still bent on asserting his
own value). You see, I'm independent. I can always
find a berth, I can. I don't believe in keeping on any-
where longer than I'm comfortable. Not but what I
shall stiok to where I am a bit longer, because I've a
chance of a rise soon. The Guv'nor don't like the man
in the Manchester department, so I expect I shall get
his berth. I get on well with the Guv'nor, you know, and
he treats us very fair;—we've a setting-room to ourselves,
and we can come and set in the droring-room of a Sunday
afternoon, like the family; and I often have to go into
the City, and, when I get up there, I can tell yer, I

speak to her a minute. Come, Polly!
[Both girls rise, and rush after a stout lady who is
disappearing in the crowd.
Alfred (speaking for the first time). I say, we'll 'ook it
now, eh?
Mr. H. (gloomily accepting the situation). Yes, we'd
better 'ook it.
[They "'ook it" accordingly, and Miss Flo and
Miss Polly, returning later, find, rather to
their surprise, that their victim has departed,
and their chairs are filled by blandly unconscious
strangers. However, both young ladies declare
that it is" a good riddance," and they thought
"that Ernie 'Obkins never meant to go,']—
which seems amply to console them for having
slightly overrated their powers of fascination.

A CONTENTED MIND.
Angelina. "Incomes under £150 a Yeab are ixsmpt from Income-Tax.
Isn't it lucky, Darling t We just miss it by Five Pounds!"
TO A FEATHER-HEADED POET.
Oh, mountainous mouther of molehills, weak wielder of terrors outworn,
Discharger of sulphurous salvoes, effetely ferocious in scorn,
Shrill shrieker and sesquipedalian, befoamed and befumed and immense
With the words that are wind on an ocean, whose depth is unf at homed of
Red fury that smitest at shadows, black shadows of blood that is red
In the face of a soulless putrescence, doomed, damned, deflowered and dead;
Oh, robed in the rags of thy raging, like tempests that thunder afar,
In a night that is fashioned of Chaos discerned in the light of a star
For the verse that is venom and vapour, disorowned and disowned of the free,
Take thou from the shape that is Murder, none other will thank thee, thy fee.
Yea, Freedom is throned on the Mountains; the cry of her children seems vain
When they fall and are ground into dust by the heel of the lords of the plain.
Calm-browed from her crags she beholdeth the strife and the straggle beneath,
And her hand clasps the hilt, but it draws not the sword of her might from its
sheath.
And we chide her aloud in our anguish, " Cold mother, and careless of wrong,
How Ions; shall the victims be torn unavenged, unavenging F How long?"
And the laugh of oppressors is scornful, they reck not of ruth as they urge
The hosts that are tireless in torture, the fiends with the chain and the scourge.
But at last—for she knoweth the season—serene she descends from the height,
And the tyrants who flout her grow pale in her sunrise, and pray for the night.
And they tremble and dwindle before her amazed, and, behold, with a breath,
Unhasting, unangered advancing, she dooms them to terror and death.
But she the great mother of heroes, the shield and the sword of the weak,
What lot or what part has her glory in madmen who gibber and shriek?
Her eye is as death to assassins, the brood of miasma and gloom, _
Foul shapes that grow sleek upon slaughter, as worms that are hid in a tomb.
In the dawn she has marshalled her armies, the millions go marching as one,
With a tramp that is fearless as joy, and a joy that is bright as the sun.
But the minions of Murder move softly; unseen they have crept from their lair,
In a night that is darker than doom on the famishing face of despair.
And they lurk and they tremble and cower, and stab as they lurk from behind,
Like shapes from a pit Acherontio by hatred and horror made blind.
These are not the soldiers of Freedom; the hearts of her lovers grow faint
When the name of assassin is chanted as one with the name of a saint.
And thou the pale poet of Passion, who art wanton to strike and to kill, [still.
Lest her wrath and her splendour abash thee and scorch thee and crush thee, be

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [August 23, 1890.
A VERY SHORT HOLIDAY.
{By One who enjoyed it.)
It haying occurred to me that within a few days I might get an
entire change by visiting some thoroughly French seaside places on
the coast of Normandy, I started via" Southampton for Havre.
I started mysteriously at midnight. Lights down. We glided
out, almost sneaked out, as if ashamed of ourselves. I had pictured
to myself sitting out on deck, eDjoying the lovely air and the pic-
turesque view. Lhomme propose, la mer dispose. I retired early,
and enjoyed neither the lovely air nor the pioturesque view. "The
rest is silenoe," or as muoh silenoe as possible, and as much rest
as possible.
8 "30 a.m.—Le Havre. Consul's chief attendant,—Lictor, I suppose,
the master being a consul,—sees me and my baggage through the
customs—" customs more honoured in the breach than the observ-
ance,"—and in five minutes I am—that is, we are, the pair of us—at
the Hotel Frasoati, which, whether it be the best or not 1 cannot say,
is certainly the liveliest, and the only one with a covered terrace
facing the sea where you can breakfast, dine, and generally enjoy a
life which, for the time being, is worth living. Apropos of this ter-
raoe, I merely give the proprietor of Frasoati a hint,—the one drawbaok
to the comfort of dining or breakfasting in this upper terrace is the door
which communicates with the lower terrace, and through which every-
one is constantly passing. We know that II faut qu'une porte soit
ouverte ou ftrmie. But this is opened and shut, or not shut, and, if
shut, more or less banged, every three minutes. If it isn't banged, it
bursts open of its own accord, and whacks the nearest person violently
on the baok, or hits a table, and scatters the bottles, or, if not mis-
behaving itself in this way (which is only when rude Boreas is at his
rudest), it admits such a draught as causes bald-headed men to rage,
ladies to shiver, delicate persons to sneeze, and, finally, impels the
diners to raise such a clattering of knife-handles on the different

The "Screen Scene," as played on a gusty night on the covered terrace
at Frascati's, Le Havre,
tables, as if they were applauding a speech or a comio song. Then
the maitre-d'hotel rushes at the door and closes it violently,—only for
it to be re-opened a minute afterwards by a waiter or visitor enter-
ing from the terrace Delow I A mechanical contrivance and a light
screen would do away with the nuisance, for a nuisance it most un-
doubtedly is. The perpetual banging causes headache, irritation,
and indigestion, and those who have suffered riy reviendront pas,
like several Marlbrooks. Let the proprietor look to this, and, where
most things are done bo well, ana not unreasonably, don't let there
be a Havre-and-Havre policy of hotel management. Allans!
I am writing this paper for the sake of those who have only a very
few days for a holiday, and like to make the most of it in the way
of thorough change. If you seleot Havre as your head-quarters for
Trouville, Cabourg, and Dives, you must be a good sailor, as you can
only reach these places by sea; and three-quarters of an hour bad
passage there, with the prospect of three-quarters of an hour worse
passage back at some inconvenient hour of the evening, destroys all
ohance of enjoyment. If you're not a good sailor, remain on the
Havre side of the Seine, and there's plenty to be seen there to
occupy you from Saturday afternoon till Wednesday evening, when
rAeTfb^what a name!) makes its return voyage to Southampton.
If the sea at Dives, in 1066 a.d., had been anything like what it
was at Havre the other day, when I wanted to oross over to Dives,
William the Conquekok would never have sailed from that plaoe
for the invasion of England. Dull as he might have found Dives,
yet I am sure the Conquering Hero would have preferred returning
to Paris, to risking the discomfort of the crossing. By the way,
the appropriate station in Paris for Dives would be Saint-Lazaire.
Then there are Honfleur, and Harfleur, and most people know
Ste. Adresse and Etretat. The views and the drives are not equal to
those about Ufraoombe and Lynton, and Etretat itself is only a rather
inferior kind of Lvnmouth. Those who want bracing won't seleot
either Ste. Adresse or Etretat or Havre for a prolonged stay. Taking
for granted the short-holiday-maker will visit all these places, let me
give him a hint for one day's enjoyment, for whioh, I fanoy, I shall
earn his eternal gratitude. Order a carriage with two horses at
Havre, start at nine or 9'30. and
drive to Etretat by way of Mar-
viliers. Stop at the Hotel de
Vieux Plats at Gonneville for
breakfast. Never will you have
seen a house so full of curiosities
of all sorts; the walls are covered
with clever sketches and paint-
ings by more or less well-known
artists, and the service of the
house is carried on by M. and
Mme. Auboubg, their son and
daughter, who, with the assist-
ance of a few neat-handed Phyl
Uses, do everything themselves
for their customers, and are at
once the best of cooks, somml-
liers, and waiters. So cheery, so
full of life and fun, so quick, so
attentive, serving you as if yon
were the only visitor in the
place, though the little inn is
as full as it can be crammed, and
there are fifty persons break-
fasting there at the same moment.

Mademoiselle qui sait attendre.

"Le vrai dernier!"
Every room being occupied, and every nook in the garden too.
we are accommodated with a rustic table in the "Grand Salon,
part of which is screened off as a kind of bar. The " Grand Salon"
is also full of quaint pictures and eccentric curiosities; it is cool and
airy, bright flowers are in the
windows, and the floor is sanded.
We had stopped here to refresh the
horses, intending to breakfast at
Etretat. But so delighted were we,
a party of "deux couverts," with
this good hotel, and still more with
the famille Aubourg, that, though
we had driven away, and were a
mile further on our road to Etretat,
we decided—and Counsellor Hunger
was our adviser too—on returning
to this house where we had noticed
a breakfast-table tastefully laid
out for some expected visitors, and
had been in the kitchen, and with
our own eyes had seen, and with
our own noses had smelt the appe-
tising preparation for the parties
already in possession. So we drove
back again rapidly, muoh to the delight of our coachman, who had be-
come very melancholy, and was evidently forming a very poor opinion
of persons who could lose the ohance of a breakfast chez Aubourg.
inflow pleased Mile. Auboubg, the waitress, appeared to be when
we returned! All the family prepared
to kill the fatted calf figuratively, as
it took the shape of the sweetest and
freshest shrimps as hors d'osuvre, and
then it became an omelette au lard
(" 0 La!") absolutely unsurpassable,
and a poulet saute, whioh was about
the best that ever we tasted. A good
bottle of the ordinary generous, fruit
and then a oup of recently roasted and
freshly ground coffee with a thimble-
ful of some special Normandy cognao,
—in whioh our cheery host joined us,
and we all drank one another s healths,
—completed as good a dejeuner as any
man or woman of simple tastes could
possibly desire.
Then the cheery son of the house,
dressed in a cook's cap and apron,
pauses in his work to join in our con-
versation. He tells us how he has
been in London, and can speak English,
and is enthusiastic about the satino
journal which Mr. Punch publishes
weekly. M. AuBOCBS fits who is &
truthful likeness, on a large scale,
of M. Daubeat, of the Palais Royal,
informs me that he can play the horn
after the manner of the guards on the coaches starting from the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
"White Horse," Piccadilly; and so, when we start for Etretat, he
produces a big cor de chasst, and, while he sounds the farewell upon
it, a maid rushes out and rings the parting hell, and M. Aubourg
pert waves his cap, and Madame her hand, and Mile, her serviette,
and we respond with hat and handkerchief until we turn the corner,
and hear the last nourish of the French "horn of the hunter," and
see the last flourish of pretty Mademoiselle's snow-white serviette.
Then we go on our way to Etretat, rejoicing. But, after this excite-
ment, Etretat palls upon us. After a couple of hours of Etretat, we
are glad to drive up, and up, and up, and get far away and above
Etretat, where we can breathe again.
Ear better is Fecamp whioh we tried two days after, and Fecamp
is just a trifle livelier than Westward Ho! Of course its Abbaye
is an attraction in itself. It is a place whose inhabitants show
considerable public spirit, as it is here that " Benedictine " is made.
When at Le Havre drive over to St. Jouin, and breakfast chez
Ernestine. Another day you can spend at Rouen, returning in the
evening to dinner. This is not intended as a chapter in a guide-
book, but simply as a hint at any time to those who need a thorough
change in a short time, and who do not care to go too far off to get
it. When they've quite finished building and paving Havre, f '11
return there and take a few walks. Now the authorities responsible
for the paving are simply the best friends of the boot-making inte-
rest, just as in London the Hansoms collectively ought to receive a
handsome Christmas hat-box from the hatters. But mind this, when
at Havre drive to Gonneville, and breakfast chez M. Auboubo.
IN THE KNOW.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)
I have had a communication from Mr. Jebrht, written in the
execrable English of whioh this calico-livered sooundrel is a con-
summate master, and informing me that, if I care to join the staff
of the journal which Mr. J. directs, a princely salary shall be at
my disposal. Mr. J. inquires what special branoh of notion it would
suit me to undertake, as he proposes to publish a serial novel by an
author of undoubted imaginative power. Here is my answer to
Mr. J. I will do nothing for him. His compliments I despise.
Flattery has never yet caused me to falter. And if he desires to
prop the tottering fortunes of his ohowder-headed rag, let him
obtain support from the pasty-faced pack of cacklers who surround
him. I would stretch no finger to help him, no, not if I saw him
no to his chin in the oleo-margarine of whioh his brains and those
his bottle-nosed, flounder-eared friends seem to be composed,
w much then for Mr. J. Du reste, as Talleyrand once said, my
important duties to the readers ol this journal fully absorb my
time.
Last week I offered to the publio some interesting details of the
family history of an exalted German prince, whose friendship and
good-will it has been my fortune to acquire by means of the
dazzling accuracy of my forecasts of racing events in this country.
I may state at once that the Grand Cross of the Honigthau Order,
"mit Diamanten und Perlen," which his Serene Highness was good
enough to confer upon me, has come to hand, and even now sparkles
on a breast as incapable of deoeit as it is ardent in the pursuit of
truth. Let this be an incitement to the deserving, and a warning to
scoffers who presume to doubt me. Many other gratifying testi-
monies of foreign approval have reached me. From the immense
heap of them stored in my front drawing-room, I seleot the following
specimens:—
(i.) Buenos Ayres, Monday.
Revolution crushed entirely by your aid. At the crisis, General
Pompanilla read all your published writings aloud to insurgent
chiefs. Effect was magical. They thought your prophecies better
than ammunition. Ha, ha I Their widows nave fled the country.
A pension of a million pesetas awarded to you. Rumours about my
resignation a mere blind. (Signed) Dr. Celhan, President.
(u.) Buenos Ayres, Monday.
The traitor Oilman has been vanquished, thanks to you. When
ammunition failed, we loaded with sporting prophecies. "Very
deadly. Treasury cleared direotly. One of your adjectives annihi-
lated a brig
(Here fol
the number of 5,000.)"
(m.) Guatemala, Sunday.
Victorious army of Guatemala sends thanks to its brave champion.
Tour inspired writings have been set to musio, and are sung as
national hymns. Effect on San Salvadorians terrible. Only two
deaf sergeants left alive. Ouerra, Vittoria Matador, Mantilla.
(Signed) Barillas, President.

Land pirates from Guatemala foiled, owing to valiant English

plant called Tehp, muoh used by Indian tribe of Estar-ting-prisahs.
My body-guard performed prodigies on Thenod, the well-known
root of the Cuff plant. Have adopted you as my grandson.
(Signed) Ezeta, President.
That is sufficient for one week. Those who wish for more in the
meantime, must call at my residence.

THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.
(Before Mr. Commissioner Punch.)
An Engxneer Officer, R.N., introduced.
The Commissioner. Sorry to see you here, Sir, as your presence
argues that you have a right to demand redress.
Engineer Officer, R.N. I think, .Sir, that we have a genuine
grievance is almost universally conceded. But, as our labours and
responsibilities have increased
enormously of late years, per-
haps you will kindly allow me
to describe our duties.
The Com. By all means.
En. Of., R.N. As the matter
is of the greatest importance
to fourteen hundred officers,
commanding ten thousand men,
I hope you will not oonsider me
tedious in making the follow-
ing statement. The success of
every function of the modem
battle-ship depends upon
maohinery for whioh the
Engineer officers are directly
responsible. By its means the
anchor is lifted, boats are
hoisted, the ship is steered,
ventilated, and _ electrically
lighted. Pure drinking water
is supplied for its hundreds of
inhabitants. The efficiency of all the elaborate arrangements of
the hull for safety in oollision, fire, or battle, depends upon the
Engineers. Their maohinery trains and elevates, loads and controls
the heavy guns. The use of the Whitehead torpedo and all its
appliances would be an impossibility without the Engineers. In
addition to this there is the propulsion of the ship, and the control
and supervision of a large staff of artificers and men. And yet the
Engineer officers are the lowest paid class of commissioned officers
in the Royal Navy—this when, without exaggeration, they may be
described as the hardest-worked.
The Com. It certainly seems unfair that officers of your import-
ance should not receive ampler remuneration. When was the rate
established?
En. Of., R.N. It has seen little change since 1870; and you may
judge of its justice when I tell you that a young Surgeon of twenty-
three, appointed to his first ship, receives more pay than many
Engineer officers who have seen fourteen years' service, and have
reached the age of thirty-five.
The Com. I am decidedly of opinion that your pay should be
inoreased, and I suppose (as evidently there has been olass feeling"
in the matter) you have had to suffer annoyanoe anent relative
rank?
En. Of., R.N. (with a smile). Well, yes, we have. But if the
Engineer-in-Chief at the Admiralty (who, by the way, receives
£1000 a-year, and yet is held responsible for the design and manu-
facture of machinery costing £12,000,000 per annum) is admitted to
be superior to all other Engineer officers, we shall be satisfied. Still
I cannot help saying that the Chief Engineer of a ship is snubbed
when all is right, and only has his importance and responsibility
allowed (when indeed it is recognised and paraded) when anything
is wrong! But let that^pass.
The Com. I am afraid it is too late to do anything further this
Session, as the House is just up. However, if matters are not more
satisfactory at the end of the recess, let me know, and but you
shall see I
\_The Witness, after suitable acknowledgment, then withdrew.
"A Lutle More than Gat but Less thaw Grave."—Not
very long ago, an aot of saorilege was committed at Canterbury by a
man, who robbed an alms-box in the Cathedral. However, dis-
regarding the precedent set some time sinoe by the Dean and
Chapter (who it will be remembered dug up_ and removed the
bones of the honoured dead) the intruder abstained from touching
the vaults of those buried in consecrated ground.

des courses. L'autre jour dans un "allu-
mette" entre deux "counties," un pro-
fessional qui s'appelle Fusil a fait plus que
deux cents des courses.

A NATIONAL APPEAL.
Deab Mb. Punch,—Cannot you do some-
thing to help us, and save us from a permanent
consignment to that wretched hole-in-a-oorner
back street site thrust upon us at the rear of the
National Gallery? We do not know how far
matters may have gone, but somebody wrote
the other day to The Timt$ to protest against
the job, and we conclude, therefore, it may
not yet, perhaps, be too late to agitate for a
stay of execution. We are not difficult to
please, and would be contented with a modest
but suitable home in any convenient lo-
cality. That such can be found when really
sought for, witness the happy facility with
■which a fitting residence has been discovered
in the east and west galleries surrounding the
Imperial Institute for the promised new Na-
tional Collection. At South Kensington we had
a narrow escape of a conflagration, from too
close a proximity to the kitchen of a shilling r«-
ttaurant. At Bethnal Oreen we have been
having a prolonged merry time of it, with
damp walls behind us and leaking roofs
above our heads. At one time we were packed
away in dusty obscurity, in the cupboards of a
temporary Government office; and looking
back on the past, fruitful as it is in recollec-
tions of official slights and snubs, you may
gather that we can have no very ambitious
designs for the future. We do, however,
protest against being tacked on as a sort of
outside back-stair appendage to the National
Gallery, that will soon want the space we
shall be forced to occupy for its own natural
and legitimate expansion. Suggest a site
for us—anywhere else. There is still room
on the Embankment. Kensington Palace—
is still in the market. Why not be welcome
there? As representatives for all of us,
I subscribe my name hereunder, and remain,
Your obedient servant,

THE LESSON OE THE SEASON.
The Season's over; for relief
You're off to scale the Alps;
Say, do you,
like some
Indian
Chief,
Look back
and count
your
scalps?
Does someone
rue your
broken
vows,
And sigh
he has to
doubt
you;
Yet felt withal the week at Cowes
Was quite a blank without you P
Are hearts still broken, as of old,
In this prosaic time,
When love is only given for gold,
And poverty's a crime.
Say, are you oonsoious of a heart,
And oan you feel it beating;

And is it ever sad to part,
And finds a joy in meeting?
The Seasons come, the Seasons go,
With store of good and ill;
Do all men find you cold as snow,
And unresponsive still P
0 beautiful enigma, say,
Will love's sublime persistence
Solve for you, in the usual way,
The riddle of existence P
Alas! love is not love to-day,
But just a bargain made,
In cold and calculating way;
And if the price be paid,
A man may win the fairest face,
A maiden tall and queenly,
The daughter of some anoient race,
Who sells herself serenely.
What wonder that the cynic sneers
At suoh a rule of life;
That, after but a few short years,
Dissension should be rife.
Ah I Lady, you'll avoid heart-ache,
And scorn of bard satirio,
If haply you should deign to take
A lesson from our lyric

"Lfad, kindly Light!" From lips serene as strong,
Chaste as melodious, on world-weary ears
Fall, 'midst earth's chaos wild of hopes and fears,
The accents calm of spiritual song,
Striking across the tumult of the throng
Like the still line of lustre, soft, severe,
From the high-riding, ocean-swaying sphere,
Athwart the wandering wilderness of waves.
Is there not human soul-light which so laves
Earth's lesser spirits with its chastening beam,
That passion's bale-tire and the lurid gleam
Of sordid selfishness know strange eclipse?
Such purging lustre his, whose eloquent lips
Lie silent now. Great soul, great Englishman!
Whom narrowing hounds of creed, or caste, or clan,
Exclude not from world-praise and all men's love.
Fine spirit, which the strain of ardent strife
Warped not from its firm poise, or made to move
From the pure pathways of the Saintly Life!
Newman, farewell! Myriads whose spirits spurn
The limitations thou didst love so well,
Who never knew the shades of Oriel,
Or felt their quickened spirits pulse and burn
Beneath that eye's regard, that voice's spell,—
Myriads, world scattered and creed-sundered, turn
In thought to that hushed chamber's chastened gloom.
In all great hearts there is abundant room
For memories of greatness, and high pride
In what sects cannot kill nor seas divide.
The Light hath led thee, on through honoured days
And lengthened, through wild gusts of blame and praise,
Through doubt, and severing change, and poignant
pain,
Warfare that strains the breast and racks the brain,
At last to haven! Now no English heart
Will willingly forego unfeigned part
In honouring thee, true master of our tongue,
On whose word, writ or spoken, ever hung
All English ears which knew that tongue's best charm.
Not aa great Cardinal such hearts most warm
To one above all office and all state,
Serenely wise, magnanimously great;
Not aa the pride of Oriel, or the star
Of this host or of that in creed's hot war,
But as the noble spirit, stately, sweet,
Ardent for good without fanatio heat,
Gentle of soul, though greatly militant,
Saintly, yet with no touch of oloistral cant;
Him England honours, and so bends to-day
In reverent grief o'er Newman's glorious clay.

"In a recent case of brigandage, people of all sorts and
cluses were implicated, while one of the leading barristers was
imprisoned on suspicion."—Report of Consul Stigano, of Palermo.
Scene—Chambers of Mr. E. S. Toppel, Q.C., in the
Inner Temple. Mr. Toppel discovered in consultation
with a Chancery Barrister, two Starving Juniors, and
sixteen Masked Ruffians armed to the teeth.
Mr. Toppel. Now that we have the Lord Chancellor,
the Lord Chief Justice, and the President of the Divorce
Division, securely locked up together in the attic, and
gagged, we may, I think, congratulate ourselves on the
success of our proceedings so far! We are, I am sure,
quite agreed as to there having been no other course open
to us than to imitate our Sicilian brethren of the robe,
and take to a little mild brigandage, considering the awful
decay of legal business ana our own destitute condition.
[Sympathetic cries of Hear, hear! from the Chancery
Barrister, and the two Starving Juniors.) I have no doubt
that a few hours spent in our attic will induce the High
Legal Dignitaries I have mentioned (laughter) to pay up
the modest ransom we demand, and to take the additional
pledge of secresy. Meanwhile, I propose that these six-
teen excellent gentlemen should re-enter the private
Pirate Bus' which is waiting down-stairs, and see whether

prisoners were getting on. The Chancellor, I regret to say, seemed dissatisfied
with the bread and water supplied to him, and asked for " necessaries suitable to
his status." He appeared inclined to argue the point, so I had to gag him again.
Mr. Toppel. Quite right. You might have told him that he is now governed
by the lex loci, and that we shall reluctantly have to send little pieces of him to
his friends—I believe that is the'' common form'' in brigand oiroles—if he persists
in refusing the ransom. How does the Lord Chief Justice bear it f

THE JACKDAW.
{Imitated from Edgar Poe, by an Indignant " Obetruetive")
"That (the defeat of our measures) was all due to Obstruction. ... It
appears that Crown and Parliament are alike to be disestablished, and
that in their stead we are to put the Obstructive and the Bore. ... I should
like to ask them what kind of Government they think best, a Bureaucracy or
a Bore-ocracy ?"—Mr. Balfour at Manchester.
Ones upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a dry and dusty volume of Bine-Bookish lore,—
While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there oame a yapping,
As of some toy-terrier snapping, snap-
ping at my study door.
"'Tib some peevish our," I muttered,

"yapping at my study door,—
Only that,—but it's a bore."
Ah! distinctly I remember, it was
drawing nigh September,
And eaoh trivial Tory Member pined
for stubble, copse, and moor;
Eagerly they wished the morrow;
vainly they had sought to borrow
From their Smith surcease of sorrow,
or from Goschen or Balfour,
From the lank and languid "miss"
the Tory claque dubbed "Brave
Balfour,"
Fameless else for evermore.
Party prospects dark, uncertain, sombre as night's sable curtain,
Filled them, thrilled them with f antastio f unkings seldom felt before;
8o that now, to still the beating of faint hearts, they kept repeating
Futile formulas, entreating Closure for the " Obstructive Bore"—
"With a view to Truth defeating, suoh they dubbed "Obstructive
Bore," As sought Truth, and nothing more.
Presently my wrath waxed stronger; hesitating then no longer,
"Cur!" I said; "mad mongrel, truly off your precious hide, I'll
score;
Like your cheek to come here yapping, just as I was gently napping;
You deserve a strapping,—yapping, snapping at my study door.
I shall go for you, mad mongrel! Here I opened wide the door.
Darkness there, and nothing more I
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there nothing hearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams of Spooks, Mahatmas, Esoteric lore;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token.
Hist I there were two words soft spoken, those stale words, " Obstruc-
tive Bore."
Bosh! I murmured, and some echo whispered back, "Obstructive
Bore": Merely that, and nothing more.
Back into my study turning, with some natural anger burning,
Soon again I heard a sound more like miauling than before.
"Surely," said I, "surely that is a grimalkin at my lattice.
Let me see if it stray cat is, and this mystery explore;
Where's that stick? Ah! wait a moment: I'11 this mystery
explore; It shall worry me no more!"
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a smirk and flutter,
In there popped a perky Jackdaw, yapping, miauling as before
(Queer mimetic noises made he), for no introduction stayed he.
But, with plumage sleek, yet shady, perched above my study door,—
Perched upon a bust of Gladstone placed above my study door,—
Perohed, and croaked " Obstructive Bore!"
Then this mocking bird beguiling my tried temper into smiling
By the lank lopsided languor of the countenance it wore.
"Though you look storm-tost, unshaven, you," I said, "have found
a haven,
Daw as roupy as a raven! Was it you yapped at my door f
Tell me your confounded name, 0 bird in beak so like Balfour!"
Quoth the bird, "Obstructive Bore!"
Much I wondered this ungainly fowl to hear speak up so plainly,
Though hU answer little meaning, little relevanoy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no sober human being
Ever yet was blessed by seeing bird above his study door—
Bird or beast upon the Grand Old bust above his study door,
With the name, "Obstructive Bore."
But the Jackdaw, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spake only
That one word, as though in that his policy he did outpour.
Not another sound he uttered, but his feathers proudly fluttered.
"Ah!" I mused, "the words he muttered other dolts have mouthed
before.
Who is he who thinks to scare me with stale cant oft mouthed before 'i"
Quoth the bird, "Obstructive Bore!"
Startled at the silence broken by reply so patly spoken,
Doubtless, mused I, what it utters is its only verbal store,
Learnt from some unlucky master, whom well-merited disaster
Followed fast and followed faster, till his speech one burden bore—
Till his dirges of despair one melancholy burden bore,
Parrot-like, '' Obstructive Bore!"
But the Jackdaw still beguiling my soothed fancy into smiling.
Straight I wheeled my easy-chair in front of bird, and bust, and door;
Then, upon the cushion sinking, I betook myself to linking
Memory unto memory, thinking what this slave of parrot-lore—
What this lank, ungainly, yet complacent thrall of parrot-lore
Meant by its Obstructive Bore."
This I sat engaged in guessing, strange similitude confessing,
'Twixt this fowl, whose goggle-eyes glared on me from above my door,
long legs twining, whom I'd often seen reolining
And a chap with
On the Treasury Bench's lining, Irish anguish gloatin;
This same chap with long legs twining Irish anguish c
Tories christened, "Brave Balfour."
! o'er,
Then methought the air grew denser. I remembered stout Earl
Spencer,
And the silly pseudo-Seraph who " obstructed" him of yore;
I remembered Maamtrasma, faction, partisan miasma,
Churchill—Churchill and his henchman, lank and languorous
Balfour.
"What," I cried, "was Arthur, then, or Randolph, in those days
of yore?" Quoth the bird, "Obstructive Bore."
"Prophet!" said I, "of things evil, prophet callous, oold, uncivil.
By your favourite ' Tu quoque' how can you expect to score P
Though your cheek may be undaunted, little memory is wanted,
And your conscience mutt be haunted by bad memories of yore.
When you were—ah I well, what were you? Tell me frankly, I
implore 1" Quoth the bird, "Obstructive Bore."
"Prophet," said I, "of all evil! that we 're going to the devil
All along of that' Obstruction '—which of old you did adore,
Ere you won official Aidenn—is the charge with which is laden
Every cackling speech you make—if you do represent Balfour,
That mature and minxish 'maiden' whom the Pats call 'Miss
Balfour,' "— Quoth the bird, "Obstructive Bore!"
"Here! 'tis time you were departing, bird or not," I cried,
upstarting;
"Get you back unto the Carlton, they on parrot-cries set store.
Leave no feather as a token of the lies that you have spoken
Of the Man, Grand, Old, Cnbroken! Quit his bust above my door.
Take thy claws from off his crown, and take thy beak from off my
door!" Quoth the bird, "Obstructive Bore!"
And the Jaokdaw, fowl provoking, still is croaking, still is croaking,
On the pallid bust of Gladstone just above my study door,
And his eyes have all the seeming of a small attorney scheming;
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the
floor;
And the shape cut by that shadow which lies floating on the floor,
Looks (to me) OBSTRUCTIVE BORE!
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Submarine Enterprise.—It is a pity, perhaps, that on the very
first occasion which enabled you to submit, for an experimental
trial, to the Dockyard Authorities at Portsmouth, your newly-
designed Self-sinking and Propelling Submarine Electric Gun Brig,
your vessel, owing{ as you say, "to some trifling, though quite
unforeseen, hitch in the machinery," should have immediately
turned over on its side, upsetting a quantity of red-hot coal from the
stoke-hole, and projecting a stifling rush of steam among the four
foreign captains, and the two scientific experts whom you had
induced to accompany you in your projected descent under the
bottoms of the three first-class ironclads at present moored in the
harbour. Your alternative ideas of either cutting your vessel in
half, and turning it into a oouple of diving-bells for the purpose of
seeking for hidden treasure on the Goodwin Sands, or of running it
under water, for the benefit of those travellers who wish to avoid
all chances of sea-sickness, between Folkestone and Boulogne, seem
both worthy of consideration. On the whole, however, we should
be inclined to think that your last suggestion—namely, that you
should put yourself in communication with some highly respectable
marine-store dealer, with a view to the disposal of your "Electric
Submarine Gun Brig," for the price of old iron, would, perhaps,
prove the soundest of all. Still, don't be disheartened.

Sib,—"Why not live out of London?" Of course.
I do live "out of London," and make a precious good
living too out of London. My friends the Butcher, the
Baker, the Greengrocer (not a very green grocer either),
the Tailor, the'.Shoemaker, &c, &c, all say the same as
Yours cheerily,
Charles Cheddar (Cheesemonger).
Sib,—I only wish everybody I don't want to see in
London would live out of it. What a thrice blessed time
August would be then! Though indeed I infinitely
appreciate small mercies now. At all events, most
people are away, my Club is not closed, and I can enjoy
myself pretty thoroughly. Yours,
Elbow Room Club.' Beau Winder.
Sib,—"Why not live out of London?" Because one
can't. Out of London there is only " existence." Is life
worth living anywhere except in London—and Paris, if
you happen to be there? No, no; those who like living
"out of London," had better not live at all.

From Arran he'd tramp to Dunrobin without the least obance of a bag!
"Peaceful hills," that s his patter, my pippin; no gillies, no luncheons, no

Wy, he ought to be tossed in a blanket; it fills a true Briton with shame.
No Moors for yours truly, wus luok 1 It won't run to it, Charlir, this round;
But give me my pun, and a chance, and I '11 be in the swim, I '11 be bound.
I did 'ave a turn some years back, though I only went out with 'em onoe,
And I shot a bit wild, as was likely, fust off, though yer mayn't be a dunce.
My rig out was a picter they told me—deer-stalker and knickers O.K.—
"Briggs, Junior," a lobsculler called me; I wasn't quite fly to his lay;

Ah! them Moors is the spots for cola Irish, and gives yer the primest of pecks.
Talk of sandwiges, Charlie, oh scissors, I'd soon ha' cleaned out Charing

And there wot some Swells with bus, I tell yer, I felt on the good gay galoot,
But I fancy I got jest a morsel screwdnoodleous late in the day,
For I peppered a bloke in the breeks; he swore bad, but 'twas only bis play.
B igged a braoe and a arf, I did, Charlie; not bad for a novice like me.
Jest a bit blown about the fust two; wanted gathering up like, j er see.
A bird do look best with his 'ed on, dear boy, as a matter of taste;
And the gillies got jest a mite sooffy along of my natural 'aste.
Never arsked me no more, for Borne reason. But wot I would say is this here,
'Arbt's bin in this boat in his time, as in every prime lark pooty near,
And when 'Abbison talks blooming bunkum, with hadjectives spioy and strong,
About Sport being stupid, and noisy, and vulgar; wy, 'Arrison '8 wrong!
He would rather shoot broken-down cab-horses,—so the mug tells us-than
birds.
Well, they 're more in his line very likely; that means, in his own chosen words,
He's more fit for a hammytoor knacker than for that great boast of our land,
A true British Sportsman! GreatSoott! It's a taste as I catnt understand.
Fact is this here Fred is a Demmyorat, Positivist, and all that.
There's the nick o' the matter, the reason of all this un-English wild ohat.
He is down on the Aristos, Charlie, this 'Arrison is. It's the Court

All a part of the game, dear old pal, the dead-set at the noble and rich.
"Smart people" are "Sports,"mostly always,and 'Abbiron slates them as Bioh.

Oh dear! oh dear! What perils I have heen through! You '11
gee me again shortly; hat there have heen momentum* in my career
when I Baid to myself, " Shall I ever aller out of this alive!" I
escaped the Petersburg police; they punched out your Cartoon, and
all the lines ahout the Czar and the Jews; that's why I was bo
persecuted, and why I was watched. I wish to Heaven you wouldn't
nave Cartoons about Czars and Jews just when I'm at Peterborough,
I mean Petersburg; tame name, different place. But there, that's
all over now, and jamais will 1 go and put myself within the clutches
of the Russian Bear again. The midnight sun must do without me in
future. I send you a sketch I made of a gargle—I think that 'g the
name—on a church-door in Lapland. Isn't it really droll? You 're
always bothering me for something droll, and now you 've got it. Then,
Mr. Punch, riding a reindeer at half-a- crown an hour. Then here are
the little Lapps offering our sailors a lap of liquor; and I said to
myself, "One touch of Nature," whioh struok me as just the very
motto for the picture. I roared with laughter at it. "This'11 do
for 'em at home," I said, and so here it is. And look at the
"Lapps of Luxury "! You know that " Lap of Luxury " is a pro-
verbial phrase; and, as you told me to make some comic sketches
of the manners and customs of the country, why, I've done so; and,
if they ain't funny, I don't know what humour is. Voiid!
But you really must not expect me to grimace and buffoon.
You must take me seriatim or not at all. I can't stand on my
head to sketch. I can't do it. I nearly did do it, though,
for when I had my sketching-book in my hand on board, the
spanker-boom, or some such thing, oame over suddenly and hit me
such a whack on the head, that for two minutes I lay insensible, and
thought I should never become sensible again. Kightly is it called
"spanker-boom,"—that is if it is called so, or some name very like
it,—for I never got such a whack on the head in all my life before.
I hear the Booming still in my ears.
Yon can't expeot a fellow to be funny, however funny he may feel
(and I did feel uncommonly funny, you may take your oath!), under
such circumstances. However, as the song says, Home once more,"
and many a yarn shall I have to tell when I gather myself round the
fireside, pipe all hands for grog, and sing you an old Norse song with
real humour in it—though I dare say you'll say you don't see it—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
JOUENAL OF A ROLLING STONE.
Fifth Entry.
Curious thing that to-day—after disappointment of failure for the
Bar—letter comes from President of my old College, asking me "if
I would accept a nice Tutorship for a time P" If so, " I had better
come down and talk to him about it."
Decided a little time ago not to try "Scholastic Profession"—
thought it would try me too much. Feel tempted now. Query—am
I losing my old pluck P In consequence of my new " pluok,"—in the
Bar Exam.?
"I'm!" remarks the President (I have run down and got a vacant
bed-room in College). "Glad to see you. Oh, yes, about that tutor-
ship. Urn, urn 1 The family live in Somerset" He mentions the
county apologetically, as if he expected me to reply—" Oh, Somerset!
Couldn't dream of going there. Not very particular, but must have
a place within ten miles of Charing Cross." As I don't object to
Somerset, at least audibly, he goes on more cheerfully—
"Boy doesn't want to be taught much, so perhaps, it would suit
you."—(Query—is this insulting ?)—" He wants a companion more
—somebody to keep him steady, nave a good influence and all that,
and give him a little classics and so on for about an hour a day."
It did not sound as bad as I expected.
"Rich people—um—merchants at Bristol, I think. Not very
cultivated, though." Here President pauses again, and looks as if
he would not be at all astonished if I rose from my chair, put on my
hat, and said, "Not very cultivated! That won't suit me! You
see how tremendously cultivated i" am." But I don't, and he
proceeds calmly to another head of his discourse.
"They haven't mentioned terms, but I'm sure they will be
satisfactory—give you what you ask, in fact." (Rather a nice trait in
their character, this.)—" Now, will you—um—take it? They want
somebody at once."
"Yes,' I reply; "I '11 go and see how I fanoy it. Have they
got a billiard-table, do you happen to know?"
The President says, he doesn't know anything about that," and
looks a little surprised, as if I had proposed a game of skittles.
On way down (next day) I feel rather like a Governess going to
her first situation. Get to house late. Too dark to see what it's like.
Have to drive up in a village fly. Query—Oughtn't they to have
sent their carriage for me P
My reception is peculiar. A stout, masculine-looking female with
a strident voice, is presumably Mrs. Bristol Merchant.
Sends me up to my bed-room as if I were my own luggage.
Evidently very "uncultivated."
In my bed-room. _ Above are the sounds of a small pandemonium,
apparently. Stamping, falling, shouting, bumping, crying. What
a lot of them there must be!
There are! At supper—they appear to have early dinners, whioh
I detest—three boys and one girl present, as a sample. Eldest a
youth about ten, who puts out his tongue at me, when he thinks I'm
not looking, and kicks his brothers beneath the table to make them
cry, which they do. I begin to wonder when my real pupil will appear.
Governess talks to me as if I were a brother professional. Query
—infra dig. again?
Children, being forbidden to talk in anything but French at meals,
say nothing at all; at the end I am astounded at Materfamilias
catching hold of the boy of ten, and bringing him round to me, with
the remark,—
"Perhaps you'd like to talk to Ernie about lessons."
Heavens! This nursery fledgling to be my pupil! And I am to
be his "companion"! Fledgling, while standing in front of me
for inspection, has the audacity to stretch out his leg, and trip up a
little sister who is passing. Howls ensue.
A nicely-mannered youth!
_'' You will have to behave yourself with me, young man!" I warn
him, in a tone whioh ought to abash him, but doesn't in the least.
"Ah, but perhaps you won't stay here long," is his rather able
rejoinder. Our Governesses never"
"Ernie!" shrieks his mother, threateningly. Ernie stops; and
I have time to regret my folly in not inquiring of the President the
precise age of my promising disciple. Very likely President didn't
know himself.
The other boys who were at supper are now presented to me. One
is about eight, the other not more than six.
"These are Herbie and Jack," says their mother, who ought to
know. Thank Heaven, they are not my pupils!
Mrs. Bristol Merchant horrifies me by saying—
"I thought it would be so nice, when you were teaching Ernie,
if Herbie and Jack could be taught too.' And after lessons you will
be able to take them such nice long walks in the neighbourhood!
It's really very pretty country, Mr.—I forget your name."
Oh. certainly, the President was quite right. She is very
uncultivated. That ever I was born to cultivate her—or her precious
offspring! But was IP Time must show.

SARTORIAL EUPHUISMS.
"Measurements about the same as they used to be, Snippe?"
"Yes, Sib. Chest a trifle lower down, Sir, that's all I"
AN ARGUMENTUM AD POCKETUM.
[The Rev. B. Mbredyth-Kitbon called the attention of the London
School Board to the action of Mr. Montagu Williams, who, being appealed
to by " a respectable-looking woman" for the remission of a fine of five shil-
lings imposed upon her husband for neglecting to send their children to
school, gave her five shillings out of the poor-box to pay it, on finding that
she had nine children, the eldest fifteen years, the youngest five months,
a husband out of work, and "no boots for her children to go to school in."
The Rev. Stewart Headlam said that in East London they suffered a
good deal through the decisions of Mr. Montagu Williams, who constantly
paid the fines from the poor-box, or out of his own pocket!]
Oh, Montagu, this conduct is nefarious!
You are, indeed, a pretty Magistrate!
Better the judgments, generous, if precarious,
Of the old Cadi at an Eastern gate.
No wonder that you madden Meredith-Ettson,
And stir the bitter bile of Stewart Headlam:.
When Justice, School-Board ruling simply "sits on,"
School-Boards become a mere annexe of—Bedlam t
Nine children! Husband out of work! No boots!
And do you really think that these are reasons
For fine-remission r This strikes at the roots
Of Law. whioh ought to rule us at all seasons.
Oh, how shall Kitson educate the " kids,"
Or how shall Headlam discipline the mothers,
If you, instead of doing what Law bids,
Pay the poor creatures' fines and raise up bothers P
Law, Sir, is Law, even to Magistrates,
Not a mere chopping-block for maudlin charity.
Fining the impecunious doubtless grates
On feelings such as yours; there's seme disparity
'Twixt School-Hoard Draconism, and regard
For parents penniless, and children bootless;
But pedagogues—ask Headlam—must be hard,
Or pedagogy's purposes are fruitless.
Poor creatures P Humph! Compassion's mighty'fine;
A gentle feeling, who would wish to shook it?
But husbands out of work with children nine,
Should pay their fines themselves—not from your pocket.

The SaMon ended; in the Park the vehioles are far and few,
And down the lately-crowded Raw one horseman canters on a
By staoka of unperoeptive ohairs; the turf
is burnt, the leaves are brown,
A stagnant sultriness prevaila—the yery
air's gone out of town!
Belgravia 's drawn her blinds, and let her
window-boxes run to seed;
Street-urchins play in porticoes—no pow-
dered menial there to heed;
Now fainter grows the lumbering roll of
luggage-cumbered omnibus:
Bayswater's children all are off upon their
annual exodus.
On every hoarding posters flaunt the charms
of peak, and loch, and sea,
To madden those unfortunates who have to stay in town—like me!
Gone are the inoonsiderate friends who tell one airily, "They 're off!"
And ask " what you propose to do—yacht, shoot, or fish, or walk, or
golf?"
On many a door whioh opened wide in welcome but the other day,
The knocker basks in calm repose—oonsoious " the family's away."
I soan the windows—half in hope I may some friendly faoe detect—
To meet their blank brown-papered stare, depressing as the outdireot!
I pass the house where She is not, to feel an unfamiliar chill;
That door is disenohanted now, that number powerless to thrill!
'Twas there, in yonder balcony, that last July she used to Btand;
Upon some balcony, more blest, she's leaning now, in Switzerland,
Her eyes upon rote-tinted peaks—but no, of sense I'm quite bereft!
The hour is full early yet, and table dhoti she'll soarce have left.
Some happy neighbour's handing her the salad But I '11 move, I
think;
I see a grim caretaker's eye regard me through the shutter's chink.
Yes, I '11 away,—no longer be the sport of sentiment forlorn,
Bat soale the heights of Primrose Hifl, pretending it's the Matterhorn;
Or hie me through the dusk to sit beside the shimmering Serpentine,
And, with a little make-believe, imagine I am up the Rhine.
Alas! the poor device, I know, my restlessness will ne'er assuage:
Still Fanoy beats, with pinions dipped, the wires of its Cockney cage I

And neither Hyde nor Regent's Park suggests a Continental Tour!
VOCES POPULI.
IX AN OMNIBUS.
The majority of the inside passengers, as usual, tit in solemn silence,
and gaze pott their opposite neighbours into vacancy, A couple
of Matrons converse m wheezy whispers.
First Matron. Well, I must say a bus is pleasanter riding than
what they used to be not many years baok, and then so much
oheaper, too. Why, you oan go all the way right from here to Mile
End Road for threepence 1
Second Matron. What, all that way for threepence—[with an
impulse of vague humanity.) The poor orses I
First Matron. Ah, well, my dear, it's Competition, you know,-
it don't do to think too muoh of it.
Conductor {stopping the bus). Orohard Street, Lady!
[ To Second Matron, who had desired to be put down there.
Second Matron (to Conductor). Just move on a few doors further,
opposite the boot-shop. (To First Matron.) It will save us walking.
Conductor. Cert'inly, Mum, we '11 drive in and wait while you 're
try in' 'em on, if you like — we ain't in no 'urry I
[ The Matrons get out, and their places are taken by two young
girls, who are in the middle of a conversation of thrilling
interest.
First Girl. I never liked her myself—ever since the way she
behaved at his Mother's that Sunday.
Second Oirl. How did she behave P
[A faint curiosity is ditcerntble amongst the other passengers to
learn how she—whoever she is—behaved that Sunday.
First Oirl. Why, it was you told me! You remember. That
night Jox let out about her and the automatic scent fountain.

First Girt. That was Eliza, all over. If Georoe had been sensible,
he'd have broken it off then and there—but no, he wouldn't hear a
word against her, not at that time—it was the button-hook opened
his eyes!
[The other passengers strive to dissemble a frantic desire to know
how and why this delicate operation was performed.
Second Girl [mysteriously). And enough too! But what put
George off most was her keeping that bag so quiet.
[The general imagination is once more stirred to Hi depths by
this mysterious allusion.
Firtt Girl. Yes, he did feel that, I know, he used to oome and go
on about it to me by the hour together. "I shouldn't have minded
so much," he told me over and over again, with the tears standing in
his eyes,—" if it hadn't been that the bottles was all silver-mounted!"
Second Girl. Silver-mounted? I never heard of that before—no
wonder he felt hurt!
First Girl (impressively). Silver tops to everyone of them—and
that girl to turn round as she did, ana her with an TTnole in the oil
and colour line, too—it nearly broke Geoboe'b 'art!
Second Girl. He's snoh a one to take on about things—but, as I
said to him, "George," I says, "You must remember it might have
been worse. Suppose you'd been married to that girl, and then
found out about Alf and the Jubilee sixpence—how would that
have been P"
Firtt Girl (unconsciously acting as the mouth-piece of the other
passengers). And what did he say to that t
Second Girl. Oh, nothing—there was nothing he could say, but I
could see he was struck. She behaved very mean to the last—she
wouldn't send baok the German concertina.
Fn-st Girl. You don't say so! Well, I wouldn't have thought
that of her, bad as she is.
Second Girl. No, she stuok to it that it wasn't like a regular
Eresent, being got through a grooer, and as she couldn't send him
ack the tea, being drunk,—but did you hear how she treated Emma
over the crinoline 'at she got for her P
First Girl (to the immense relief of the rest). No, what was that?
Second Girl. Well, I had it from Emma her own self. Eliza
wrote up to her and says, in a postscript like,—Why, this is Tottenham
Court Boad, I get out here. Good-bye, dear, 1 must tell you the rest
another day.
[Gets out, leaving the tantalised audience inconsolable, and long-
ing for courage to question her companion as to the prectte
details of Eliza's heartless behaviour to George. The com-
panion, however, relapses into a stony reserve. Enter a
Chatty Old Gentleman who has no secret* from anybody,
and of course selects as the first recipient of his confidence
the one person who hates to be talked to in an omnibus.
The Chatty 0. G. I've just been having a talk with the police-
man at the corner there—what do you think I said to him P
His Opposite Neighbour. I—I really don't know.
The C. O. G. Well, I told him he was a rich man compared to
me. He said, "I only get thirty shillings a week, Sir." "Ah," I
said, "but look at your expenses, compared to mine. What would
you do if you had to spend eight hundred a-year on your children's
education P I spend that—every penny of it, Sir.
His Opp. N. [utterly uninterested). Do you indeed?—dear me!
C. O. G. Not that I grudge it—a good education is a fortune in
itself, and as I've always told my boys, they must make the best
of it, for it's all they '11 get. They 're good enough lads, but I've
had a deal of trouble with them one way and another—a deal of
trouble. (Pauses for some expression of sympathy—which does not
come—and he continues:) There are my two eldest sons—what must
they do but fall in love with the same lady—the same lady. Sir!
(No one seems to care much for these domestic revelations—possibly
because they are too obviously addressed to the general ear.) And,
to make matters worse, she was a married woman—(his principal
hearer looks another way uneasily)—the wife of a godson of mine,
which made it all the more awkward, y' know. (His Opposite
Neighbour giving no sign, the C. 0. G. tries one Passenger after
another.) Well, I went to him—(here he fixes an old Lady, who
immediately passes up coppers out of her glove to the Conductor)—
I went to him, and said— (addressing a smartly dressed young Lady
with a parcel, who giggles)—! said, "You're a man of the world—
so am I. Don't you take any notice," I told him—(this to a callow
young man, who blushes)— they're a couple of young fools," I
said, "but you tell your dear wife from me not to mind those boys
of mine—they'll soon get tired of it if they're only let alone."
And so they would have, long ago, it's my belief, if they 'd met
with no encouragement—but what oan I do—it's a heavy trial to a
father, you know. Then there's my third son—he must needs go
and marry—(to a Lady at his side with a reticule, who gasps faintly)—
some young woman who dances at a Music-hall—nice daughter-in-
law that for a man in my position, eh? I've forbidden him the
house of oourse, and told his mother not to have any communication
with him—but I know, Sir,— (violently, to a Man on his other tide,
who coughs in much embarrassment)—I know she meets him once a
week under the eagle in Orme Square, and I oan't stop her! Then
I'm worried about my daughters—one of 'em gave me no peace till

IN THE KNOW.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)
Headers of this journal will be surprised to learn that I am
penning these lines from Blancheville, which as everybody, except
the ohief of the chowder-heads, knows is
the most important town of one of the
principal departments of France. Nothing
but an overwhelming' sense of what is due
to myself, to my readers, and to my coun-
try, would have dragged me from the
Metropolis at this season of the year. But
a distinction was offered to me, a distinc-
tion so unique and so dazzling that I felt
that it would not be fair to my fellow
ceuntrymen, of all ages, and of every
party, if I failed to take advantage of it,
and thus to present to the envious world the proud speotaole of an
Englishman honoured by the great Frenoh nation. I will narrate the
matter as briefly as is consistent with my respect for accuraoy, and
with my contempt for the tapioca-brained nincompoops who snarl,
and chatter, and cackle at me in the organ of Mr. J. Last Friday I
received this telegram:- Blancheville, Friday.
The inhabitants of Blancheville, in public meeting assembled,
felicitate you on stupendous sucoess of all your prophecies. Desiring
to honour you in the name of France, the mother of glorious heroes,
and the eldest daughter of Liberty, they have awarded to you the
Montyon prize for virtue, and have seleoted you as Rosier en
ferpituite de Blancheville, a new post never before held by a man.
resentation on Sunday. Come at once.
(Signed) Caramel, Maire de Blancheville.
I started that evening In the course of the following day I
reached Blancheville. The people, in their holiday attire, were
gathered in thousands at the railway station. M. Cabamel, accom-
panied by the Prefet and the Sous-Prefet, all in their tricolor
sashes, was the first to greet me. Saluting me on both cheeks, he
called upon the world to witness that this was indeed a great day for
Blancheville. My escort, under the command of General Count
Croutaujpot, then formed up. I mounted the gilded Car of Viotory,
specially provided for the celebration, and, amidst the plaudits of
the assembled millions, I was drawn by a specially-seleoted band of
Enfant* de la Patrie (a sort of body-guard, composed entirely of the
French aristocracy) to the palace, which had been prepared for my
reception. At the banquet, in the Town Hall, the healths of the
Queen and of M. Cabnot were followed by a lengthy speech, in
English, from my brother Caramel (we have sworn fraternity), in
whioh he declared that the centuries looked down and redazed in this
joioe, and that it was a delight for him to carry a toast to the illus-
trious visitor who had deigned to come to Blancheville. On the
following day the ceremony took place. I transcribe and translate
from Le Petit Colporteur de Blancheville, the chief looal journal, an
account of what took place.
"On this day, so great and glorious for our France, it is not
:v-'~ to refrain from tears of joy and satisfaction. We nave made

him Rosier en perpiluiti de Blancheville, him the proudest and
most sympathetic writer who has dazzled Europe sinoe the great
and illustrious Plumeau" (a looal author of repute) "departed from
us. The history of this day must be written. Let us essay to do
it as it should be done. In the early morning twelve seleoted
maidens, robed in muslin and lilies, sang the Tocsin de la Patrie
outside the Palace where our guest reposed. Soon afterwards he
himself appeared in flowing white garments, and showered blessings
upon their heads. He descended. He entered the four-in-hand-
teams whioh the Maire had, as a compliment to England, made up
with a char-d-banc of the neighbourhood. Thus he was drawn to
the Market Plaee, where some of our bravest veterans fired in his
honour a thundering salute. The beautiful and admirable Madame
Caramel then advanced to him with a wreath of roses in her hand.
She crowned him with it. saying, 'Wear this for Blanoheville.
Nobly hast thou earned it. With difficulty the illustrious author
preserved his calm. A tear sparkled in his eye. He bent low, and
m a voioe ohoked with emotion, thanked the citizens of our town.
Then mounting on a milk-white steed, and surrounded by the
young men of the district, he received from the Prifet the Prix
Montyon for virtue."
The rest is too flattering. I am hastening home. The Queer
has been graciously pleased to permit me to wear the Prix Montyon
at Court. Can a man want more P Yours, in all humility,
Lb Rosier de Blancheville.

Lord George Puff and Sir John Bull discovered attending a
rehearsal of the Naval Estimates.
Lord^ Oeorge. And now I pray your particular attention. Sir John,
as this is the best thing in my play—it is a spectaoular effect called
the Summer Manoeuvres.
Sir John. And no doubt costly, Lord George P
Lord Oeorge. You are right, Sir John, as you will have an
opportunity of finding out—hereafter.. But to the argument. It is
supposed that the British Fleet is at war with, indeed, the British
Fleet.
Sir John. A very clever idea.
Lord Oeorge. I natter myself it is, and novel too. It is true that
occasionally the Bhips comprising the British Fleet have run into one
another in the past just as if they had been at war, but then they
were avowedly at peace, and now they are undoubtedly the reverse.
Do you take my meaning?
Sir John. Well, not clearly. How do you ehow that the British
Fleet is at war with the British Fleet P
Lord Oeorge. Ah, there comes in my art, and I think you will
confess I have a very pretty wit. You Bee I divide the British Fleet
into two parts—one part represents the enemy and the other part
represents itself like the House of Commons, a most representative
body. That is dear, I hope?
Sir John. Certainly—one is the British Fleet, and the other is not
the British Fleet. But is there no bond of union?
Lord George. Most assuredly there is—you pay for both. But,
pardon me, I beg you will not further interrupt me. So, now that
we have the two Fleets face to face, or, I should say, bow to starn, we
proceed exactly as if there were a real quarrel between them. We
Bpend money on coal, we spend money on pay, we spend money on
ammunition. Nay, by my life, we spend money on everything—just
as we should do if war were really declared! That's simple
enough.
Sir John. I confess your plan does seem simple.
Lord Oeorge. And there is more behind. We are not satisfied
with merely spending money—we learn a lesson as well. Come, you
must confess that surprises you P
Sir John. Well, I admit that generally, where there is any
spending of money, it is / who learn the lesson.
Lord Oeorge. Good—distinctly good! But let us be serious.
Well, when we are carrying on a war by every means in our power,
we fancy that one Fleet is chasing the other. They both have equal
speed, and we give one Fleet twenty-four hours' start of the other,
and will you believe me that, although the first follows the second
as fast as may be from the beginning to the end of the manoeuvring,
they never see one another! On my life—never! They never see
the British Fleet, because it's not in sight!
Sir John. But could you not have learned all this without so great
an expenditure of money P
Lord George. Well, no, Sir John—not at the Admiralty!
Sir John. And how do you end the farce P
Lord George. In the usual fashion, Sir John (ignites blue fire)—in
smoke!

MR. PUNCH'S SWIM ROUND THE WORLD.
(From his own Prophetic Log book.)
Eerne Bay.—The weather being extremely favourable, I jumped
off the end of the new pier, and, getting the benefit of the flood tide,
passed the Nore and inspected Southend. Swimming quite easily,
assisted by one or two short rests.
Margate.—Beached this popular seaside place a few hours later.
Swam out of sight of the sands to rid myself of a view of the excur-
sion riff-raff thereon congregated. Sea completely smooth, but cold.
Took a nip of 's English Cognac.
Samsgate.—Very pleased to find myself abreast of the Royal
Crescent, which seemed delightful. Cape Grisnez still bearing N.E.
by E. Munched one of 's excellent Birchrod Biscnits.
Dover.—Just had a good long rest in front of Clarence Lawn,
which glistened in the sunlight. Qreatly refreshed after a drink of 's Essence of Gravy beef.
Calais.—A shower of rain came on at this point. However, one of
——'» excellent umbrellas kept my head dry, and, being easy to hold,
did not prevent me from swimming and writing up my log.
Gibraltar.—I felt very fatigued going through the Bay of Biscay,
but recovered much of my strength off the fortress by suoking one of 's capital Kill-cough Lozenges.
Malta.—I have now been in the water six days and three nights
continuously, and yet am nearly as fresh as when I started. I
attribute this marvellous fact to my practice of sipping 's Essence
of Coffeetine.
Aden.—Water extremely hot. but am still confident of success.
Went to sleep for an hour in the Red Sea, smoking one of 's
Anti-alligator cigarettes, which are a real preventive against
crocodile annoyance.
Madras.—Am continuing my side-stroke but somewhat languidly.
I half regretted that I was unable to go on shore to see the Indian
curiosities. Much refreshed after partaking of the oontents
of ——'§ Patent Luncheon Basket.
Singapore.—Have now been continually in the water for six
weeks. Regret that my log should be so "scrappy," but my time
just now is very much occupied by other things. Tired, but confi-
dent of success. During the last fortnight have fed with great relish
upon 'a Puri* de fuiei grot. It is not only cheap, but excellent,
Xttr Hebrides.—Am now within measurable distance of the end of
my journey. Quite accustomed to the water. However, greatly
fatigued, and very pleased to eat some of 'a Alimentary Con-
diment.
Pitcairn Island.—Glad to be again in these latitudes. My strokes
are now very feeble. I should have to give in were it not for '■
Medicated Mutton Broth, whioh seems to be most nourishing.
Cape Town—In a fainting condition. Scarcely able to hold this
pen. Became better after eating 's Digestible Plum Puddings,
sold in tin oanisters at Is. lQd. per pound.
Itio Janeiro.—Terribly hot and exhausted. I have now been
three months continuously in the water, which is certainly a long
time. Muoh amused with a toy called 's Mechanical Rabbit.
Cape Verde Islands.—Almost unconscious from fatigue. However,
I can swim more easily after I have drunk a glass or two of 'i
Cabbage Rose Temperance Non-Intoxicating Sherry. It is a most
admirable beverage.
Madeira.—I move with the greatest difficultv, and fear I must be
sinking. I obtain great strength from an occasional sip of 'a
"Beef-fibre" (title registered) which seems to me worth twioe its
weight in gold.
Dublin.—Have now been in the water continuously for nearly
half a year. Too feeble to look at Dublin. I am evidently sinking,
and can only keep off a relapse by eating 's Patent Vegetable
Substitute for Roast Pork.

As stated in the Daily Telegraph of Thursday last, the Russian
Censor stamped out Mr. Punch's Cartoon, "From Nile to Neva,"

tainly is a study in black, without any relief whatever. A Black

WHAT THE TAME RABBIT

{Some way after "Alice in

ing. (Laughter.) Yes, that is a
subject for merriment, probably,
on account of its comparative
novelty, but it is also a subject of
satisfaction, which is akin to
merriment, because this rabbit-
farming appears to be a very good
and promising description of pur-
suit. . . . That is the raising
of tame rabbits."—Mr. Gladstone
at the Hawarden Floral and
Horticultural Society's Show.
These were the verses the Tame
Babbit recited:—
The Grand Old Man was on
the stir;
Mokant named me to him;
He gave me a good character;
I thought his meaning dim.
He held me up; they thought
it fan!
And laughed; he chid their
glee. [on,
If he should push this matter
What will become of Me P
He said I was a paying game,
Commending me as such.
That's the result of being
tame,
And living in a hutoh.
My notion is that it is -vain
For you, you Grand Old
Fella,
To rave of rabbits in the rain,
Beneath a big umbrella.

For this should ever be
A secret kept from all the rest,

ROBERT'S LITTLE HOLLERDAY.
Mr hollerday, or sum of it, was spent in Hopen Spaces. Hif any-
body as has got two eyes in his hed, and a hart in his buzzom, wants
for to see what can be done with about 40 hakers of land—witch the
most respecfool Gardiner told me was about the size of the Queen's
Park at Kilburn—let him go there on a fine Summer's Arternoon,
and see jest about five thowsen children a playing about there, all
free, and hindependent, and appy, with two fountings to drink
when they 're ot and thirsty, and a nice littel Jim Nasyum to climb
up and down. They ain't allowed to play at Cricket ooz there ain't
not room enuf, but I did see two bold littel chaps, about six a peace,
a breaking of the Law, and a playing at the forbidden game, with
a jacket for the wicket and a stick for a Bat, and the kind-arttd
Gardiner hadn't got hart enuff to stop 'em.
He told me as now, when the Copperashun fust took possesshun of
it, it was nothink but a Baron Swomp, but that, what with the
spending of lots of money, and the souperintending genus of Major
Makenzie, in two years it was maid to blossom like a rose. I spent
a werry plessant arternoon there, and drove home in style on the
Box 8eat of a reel Company's Bus. The nex day I went to Hi gate
Wood, another of the grate works of the good old Copperashun.
And lawks, what a difference! No swarms of children a playing
about on the grass, but lots and lots on 'em a racing about among
the hundreds of trees, and their warious fathers and mothers a
looking on with smiling faces and prowd looks. There is one
place in the werry middle of the Wood where no less than sewen
parths meets, and there the Copperashun Committee has bilt up
a bewtifool Founting, and a long hinskripshun in praise of Water,
tho I shood dout if they speaks from werry much pussonal xperi-
enoe. I was told as how, when they fust hopened the Founting,
the Chairman made a bewtifool speech, and ended by saying, '' Water,
brite Water for me, and Wine for the trembling Debborshee," and
then they all went off to a jolly good dinner.
With that artistick taste as so distinguishes 'em. they have
crissened the place where the seven roads meets, The Seven
Dials." There was crowds of peeple there, all enjoying of themselves
in a nice quiet way, and altogether it was a werry werry nice site.
The werry next day I started in the warm sunshine for pretty
West Ham Park, and had a leetle adwenture as ushal, for jest as
I got there who shoud I meet but the rayther sillybrated Parson of
the Parish—tho' judgin by aperienoes I shoud have took him for the
Bishop of Essex—and seeing me in my new Hat and my best black
Coat, he werry naterally took me for a inquiring Wisher, and told
me all about the good deed of the Copperashun in saving the
Park for the good of the Peeple. There was some werry little
chaps a playing Cricket as before despite of the Law, and they had
a reel bat too, and one on 'em, seeing me a looking on apruvingly,
gave the ball such a tremenjus blow that he got a tooer, so I called
out braywo!
There seemed a lot of washing going on jest outside the Park, the
white shirts and settera, flustering gaily in the breeze. But, as the
Poet says, "they're alius Washing Bomewheres in the World I"
The common peeple was orderd to walk on the footpaths, but a
gardiner told me as them orders was not ment for such as me. I
had a most copious Lunch for tuppense in the helegant Pawillion,
and being in a jowial and ginerus mood, I treated six of the jewwenile
natives to a simmeler Bank wet. Then there is the sillibrated Band
as the Copperashun perwides twioe a week, on which occasions
reserwed seats is charged a penny each. The werry adwanced state
of the musical taste of the nayberhood may be judged by the fact,
that at a Concert close by, a " Ode to a Butterfly" was to be played
on a base Trombone!
The Gardiner told me as there was such a crowd of children on
larst Bank Hollerday that there was hardly room to move about,
tho' the Park is 80 hakers big; but as I am told that such a space
wood hold about 80 thousand, quite cumferal, I thinks as he must
have slitelj- xadgerated. Bobkbt

THE PROFESSIONAL QUEST.
AT THE SEA-SIDE.
Dear Mb. Punch,—When I last wrote to you I was antioipatorily
revelling in the sea-bathing, tennis tournaments, pier band, and even-
ing promenades of Flatsands. Alas! that I must confess it, but, after a
fortnight's visit to
that "salubrious
spot" (vide highly-
coloured advertise-
ments), I give it as
my opinion that
Flatsands is a
failure; and I
think that, when
you have listened
to, or rather pe-
rused, my tale of
woe, you will agree
with me that it is a
place to be avoided
at all costs.
On the difficul-
ties and length of
my journey thither
(I changed five
times, and spent
nine hours in doing
so), I will not
dwell, neither will
I lay stress on the
faot that, when I
did at last reach
my destination, a
prospect void of either Aunt, or conveyance of any kind, met my
view, or that a heavy sea-mist had gathered, and was falling in
the guise of penetrating, if fine, rain. After parleying with the
station-master for some time, I ascertained that the station 'bus
never put in an appearanoe in wet weather, and that I could not get
a closed fly, beoause the Flatsands' conveyances were all pony-
traps, and therefore hoodless. He, however, directed me towards
Balmoral, whioh was my Aunt's 'address, and told me that ten
minutes' walk would take me, and that my luggage should be sent
after me, on a truck.
After some difficulty, for the sea-fog was very thick, Ijdiseovered
Balmoral, but not my Aunt. The truculent-looking proprietor of
the house, who answered the door, condescended to inform me that
my relative "was the difficultest lady he'd ever had to do for.
And that she'd left two days a-gone." But where she had betaken
herself to, he either would not or could not tell me. "You'd best
try along this row," he said, and then slammed the door in my
face. Having nothing better to do, I followed his advice, and "tried
along the row." I rang at Osborne, Sandringham, and Windsor.
I knocked at Claremont (the bell was broken there), and walked
boldly into Marlborough House, for that royal residence in particular
was devoid of all ordinary means of heralding one's approach. I
was just giving up my quest in despair, when through the rain,
which was now falling heavily, I spied a small stucco villa standing
shriakingly back behind a row of palings, which, in spite of their
green paint, looked more like domestic tire-sticks than anything
else. The somewhat suggestive name of Frogmore was inscribed
on the small gate, and I remembered that I quite shivered as I
walked up the sloppy path, with my usual inquiry ready to hand.
This time, though, T was right, and when, a few minutes later, I
was sitting before a roaring fire, imbibing hot tea, and listening to
my Aunt's account of her latest complaint (did I tell you she was
hypochondriacal i) I felt that really and at last I was in for a
pleasant visit.
The evening proved a short one, for Aunt retired at nine, for
whioh I was not sorry, as by that time the atmosphere of the sitting-
room was distinctly stuffy, and neither dinner, nor the fumes of toe
invalid's hot-and-strong "night-oap" improved it. Next morning
I sympathised with her on the faot that, soon after she had gone to
bed, the young lady on the drawing-room floor (for two other families
shared Frogmore's roof with us) had begun to sing, and had con-
tinued her performances till midnight; but I found my commisera-
tion wasted, for she said that it had soothed her, whioh was con-
siderably more than it had done me. After breakfast—which was
late, on account of Aunt's health—I proposed a stroll on the Prome-
nade, or an inspection of the tennis courts. "Bless my soul!" cried
Auntie, "a person in my state of health does not go to places all over
promenades and tennis courts. You won't find any such things at a
nice quiet resort like Flatsands." I felt a little dashed, but replied
"that perhaps she was right, and that it was a nice change to be
without tennis; and that, as to promenades, they were quite super-
fluous where there was a pier, and a good band. "A pier, child!"
she screamed. "You won t find any such abominations as piers here,
or German bands either. Do you think that I should come anywhere
where there was a pier?" I felt the smile on my face becoming fixed,
but I mastered my feelings sufficiently to murmur something about
bathing before lunch.
"You can't bathe here," snapped Aunt—"they don't allow it.
The shore is too dangerous. But you can come out with me, if you
like, to the tradespeople—I see my bath-chair ooming along the road."
And that, Mr, Punch, is how I spent my fortnight at Flatsands.
Walking by the side of my Aunt's chair, and giving orders to the
tradespeople in the morning; walking beside the same chair and
blowing up the tradespeople for not having carried out the orders,
in the afternoon; sitting in a hot room from five to nine o'clock,
then lying awake till midnight, listening to the drawing-room
young lady singing Italian and German songs out of tune, and with
an English accent.
Three things only ooourred to in any way vary the monotony of
my existence. The first was the arrival of the singing young lady's
brother. He was seventeen, and bis lungs were as thick as bis
boots. He tobogganed down-stairs on a tea-tray the first day he
arrived; the second day he passed me in the hall and asked, with
a grin, "if I was one of the mummies in this old mausoleum!'"
the third day he left, saying that the place was " too jolly beastly
slow" for him. The second event was the sadden extraordinary
mania that Aunt (did I tell you she was rich ?) took for the singing
lady. I discovered, much to my chagrin, I must say, that often,
instead of going to bed at nine, as I believed she did, she used to
ensonnce herself in the drawing-room, and there sit and listen to
indifferent music till all hours. It was this second event which
brought about the third excitement. For having been a little
imprudent one night, in the matter of "night-caps," or oareless as
to draughts, my Aunt was taken seriously ill. At least she chose
to think herself so, though I now have vague suspicions that the
singing ludy knew more about it all than she cared to tell. All I
know is that the dootor was sent for, and that, after a long confab
in the siok room, he came to me and ordered my immediate return
home. _ "Your poor Aunt requires perfect quiet," he said.
Having no ohoioe in the matter, I packed my boxes; not exactly
with reluctance, but still with an uncomfortable feeling of being
wanted out of the way. Aunt's last words to me rather confirmed
my suspicions. "Ah! you are off, are you? Well, I may pull
through this time—I think I feel better already." Then, with a
peoking kiss, and an inaudible remark anent the ingratitude of
relations, she dismissed me. As I left the house I distinctly heard
that singing creature run up-stairs and into Aunt's room.
On the way back to town I decided that she (Aunt I mean) was
right—relations are disgustingly ungrateful.

MODERN TYPES.
{By Mr. Punch's own Type Writer.)
No. XVIII.—THE UNDOMESTIO DAUGHTER.
The race of daughters is large, but their characteristics, vocations,
and aptitudes, are but little understood by the general public It
is expected of them by their mothers that they should be a comfort,
by their fathers that they should be inexpensive and unlike their
brothers, and by their brothers that they should be as slaves,
submissively attached to the fraternal oar of triumph. The outside
public, the mothers and fathers, that is to say, of other daughters,
look upon them vaguely, as mild and colourless beings, destitute
alike of character, of desires and of aspirations. And it must be
said that daughters themselves, before matrimony absorbs their
daughterhood and relieves them of their mothers, seem to be in the
main content with the calm and limited existence which their
relations and the voioe of tradition assign to them. Most of them after
they have passed through the flashing brilliance of their first season,
and the less radiant glow of their second, are happy enough to spend
the time that must elapse ere the destined knight shall sound the
trumpet of release at the gates of the fortress, in an atmosphere of
quiet domestic usefulness. One becomes known to fame, and her
friends, as being above all others, "such a comfort to her mother."
She interviews the cook, she arranges the dinners,
she devises light and favourite dishes to blunt
the edge of paternal irritability by tickling the
paternal palate, she writes out invitations, pre-
sides at the afternoon tea-table, and, in short,
takes upon herself many of those smaller duties
which are as last straws to the maternal back.
Another becomes the sworn friend and ally of
her brothers, whom she assists in their scrapes
with a sympathy which is balm to the scraped
soul, and with a wisdom in counsel, which can
only spring from a deep regret at not having
been herself born a boy, and capable of scrapes.
But there is often in families another and an
TJndomestio Daughter, who aspires to be in all
things unlike the usual run of common or do-
mestic daughters. From an early age she will
have been noted in the family circle for romantic
tendencies, which are a mockery to her Philis-
tine brothers, and a reproach to her common-
place sisters. She will have elevated her father
to a lofty pinnacle of imaginative and imma-
culate excellence, from which a tendency to
shortness of temper in matters of domestic finance
resulting in petty squabbles with her mother,
and an irresistible desire for after - dinner
somnolence, will have gradually displaced him.
One after another her brothers will have been
to her Knights of the Round Table of her
fancy, armed by her enthusiasm for impossible conflicts, of which
they themselves, absorbed as they are in the examination and
pocket-money struggles of boyhood, have no conception whatever.
The effort to plant the tree of romance in an ordinary middle-class
household was predestined to failure. Her disappointments are
constant and crushing. Desires and capacities which, with careful
nurture, might have come to a fair fruit, are chilled and nipped by
the frost of neglect and ridicule. Her mind becomes warped. The
work that is ready to her hand, the ordinary ronnd of family tasks
and serviceableness, repels her. She turns from it with distaste, and
thus widens still more the gulf between herself and her relatives.
Hence she is thrown baok upon herself for companionship and
comfort. She dissects, for her own bitter enjoyment, her inmost
heart. She becomes the subtle analyst of her own imaginary
motives. She calls up accusing phantoms to charge her before the
bar of her conscience, in order that she may have the qualified
satisfaction of acquitting herself, whilst returning against her
relatives a verdict of guilty on every count of the indictment. In
short, she becomes a thoroughly morbid and hysterical young woman,
suspicious, and resentful even of the sympathy which is rarely
offered to her. In the meantime, two ot her younger sisters are
wooed and won in the orthodox manner by steady-going gentlemen,
of good position and prospects. The congratulations showered upon
them, and the rejoicings which attend them on their wedding days,
only serve to add melancholy to the Undomestio Daughter, who has
already begun to solace herself for her failure to attract men by the
reflection that matrimony itself is a failure, and that there are higher
and worthier things in life than the wearing of orange-blossoms, and
going-away dresses. It must be said that her parents strive with
but little vigour against their daughter's inclination. Her father
having hinted at indigestion as the cause of her unhappiness, and
finding that the hint is badly received, shrugs his inappreheneive
shoulders, and ceases to notioe her. Her mother, persuaded that
vol. xcrx,
sanity is to be found only on the maternal side of the family, lays
the peculiarities of her daughter to the charge of some abnormal
paternal ancestor. Having thus, by implication, cleared herself
from all responsibility, she feels that she is better able to take a
detached and impartial view of errors which, seeing they are those
of her own flesh and blood, she professes herself utterly unable to
understand or to correct.
The Undomestio Daughter thus acquires the conviction that she
herself is the most miserably crushed member of a down-trodden
sex. In this, and in the agreement which she exaots from two or
three melancholy friends, she seeks a solace for her sufferings.
After a time, however, she discovers that this is insufficient. It
must be said to her credit that her energies find the outlet of a
passive sorrow inadequate. She burns to prove that one who is
misunderstood and despised cannot only find useful work to do, but
can do it better than her humdrum domestic Bisters. Unfortunately,
however, she overlooks the obvious and easy duties of her home.
She scans the remote corners of the world. Her bruised spirit
flutters about the bye-ways of charitable effort, and at length she
establishes herself as a visitor, a distributer of tracts and blankets,
and an instructor of factory girls. It is unnecessary to insist that
these occupations are useful and praiseworthy in the abstract. It may
be doubted, however, whether they should be undertaken by one who
has to neglect for them equally necessary but less attractive labours.
The Undomestio Daughter, however, rejoices
in the performance of work, which, as it were,
sets a seal; to her wretchedness, and stamps her
as a being apart from the ruck of her sex. She
now takes her meals alone, and at her own hours.
She probably breakfasts at half-past seven, and
dashes out to interview the Secretary of the
Society for Improving the Cultivation of Mus-
tard and Cress on the Desert Patches of the Mile
End District. After this she will hasten to
Lambeth, in order that mothers residing in that
teeming quarter of the town may be blessed
with mittens and mob-caps, and returning
thence she devotes an hour or so to lectures
which are to make her expert in tending the
ailments of humanity. Occasionally the family
arrangements are upset, in order that she may
have her dinner at an hour which will make it
convenient to her to attend the meeting of an
Institute for Reading Historical Novels to Work-
ing Girls, and her father will lose all his avail-
able stock of good temper on finding that the
moments generally devoted by him to soup are
ocoupied to his exclusion by the apple-tart
provided for his busy daughter. Hence come
more storms and misunderstandings. Paternal
feet are put down—for a time, and neglected
excellence pines in bed-rooms.
Shortly afterwards the Undomestio Daughter
discovers that nature intended her to be a hospital nurse, and she
takes advantage of a period when her mother, being ocoupied in
tending a younger brother through scarlatina cannot offer a deter-
mined opposition, to wring an unwilling consent from her father,
and to leave her home in order to carry out her plan. This phase,
however, does not last many weeks, and she is soon back onoe more
on the parental hands. Thus the years pass 'on, the monotony of
neglecting her home being varied by occasional outbursts of enthu-
siasm which carry her on distant expeditions in strange company.
During one of these she falls in with a lay-preacher, who to a
powerful and convincing style adds the fascination of having been
turned from an early life of undoubted dissipation. She sits at his
feet, she flatters him as only a woman can natter a preacher, and
haying eventually married him, she helps him to found a new
religion during the intervals that she can spare from the founda-
tion of a considerable family. Warned by her own experience,
she will never allow her daughters to be seen without their sewing
or their knitting. Her sons will all be forced to learn useful trades,
and it is quite possible that as time passes she may irritate even
her husband, by constantly holding herself up to her somewhat dis-
contented family as a pattern of all the domestic virtues.

epitaph. I hope and beg

THE DAMSELS OF DIEPPE;
Or, The Legend of Lionel.
"Newhaven to Dieppe," he cried, but, on the voyage there,
He felt appalling qualms of what the French call mat dt mtr;
While, when the steward was not near, he struck Byronio attitudes,
And made himself most popular by pretty little platitudes.
And, while he wobbled on the waves, be sure they never slep',
While waiting for their Lionel, the Damsels of Dieppe.
He landed with a jaunty air, bnt feeling rather weak,
While all the French and English girls oried out, " C'est magni-
flqiu.'"
They reok'd not of his bilious hue, but murmur'd quite ecstatical,
"Blue ooat, brass buttons, and straw hat, — c'est tout-d-fait
piratical!"
He hadn't got his land-legs, and he walked with faltering step,
But still they thought it comme-il-faut, those Damsels of Dieppe.
The Douane found him circled round by all the fairest fair,
The while he said, in lofty tones, he'd nothing to declare;
He turned to one girl who stood near, and softly whisper'd, "Fly,
0 Nell!"
But all the others wildly cried, "Give us a ohanoe, 0 Lionel!"
And thus he cime to shore from all the woes of Father Nep.,
With fatal fascinations for the Damsels of Dieppe.
He went to the Casino, whither mostly people go,
And lost his tin at baccarat and eke peti's chevaux:
And still the maidens Hocked around, and vowed he was amusing 'em,
And borrowed five-frano pieces, just for fear he should be losing'em;
And then he' d sandwiches and bocks, whioh brought on had dyspep-
sia for Lionel beloved by Damsels of Dieppe.
As bees will swarm around a hive, the maids of La belle France
Went mad about our Lionel and thirsted for his glance;
In short they were reduced unto a state of used-up coffee lees
By this mild, melancholic, maudlin, mournful Mephistopheles.
He rallied them in Frenoh, in whioh he had the gift of rep-
-artee, and sunnily they smiled, the Damsels of Dieppe.
At last one day he had to go; they came upon the pier;
The Frenoh girls sobbed, "Man cher.'" and then the English sighed,
"My dear!"
He looked at all the threatening waves, and cried, the while em-
bracing 'em, ['em 1"
(I mean the girls, not waves,) " Oh no! I don't feel quite like facing
And all the young things murmured, "Stay, and you will find
sweet rep-
-aration for the folks at home in Damsels of Dieppe."
And day by day, and year by yeir, whene'er he sought the sea.
The waves were running mountains high, the wind was blowing free.
At last he died, and o'er his bier his sweethearts sang doxology,
And vowed they saw his ghost, whioh came from dabbling in psy-
chology.
And to this hour that spook is seen upon the pier. If soep-
- tioal, ask anoient ladies, once the Damsels of Dieppe.

Still endeavouring: to earn an
honest, but unpleasant, penny as
a (temporary) Private Tutor.
Begin to be vaguely conscious
that my grasp of the Latin
Grammar is not as firm as it
might be. Will my classical
training see me through, or will
"Ernie" see through my clas-
sical training P
Ernie (before breakfast) offers
to conduct me round the grounds.
Must take the youngster down a
peg or two. So, when he shows
me the stables, rather proudly, I
remark, pityingly — " What!
Only three nags?"
"Oh, I ride a pony," he replies,
airily. "What can you ride,

horseback than on my legs. He
winks, as if he didn't quite

certainly infra dig. to be praising
one's accomplishments, especially
to a chit like this.
"We buried Nebo here," the
boy says, pointing to a damp
mound. He was our Newfound -
land dog, and the gardener drop-
ped a beam on him, and killed
him as dead as Julius Caesar.
Oh, Mr. Joynson. when did
Julius C'.v.sar die P"
Happily my presence of mind
does not desert me. I reply,
7 ry/'fsy

it! Don't you know
your Roman History better than
thatP"
"No," he answers—" do you?"
Then a sudden thought strikes
him. "Oh, I '11 ask Miss Myrtle" (Miss Myrtle is the Governess)
—" the '11 be sure to know. She isn't a muff."
Query—What is the best line to take with a remark like that?
Before I decide the point, H krhi k rushes out into the garden, and is
immediately sent spinning into a cucumber-frame by his kind elder
brother, who then disappears into the house.
Yells from H eriiie. Go in and send the Governess to him. Relief
from children for about ten minutes.
At Breakfast.—Mother cross. Seems to think that I ought to
have prevented Ernie from mutilating Herbie. Herbie appears
with head bandaged, still sobbing. French again, thank Heaven!
—so children silent. Never felt the advantage of foreign languages
till now.
Mamma, with a courage worthy of a better cause, asks me, "What
time lessons will begin?" I reply, evasively, that I shall be in the
library, and that I will ring for Ernest (I lay stress on the word
Ernest, as excluding the two others) when I am ready for him."
I do, after a good preliminary smoke. Herbie and Jack present
themselves at the same time. I send them off to the Governess, and
lock the door; Governess sends them back to me: result is, that
they play about outside library all morning, so that we (Ernest
and I) can hardly hear ourselves speak.
Put Ernie through his paces. Ask him what he knows. Process
(I fear) incidentally reveals to him what I know. Hear him at lunch
explaining to Herbie (with whom he has made friends again) that
I am " not bad at sums, but a shocking duffer at Latin." Pretend
not to hear the remark.
Afternoon.—Find the three boys, and two girls, all waiting—
apparently—to go out for a country walk with me!
What I Two-and-two 1 Never!
"But—er "I say, addressing the little girls, in a pleasant tone,
"aren't you going out with your Governess?"
"Oh, yes "—they both exclaim at once—" the't coming too!"
The situation is becoming more and more embarrassing. I can't,
in politeness, refuse the Governess's society for a walk. I solve the
problem, temporarily, by telling
all five children to run up to Miss
Myrtle, and ask her which way
she thinks we had better go."
They perform the commission
with alacrity, which gives me
the opportunity of slipping out
at back-door, and taking quiet
ramble by myself. When will
Paterfamilias himself turn up?
I have not Been or heard from
Mr. Bristol Merchant yet.
I am fated, however, to hear
from him pretty soon; and, when
I do, his communication is sur-
prising. It comes in the form of
a telegram, addressed to me. It
runs thus:—
"Just heard President asked
you to take tutorship. Misunder-
standing. Very sorry, but have
myself engaged another tutor.
He will arrive this evening.
Shall I tell him not to come?
Awkward! Wire reply."
Awkward! On the contrary,
I feel it to be almost providential.
Mamma doesn't apologise, but
says, frankly — " Why, if he
oomes, there'll be two tutors —
and one is quite enough!"
I telegraph briefly to the effect
that, under the circumstances, I
will go at once.
Bid good-bye (after lunch) to
Ernie, in hall. He says—"I
knew you would never do for the
plaoe, and ought to have his
ears boxed by his fond Mamma,
but hasn't. As I go down front
walk, see him and Herbie and
Jack all putting out what I think
I may appropriately call their
"mother tongues" at me from
a top window!
Moral—for my own consump-
tion: Never go to an uncultivated
family again.
So ends my Tutorship! And
I've never once set eyes on my
employer all through I
After this fiatco, the President certainly ought to do something
handsome for me.
He does! Writes and says how sorry he is to hear of the stupid
mistake that has been made. He knows of another very nice family,
in Cheshire, who want a Private Tutor. Shall he mention my
to them t Not for worlds!

MISLED BY A MANUAL!
(The Lament of a Would-be Linouist.)
When on my Continental tour preparing to depart,
I bought a Conversation-Book, and got it up by heart;
A handy manual it seemed, oonvenient and neat,
And gave for each contingency a dialogue complete.
Upon the weather—wet or fine—I could at will discourse,
Or bargain for a bonnet, or a boot-jack, or a horse;
Tell dentists, in three languages, which tooth it is that hurts;
Or chide a laundress for the lack of starch upon my shirts.
I landed full of idioms, which I fondly hoped to air —
But crushing disappointment met my efforts everywhere.
The waiters I in fluent French addressed at each hotel
Would answer me in English, and—confound 'em I—spoke it well.
Those phrases I was furnished with, for Germany or Franoe,
I realised, with bitterness, would never have a chance!
I swore that they should hear me yet, and proudly turned my back
On polyglots in swallowtails, and left the beaten track
They spoke the native language now; but—it was too absurd—
Of none of their own idioms they apparently had heard!
My most colloquial phrases fell, I found, extremely flat.
They may have come out wrong-side up, but none the worse for that.
I tried them with my Manual; it was but little good;
For not one word of their replies I ever understood.
They never said the sentences that should have followed next:
I found it quite impossible to keep them to the text!
Besides, unblushing reference to a Conversation-Book
Imparts to social intercourse an artificial look.
Bo I let the beggars have their way. 'Twas everywhere the same;
I led the proper openings—they wouldn't play the game.
Now I've pitched the Manual away that got
me in this mess,
And in ingenious pantomime my wishes I
express.
They take me for an idiot mute, an error I
deplore;
But still—I'm better understood than e'er
I was before!

Theatre on the 27th opened its doors at t
?[uarter to three o'clock in the afternoon,
or the performance of The Violin Makers,
an adaptation of Le Luthier de Critrume,
and the production of a "new and original
Comedy sketch," in two Acts, called The
Deacon, by Henry Author Jones. The
first piece I had already seen at the Bnihej
Theatre, with Professor Herkokkr, R.A.,
in the principal oharaoter. I had now an
opportunity of comparing the Artist-Actor
with the Manager-Actor, and must confess
that I liked the former better than the
latter. Mr. Willard as Filippo, was Mr.
Willard, but Professor Hexkomer, shaved
for the occasion, seemed to be anyone other
than Professor H erkomer. The mounting
of the piece at Bushey was also greatly to
be preferred to the mise-en-scene in Shaftes-
bury Avenue, and as the accomplished
Artist-Actor had also supplied some exceed-
ingly touching music to his version of
Franqois Coppbe's Poetical Play, which
was wanting two hundred yards from Pic-
cadilly Circus, I was altogether better
pleased with the entertainment served up
with sauce d la Herkomer. I may be wrong
in preferring the amateur to the profes-
sional, or I may be ri^ht—after all, it is
merely a matter of opinion.
Mr. Jones is entirely justified in call-
ing The Deacon a "sketch," as it oan
scarcely claim greater histrionic importance. I think I may take
it for granted that a sausage-maker, from the nature of hit
employment, is usually presumed to be a man not absolutely
without guile, and, therefore, Abraham Boothroyd, "Wholesale
baoon-f aotor. Mayor of Chipping Padbury on the Wold, and Senior
Deacon of Ebenezer Chapel, may perhaps be counted one of those
exceptions that are said to prove the rule. According to Mr. Jones,
this eccentric individual comes up to town to attend an indignation
meeting held with a view to protesting against the conversion of
Exeter Hall into a temple of the drama, and after dining with "i
Juliet of fifteen years ago," and a new and quaint sort of Barrister,
aooompanies them to the play, and is so greatly pleased with the
performances presented to him, that, before the curtain falls, he
announces his intention of repeating his visit to the theatre every
evening until further notice! This may be true to human nature,
because there is authority for believing that the said human nature is
occasionally a "rum un"; but, without the precedent I have
quoted, it is difficult to accept the sudden conversion of Mr. Booth-
royd as quite convincing. I could scarcely have believed that
Mr. Jones, who has done such excellent work in Judah, and The
Middleman, could have been the author of The Deacon, had not his
name appeared prominently on the playbill, and had not a rumour
reached me that this "comedy sketch" had adorned for years, in
MS. form, a corner of some book-shelves. I think, if the rumour is
to be believed, that it is almost a pity that there was any interference
with that corner—I fancy The Deacon might have rested in peace on
the book-shelves indefinitely, without causing serious injury to
anyone. But this is a fancy, and only a fancy.
I may add that Mr. Willard made the most of the matenalj
provided for him; but whether that most was much or little is, and
must remain, a matter of conjecture. On the whole, if I had
understood aright what the sad sea waves were evidently attempting
to say to me, I think I would not have attended on the 27th of
August a London Matinie. But this is a thought, and nothing more

THE DOCTRINE OF "HINTERLAND."
These three Gentlemen do not play the Game, but wish to take a Morning Walk by thb Sea.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Baron has recently
been reading a new work,
disinterestedly recom-
mended to him by M.
Roques, the Frenoh pub-
lisher and Frenoh book-
seller of Bond Street,
entitled L'Ame de Pierre,
by Georges Ohnet. It is
a strangely fascinating
story; the picturesque de-
scriptions transport us to
the. very places; and the
studies of life, are, speci-
ally of certain phases of
French life, most interest-
ing to an English reader.
The cosmopolitan Baron
De B. W. wishes that
Frenchmen, however manly
they may be, were not so
easily and so constantly
moved to tears. This
however, is only a matter
of taste. What the pur-
pose of the novel may be
—for Georges Ohnet has
written this with a pur-
pose—is not quite evident.
Whether it is intended to chime in with the popular theme of hypno-
tism, and illustrate it in a peculiar way, or whether it is merely
illustrating Hamlet't wise remark that, There is more in heaven
and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy," the Baron is at a loss
to determine. It is psychological, it is materialistic, it is idealistic, it is
philosophical, it is . . . French. The Vacuus Viator may have a
worse companion on a long journey than L'Ame de Pierre.
Talking of materialistic, "let us," quoth the Baron, "be grateful
to Mrs. DE Salts for a bookful of 'Tempting Dishes for Small
Incomes,' published by Longmans & Co." First of all get your
small income, then purchase this book, for eighteenpenoe, or less
with discount; or (a shorter and a cheaper way) borrow it from a
friend. Let the Small Inoomer cast his watery eye over Lobster cutlets,
p. 19, and Lobster pancakes: let him reduce his small income to some-
thing still smaller in order to treat himself and family to a Rumpsteak
d la bonne bouche, a Sausage pudding, and a Tomato curry. The
sign over a Small-Income House is the picture of a Sheep's Head,
usually despised as sheepish: but go to p. 28, and have a tete-a-tete
{de mouton) with Mrs. de Salis about Sheep's head au Gratin.
Babbit batter pudding, eh P with shalot d discretion. How's
that for high? Let the Small Incomer get some dariole tins,
mushrooms, chives, rabbits, tripe, onions, oil, ducks, eggs, and with
egg kromeshies he'll dine like a millionnaire, and be able to
appreciate a real epigram of Lamb (not Charles) and Peas. Don't
let the Man with a Small Income be afraid of trying Un Fritot de
Cervelie de Veau, simply because of the name, which might do
honour to the menu of a Lucxtllus. _ "Blanch the Brains " for this
dish—delicious 1—"and fry till a nice golden colour." Beautiful!
Nice golden colour like dear Blanche's hair: only often that's
a Blanche without brains. And now your attention, my Small In-
oomer, to Eggs d la Bonne Femme. This work ought to be arranged
as a catechism: in fact all cookery books, all receipt books, should
be in the form of Question and Answer.
Question.—Now, Sir, how would you do Eggs d la Bonne Femme t
Perhaps this query might be preoeded by general information as
to who the particular "bonne femme" (for she must have been a
very particular bonne femme) was to whom so many dishes are
dedicated. [In the Scotch McCookery books, Broth o' the Oude-xeife
would be a national name.]
Answer.—To make Eggs d la Bonne Femme, Mrs. de Salis says,
"Get as many eggs as there are guests (they should all be the same
size) "Now this is a difficulty. It is not an easy matter to
assemble round your table a party of guests " all the same size:"
still more difficult is it to get together a lot of eggs all the same size
as the guests. But, when this has been got over, read the remainder
at p. 55, and then, as Squeers's pupils used to have to do, go and
reduce the teaching to practice.
The receipt for Potatoes d la Lyonnaise begins with, "Mince an
onion, and fry it in hot butter 0 rare 1 Why do more?
Who wants potatoes after this? And, when you 've had quite enough
of it, smoke a pipe, drink a glass of whiskey-and-water, go to an
evening party, and then, if you won't be one of the most remark-
able advertisements for celte bonne femme Madame de Salis, why
I don't live in Baronion Halls, and my name's no longer
The Baron de Book-Works.
P.S.—So many persons have sent in touching requests to the Baron
only to notice their books with one little word, that his library table
frroans under their weight. To about a hundred of them that one
ittle word might be "Bosh! "—but even then they'd be pleased.
THE NEW STOCKING.
[The Chancellor of the Excheqvir has announced that the Treasury
hare decided to enable the small investor in Con ml a, upon a written request
to the Bank of England, to have his dividends re-invested as they arise, and
thus automatically accumulated without further trouble on his part.—Timts ]
Oh, it was the old Lady of Threadneedle Street,
And she held up her Stocking (ne'er used for her feet),
And she ups, and says she, " I've an excellent notion;
Leastways, 'tis one borrowed from Cohen by Goschkn;
Whioh nobody oan deny!
"The cash that you put in my Stocking, my dears,
Will grow by degrees, if you leave it for years.
By your dividends? Ah! you draw them, girls and boys,
And spend 'em, the Times says, in sweets and in toys;
Which nobody oan deny!
"How very much better to let 'em remain;
lie-invest 'em, in fact! An original brain
Has bit on that capital notion, at length,
And I'm game for to baok him with all my old strength,
Which nobody can deny I
"Leave your dividends in my—suppose we say hose—
And the cash, snowball-like, gathers fast as it goes.
So my—Stocking (I must use the word) will be seen,
The latest and best Automatic Machine,
Whioh nobody oan deny!
"Think, children/of Ao-ou-mu-la-tive Con-sols I
Much better than bull's eyes, and peg-tops, and dolls!
Yes, this is the notion, exceedingly know in',
Whioh Goschkn, the Chanoellor, borrows from Cohen,
Whioh nobody can deny!
"To the Nation friend Cohen's idea's a great gift:
It should lend suoh a "vigorous impulse to thrift;
Leave your coin in my Stocking—in time it will double,
Without giving you, what a Briton hates. Trouble!
Whioh nobody oan deny!
"Then think'of the saving in potions and pills,
And the fall in that very bad stock—Doctor's BiUs—
When your Dividends no longer spoil girls and boys
With per-ni-oi-ous sweets, and with re-dun-dant toys,
Which nobody oan deny!
"8o, dear Little Investors, I trust you '11 come nocking,
Like bees to the hive, to my last style of Stocking,
My new, automatic, self-mending, smart hose,
In whioh cash, left alone, gathers fast as it goes,
Which nobody oan deny I"

THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK.
Modern Nautical Version.
{By a Correspondent with Admiral Tryiton's Fleet.)
Fit the Last.—The Vanishing.
We sought it with searoh-lights, we sought it with care,
We pursued it with ships and hope;
But it seemed to have suddenly vanished in air
From under the heaven's blue oope.
We shuddered to think that the ohace might fail,
And Teton, exoited at last,
Went ramping like redskin in search of a trail,
For the ten days were nearly past.
"There is Thingumbob shouting!" the Admiral said.
"He is shouting like mad, only hark!
He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,
He has certainly found the—Snark!"
We gazed in delight, whilst a Bo'sun exclaimed—
(Your Bo'sun is always a wag!)—
"In the East there's a wision, a mirage it's named I
That the Snark t Put yer head in a bag!"
Then Admiral Teton he ramped like a lion,
In prospect of splendid success.
But the Snark, with a spasm, plunged in a sea chasm;
Of Setmoue one couldn't see less.
"It's the Snark I" was the sound that first fell on our ears;
It seemed almost too good to be true.
Then followed a torrent of laughter and jeers;
Then the words, "It is all a Yah-Boo"
Then silence. Some fancied they heard in the air
A sigh (from the lips of J. B. r)
That sounded like" jum I" But some others declare
It was more like a half-choked big D.!
We hunted ten days and ten nights, but we found
Not so much as poor oollier-barque.
By which we might tell that we steamed o'er the ground
Where Culm-Seymoub had handled the Snark!
In the depths of that two thousand square miles, they say,
'Midst the world's mooking laughter and glee,
Seymour softly and silently vanished away—
This Snark teas a Yah-Booh-Jum, you see!
"A VERY SHORT HOLIDAY."
For the benefit of all tourists in Normandy, and visitors to Le
Havre, Etretat, and all round and about
that quarter, I gave an account, two
weeks ago, of the excellent fare pro-
vided for us by La famille Aubourg at
Gonneville. But on that occasion I
made the great mistake of calling their
curionsold house—a perf eot little museum
of curiosities and works of Art—''a
hotel." By my halidom! "Hotel,"
save the mark—and spend the shilling.
"Hotel," quotha! "Hotel" is far too
modern. Old English "Inn" more like.
The kind of inn, good gossip, whioh was
kept in Shaksfeare's time by "mine
host," where everyone, with coin of the
realm in his purse, could take his ease
and be happy. So, to put me right on
this matter, M. Aubourg sends me a
truelle of burnished metal, on which is
i**-* inscribed, "Hottellerie de$ Vieux Piatt,
"Is this a dagger that I see Souvenir d'Aubourg," whioh truelle, if
before me?" not large, "yet will serve" to help fish,
No, e'est un souvenir d'Au- or pommes louffleei, or pommet Anna,
bourg, une petite truelle A and, mark ye, my masters, will also serve
pouson de l'Hostellerie dea to recall to my memory a right merrie,
Vieux Plats, Gonneville. even tho' 'twere an all too short, holiday.

Long have Advertisement's obtrusive arts
Pervaded our huge maze of malls and marts;
But now the " swinging signs " of ogre Trade,
Even the smoke-veiled vault of heaven invade,
And sprawling legends of the tasteless crew
Soar to the clouds and spread across the blue.

Rises o'er realms that dwarf Imperial Rome.

Forests of tall and spindly poles arise.
With swinging signs that almost hide the skies.
Huge letterings hang disfiguring all the blue

Long have its letterings large, its pictures vile,

Made horrors of its hoardings, and its walls
Disfigured from the Abbey to St. Paul's,

Allowed Boeotian Commerce to displace
Scant Urban Beauty from its last frail hold,
On a Metropolis given up to Gold.

If not of smoke at least of flaming lies,

IN THE KNOW.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)
I was aware that Mr. J. was a semolina-brained impostor, but I
should never have conceived that even he, the jelly-faced chief of the
•howder-heads, could have attained to such a pitch of folly as to
inform me that " the Prix Montyon is not a medal, and cannot be
worn at Court" These are his words. Did I ever say it was a
medal P I remarked that the Qctren had given me permission to
wear it at Court. That is true. But I never said that I would or
could so wear it. As for Her Most Gracious Majesty's permission, it
to me in a document beginning, "Victoria, by the
grace of," &o., and containing the signature of Lord Haxsbttbt, the
Lord Chancellor No, by the way, that is another Royal commu-
nication. The Permission begins. To our right trusty and well -

story of what took place at the meeting of the German Emprbob with

mustang) he had ridden into the heart of the hostile position, and
with one stroke of his Pen (a sort of Russian scimetar with a jewelled
hilt) he had captured a convoy containing three thousand Versts (a
sort of condensed food), intended for the consumption of the opposing
Army. Tired with his labours, he was now lying at full length
beside his Imperial host on the banks of the torrential Narva. The
Czar, in attempting to open a Champagne bottle, had just broken one
of his Imperial nails, and had despatched his chief butler to Siberia,
observing with pleasant irony, that he would no doubt find a cork-
screw there. At this moment a tall and aristocratic stranger,
mounted upon a high-spirited native Mokeoffskaia, dashed up at full
gallop. To announce himself as Lieutenant-General Popoff, to seize
the refractory bottle, to draw the cork, and pour the foaming liquid
into the Imperial glasses, was for him the work of a moment. That
stranger was I. In recognition of my promptitude, the Czar has
conferred upon me the Stewardship ot the Vistula Hundreds, with
the command of a division of the Yeomanoff Cavalry, the most
distinguished horse-soldiers in Europe.
The German Empebob was equally impressed. His Majesty smiled,
and, turning to General Capbtvi, told him to consider himself hence-
forth under my orders for everything that concerned the peace of the
world. I could see that Caprivi did not relish this, but I soon made
him know his place, and when I threatened to send for Prince
Bismarck—who, by the way, has granted me the unique honour of
an interview—he became quite calm and reasonable. On my way
home, I called in on Prince Feed in am of Bulgaria, who offered me
his Crown, telling me at the same time that he intended to take a
course of German Baths. He said I should find Stambouloff a very
pleasant fellow; "but," he added, "you've got to know him first.
I, of course, refused His Highness's offer, and accepted instead the
Cross for Valour on the.Field of Battle. I then hurried off to Servia.
King Milan informed me that, if I wished to take a Queen back
with me to England, he would dispose of one very cheaply. Having
advised the Regents as to the best method of governing the country,
I departed for Roumania. The Queen of Roumania welcomed me as
a literary man. She writes all the Roumanian sporting prophecies
in verse. The King invested me at once with the Stombroku Order
in brilliants, with the lohu Clasp for special promise shown in con-
nection with turf literature. I may assure you in confidence that
there will be no war for the next week or two. This result is entirely
due to me.
Do you want to hear about the St Leger P I need only say that my
own Surrfoot has brought me Alloway Heaume. Whilst in Russia I
heard about plenty ot Serft, but they were not saints. Anybody
who proposes to wear a Blue-green waistcoat on the Queen't Birthday
ought to eat Sainfoin for the rest of his life, and be taken Right

Messrs. Bisson and Bubnand; Gilbert IBeckett assisting in

Dbubiolano Impfratore, wouldn't
wait for the production of an Opera
in Paris in order to bring it out here
with the French cachet, but deter-
mined to have one done all for
themselves, and to bring it out here
first. So the French author began
it, the English one finished it, and
the Composer wrote _ music for
original French and original Eng-
lish words. It is an international
Opera; a new departure, and in
the Operatic world an important
one. It answers a question which
was once the question of the day,
"Why should London wait?"
London, represented by Sheriff
Dbubiolant/s, did not wait, and
was served immediately with Cap-
tain Thtrese, produced Monday the
25th, at the Prinoe of Wales's

don has justified the generosity of
all concerned behind the curtain,

good musio, capital acting, magnificent dresses, and perfect mise-en-

strength in dancing, and Mr.
Harry Monxhouse is genuinely
comio. Mr. Henby Ashley,

mirth, at the end of the Second

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUT FOR A HOLIDAY.
(By our Impartial and Notto-be-biassed Critic.)
I had often been told that St. Margaret's Bay, between Deal and
Dover, was lovely beyond oompare. Seen from the Channel, I had
heard it described as " magnificent," and
evidence of its charms nearer at hand,
was adduced in the fact that Mr. Alma
Tad km a, R.A., had made it his head-
quarters during a portion of the recent
summer.
So 1 determined to visit it. I had to
take a ticket to Martin's Mill, a desolate
spot, containing a railway station, a rail-
way hotel, and (strangle to say) a mill.
I was told by an obliging official on my
arrival, that St Margaret's Bay was a
mile and a half distant—"to the village."
And a mile and a half—a very good mile
and a half—it was! Up hill, down dale,
along the dustiest of dusty roads, bordered
by telegraph poles that suggested an
endless lane without a turning. On
climbing to the summit of each hill another long stretch of road pre-
sented itself. At length the village was reached, and I looked about
me for the sea. A cheerful young person who was flirting with a
middle-aged oyolist seemed surprised when I asked after it. "Oh,
the sea 1 " she exclaimed, in a tone insinuating that the ocean was at
a decided discount in her part of the world—"oh, you will find
that a mile further on." I sighed wearily, and recommenced my
plodding stumbles.
I passed two unhappy-looking stone eagles protecting a boarding-
house, and a shed given over to the sale of lollipops and the hiring
of a pony-chaise. The cottages seemed to me to be of the boat-
tarned-bottom-upwards order of architecture, and were adorned
with placards, announcing "Apartments to Let." Everything
seemed to let, except, perhaps, the churoh, which, however (on
second thoughts), appeared to be let alone. But if the houses
were not, in themselves, particularly inviting, their names were
pleasing enough, although, truth to tell, a trifle misleading. For
instance, there was a "Marine Lodge," which seemed a very con-
siderable distance from the ocean, and a "Swiss chalet" that but
faintly suggested the land renowned equally for mountains and
merry juveniles. I did not notice any shops, although I fancy, from
the appearance of a small barber's pole that I found in front of a
cottage, that the hair-dressing interest must have had a local repre-
sentative. For the rest, an air of hopefulness, if not precisely
cheerfulness, was given to the place by the presence of a Conva-
lescent Hospital. Leaving the village behind me, I came, footsore
and staggering, at length to the Bay. I was cruelly disappointed.
Below me was what appeared to be a small portion of Rosherville,
augmented with two bathing-machines, and a residence for the
Coast-guard. There was a hotel, (with a lawn-tennis ground), and
several placards, telling of land to let. The descent to the sea was
very steep, and, on the high road above it, painfully modern villas
were putting in a disfiguring appearance. On the beaoh was a
melancholy pio-nio party, engaged in a mild carouse. In the gloam-
ing was alight-ship, marking the end of the Goodwin Sands.
On a beautiful day no doubt St. Margaret's Bay would look quite
aa lovely as Oravesend, but when it rained I question whether it
would oompare favourably with Southend under similar atmospheric
circumstances. There was some shrubbery creeping up the white
hill-side that may have been considered artistic, and possibly the
great expanse of ocean (when completely free from mist) had to a
certain extent a sort of charm. As I looked towards the coast of
France I had an excellent view of a steamer, crammed with
(presumably) noisy excursionists, ooming from Margate. But when
I have said this I have nothing- more to add, save that you can
get from Martin's Mill to St. Margaret's Bay by an omnibus. By
catching this conveyance you avoid a tedious walk, which puts you
out of temper for the rest of the day.
P.8.—I missed the omnibus!
Good Young "Zummerset!"
(Champion in Cricket of the Second-class Counties.)
Eight matches played, and eight matches won I
That's what none of the First-class Counties have done.
'Tis clear that Young Zummerset knows " how to do it."
Bravo, Palairkt, Woods, Tyleb, Roe, Hewitt 1
Go on in this fashion, and soon you '11 be reokoned
Among the First-Classen, instead of the Second.
Wet wickets this season, boys, seldom a rummer set,
But they anyhow seem to have suited Young Zummerset!

THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.
(Before Mr. Commissioner Tunch.)
A Medical Officer (with martial manner, and well tel up) introduced.
The Commissioner. Well, Sir—may I call you Colonel ?—what can
I do for you?
Medical Officer (smiling). I am afraid, Sir, you may give me no
military rank, as it would be contrary
to the Regulations.
The Com. Have I not. the pleasure of
addressing a soldier?
Med. Off. Well, yes, Sir, I suppose
I may claim that title. I am an Army
Surgeon, and in that capacity have not
only to risk my life equally with my
comrades in the field, but have to-
brave the additional danger insepar-
able from the fever-wards of a hospital.
As a matter of fact many of my col-
leagues have earned the V.C., and not
a tew taken command when their aid
was needed. I hope you have not for-
gotten Anthony Home Wuje and
Mackinnon.
The Com. Certainly not — they are
gallant fellows. Well, I am sorry to see you here, Doctor—what can
I do for you?
Med. Off. I would ask your good services, Sir, to get us greater
recognition in the Army. Pray understand we do not wish to be oalled
Captain, Major, or Colonel, merely to "peacock" before civilians,
but because, without official recognition of our true status, we are
treated as inferior beings by the youngest subaltern in any battalion
to whioh we may be attached.
The Com. Surely, Doctor, the title you have secured by scientific
attainments, takes precedence of all others more easily obtained f
Med. Off. Possibly, in a College common-room, but not at a mess-
table of a depot centre. That I express the general opinion of
members of my profession is proved by the fact that it is shared by
Sir Andrew Clark, the President of the Royal College of Physioians.
The Com. Well, what would you propose P
Med. Off. That we shonld be put on the same footing so far as
rank is ooncerned, with officers in the Commissariat and other non-
actively-combatant branohes of the Army. We are merely fighting
the fight fought years ago by another scientific corps, tile Royal
Engineers.
The Com. But surely, Dootor, the officers you have mentioned
know something of their drill P
Med. Off. If that is the difficulty, let us make ourselves equally
proficient. The more we are in touch with the so-called combatant
officers the better.
The Com. Well, certainly, if you are good drills (and have some
knowledge of the internal economy of a regiment, and the rudiments
of military law) I cannot see why you should not enjoy the rank to
which you aspire. I wish you every suooess in your application.
After all, you are masters of the situation. If your superior officers
are unreasonable—physio them!
[The Witness after returning thanks, then withdrew.

HAPPY THOUGHT. DAVID COX REDIViVUS!
ALL THE YEAR ROUND;
Or, Keeping Up the Ball.
When September soaks the fields,
And the leaves begin to fall,
Cricket unto Football yields,—
That is all!
Yes—in hot or humid weather,
At all seasons of the year,
Life is little without leather
In a sphere.
In the scrimmage, at the stumps,
'Neath the goal, behind the sticks,
Life's a ball, which Summer thumps,
Winter kicks.
From Naustcaa—classic girl!
Unto Renshaw, Gunn, and Grace,
Balls mankind must kick or hurl,
"Slog" or "place.'*
Oar "terrestrial ball" is round,
(Is it an idea chimerical':)
Man, by hidden instincts bound,
Loves the spherical.
In rotund, elastic bounders,
Plainly the great joy of men is,
Witness cricket, billiards, rounders,
And lawn-tennis.
Now the championship is fixed,
Now the averages are settled,
Spite of critics rather mixed,
Slightly nettled.
Now the heroes of the Goal
Brace themselves for kick and scrum-
mage,
Verily, upon the whole,
'lis a "rum" age!
Wane the joys of Love, Art, Faction,
Parties rise and Parties fall,
The world's sure centre of attraction
Is a Ball!
WARE SNAKE!
Sats Professor Alfred Marshall, of Cam-
bridge, the great English Economist, in his
luminous Address at the British Association
meeting:—
"Every year economic problem! become more
difficult, every year it is more manifest that we need
to hare more knowledge and to get it Boon, in order
to eacape, on the one hand, from the cruelty and
waste of irresponsible competition and the licentious
use of wealth, and, on the other, from the tyranny
and the spiritual death of an iron-bound Socialism."
Here be judicial truths, skilfully Mar-
shalled into clear order, which may profitably
be noted by the angry sciolistic skirmishers
on one side and the other in the great Social
War now raging.
The sniffing Laissez-faire man, the high
and dry Economist, shrieks at the enthusiastic
humanitarian Socialist, whom he would fain
send to Antioyra,—or farther; the headlong
humanitarian Socialist howls at the high and
dry Economist, whom he would like to de-
spatch finally to Saturn, or "haply to some
lower level," as Bob Lowe's epitaph had it.
The result is cantankerous charivari!
Marshall does more and better. He em-
phasises "the cruelty and waste of irrespon-
sible competition," he admits "the licentious
use of weath," but he also recognises "the
tyranny and the spiritual death of an iron-
bound Socialism," that violent and venomous
form of Socialism, whioh Mr. Punch this week
has represented under the apt symbol of acling-
ing, hampering, and suffocating Serpent.
Let the impetuous zealots who may probably
demur to Mr. Punch's symbol—misunder-
standing it—ponder Professor Marshall's
words, and be not precipitate in judgment.
There is Socialism and Socialism. The sort
pictured by Professor Marshall, and Mr.
Punch, is, like the Serpent of Old Myth, not
the would-be friend of labour-oursed man-
kind, but a deceiving and glosingly deadly
"incarnation of the Enemy."
THE STRAIGHT TIP.
[" There is one national duty in this connection,
and only one, that is worth insisting upon for a
moment. That duty is to render it impossible for
any enemy or combination of enemies to interrupt
our supply of food or whatever else is necessarv for
our well-being."—The "Times" on Sir George
Tryon's Scheme for National Insurance of Ship-
ping in Time of war.]
RroHT, "Thunderer/' and tersely put I
Hammer this into Bull's big noddle,
Until he just puts down his foot
On temporising timid twaddle,
And you will do a vast deal more
To keep our drowsy British Lion
In health, and strength and wakeful roar
Than all the schemes Tryon may try on.
Battle's not always to the strong;
The raoe, though,muBt be to—the Fleet,
With us at least. We oan't go wrong
In making safety there complete.
And by St. George we oan't go right
On any other tack whatever,
Until that Fleet is fit to fight
With all our foes though strong and olever.
Insurance may be all serene,
But the insurance John must measure
Is safety on all roads marine
For him, his men, his food, his treasure.
And if our ships don't give us this
On Neptune s high-road wild and wavy,
John Bull his chief straight tip will miss,
And likewise soon may miss—his Navy!

PROFESSOR MARSH'S PRIMEVAL TROUPE.
HE SHOWS HIS PeBFEOT MASTKBY OVER THE CeRATOFSIDjB.
{See Proceedings of (he British Association at Leeds.)
CUPID AND MINERVA.
[Fragment /rem an Autobiography that it is hoped will never be written.)
I was most anxious that my past should be concealed from him, as I felt that
onoe revealed, it would come between as as a barrier for ever! So I dissembled.
I adapted my conversation to his capabilities. I learned to talk of lawn tennis,
cricket, politics, even oookery. Only on one occasion did I betray myself. With
selt'-abasement I was asking for an explanation of the electric telegraph. He
gave me a somewhat faulty definition.
"Dearmel" I cried. "Howdidthey ever come to think of suohaeleverthing?''
"Omne ignotum pro magnifico," he replied, with condescension.
I could not bear the false quantity even from his lips, and I asked, "Would
not ignotum be better, darling?"
I oould have bitten out my tongue for such an indiscretion. He looked at
me sharply, with a glanoe of oovert distrust.
"What do you know about it P " he asked, somewhat brusquely.
"Nothing, nothing!" I said, confusedly. "I happened to be looking through
an Explanatory Pronouncing Dictionary of Latin Quotations, and found the
passage."
"Beware of consulting text-books," he returned, sententiously. "A little
knowledge is a dangerous thing."
For the moment I was safe, but I knew that the confidence that hitherto
had existed between us was shaken and lessened. When he left me that day,
he referred once more to the incident.
"Forgive me, Scholastic*, I know I have been disagreeable. But I confess
I am upset—the faot is a man doesn't care to be picked up sharp in his Latin."
"Forgive me!" I pleaded, "and you will love me P"
"Ad f'mtm !" he returned, making the first vowel short. I set my teeth
and was silent. He looked at me with a keen glanoe, as if he would read my
will stand
a burst
"IN THE AIR!"
A Parable for the Period.
At length the day arrived for our marriage. Just as I was starting for the
Church a letter was handed to me. I recognised in the shaky superscription
(which seemed to tremble in every stroke) his handwriting. The envelope con-
tained a printed paper 1 It was the Oxford Class List 1 Then the truth in all its
hideousness dawned upon me. He knew at last that I had taken a Double First!
• •••••••
This occurred many yean ago. Well, time has brought its compensating
comforts, and I am at least able to exclaim, " Quum multa injutta ac prava
fiunt moribus !" without being guilty of using a false quantity 1
"A coarse precipitous, of dizsy I,
Suspending thought and breath; a monstrous sight!
For in the air do I behold indeed
An Eagle and a Serpent wreathed in fight."
Skbllbt's Revolt of Islam.
A monstrous sight! Through Seellet's vision rare
Of high Revolt one mighty image glows,
This pregnant symbol of the struggling pair,
So strangely matched, and wildly-warring foes,
Filling the startled air with Titan throes.
Interpret as you will that Winged Form,
High-soaring, keen-eyed, of imperial pose,
Or that close-clinging, coiled Colossal Worm;
'Tis an eternal type of strife amidst the storm.
The symbol speaks, though variously applied.
Of snaking sleight that soaring strength assails,
And strives to drag it from its place of pride,
And, after cruel conflict, faints and fails.
Sometimes it seems the air's strong monaroh vails
His crest awhile, as, hampering coil on coil,
Insidious knot on pinion proud prevails;
Yet towering greatness crawling hate shall foil,
Nor shall the Bird of Jove be long the Python's spoil.
Strong-winged this Eagle, either waiter ready
To buoy and to upbear that body great.
Potent of beak and claw, of eye-glance steady,
Lord of the air, and master of its fate,
It seems, it seems, sailing in splendid state
Athwart the stretches of the skyey blue.
Yet what might be the fleet-winged wanderer's fate.
Did either pinion fail P Its flight is true
Only when level buoyed upon the plumy two.
"A shaft of light upon its wings descended.
And every golden feather gleamed therein."
Ay! and their fate's inextricably blended;
Let either faint or flag, they shall not win
Athwart the aerial azure clear and thin.
Brothered in use are they, in use and need.
See how the Serpent's many-coloured skin
_ Writhes hither, thither, with insidious heed,
Striving to maim one pinion. Shall the pest succeed P
Bred far below, in dank malarious slime,
That Serpent hath no power to soar in air,
Save clinging to winged creatures that can climb
The empyrean; vet from its foul lair
It sprang to the broad wings it would ensnare,
Enooil, enshaokle, hamper, break, drag down.
How swept the Bird so low that it should dare,
That Worm, to wriggle midst its plumes full grown.
And with the Air's sole monaroh thus dispute the crown P
Alas! the Eagle stooped; those well-poised pinions
Faltered, and beat the air unevenly;
Nor shall the Bird maintain its proud dominion!
If those wings lapse from rhythm, pulse awry.
Vain power of beak and claw, keenness of eye,
Or pride of crested head, if those broad vanes
Beat without balance true the olouded sky.
The lord of those etherial domains,
Once wing-maimed, pitiless fate to the dull earth enchains.
That Serpent is a sinister birth of time,
The likeness of the light 'twould fain take on,
But 'tis engendered from the poisonous slime
Of hate, and greed, and darkness. Though it don
Apollo's guise, 'tis but Apollyon.
To shackle, poison, palsy is its aim.
Venom and violence never yet have won
A viotory truly worthy of the name.
To call this thing Toil's friend is friendship to defame.
"An Eagle and a Serpent wreathed in fight! ",
There is the symbol he who runs may read.
The Bird is Trade, with pinions balanced right;
Labour and Capital in love agreed,
All's well; the Serpent shall not then succeed
In shackling that, or in destroying this.
The snake, a venomous worm of poisonous breed,
In vain shall coil and knot, shall strike and hiss.
Mark, Wealth I mark, Toil! The moral's one you soaro
can miss I A

A WORD TO JOHN BUENS.
[" He was in the unfortunate position of haying probably to go to Parlia-
ment at the next election, but he would rather go to prison half-a-dozen
times than to Parliament once, because Labour candidates in the past had
either been thrown out or tied to the coat-tail of party politics. He wished
it to be distinctly understood that there must be nothing of this, but their
candidates must go forth as labour candidates, and labour candidates only.
He must know on what terms he must do the dirty work of going to Parlia-
ment."—Mr. John Burns at the Trade Union Congrsss at Liverpool.]
Good gracious, how awful I The Trades were assembled,
And they all yelled together, and tempers got brittle;
And when Brans rose and thundered, all Liverpool trembled
(Though Brass is perhaps Boanerges spelt little).
And he laid all about him, like mules who can kick hard,
But kick without aim for the pleasure of kicking;
And he trod upon Fkswicx. and trampled on Pickard,
And his friends shouted, Death to political tricking 1"
And on one side we heard all the Socialist gang wage
A war against Bhoauhcrst, who carried a hod once.
And Broad hurst retorted on Brass and his language,
That Brans might go back, since he languished in "quod" once.
And Burns ranted back; as the French say, the mustard
Had gone to his nose, which was rather unfortunate.
"St. Stephen's requires me, and I," so he blustered,
"Must needs be a Member, since friends are importunate.
"But I'd rather," he added, "go six times to Holloway"
aill not language like this of J. B. make The Star lament ?)
in go (which is dirt) to St Stephen's, or loll away
My time and the People's as Member of Parliament."
Now, Brass, be advised; that is bunkum—you know it.
Ton " must be a Member" f Pooh, pooh, Johs, I doubt you.
Short answers are best, so Punch answers you, "Stow it.
Stay away, and we '11 try for salvation without you."
There 'a no " must" in the matter. The goose, Johs, who flaps his
Vain wings, though at first very fearful he may be,
If you face him at once, why, he promptly collapses;
He may hiss as he runs, he won t frighten a baby.
Be warned in good time—why there isn't a man, Sir,
Or at most one or two, whom the universe misses.
You strut for a moment, and then, like poor Anser,
You vanish, uncared-for, with splutter and hisses.
If a man cares to toil, if, like Broad hurst or Burt, he
Puts his neck to the yoke for the good of his fellows,
He will find work to do (though you scorn it as dirty),
Without all this labour of trumpet and bellows.
Surely butter must oloy, though your friends do the churning—

HOMO SAPIENS.
(A Question for the next Anthropological Assembly.)
[" When we consider the vast amount of time comprised in
the Tertiary period . .. the chances that man as at present
constituted, should be a survivor from that period seem remote,
and against the species Homo Sapient having existed in Miocene
times almost incalculable."—Address of the President of the
Anthropological Section, Dr. John Evans, at the Leeds Meeting
of the trxtxsh Association.,]
When then did Homo Sapiens first appear P
Upon whose speculations shall we bottom us F
Contemporary he with the cave bear,
But hardly with the earliest hippopotamus.
The happy Eocene beheld him not;
That cheerful epoch when a morning ramble
Among the mammoths, without gun or shot,
Must have been such a truly sportive scramble.
The pleasant Pliocene preceded htm,
Apparently, poor bare, belated Homo;
His spectre seems to haunt, despondent, dim,
Lakes—how unlike Killarney, Wenham, Como!—
Where dens called Dwellings may have left some trac \
Before " quarternary times "—whatever they were—
Homo appears not to have shown his face.
And then its features far from gracefully gay were.
So Evans, who the mystery of Man's birth
Into our Cosmos carefully unravels.
He seems to view with sceptical calm mirth.
Remains of Man among the river gravels.
Well, we '11 relinquish Tertiary man,
Without immoderate grief, or lasting anguish.
The Pliocene, if we can grasp its plan,
Would seem an epoch when our race would languish.
The skeletons, out animal bones, and flints,
Supposed to prove his presence, let's abandon;
But on some subjects we should like some hints;
When did he come, and what has Sapient Man done
To justify his advent P Take him now,
Apart from retrospection prehistoric,
What is the being of the lifted brow
Doing at present P Strange phantasmagoric
Pictures of his proceedings flit before
The vision of alert imagination;
Playing the brute, buffoon, "bounder," or bore,
In every climate, and in every nation!
Hnmo —here wasting half his hard-earned gains
Upon Leviathan Fleets and Mammoth Armies,
Spending his boasted gifts of Tongue and Brains
In Party spouting. Swearing potent charm is
In grubbing muck-rake Money on the Mart,
Or squandering it on Turf, or Gambling Table.
Squabbling o'er the Morality of Art,
Or fighting o'er the Genesis of Fable.
You '11 find him—as a Frank—in comic rage,
Mouthing mad rant, fighting preposterous duels,
Scattering ordures o'er Romance's page, [jewels.
And decking a swine's snout with Style's choioe
You '11 Bee him—as a Teuton—trebly taxed,
Mooning 'midst metaphysical supposes;
Twirling a huge moustache, superbly waxed.
And taking pride in slitting comrades' noses.
You'll meet him—as a Muscovite—dead set
On making civic life a sombre Hades,
Shaking a knife with tyrant's blood red-wet,
Or—aping " Paris-goods" in art, dress, ladies.
You '11 spy nim—as a Yankee—gassing loud
About his pride, and yet chin-deep in snobbery;
Leaving State matters to corruption 'a crowd,
And justifying (literary) robbery.
Whilst as a Briton! Bless us, 'twould take time
To picture Homo in his guise Britannic
Here he is making a fine art of crime,
There he is fussing in a Pari tan panic;
Here with McMucx ne plays the prurien* spy,
And there with Oscar in a paroxysm
Of puerile paradox spreads to Cultohaw's eye
The fopperies of " Artistio Hedonism"!
Oh, Evans, noting Man (not Tertiary)
In Church or State, the Studio or the Tavern,
One wonders—not was he contemporary
With Danish Kjokkenmoddings or Kent's Cavern,—
No. thinking of his work with Swords, Tongues, Pens,
Of most ot which Wisdom would make a clearance,
One wonders whether Homo Sapiens
Has really truly yet made his appearance I

COLLAPSE OF CORNER MEN."
{As understood by Our Christy Minstrel Artist in Black and White.)
[Mr. — was a prominent operator on the Market, in connection with an attempted great " Cotton Corner." .
The Corner ended in a collapse.]
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
In consequence of the taking in or taking ont of Nobodies' luggage,
the train had been considerably delayed, and this delay had been
protracted by the thirsty condition of the panting ana enfeebled
engine. Stopping to water the horses in the olden days took much
leas time, I should imagine, than stopping to supply the engine
with water in our own day. Be this as it may, the stoppages had
already been considerable, and the Baron was ruminating on the
beat method of passing his valuable time for the next two hours,
when it occurred to him that in his bag he had been carrying about
for some time past three books, in the hope that there might occur
gome opportunity, of which the Baron could avail himself, to peruse
these works, and remark upon them for the benefit of the select
reading public. He took up the first, read a few sketches of Our
Churchwardens, but failing to appreciate the subject, returned it to
the bag, and went in for Monsignor. Perhaps the weak state [of
health in which our engine found itself, had not been improved by
the additional weight imposed on it, owing to haying to carry Mon-
stgnor. "Uncommonly heavy," said the Baron, when he arrived
at the hundredth page; "I will keep it in reserve for my lighter
and gayer moments, when timely repression may be necessary."
So saying, he restored this to the same receptacle, and made another
dip in the lnoky bag. This time he brought to the surface The Case
of George Candlemas, by George Sims. Very nearly giving it up
was the Baron, on account of its title, so suggestive of the usual vein
of shilling shockers, and very glad is he that he did not do so, as
for the next hour and a quarter not only was the Baron really
interested, but highly amused, and it would have done the heart of
Gxobge Sims, of Horrible London and other emotional tales, good to
have seen the Baron chuckling over this capital short story, which
is as ingenious as it is genuinely droll. It belongs to the same genus
as the Danvers Jewels, though, in this latter, the idea of the character
of the narrator is more humorously conceived than is Mr. Sims's
Bixonet who acts as an amateur detective. The Baron highly
recommends this story, as he also does a short tale in Blackwood, for
this month, entitled, A Physiologist's Wife, by A. Conan Doyle.
The Baron's attention has been turned to five little volumes of
Lore Tales, English, Irish, Scotch, American, and German. They
form a companion set to Weird Tales, published also by Paikbson
& Co., and a pooketable size, most useful for travellers.
A propos of Travellers, why does not some English firm bring out
a aeries of Guide-books, of the size, and written in the style of the
Guides Conty, which, for travelling in France, are far ana away the
beat Guide-books I know. The Guides Joanne are of course good,
steady, trustworthy Guides, but they don't attract the traveller's
attention to out-of-the-way places, and to the " things to do," in the
same pleasant way as do the writers in the Guides Conty. Where
to go, when to go, how to go, how to make the most of a short visit,
what to ask for, what to look for, what to take, and what to avoid,
these are details for which the Guides Conty go in. They might be
better, perhaps, in the way of maps, but this is a fault of all Guides.
Wishing, when at Havre, to visit Merville-sur-
brated Corneville, with whose cloches we are all acquainted, in vain
-Mer, and the cele-
I searched the ordinary maps, and at last found quite a microscopi-
cal place, and without the Sur Mer," as there wasn't room for it in
a map of either the Guide Joanne or Conty, I forget which. Why
it seems to be generally ignored I don't know, but in this respect it
is a fellow-sufferer with Westgate-on-Sea, whose name is on no
sign-post that ever I've seen in the Island of Thanet, though it may
by this time figure on some recent maps. The village of " Garlinge,
which is on the inland side of the L. C. & D. line, is to be found on
every direotion-post and on .every map, and the fashionable West-
gate is, so to speak, nowhere. Baron de Book-Worms.
P.8.—Just attempted to read Rudyard Kipling's On Greenhow
Hill, in this month's Mac mill cm. No doubt very clever, and will be
greatly admired by Kiplingites, but, for me, time is too valuable
and life too short to study and appreciate it. I can't even read it:
dommage, but I can't.
In this month's number of The Cabinet Portrait Gallery (Cassell
& Co.) there is one of the best photographs of John Morlxy I ever
remember to have seen. Not easy to take: this one is by Downey.
No mistaking a photo by Downey, and this one of John Morley,
the Nineteenth Century Sr. Just, has a thoroughly downy look
about the face. Those of Lady Dudley and Sir Frederick Leighton
are not up to the Downey standard, Bpeoially Lady Dudley's.
In the Fortnightly Mr. Frank Harris nas induced Mr. W. S.
Lilly to give us some personal reminiscences of Cardinal Newman,
together with some letters of the Cardinal's to him. Interesting, but too
brief. Oddly enough, d propos of "Reminiscences," there is in this
same Number a very amusing article by J. M. Barbie on the manu-
facturing of reminiscences. Very droll idea, "Bead it," says the
Baron.
In the Contemporary Mr. Wilfrid Mktnell gives an interesting
Memoir of the great Cardinal and his contemporaries, and Mr. Bun-
tabd Kipling writes a tale entitled The Enlightenment of Mr.
Padgett, M. P.—of whioh more when 1 've read it. • • * I have read
it. It isn't a story, so I was disappointed, and about as interesting
to a story-seeker as The National Congress, of whioh it treats, _ to
the majority of the Indian natives. But the dialogue is instructive
and amusing, and will enlighten many Padgetts. j; DE b.-W.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUT FOR ANOTHER HOLIDAY.
(By our Impartial and Not to-be-biassed Critic.)
I had been told that Ostend was an excellent place. "Quite
a Town of Palaces 1" was the enthusiastic description that had
reached me. 8o I determined to leave " Delicious Dover" (as the
holiday Leader-writer in the daily papers would call it), and take
boat for the Belgian coast.
The sea was as calm as a
lake, and the sun lazily
touched up the noses of
those who slumbered on the
beach. There is an excel-
lent service of steamers
between England and
Belgium. This service has
but one drawback—a slight
one: the vessels have a way
with them of perpetrating
practical jokes. Only a
week or so ago one lively
mail-carrier started prema-
turely, smashing a gangway, and dropping a portmanteau quietly
into the ocean. On my return from foreign shores, I passed the same
cheerful ship lying in mid-channel as helpless as an infant. How-
ever, the accident (something, I fancy, had gone wrong with the
engines) appeared to be treated as more amusing than important.
Still, perhaps, it would be better were the name of this luckless boat
changed to Le Farceur; then travellers would know what to expeot.
But I must confess that my experiences were perfeotly pleasant.
The steamer in which I journeyed crossed the Channel in the advertised
time, and if I wished to be hypercritioal. 1 would merely hint that
the official tariff of the refreshments sold on board is tantalising.
When I wanted cutlets, I was told they were "off," and when I
asked for "oold roBbif," that was "off" too. The garcon
(who looked more like a midshipman than a cabin-boy) took ten
minutes to discover this fact. And as I had to rely upon him for
information, I had to wait even longer before the desired (or rather
undeaired) intelligence was conveyed to me. I pride myself upon
oaring nothing about food, but this failure to obtain my heart's (or
thereabouts') yearning caused me sore annoyance.
Well, I reached Ostend. The town of palaces contained a Eursaal
and a Casino. There were also a number of large hotels of the
Sing's Road, Brighton, plus Northumberland Avenue type. Further,
there were several maisons mexMies let out in flats, and (to judge from
the prices demanded and obtained for them) to flats. The suite of
apartments on the ground floor consisted of a small bed-room, a tiny
drawing-room, and a balcony. The balcony was used as a suite d
manger in fine weather, and a place for the utterance of strong
expressions (so I was informed) when the rain interfered with at
fresco comfort. There was a steam tramway, and some bathing-
machines of the springless throw-you-down-when-you-least-ex-
pect-it sort. The streets, omitting the walk in front of the sea,
were narrow, and the shops about as interesting as those at the
poorer end of the Tottenham Court Road. But these were merely
details, the pride of Ostend being the Eursaal, which reminded me
of an engine-house near a London terminus. I purchased a ticket
for the Eursaal and the Casino. There was to be a concert at the
first and a ball at the last. I soon had enough of the concert, and
started for the ball.
It was then that I found a regulation in force that made my
cheeks tingle with indignation as an Englishman. Although the
tickets costing three francs a piece, were said to secure admittance
to the Eursaal and the Casino, I noticed that children—good and
amiable children—were not allowed to enter the latter place. I
could understand the feelings of a gentleman who attempted to
obtain access for his eldest lad—a gallant boy of tome fourteen
summers, and a baker's dozen of winters. My heart went out to
that British Father as he disputed with the Commissaires at the
doorway, and called the attention of the Representative of "the
Control" to the fact that his billet was misleading. "You are an
Englishman," said the Representative of the Control, "and the
English observe the law." "Yes," returned the angry Father;
"but in England the Law would support one in obtaining that for
which one had paid. My son has paid for admission to the Eursaal
and the Casino! He is refused admittance to the Casino, therefore
this tioket of his spreads false intelligence! It is a liar I It is a
miserable 1 It should be called the traitor tioket I" But all was
useless. The gallant lad had to remain with the umbrellas! I
could not help sympathising with that father. I could not refrain
from agreeing with him, that where such a thing was possible,
something must be entirely wrong. I could not deny that under
the circumstances Ostend was a sham, a delusion, and a snare!
When he observed that Ostend was grotesquely expensive, I
admitted that he was right. When he said that it was not a patch
vol. zcrxi

upon Boulogne or Dieppe, I again acquiesced. When he asserted
that every English tourist would be wise to avoid the plaoe, I
acknowledged that there was the genuine ring of truth in his
declaration. When he appealed to me, as a dispassionate observer,
to say whether I did not consider the conduct of the authorities
arbitrary, unjust, and absurd, I was forced to admit that I did con-
sider that conduct absolutely indefensible. Lastly, when he
announced that he intended never to say another word in praise of
Ostend, I confessed that I had come in my own mind to the same
determination.
P. 8.—I may add that I was accompanied by my son, who was also
refused admittance. But this is a matter of purely personal interest,
and has nothing whatever to do with it.
THE CACHET OF CASH AT DRURY LANE.
A Million of Money, "a new military, sporting, and spectaoular
Drama," is a marvel of stage management. No better things than
the tableaux of the Derby Day, the grounds of the Welcome Club,
and the departure of the Guards from Wellington Barracks for
foreign parts /-"r\
have been
seen for many
a long year.
In such a piece
the dialogue
is a matter of
s econdary
consideration,
and even the
story is of no
great import-
ance. That the
plot should Medal found in the Neighbourhood of Drury Lane,
remind one of Drury Lane successes in the past is not surprising,
considering that one of the authors (who modestly places bis name
second on the programme, when everyone feels that it should come
first) has been invariably associated with those triumphs of scenic art.
Augustus Druriolancs has beaten his own record, and the Million
of Money so lavishly displayed behind the scenes, is likely to be
rivaled by the takings in front of the Curtain—or to be more exact,
at the Box-office. The Authors, in more senses than one, have
carried money into the house. But they have done more—they
have inculcated a healthy moral. While Mr. Henry Arthur
Jones is teaching audiences a lessen in Judah, that would have
received the enthusiastic approval of the philanthropic Earl of
Shaftesbury, after whom Shaftesbury Theatre is, no doubt, oalled,
the great Harris and the lesser Pettit are showing us in the
character of the Rev. Gabriel Maythorne, a Parson that would
as certainly have secured the like hearty good-will at the same
shadowy hands. The Rev. Gentleman is a clergyman that extorts
the admiration of everyone whose good opinion is worth securing.
He apparently is a "coach," and (seemingly) allows his pupils so
much latitude that one of them, Harry Dunstable (Mr. Warner),
is able to run up to town with his (the Reverend's) daughter seoretly,
marry her, and stay in London for an indefinite period. And he
(the Parson) has no absurd prejudices—no narrow-mindedness. He
goes to the Derby, where he appears to be extremely popular at
luncheon-time amongst the fair ladies who patronise the tops of
the drags, and later on becomes quite at home at au illuminated
fete at the Exhibition, amidst the moonlight, and a thousand
additional lamps. It is felt that the Derby is run with this good
man's blessing: and everyone is glad, for, without it, in spite of
the horses, jockeys, carriages, acrobats, gipsies, niggers, grooms,
stable-helps, and pleasure-seekers, the tableau would he eesthetioally
incomplete. And the daughter of the Reverend is quite as interest-
ing as her large-hearted sire. She, too, has no prejudices (as instance,
the little matrimonial trip to London); and when she has to part with
her husband, on his departure (presumably en route to the Bermudas),
she requires the vigorous assistance of a large detachment of Her
Majesty's Guards to support her in her bereavement. Of the actors,
Mr. Charles Glennet, as a broken-down gentleman, is certainly
the hero of the three hours and a half. In Act III., on the night of
the first performance, he brought down the house, and received two
calls before the footlights after the Curtain had descended. He has
many worthy colleagues, for instance, Mr. Harry Nicholls, Miss
Mulwabd, Mr. Charles Warner, and Miss Fanny Brough, are
all that could be desired in their respective lines. _ But, well oast
as it undoubtedly is, the play has vitality within it that does not
depend for existence upon the efforts of the company. It is good all
round—soenery. dresses, properties, and effects—and will keep its

"WANTED!"
WANTED, by a well-travelled lady, of {esthetic and refined
tastes, a comfortable and congenial home with a Duchess.
The Advertiser, who is a person of much intelligence, and a most
agreeable gossip, regards her pleasant companionship as an equi-
valent for the social advantages (including carriage-drives, and an
introduction to the very best society), for which she is prepared to
offer the very handsome remuneration of ten shillings a week.
TTOR8E WANTED.-Must have been placed in a recent Derby.
XI and show a good racing record. Thoroughly sound in wind
and limb, expected to be equal to carrying 13 stone in the Park,
or to doing any work from a four-in-hand down to single harness in
a hearse. On the advertiser being furnished with a suitable beast,
he will be prepared to put down a five-pound note for him, payable
by ten-shilling monthly instalments.
TTOME REQUIRED FOR AN INDIAN CHIEF—The Adver-
JT1 tiser, who has recently received a consignment of Savages
from Patagonia, and has had to entertain their Monarch in his
residence at Bayswater, as he is about to pay a four weeks' visit to
the Continent, is anxious in the meantime to find a suitable home
for him in some quiet suburban family, who would not object to some
fresh and lively experience introduced into the routine of their
domestic circle, in consideration for a small payment to defray the
alight extra cost involved in his support. He will give little trouble,
an empty attic furnished with a hearth-rug supplying him with all
the accommodation he will require, while his food has hitherto con-
sisted of tripe, shovelled to him on a pitchfork, and stout mixed with
inferior rum, of which he gets through about a horse-pailful a-day.
His chief recreation being a "Demon's War Dance, in which he
will, if one be handy, hack a olothes-horse to pieces with his " baloo,"
or two-edged chopper-axe, he might be found an agreeable inmate by
an aged and invalid couple, who would relish a little unusual after-
dinner excitement, as a means of passing away a quiet evening or
two. Applicants anxious to secure the Chief should write at once.
Three-ana-sixpence a-week will be paid for his keep, which,
supplying the place of the rum in his drink (which has been tried
with effect) with methylated spirit mixed with treacle, affords an
ample margin for a handsome profit on the undertaking.
DEVELOPMENT.

I" Even a colour-sense is more important in the development of the indi-
vidual than a sense of rig tit and wrong."—Oscae Wilde.]
If you're anxious to develop to a true hedonio "swell," hop on a

prattle about Art.
Take some laboured paradoxes, and, like Samson's flaming foxes, let
them loose amidst the corn

regard with lofty scorn.
And every one will say,

What a very singularly smart young man this smart young man
must be!" •

If you aim to be a Shocker, carnal theories to cocker is the best way
to begin.
And every one will say.
As you worm your wicked way,
"If that's allowable for Aim which were criminal in me,
What a very emancipated kind of youth this kind of youth
must be."
Human virtues you'll abhor all, and be down upon the Moral in
uncompromising style.
Your critical analysis will reduce to prompt paralysis every motor
that's not vile.
You will show there's naught save virtue that can seriously hurt you,
or your liberty enmesh;
And vou'll find excitement, plenty, in Art's dolctfar niente, with a
flavour of the flesh.

Then having swamped morality in " intensified personality" (which,
of course, must mean your own),
And the "rational" abolished and "sincerity " demolished, you will
find that you have grown
With a " colour-sense" fresh handselled (whilst the moral ditto's
cancelled) you '11 develop into—well,

And every one will say,
As you writhe your sinuous way,

why see
What a very perfectly developed young man this developed young
man must be."
With your perky paradoxes, and your talk of "crinkled ox-eyes,"
and of books in " Nile-green skin."
That show forth unholy histories, and display the " deeper mysteries"
of strange and subtle Sin.
You can squirm, and glose, and hiss on, and awake that nouveau
/risson which is Art's best gift to life,

is the silent surgeon's knife!
And every man will say,

THE AMERICAN GIRL.
[An American Correipondent of The Qalignani Messenger is very serere on
the manners of his fiir oountry women.]
She " guesses " and she " calculates," she wears all sorts o' collars,
Her yellow hair is'not without suspicion of a dye;
Her "Pappa" is a dull
old man who turned
pork into dollars.
But everyone admits
that she's indubi-
tably spry.
She did Rome in a swift
two days, gave half
the time to Venice,
But vows that she saw
everything, although
in awful haste;
She's fond of dancing,
but she seems to fight
shy of lawn-tennis,
Because it might en-
danger the propor-
tions of her waist.
Her manner might be well
defined as elegantly
skittish;
She loves a Lord as only a Republican can do;
And quite the beBt of titles she's persuaded are the British,
And well she knows the Peerage, for she reads it through and
through.
She's bediamonded superbly, and shines like a constellation,
You scarce can see her fingers for the multitude of rings;
She's just a shade too conscious, so it seems, of admiration,
With irritating tendencies to wriggle when she sings.
She owns she is " Amur'can," and her accent is alarming;
Her birthplace has an awful name you pray you may forget;
Yet, after all, we own "La Belle Ame~ricaine is charming,
So let us hope she'll win at last her long-sought coronet.

TIPS FROM THE TAPE.
(Picked up in Mr. Punch's own Special City Corner.)
Is my last I announced that I was busily giving my mind to the
launching of a new " Combination Pool" over the satisfactory results
of which to all concerned in it, under certain contingencies, I had no
shadow of a doubt. This I have since managed to float on the
market, and, though I worked it on a principle of my own, whioh,
for want of a better description, I have styled amalgamated
"Profit and Loss." I;regret to have to inform those clients who have
entrusted me with their cheques in the hopes of getting, as I really
fully believed they would, 700 per cent, for their money in three days,
that I have had to close the speculation rather suddenly, and I fear,
as the following illustrative figures will show in a fashion that not
only deprives me of the pleasure of enclosing them a cheque for
Profits, but obliges me to announce to them that their cover has dis-
appeared. The Stocks with which I operated were " Draohenfonteim
Catapults," "Catawanga Thirty-fives," and " Blinker's Submarine
Explosives." The Illustbation, I hoped, would have stood as
follows:—
£100 invested in Drachenfonteim Catatpults, showing
profit of 1 per cent. . . . . . £100
£100 invested in Catawanga Thirty-fives, showing
profit of 24 _per oent £250
£300 invested in Blinker's Submarine Explosives,
showing profit of 3 per cent £900
Gross Profits £1250
Unfortunately, however, the real figures came out ratherldifferently,
for they stood, I regret to say, as under:—
£100 invested in Drachenfonteim Catapults, at a loss
of 5 per cent £500
£100 invested in Catawanga Thirty-fives, at a loss of
7 per oent. £700
£300 invested in Blinker's Submarine Explosives, at
at a loss of 4 per cent £1200
Total loss £2400
This, I need scarcely say, has at present not only eaten up every
halfpenny of cover, but a great deal besides; and I am not sure that
I shall not have to come down on my clients to make good the
balance. I cannot account for the result, except from the fact that
a new olerk read out the wrong tape; and when I telephoned to my
West-End Private Inquiry Agent about these very three Stocks, he
appears not to have heard me distinctly, and thought I was asking
him about Goschens, the old Three-per-Cents., and Bank Stock,
about which, of course, he could only report favourably. It is an
awkward mistake, but, as I point out to all my clients, one must not
regard the Dealer as infallible. These things will occur. However,
I am going to be more careful in future; and I may as well announce
now, that on Monday next I am about to open a new Syndicate
Combination Pool, with a Stock about which I have made the most
thorough and exhaustive inquiries, with the result that I am con-
vinced an enormous fortune will be at the command of anyone who
will entrust me with a sufficiently large cheque in the shape of cover
to enable me to realise it.
For obvious reasons I keep the name of this Stock at present a
dead secret. Suffice it to say, that the operation in question is
connected with an old South-American Gold Mine, about to be re-
worked under the auspices of a new company who have;bought it
for a mere song. When I tell my clients that I have got all my in-
formation from the Chairman, who took down under nis greatcoat a
carpet-bag full of crushed quart* carefully mixed with five ounces «f
gold nuggets, ana emptied this out at the bottom of a disused shaft, and
then got a Yankee engineer to report the discovery of ore in " lumps as
big as your fist," and state this in the new prospectus, they will at
once see what a solid foundation I have for this new venture, which
must inevitably fly upwards by leaps and bounds as soon as the
shares are placed upon the market. Of course, when the truth comes
out, there will be a reaction, but my clients may trust me to be on
the look-out for that, and, after floating with all their investments
to the top of the tide, to get out of the concern with enormous profits
before the bubble eventually bursts. It is by a command of infor-
mation of this kind that I hope to ensure the confidence and merit
the support of my friends and patrons. Remember Monday next,
and bear in mind a cheque for tnree-and-sixpence covers £5000. The
subjoined is from my correspondence:—
Sib,—I have as trustee for five orphan nieces to invest for each of
them £3 18s. '.hi., left them by a deceased maternal cousin. How
ought I to invest this to the greatest advantage with a due regard to
security. What do you say to Gosohens P Or would, you recommend
Rio Diavolos Galvanics! These promise a dividend of 70 per cent.,
and although they have not paid one for some time, are a particularly
cheap stock at the present market prioe, the scrip of the Five per
Cent. Debenture Stock being purchased by a local butterman at
seven pounds for a halfpenny. A Spanish Nobleman who holds
some of this, will let me have it even cheaper. What would you
advise me to do? Yours, &o., A Tbustee is a Foo.
Don't touch Goschens, they are not a speculative Stock. Ton
certainly might do worse than the Rio Diavolos Galvanics. Do not
hesitate, but put the little all] of your five orphan nieces into them
at once, and wait for the rise,
ON THE CARDS.
[By a Whist-loving Maladc-Imaginaire,)
Oh, where shall I hit on a " perfect cure" P
(What ails me I am not quite sure that I 'm sure)
To Nioe, where the weather is nice—with vagaries?
The Engadine soft or the sunny Canaries P
To Bonn or Wiesbaden? My doctor laconic
Declares that the Teutonic air is too tonic.
Shall I do Davos-Platz or go rove the Riviera P
Or moon for a month in romantic Madeira?
St. Moritz or Malaga, Aix, La Bourboule P
Bah! My doctor's a farceur and I am—a fool.
I will not try Switzerland, Norway, or Rome.
I 'ljjro in for a rest and a rubber—at home.
A Windermere wander, and Whist, I feel sure,
Will give what I'm seeking, a true " Perfect Cure."
A Bubble fbom the Subs.—A Firm of Soap-boilers have been
sending round a circular to "Dramatio Authors" of established
repntation, and (no doubt) others, offering to produce gratis the
best piece submitted to them at a " Matinie performance at a West
End ^Theatre." The only formality necessary to obtain this sweet
boon is the purchase of a box of the Firm's soap, which will further
contain a coupon "entitling the owner to send in one new and
original play for reading." The idea that a Dramatio Author of any
standing would submit his work to such a tribunal, even with the
dazzling prospect of a Matinie in futuro, is too refreshing I How-
ever, as literary men nowadays fully appreciate the value of their
labour, the !idea, in spite of the soap with which it is -
may be dismissed with the words, "Won't Wash 1"

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Why doesn't some publisher bring; ont The Utterbosh Series, for,
upon my word, says the Baron, the greater part of the books sent in
for notice" are simply beneath it. Here 'a one on which I made
notes as I went on, as far as I could get through it. It is called
Nemesis i a Moral Story, by Seton Cbewe. Its sole merit would
okj II V b> I "ave Deen being in one volume, were it
Jf—^Z<J notthatthisform.beingabaittothennwary,
aggravates the offence. The heroine is Lu-
ctnda} a milliner's apprentice. Being com-
promised by a young gentleman under age,
who suddenly quits the country, she goes
to confess her sin to the simple-minded
Curate, who sees no way out of the difficulty
except by marrying his penitent, which he
does, and after the christening of her first-
born, a joyous event that ocours at no great
interval alter the happy wedding-day, the
Curate, the Reverend Mr. Smith, is trans-
W^-' '™ ferred by his Bishop from this parish to
somewhere else a considerable distance off, whence, after a variety
of troubles, he goes abroad as a travelling watering-plaoe clergyman.
After this, his wife becomes a Roman Catholic for six months, and
then developes into a thoroughpaced infidel of generally loose
character. She takes up with a Lion Comique of the Music-Halls,
who is summarily kicked down-stairs by the Reverend Mr. Smith
on his return home one evening. And at this point I closed the
book, not caring one dump what became of any of the charac-
ters, or of the book, or of the writer, and unable'to wait for the
moral of this highly "moral story," which, I dare say, might
have done me a great deal of good. So I turned to Vanity
Fair, and re-read for the hundredth time, and with1 increased
pleasure, the great scene where Rawdon Crawley, returning home
suddenly, surprises Becky in her celebrated teti-a-tete with my
Lord Steyne.
With pleasure the Baron welcomes Vol. No. IV. of Routledge's
Caritbrooke Library, which contains certain Early Prose Romances,
the first and foremost among them being the delightful fable of
Reynart the Fox. Have patience with the old English, refer to the
explanatory notes, and its perusal will well repay every reader. How
came it about that modern Uncle Remus had oaught sojthoroughly the
true spirit of this Mediaeval romance P 1 forget, at this moment, who
wrote Uncle Remus—and I beg his pardon for so doing—but who-
ever it was, ;he professed only to dress up and record what he had
actually heard from a veritable Uncle Remus. Brer Rabbit, Brer
Fox, and Old Man Bar, are not the creatures of JEsop's Fables;
they are the characters in Reynart the Fox. The tricks, the
cunning, the villany of Reynart, unredeemed by aught except his
affeotion for his wife and family, are thoroughly amusing, and his
ultimate success, and increased prosperity, present a truer picture of
actual life than novels in which vice is visibly punished, and virtue
patiently rewarded. And once more I call to mind the latter days of
Becky's career.
Speaking of Thackeray, Messrs. Cassell & Co. have just
brought out a one-and-threepenny edition ("the threepence be
demmed! ) of the Yellowplush Papers, with a dainty canary-
coloured Jeames on the cover. At the same time the same firm
produce, in the same form, The Last Days of Pompeii, The Last
Days of Palmyra, and The Last of the Mohicans. Odd, that the
first issue of this new series should be nearly all'1 Lasts." The Yellow-
plush Papers might have been kept back, and The Last of the Barons
peen substituted, just to make the set of lasts perfect. The expression
is suggestive of Messrs. Cabsell going in for the shoemaking trade.
The Last Days of Palmyra I have never read. "I will try it,"
says the bold Baron.
But what means this new style of printing on thin double sheets?
One advantage is that no cutting is required. If this form become
the fashion, better thus to bring out the Utterbosh Series, which
shall then escape the critics' hands,—no cutting being required.
There are, as those who use the paper-knife to these volumes will
discover, in this new issue of Messrs. Casseix's, two blank pages
for every two printed ones, so that a new novel might be written
in MS. inside the printed one. The paper is good and clean to the
touch; but I prefer the stiff cover to the limp, there's more back-
bone about it, says the Baboit de Book-Worms.
Scarcely time to bring out a pocket edition [(like those genuine
pocketahle and portable editions, the red-backed Routi.kdges) of
The Bride of Lammermoor, between now and the date of its produc-
tion, next Saturday, at the Lyceum. But worth while doing it as
soon as possible. Advice gratis. B. de B.-W.
P.S.—(Important to Authors and Scribblers.)—Unfortunately the
Baron has been compelled to take to his bed (which he doesn't take
to" at all—but this by the way), and there write. Once more he
begs to testify to the excellence both of The Hairless Author's Pad

—no The Author's Hairless Pad—and. of the wooden rest and frame
into which it fits. Nothing better for an invalid than rest for his
frame, and here are rest and frame in one. Given these (or, if not
"given," purchased), and a patent indelible-ink-lead pencil (whose
patent I don't know, as, with much use, the gold-lettering is almost
obliterated from mine, and all I can make out is the word "Eagle "),
and the convalescent author may do all his work in comfort, without
mess or muddle; and hereto, once again, I set my hand and seal, so
know all men by these presents, all to the contrary nevertheless and
notwithstanding. B. de B.-W.
GEEEN PASTURES OR PICCADILLY?
To the Editor.
8 m,—I see that you have opened your columns to a discussion of
the relative advantages of life in London and the Suburbs. I don't
think that really the two can be compared. If you want perfect
quietude, can you get it better than in a
place where, between nine and six, not a
single male human being is visible, all of
them being in town? Some people may
call this dull; but I like it. Then every-
thing is so cheap in the Suburbs! I only pay V
£100 a year for a nice house in a street, with J*
a small bath-room, and a garden quite as
large as a full-sized billiard-table. People
tell me I could get the same thing in London,
but of course a suburban street must be nicer
than a London one. We are just outside
the Metropolitan main drainage system, and
our death-rate is rather heavy, but then our rates are light. My
butcher only charges me one-and-twopence a pound for best joints,
and though this is a little dearer than London, the meat is probably
more wholesome from being in such good air as we enjoy. In winter-
time the journey to town, half-an-hour by train, has a most bracing
effect on those capable of bearing severe cold. For the rest, the
incapables are a real blessing to those who sell mustard-plasters
and extra-sized pocket-handkerchiefs. Our society is so select
and refined that I verily believe Belgravia1 can show Lnothing
like it! Yours obediently,
Fab from the Madding Cbowd.
Sib,—The Suburbs are certainly delightful, if you have a good
train service; but this you seldom get. I do not ..complain of our
Company taking three-quarters of an hour to perform the distance of
eight and a half miles to the City, as this seems a good average
suburban rate, but I do think the fast" train (which performs the
distance in that time) might start a little later than 8'30 a.m. Going
in to business at 10'30 by an " ordinary" train, whioh stopB at six-
teen stations, and takes an hour and a half, becomes after a time
rather monotonous. It involves a painful "Rush in Urbe"to get
through business in time to catch the 4'30 " express" back, a train
which (theoretically) stops nowhere. Country Cussnr'.
SrB,—No more London for me! I've tried it, and know what it's
like. I have found a delightful cottage, twenty miles from town,
and mean to live in it always. Do we ever have one of your nasty
yellow fogs here? Never! Nothing more than a thick white mist,
which rises from the fields and envelopes the house every night. It
is true that several of our family complain of rheumatism, and when
I had rheumatic fever myself a month ago, I found it a little incon-
venient being six miles from a doctor and a chemist's shop. But
then my house is so picturesque, with an Early English wooden
porch (whioh can be kept from falling to pieces quite easily by ham-
mering a few nails in now and then, and re-pamting once a week),
and no end of gables, whioh only let the water into the bedrooms in
case of a very heavy shower. Then think of the delights of a garden,
and a field (for which I pay £20 a year, and repair the hedges), and
chickens 1 I don't think lhave spent more than £50 above what I
should have done in London, owing to the necessity of fitting up
chicken-runs and buying a conservatory for my wife, who is pas-
sionately fond of flowers. Unfortunately my chickens are now
moulting, and decline to lay again before next March; so I bring
back fresh eggs from town, and, as my conservatory is not yet full,
flowers from Covent Garden; and I can assure you that, until you
try it, you cannot tell the amount of pleasure and exercise which
walking a couple of miles (the distance of my cottage from the sta-
tion), laden with groceries and other eatables, can be made to afford.
Yours chirpily, Field-Fabe.
Good for SpobtI—A well-known chartered accountant, with a
vulpine patronymic, complains of the unkind treatment he reoently
received in Cologne at the hands of the German police. He should be
consoled by the thought, that his persecution marked in those
latitudes the introduction of Fox-hunting.

In trickery's quicksand sinking,

Their tool must choke or drown?
Indifferent France sits smiling.

This quicksand unromantio
Closes on him, the Antic,

And foiled fire-eaters utter
Most sanguinary threats.

So fumes the fierce swash-buckler,
And his toy-rapier whets.
But will that quicksand only

The fraud exposed, the known lie,
The bribe at length betrayed,

TO A TRUMPETING DEMOCRAT.
[Mr. Axdrsw Carnegie, the Iron King and millionnaire of Pittsburg,
has been addressing big audiences in Scotland. Amongst his remarks were the
following:—"It is said that in America, although we have no aristocracy,
we are cursed with a plutarchy. Let me tell you about that. A man who
carries a million dollars on his back carries a load.. . . When I speak against
the Boyal Family I do not condescend to speak of the creatures who form the
Hoyal Family—persons are so insignificant. ... We laugh at your ideas in
this petty little country having anything to say to the free and independent
citizens who walk through Canada, Australia, and America. You know how
to get rid of a Monarchy. Brazil has taught you."—&c, &c]
Carnegie, pray take notice, sinoe I know that it would blister
The thin skin of a democrat, I drop the title " Mr.,"
You have talked a lot of bunkum, all mixed up with most terrific cant.
Bnt yon truly said that "persons are so very insignificant;"
And the author of a speech I read, part scum and partly dreggy,
Is perhaps the least significant—that windbag named Carnegie.
Bnt your kindness most appals me, Sir; how really, truly gracious,
For one whose home is in the States, free, great, and most capacious,
To come to poor old England (where the laws but make the many fit
To lick a Royal person's boots), and aU for England's benefit.
To preach to us, and talk to us, to tell us how effete we are,
How like a flock of silly sheep who merely baa and bleat we are.
And how "this petty little land," which prates so much of loyalty,
Is nothing bnt a laughing-stock to Pittsburg Iron-Royalty^
How titles make a man a rake, a drunkard, and the rest of it,
While plain (but wealthy) democrats in Pittsburg have the best of it.
How, out in Pennsylvania, the millionnaires are panting [banting.
(Though there's something always keeps them fat) for monetary
How free-born oitizens complain, with many Yankee curses,
Of fate which fills, in spite of them, their coffers and their purses.
How, if the man be only poor, there's nothing that can stop a oit
In Yankeeland, while here with us the case is just the opposite.
How honest British working-men who fail to fill their larder
Should sail for peaoe and plenty by the very next Cunarder.
And how, in short, if Britishers want freedom gilt with millions,
They can*t do wrong to imitate the ohivalrous Brazilians.
Well, well, I know we have our faults, quite possibly a orowd of them,
And sometimes we deceive ourselves by thinking we are proud of them;
But we never can have merited that you should set the law to us,
And rail at us, and sneer at us, and preach to us, and "jaw" to us.
We 're much more tolerant than some; let those who hate the law go
And spout sedition in the streets of anarchist Chicago;
And, after that, I guarantee they '11 never want to roam again,
Until they get a first-class hearse to take their bodies home again.
But stay, I've hit upon a plan: We '11, first of all, relieve you
Of all your million dollars that so onerously grieve you;
Then, if some loud, conceited fool wants taking down a peg, he
Shall spend an hour or so in talk with democrat Carnegie.
For all men must admit 'twould be an aot of mere insanity
To try to match this Pittsburger in bluster or in vanity.
And oh, when next our Chancellor is anxious for a loan, Sir,
He '11 buy you in at our price, and he '11 sell you at your own, Sir.
And if you don't like English air, why, dash it, you may lump it,
Or go and blow in other climes your most offensive trumpet!
ROBERT UP THE RIVER.
_ I atended on a Party larst week as went up the River (our nioe
little Stream, as the aughty Amerrycanes calls it) to Ship Lake, tho'
why it 'a called so I coodn't at all make out, as there ain't no Ship
nor no Lake to be seen there, ony a werry little Werry, and a werry
littel River, and a werry littel Hiland j and itiwas prinsepally to see
how the appy yung Gents who sumtimes lives on the same littel
Hiland, in littel Tents, was a gitting on, as injuoed all on us, me and
all, to go there. It seems that for years parst quite a littel Collony of
yung Gents as gets their living in the grand old Citty has been in
the habit of spending their littel summer Hollydays there, but, some-
hows or other, as I coodn't quite understand, the master of the littel
Hiland made up his mind for to sell it, and all the yung Gents was
in dispair, and wundered where on airth they shood spend their
Hollydays in future. But they needn't have been afeard—there was
a grand old hinstitushun called " The Copperashun 1" as had both
their ears and both their eyes open when they heard about it. So
when the time came for it to be sold, they jest quietly says to one of
their principel Chairmen (who is sich a King of Good Fellers that
they all calls him by that name, and he arnsers to it jest as if it was
the werry name as was guv him by his Godfathers and his God-
mothers, as I myself heard with my own ears), "Go and buy it'."
So off he goes at wunoe and buys it, and the kindly Copperashun
Gents as I went with larst week, went to take possesshun on it
aoordingly, and to see if anythink coud be done to make the yung
Campers-out ewen more oumferabel than they ewer was afore! Ah,
that s what I calls trew Pattriotizm, and trew Libberality, if you
likes, and that's what makes 'em so much respeckted.
Our Gents was all considrably surprized at the lots of Tents as
was all a standing on Ship Lake Island; one on 'em, who was got
up quite in a naughtical style, said as he was estonished to see so
many on 'em pitched, but I think as he must ha' bin mistaken, for I
didn't see not none on 'em pitched, tho' I dessay it might ha' been
werry usefool in keeping out the rain on a remarkabel wet night.
By sum mistake on sumboddy's part, there wasn't not no yung
Campers-out to receeve us, and so fears was hentertaned that they
wood have to cum again shortly; but they are bold plucky gents, is
the men of the Copperashun, and they one and all xpressed their
reddiness to do it at the call of dooty. Besides, we had sich a reel
Commodore a board as made us all quite reddy to brave the foaming
waves again. Why, he guv out the word of command, whether it
was to Port the Helem, or to " Titen the mane braces," as if he
had bin a Hadmiral at the werry least, and his galliant crew obeyed
him without not no grumbling or ewen thretening to strike!
By one of them striking and remarkabel ocurrences as happens so
offen, who shood we appen to find at Ship Lake, but one of the werry
poplarest of the Court of Haldermen, and what shood he do but ask
em all in to lunoh at his splendid manshun, and what shood they all do
but jump at the hoffer, and what does he do, for a lark, I serppose—
if so be as a reel Poplar Alderman ewer does have sich a thing as a
lark—and give 'em all sioh a gloiyous spread, as I owerbeara one
henergetick Deperty describe it, as hutterly deprived 'em all of the
power of heating a bit of dinner till the werry next day, to which
time they wisely put it off, and then thorowly injoyed it.
In course, I'm not allowed to menshun not no names on these
eonferdential ocasions, but I did hear "the Commodore" shout to
"the King" sumthink about " Hansum is as Hansum does," but it
was rayther too late in the heavening for me to be able to quite
unnerstand his elusions.
I am 'appy to be able to report that we every one on us arrived, in
Town quite safe and quite happy, xcep sum of the pore hard-working
crew who are left at Marlow till further orders. Robert.

A FAIR PROPOSAL.
Johnson (at window—having offered to tame a vicious Borse for his Friend\ "Now, Toil, just coilar hold of his Head, and / 'LL
PUT THE MUZZLB ON!"
A SPORTING STYLE.
(Third Example.)
Two examples of a correct Bporting style
have been already laid before the public For
coDrenience of reference they may be denned
aa the mixed-pugilistic and the insolent.
There is. however, a third variety, the equine,
in which everyone who aspires to wield the
pen of a sporting: reporter must necessarily be
a proficient. It may be well to warn a be-
ginner that he must not attempt this style
until he has laid in a large stock of variegated
metaphoric expressions. As a matter of fact
one horse-race is very much like another in
its main incidents, and the
process of betting against
or in favour of one horse
resembles, more or less, the
process of betting about
any other. The point is,
however, to impart to
monotonous incidents a
variety they do not pos-
sess; and to do this pro-
perly a luxuriant vocabu-
lary is essential. For in-
stance, in the course of
a race, some horses tire, or,
to put it less offensively,
po less rapidly than others.
The reporter will say of
such a horse that he (1)
"shot his bolt," or (2)
"cried peccavi," or (3) "cried a go," or (4)
"compounded," or (5) "exhibited signals of
distress," or (6) "fired minute guns," or (7)
"fell back to mend his bellows," or (8)
"seemed to pause for reflection."

Again, in reoording the upward progress of
horses in the betting market, it would be
ridiculous to say of all of them merely that
they became hot favourites. Vary, there-
fore, occasionally, by saying of one, for ex-
ample, that " here was another case of one
being eventually served up warm"; of
another, that " plenty of the talent took 7 to
4 about Mousetrap;" of a third, that "Para-
dux had the call at 4 to 1;" and of a fourth,
that "a heap of money, and good money
too, went on Backslide." After these preli-
minary instructions, Mr. Punch offers his
Third Example.—Event to be described:
A horse-race. Names of horses and jockeys,
weights, &c. supplied.
Considerable delay took place. Little
Benjy made a complete bole in his manners
by bolting. Eventually, however, the flag
fell to a capital start. Burglar Bill on
the right out out the work* from Paladin,
who soon began to blow pre it guns, and
after a quarter of a mile had been nego-
tiated yielded his pride of plaoe to Cudlums
with The P'liceman in attendance, Sobriety
lying fourth, and D. T. close behind. Thus
they raced to the bend, where Burglar Bill
cried peccavi, and Cudlums having shot her
bolt. Sobriety was left in front, only to be
challenged by Cropeared Sue, who had been
coming through her horses with a wet sail.
Bounding the bend Simpson called upon Mrs.
Brady and literally took tea with her rivals, t
whom he nailed to the counter one after
* Note this sentence. It is essential.
f At first sight it would appear more natural
that Simpson (presumably a jockey) having called
upon Mrs. Brady, should take tea with her rather
than with her riraj. But a sporting style involves
us in puzzles.
another. The favourite compounded at the
distance, and Mrs. Brady romped home the
easiest of winners, four lengths ahead of
Cropeared Sue; a bad third. The rest were
whipped in by Flyaway, who onoe more
failed to justify the .appellation bestowed
upon him.
Mr, Punch flatters himself that, upon the
above model, the report of any race-meeting
oould be accurately constructed at home. In
future, therefore, no reporter should go to
the expense of leaving London for Epsom,
Newmarket, Ascot, or Goodwood.
A CENTENARIAN.
"This is the cent*nary of the till hat."
Daily New:
A bunpetd years of hideonsness,
Constriot<d brows, and strain, and stress!
And still, de-

INTERVIEWING A LA MODE.
{Quite at the Service of some of Mr. Punch's Contemporaries.)
One of our Representatives called a few days since upon
Mr. Brown, senior member of the well-known firm of
Messrs. Brown, Jones, and Robinson. The Eminent
General Dealer was seated "in his counting-house," as
the nursery-song hath it, "counting out his money."
"Come in, come in!" -said Mr. Brown, cordially, as
he somewhat hurriedly looked up the coin in a safe out
of our reach. "I am delighted to Bee you."
"Glad to hear it," we replied, rather drily. "We
want to put a few questions to you, in the interest of the
public."
"As many as you please. I am, as you know, a man
of business; still, the resources of our establishment are
so vast, that my place can be supplied without incon-
venience to our thousands, I may say millions of customers.
And now, Sir, what can I do for you?"
"Well, Mr. Bkown, speaking in the name of civilisa-
tion, I would wish to ask you if you have much sale
for Smashtjp's Concentrated Essence of Cucumbers
(registered), in the larger bottles?"
Yes, Sir, we have; although the smaller sizes are,
possibly, a trifle more popular."
"What do you think of Cottonbacx's Fleur de
Lyons Putney Satin?"
"A most admirable material for home wear, although
we do not recommend it for use at a party, a ball, or a
reception. For festive occasions we do a very large trade
inl Giqglewater's Superfine Velvet South American
Moire' Antique as advertised."
"Indeed 1 Perhaps, you can mention a few more
articles that in your judgment you believe it will interest
our readers to learn about."
"Pardon"me, but don't you put that sentence a trifle
olumsily?"
Our Representative smiled and blushed. Then he
admitted that Mr. Bbown might be right.
"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the Senior Partner, in great
glee. "You see I have my head sorewed on the right
way I But to answer you. Gotemon'b Patent Alligator's
Skin Braces are attracting much attention just now, so is
Wipe's Castle 2 Imperial William Champagne, whioh
finds (I may observe confidentially) a ready sale at thirty-
two shillings the dozen. Then there are Axe's Eleotric
Tooth-brushes, and Crax's Stained-glass Solid Mahogany
Brass-mounted Elizabethan Mantel-boards. Then, of
course, I must not forget Bolter's Washhandstands and
Boundeb's Anti-agony Aromatic Pills."

"And all these articles Bell largely?"
"Very largely, indeed. And so they should; for they are well worth the
money they cost."
"Indeed they are, or I should not find them in your establishment."
"You are very good. And now, d propos of your journal, will you permit me
to pay a return compliment?"
1 Certainly,"we'replied. "You havenoticedanimprovementinourcolumns?"
"Unquestionably I have," returned Mr. Bbown, emphatically. "I have
observed that of late you have given much interesting matter in the body of
your paper that heretofore used to be reserved for the pages exclusively devoted
to advertisements. I congratulate you!"
And with a courteous wave of his hand and a bow of dismissal, the Eminent
Pillar of Commerce delicately intimated to us that our interview was at an end,
'AERY ON THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY.

They may copy my style till all's blue, but they won't disoombobulate me.
Names and metres is anyone's props; but of one thing they don't get the 'ang;
They ain't fly to good patter, old pal, they ain't copped the straight griflin on slang.
'Tisn't grammar and spellin' makes patter, nor yet snips and snaps of snide talk.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MODERN TYPES.
(By Mr. Punch'a Own Type Writer.)
No. XIX.—THE SERVANT OF SOCIETY.
The Servant of Sooiety is one who, having in early life abdicated
every claim to independent thought or action, is content to attach
himself to the skirts and coat-tails of the great, and to exist for a
long time as a mere appendage in mansions selected by the unerring
instinct of a professional tuft-hunter. It is as oommon a mistake
to suppose that all tuft-hunters are neoessarily of lowly birth and
of interior social position, as it is to believe them all to be offensive
in manner and shallow in artifice. The coarse but honest Snob still
perhaps exists, and here and there he thrusts and pushes in the old
familiar way; but more often than not the upstart who has won
his way to wealth and consideration finds himself to his own surprise
courted and fawned upon by those whose boots his abilities would have
fitted him to black, and his disposition prompted him to lick. Noble
sportsmen are proud to be seen in his company, aristooratio gninea-
pigs are constantly in his pocket in the oongenial society of the
great man's purse, art willingly reproduces his features, journalism
enthusiastically commemorates his adventures, and even Royalty
does not thrust away a votary whose ministrations are as acceptable
as they are readily performed. Without much effort on his own
part he is raised to pinnacles whioh he imagined impossible of access,
and soon learns to look down with a contempt that might spring of
ancient lineage and assured merit, upon the^hungry crowd whose
cry is that of the daughter of the horse-leech.
But the genuine Servant of Society is of a different stamp.
Ordinarily he is of a good family, and of a
competence which both differs from and re-
sembles his general character in being pos-
sessed at once of the attributes of modesty
and assurance. From an early age he will
have been noted for the qualities which in
after-life render him humbly celebrated in
subordinate positions. At school he will have
had the good fortune to be attached as fag
to a big boy who occupied an important place
as an athlete, and whose condescending smiles
were naturally an object of greater ambition
to the small fry than the approval of the school
authorities. For him he performed with much
assiduity the various duties of a fag, happy
to shine amongst his companions as the
recipient of the great boy's favours. To play
the jackal without incurring universal dislike
is (at school) no very easy task, but he accom-
plishes it with discretion and with a natural
aptitude that many matnrer jackals might
envy.
At the age of seventeen he is withdrawn
from school. His own marked disinclination
saves him from a military career, and he is
subsequently sent to pass a year or two upon
the Continent of Europe, in order that he may first of all pass the
examination for the Diplomatic Service, and subsequently foil foreign
statesmen with their o wn weapons, and in their own language. Return-
ing, he secures his nomination, and faces the Examiners. Providence,
however, reserves him for lower things. The Examiners triumph,
and the career of the Servant of Society begins in earnest. The
gaition of his parents secures for him an entrance into good houses,
e is a young man of great tact and of small accomplishments. He
can warble a song, aid a great lady to organise a social festivity,
lead a cotillon, order a dinner, and help to eat it, act in amateur
theatricals, and recommend French novels to inquiring matrons
His manners are always easy, and his conversation has .that spiee of
freedom whioh renders it specially acceptable in the boudoirs of the
smart. The experience of a few years makes plain to him that, in
social matters, the serious person goes down before the trifler. He
therefore cultivates flippancy as a fine art, and becomes noted for a
certain cheap cynicism, whioh he sprinkles like a quasi-intellectual
pepper over the strong meat of risky conversation. Moreover, he is
constantly self-satisfied, and self-possessed. Yet he manages to
avoid giving offence by occasionally assuming a gentle humility of
manner, to whioh he almost succeeds in imparting a natural air, and
he studiously refrains from saying or doing anything whioh, since it
may cause other men to provoke him, may possibly result in his
being forced to pretend that he himself has been ruffled. Yet it
must be added that he is always thoroughly harmless. He flutters
about innumerable dovecots, without ever fluttering those who dwell
in them, and, in course of time, he comes to be known and accepted
everywhere as a useful man. As might be supposed, he is never ob-
trusively manly. The rough pursuits of the merely athletio repel
him, yet he has the knack of assuming an interest where he feels
it not, and is able to prattle quite pleasantly about sports in whioh he

takes little or no active part. At the same time it must be admitted
that he holds a gun fairly straight, and does not disgrace himself
when the neoessity of slaughtering a friend's pheasants interrupts
for a few hours the rehearsals of private theatricals, in company
with the friend's wife. Certainly he is not a fool. He gauges with
great accuracy his own capacities, and carefully limits his ambition
to those smaller desires which, since they exact no vaulting power, are
never likely to bring about a fall on the other side. The objectt
of his admiration are mean; and since he meanly admires them, he
comes quite naturally under the Thaokerayan definition of a Snob.
Whilst he is still a year or two on the fair side of thirty, it may
happen that a turn of the political wheel will bring into high offioe a
statesman who is quite willing to be served by those who are able to
make themielves useful to him, without exacting from them solidity
either of character or of attainments. With him the Servant of
Society, with an instinct that does credit to his discernment, will
have established friendly relations. The politician was first amused
and then impressed by his versatility; now, having the opportunity,
he offers to hinrthe position of Assistant Private Secretary (unpaid),
and it is scarcely necessary to say that the young man accepts it
with a gratitude whioh proves that he believes his patron capable of
conferring further favours. From this time forward he begins to
abandon the merely frivolous air that has hitherto distinguished him.
He lays in a mixed stock of solemnity, mystery, and importance, and
occasionally awes the friends of his flippant days by assuming the
reticent look and the shake of the head of one who is marked off
from common mortals by the possession of seorets the revelation of
which might, perhaps, imperil the peace of the world. In country-
houses, in London drawing-rooms, and at Clubs, where he had
hitherto been mentioned with a laugh as
"Little So-and-So," he comes to be talked of
as "So-and-So—-of course you know him—
Lord Blank's Private Seoretary." Thus he
becomes quite a personage. But he is far from
abandoning the role of Servant of Society.
Indeed, he only enlarges and glorifies the
scope of his ministrations, without in any way
ceasing to cultivate those smaller trifles which
stood him in suoh good stead at the outset of
his career. He now has the satisfaction of
seeing many of those who desire anything
that a Cabinet Minister can give, cringing to
one whom they despise, and who rejoices in
the knowledge that he can afford to patronise
them, and perhaps crush them by obtaining
for them that which they want.
When, in the course of a few years, Lord
Blank's party ceases to direct the government
of the country, his Assistant Private Secretary
follows him into the cold shade of adversity
and opposition, and stands by him with exem-
plary usefulness and fidelity. But, though
he is often pressed, he never contests a
constituency, feeling, perhaps, that it is im-
possible to serve both Society and the Caucus.
In time his name becomes the oommon property of all Society journals
—his biography is published in one, his discreet service is extolled in
another, while a third goes so far as to hint that, if the truth were
known, it would be found that the various departments of the State
could not possibly carry on their affairs without his enlightened
counsel. He adopts an antique fashion of dress, in order to empha-
sise his personality. He wears a stuck, and a very wide-brimmed
hat, and carries a bunch of seals dangling from a fob.
At forty-five he marries the daughter of a powerful Peer, and,
shortly afterwards, insures so much of the favour of Royalty as to be
spoken of as a persona grata at Court. Henceforward his services
are often employed in delicate negotiations, which may necessitate
the climbing of many back-stairs. On such occasions, and after it
has been announced in the papers that "Mr. So-and-so was the
bearer of an important communication " from one great person to
another, it is his custom to show himself in his Clubs and in crowded
haunts, bo that he may enjoy the pleasure of being pointed out,
digita pratereuntium, and of catching the whispers of those who
nudge one another as they mention his name.
Finally, it will be rumoured that he has been collecting materials
for the Memoirs whioh he proposes shortly to publish. But though
he never disclaims the intention, and is even understood, on more
than one ocoasion, to allude in conversation to the precise period of
his life to whioh his writing has then brought him, it is quite certain
that he will never carry out the intention, or bring out the book. At
the age of sixty he will still be a young man, with a gay style of
banter peculiarly his own. Towards the end of his life he will often
talk darkly of great events in which he has played a part, and of
extraordinary services whioh only he could have performed; and
when he dies, the country will he cilled upon to mourn for one
who has savel it from social degradation, and from political disaster.

[According to the Standard, by the new Meat Inspection Law, just come
into force in the United States, American cattle and pigs for export to
England, France, or Germany, are to be inspected before leaving America,
with a view to removing the grounds of objection on the part of those
Governments to the unrestricted reception of these important American
exports. Should any foreign Government, fearful of pleuro-pneumonia or
trichinosis, refuse to trust to the infallibility of the American inspectors,
the President of the United States is authorised to retaliate by directing
that such products of such foreign State as he may deem proper shall be
excluded from importation to the United States.]

Speaking of Reynart the Fox, I was made, by a slip of the prin-
ter's hand—I am accustomed to seeing slips from his hand, which is
quite another thing—to say that this medieval romance " presents a
truer picture of life than novels in which vice is punished and virtue
patiently rewarded." After consider-
ing for some time what on earth I could
have meant by "patiently rewarded,"
I remembered that I had written
'' patently rewarded.'1 The printer put
'ik my "i" out, and without an "i" it

in nutshells, and good in everything." Shelley's poems might
be brought out in pocketable form under a similar title, Nut-Shelley
Poems. I have not yet seen the volume in question, only heard tell
of it, and should not be surprised to hear that the central novel and
the best was a short military novel, entitled The Kernel. Messrs.
Hutchinson & Co. are the publishers. I hope Mr. Sterry has
illustrated them himself. He can draw and paint, but he won't, and
there's an end on't. He must follow np the Nutshells with a volume
of Crackers, about Christmas time.
Just been looking through London Street Arabs, by Mrs. H. M.
Stanley, published by Cassell & Co., which firm—whose tele-
graphio address is "Caspeg, London," and a good name too—writes
to the Baron thus:—"in forwarding you an early copy"—small
and early—" of Mrs. Stanley's book, we will ask you to be good
enough"—("I am 'good enough'" quoth the Baron)—"to confine
your extracts from the Introduction to an extent not exceeding one-
third of the whole."_ "Willingly, my dear 'Caspeg,'" replies the
Baron, who does not like being dictated to. and, to gratify your wish to
the utmost, he will make no extracts at all from the book, a proceed-
ing which ought mightily to delight '' Caspeg, London." What next P
Wul publishers send to the Baron, and request him not even to
breathe the names of their books? By all means. He has no objec-
tion, as, whether Bent to him for review, or purchased by him pour
s» ilistraire, the Baron only mentions those he likes, or, if he mentions
those he dislikes, 'tis pro bono publico, and there's an end on't
Mrs. Stanley appreciates humour, as the following anecdote will
show But, dear me, the Baron is forgetful—ho begs "CaspegV'
pardon; he mustn't quote. Mrs. Stanley can be truly sympathetic
with sorrow, as the following story proves no, "Caspeg," the
story must not follow. Never mind—the Baron's dear readers will
read it for themselves if they feel'' so dispoged." The Baron supposes
that all this was written and drawn while Mrs. Stanley was Miss
Dorothy Tennant, because her recorded opinion, probably, as
a spinster, is (and here the Baron "quotes" not, but "alludes"),
that you can find better artistic material in this line at home, than
you can obtain by seeking it abroad; yet when she married, off
she went to Milan, Venice, and so forth. For pleasure, of course,
not work; but work to her is evidently pleasure. May happiness
have accompanied her everywhere! The drawings are pretty, rather
of the goody-good "Sunday-at-home -readings" kind of illustra-
tions. And what on earth has a sort of pictorial advertisement for
".Somebody's Soap" got to do with Street Arabs P Washed Ashore;
or, Happy At Last?1 might be the title of this mer-baby picture,
in which two naked children, not Street Arabs, or Arabs of any
sort, are depicted as examining the inanimate body of a nondescript
creature, half flesh and half nsh, whioh has been thrown up by the
waves "to be left till called for" by the next high-tide, when,
perhaps, its sorrowing parents, Mr. and Mrs. Merman, or its
widowed mother, Mrs. Merwokan, arrayed in sea-" weeds," may
come to claim it and give it un-ohristian burial. But that the
Baron, out of deference to the wishes of "Caspeg, London," does
not like to quote one single line, he could give Mrs. Stanley's own
account of how this picture of the Mer-baby came to be inahldsd
in the Street Arab Collection. For suoh explanation the Baron
refers the reader to the book itself. "Caspeg," farewell!

novelettes of like kind. He says that he is getting just the least bit
tired of Mignon, and the plain-spoken girls, and the rest of them.
By the way, he observes that it seems to be the fashion, judging
from the pages of Ferrers Court, in what he may call "Service
Suckles," to talk continually of a largely advertising lady's tailor.
If this custom spreads, he presumes that that popular topic of
conversation, the weather, will have to give place to the prior
claims for consideration of Somebody's Blacking, or Somebody-
else's Soap. This is to be regretted, as, in spite of the sameness of
subject of the Bootle's Baby series, John Stbange Winter is always

of Lammermoor in order to refresh his memory before seeing the new

Ashton, which, during rehearsals, must have been peculiarly appro-
priate to her representative at the Lyceum, Miss Ellen Terby.
Here they are:—"To these details, however trivial, Lucy lent
patient and not indifferent attention. They moved and interested
Henry, and that was enough to secure her ear." "Great Scott!"

STALKING THE SAGACIOUS STAG.
Sporting Xotes from Our Special Representative.
I had an invite from Jepson, a Stock Exchange acquaintance,
who has rented a Moor for the winter months, and who, happening
to hear that I and my two foreign friends were in the neighbour-
hood, most kindly asked me to come and have a look at his box,
and bring them with me.
"I hear," he writes, "that the deer are very lively, and if you
want to show your foreign friends some first-rate British Sport, you
can't do better than bring them."
Need I say that I jumped at this. Coming along on the top of the
coach, that takes us to Spital-hoo, the place my friend has rented, I
have been endeavouring to describe what I imagine to be the nature
of the sport of Deer-stalking to the Chief and the Bulgarian Count.
The former, who has been listening attentively, says that, from
my description, stalking a stag must be very much the same as
hunting the double-humped bison in Mwangumbloola, and that
the only weapon he shall take with him will be a pickaxe. I have
pointed out to him that I don't think this will be any use, as in
deer-Btalking I fancy you follow the stag at some distance, but he
seems resolute about the pickaxe, and bo, I suppose, I must let him
have his way. The Bulgarian Count was deeply interested in the
matter, and says that evidently the proper weapon to use is a species
of quick-firing, repeating Hotchkiss, and that he has one now on
its way through Edinburgh, the invention of a compatriot, that
will fire 2700 two-ounce bullets in a minute and a-half. I fancy,
if he uses this, he will surprise the neighbourhood; but, of course,
I have not said anything to interfere with his project.

THE PLEASURES OF GETTING UP EARLY TO GO "CUBBING."

1. The Meet was to be at Cropper's Gorse, 6 30. At 4'30
Thompson called for me. He said he knew the way perfectly.
2. After we had gone a couple of miles, a steady rain came
D. I didn't think much of the beauties of early morning.

3. "Well, my man," said Thompson, "seen the hounds?
This is Cropper s Gone, I suppose?" "Noa, Sur; this be
Cropper's Plantation. The Gorse be four miles oyer yonder !''
4. "Extraordinary thing I should hare been mistaken,"
said Thompson. "Never mind. Lot's canter on, and we '11
see some fan yet."

6. "Hi! my boy, is this Cropper's Gorse i" asked Thomp-
son. "Noa, Sur. This be Cropper's Common. The Gorse
be fire miles over yonder!"
G. Then Thompson had the decency to say, "Let's go
back and hare breakfast."
RATS IN COUNCIL.
A mass meeting of Rats was held (unknown to the Park-keepers) under the Reformer's Oak in Hyde Park,
at midnight of last Sunday. The object of the gathering was to protest against the proposal made by a
Correspondent of The Timet, that the "sewer-rats who had established themselves in the sylvan retreat"
known as Hyde Park Dell, should be exterminated by means of "twenty ferrets and a few capable dogs."
Mr. Rodent (Senior) was called upon to preside. He took the hillock amid waving or tails and much
enthusiasm, and remarked that he trusted that that vast assembly, one of the most magnificent demonstrations
that even Hyde Park had ever known, would show by its orderly behaviour,_ that Rats knew how to
conduct business. iChetrt.) They lived in strange times. A barbarous suggestion had been made to evict
circumstances. [Cheers.) They were accused of eating young moor-chicks. Well, was a Rat to starve f
("iVb. no.'") Lid not a Rat owe a duty to those dependent upon it? {Cheers, and cries of" Yes.'") He
appealed to the opinion of the civilised world to put a stop At this point in the Chair-rat's address, an
alarm of " Dogs!" was raised, and the meeting at once dispersed in some confusion.

though, perchance,

TO MY UMBRELLA.
Twere hard indeed to try to get
A theme without some poem on it—
A vilanelle, a triolet,
An ode, an epic, or a sonnet.
Castara's charms were sung of old,
Both Swift and Sidney wrote to Steim,
But mine it is to
first unfold
The praipe of my
beloved Umbrella.
You are not difficult
to please,
Although no doubt
n trifle "knobby;"
Whilst I'm reclining
at mine ease,
I leave you standing
in the lobby.
I ever treat you.thus,
and yet
I haven't got a friend
who's firmer;
In point of fact, yon even let
Me shut you up without a murmur.
Now some seek solace sweet in smoke,
And make a pipe their Amkyllis;
So think not that I do but joke
In calling you my darling Phyllis.
And though the gossips never spare
For ill-report to seek a handle,
7hi (indiarubber) ring you wear
Prevents the very thought of scandal.
"Fair weather, friend," we've often heard
Used as a term to throw discredit.
Though clearly it were quite absurd
If speaking of your sell one said it.
When skies are blue (a thing that's rare)
I in the coolest way forsake you,

But; when the For. cist tells me " Fair,"
Or "Settltd Sunshine," then I take you.
I like to think of one sweet day
When cats and dogs it kept on raining,
(Why "cats and dogs," it's rieht to say,
Who will oblige me by explaining ?)'
When someone, who had golden hair,
And I were walking out together,
And underneath your sheltering care,
Were happy spite of wind and weather.
One day I atked a friend to dine,
The friend I most completely trusted.
We sat and chatted o'er the wine,
He liked the port—my fine old crusted.
At length we said " Good-night." He went
But not alone. For to my sorrow
Mv mind with jealousy was rent,
To find you misting on the morrow.
You had eloped! Yet all the same
I felt quite sure you were his victim,
When baok a sorry wreck you came,
I very nearly went and kicked him!
Did Love take wings, and fly away?
Grew my affeotion less f No, never!
To tell the truth, I'm bound to say
I fondly loved you more than ever 1
With him—the man who was my friend—
It 'a pretty clear you got on badly;
Your ribs, somehow, seem prone to bend,
Your silken dress seems wearing sadly.
It's very hard, I know, to part,
And sentimental feelings smother,
But even though it break my heart,
I'm going, next week, to get another.

HISTOEY AS SHE IS WROTE!
Last week the St. James's Gazette published an article proving
that the Bastille, so far from being a gloomy prison, was the most
delightful of hotels. This historical record has, however, caused no
surprise in 85, Fleet Street, because the following extraot from a
very old diary has for years been awaiting publication. The time
has now arrived for it to see the light.
GAT MOMENTS AT THE ANCIENT BAILEY.
Newgate, September 29, 17—.—Got up with the assistance of my
valet, and held my customary leve"e. The Governor of the place
asked my permission to enter my luxuriously furnished apartments,

to show me an amusing set of irons that had been discovered in one
of the cells used during the last two hundred years for the storage
of fire-wood. The droll things were called the " LittlelEase," and
seemingly, were intended to create merriment. One of the officers
was complacent enough to assume them, and caused great diversion
by his eccentric gestures. My len'e was not quite so successful, as
is generally the case, as that tedious old gossip, Guido Faux, obtained
admission. As usual he had a grievance. It appears that a report
has got abroad that he was executed in the days of our late lamented
Monarch, James the First of Great Britain, and Sixth of Scotland.
Says Guido, "If this be believed by the multitude there will be a
demand for my expulsion, and what shall I do if I be turned out?"
Condoled with him, and escaped his importunities by joining with
Master John Sheppard, and Squire Turpin in a game of Lome
Ten Hys," a recreation recently introduced by my good neighbour
Monsieur Claude du Val. Failed in making a goal, and put out
thereat. However, regained my usual flow of spirits on receiving
a polite request from the Governor to join him and his good Dame
in a visit to the Tower of London, to call upon Lady Jane Grey—
once Queen—and now a guest in that admirable institution. Was
graciously received by Her Ladyship, who is now of advanced age.
Her Ladyship was vastly amused at the news that had reached her
that some chroniclers do insist that the has lost her head. "I have
in good sooth lost my teeth," laughed the venerable gentlewoman;
"but my head is as firmly set upon my shoulders as ever. I do verily
believe that it must be some mad piece of waggery of that Prince of
good fellows, Sir Walter Raleigh. The aged Knight is always up
to some of his nonsense!" After playing a game of quoits with Lord
Balmarino and the Tower Headsman (whose office is a well-paid
sinecure), I returned to Newgate, greatly pleased with my morning's
promenade. In the afternoon, entertained the Governor at dinner,
who declared that he oould never get so good a meal in his own
quarters. "Strap me, no!" I exclaimed; "and, were it not that
our food was excellent, who would stay at Newgate?" For I confess
that, although there are pleasure-gardens, and every sort of amuse-
ment and comfort, Newgate, at times, is decidedly damp. Then I
raised a glass of punch to my lips, and wished him the same luck
that I myself enjoyed. "And that I had!" quoth he. "Would I
were prisoner instead of Governor. But it would not be meet. I am
not a man of sufficient quality!" And now I must bring this entry
to a conclusion, for there is to be a theatrical performance in the
dining-hall. Little David Garbick is to play the prinoipal male
oharaoter, while Mistress Nellie Gwyne, Mistress Sidd-ins, and
Mistress Peg Woffington, are also in the cast. The title of the
piece is Hamlet, and I am told it is written by a young man new to

Town. The name of the author is either Shakspeare or Smith.
I am not sure which, but think Smith.
• •••••
P.S.— Open my Diary onoe again. Hamlet a poor piece. It is |
now said that it was written T>y Bacon or Buchanan. Of the
former I know nothing, and posterity must discover the identity of
the latter. For the rest, if again I am pressed to go to the Play—
strap me! but, comfortable as I am, I will pack up my traps, and
be off from Newgate—for ever!
THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.
{Before Mr. Commissioner Punch.)
A Shareholder in a Gat Company introduced.
The Commissioner (sharply). Well, Sir, what is it?
Shareholder. I have oome to complain about the Gas Com-
panies
The Com. I am not- surprised. They are generally causing some
one or other trouble.
Shareh. No. I beg your pardon, Sir, but you misunderstand me.
I am interested in the prosperity
of Gas Companies
The Com. Then I pity you,
for they are oertain. sooner or
later, to be superseded by the
Electric Light.
Shareh. Will you allow me
to continue? I am annoyed
that some one has been com-
plaining in |the Times that " A
Chief of a Rental Department"
(invariably a person of tho
highest respectability) has a
right to the title 'of an arbi-
trary cove!"
The Com. No doubt someone
(who showed his wisdom in ap-
pealing to so powerful a tri-
bunal) gave his reasons?
Shareh. Well, yes; he_cer-
tainly had been served with a
demand to pay £1 4j. Wd. within three days, to " prevent the'neces-
sity" of the gas supply to his premises being discontinued at a time
when he and his family were out of Town, and his house was closed
for the reoess.
The Com. Primd facie, that seems a Btrong order! And I suppose
the complainant wrote to the Gas Company, and got no redress r
Shareh. Well, yes. But then, you see, this demand for payment
within three days may have been a final notice.
The Com. (drily). Seems to have been very final indeed! Was
there anything on the face of the notice to distinguish it from an
ordinary unstamped circular?
Shareh. No, 1 believe not. But, then, possibly, the account had
been submitted to him before.
The Com. How do you know? Speaking from my own experience,
a demand-note is generally left at the house when the master is
away, and the Collector does not take the slightest trouble to collect
the money. He leaves it to chance whether the money is sent or not.
Surely you must know that in your character of a householder?
Shareh. Well, yes; I fancy that the collector does sometimes act
in a very perfunctory manner.
The Com. And that servants frequently are unable to distinguish
between the open circular of a Gas Company asking for the settlement
of an account, and the open circular of a touting coal merchant
asking for custom? And when this happens, both find a home in the
dust-hole. Is not that so?
Shareh. Well, yes—very likely—but the law is
The Com. (sternly). The Law and its name should not be
taken in vain. I have seen on a Gas Company's circular the terrors
of a statute invoked to secure prompt payment of a few shillings 1
After all, the Gas Companies (albeit monopolists) are merely traders,
and the Public are the customers. If a butcher, a baker, or a
candle-stiok maker invariably attempted to secure immediate pay-
ment by reference on the invoioe to the usefulness of the County
Court, it is more than possible that that butcher, that baker, or that
candle-stick maker, would speedily have to retire from business vid
the Bankruptcy column of The London Gazette. Thus Gas Com- 1
panics, who adopt a like unpleasant tone, are regarded as the natural
enemies of the Pnblio generally. You have a grievance—as a share-
holder of one of these Associations—but this is not the place to
obtain redress. If you want to improve your position, keep your
eye upon your employes, and teach them the meaning of that well-
worn phrase, Suaviter in modo, fortiter in re! You may go!
[The Witness then retired, with difficulty repressing a painfui
exhibition of the most acute emotion.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.
Se-w Series.—Important Announcement.
This age has been called an Age of Progress, an Age of Reform,
an Age of Intellect, an Age of Shams; everything in fact except
an Age of Prizes. And yet, it is perhaps as an Age of Prizes that
it is destined to be chiefly remembered. The humble but frantio
solver of Acrostics has had his turn, the correct expounder of the
law of Hard Cases has by this time established a complete code of
etiquette; the doll-dresser, the epigram-maker, the teller of witty
stories, the calculator who can discover by an instinct the number
of letters in a given page of print, all have displayed their ingenuity,
and have been magnificently rewarded by prizes varying in value
from the mere publication of their names, up to a policy of life
insurance, or a completely furnished mansion in Peokham Rye. In
fact, it has been calculated by competent actuaries that taking a
generation at about thirty-three years, and making every reasonable
allowance for errors of postage, stoppage in transitu, fraudulent
bankruptcies and unauthorised conversions, 120 per cent, of all
persons alive in Great Britain and Ireland in any given day of
twenty-four hours, must have received a prize of some sort.
Novelists, however, have not as jet received a prize of any sort, at
least as novelists. The reproach is about to be removed. A prize
of £1000 has been offered for the best novel by the Editor of a news-
paper. The most distinguished writers are, to it is declared, entered
for the Competition, but only the name of the prize-winner is to be
revealed, only the prize-winning novel is to be published. Such at
least has been the assurance given to all the eminent authors by the
Editor in question. But Mr. Punch laughs at other people's
assurances, and by means of powers conferred upon him by himself
for that purpose, he has been able to obtain access to all the novels
hitherto sent in, and will now publish a selection of Prize Novels,
together with the names of their authors, and a few notes of his own,
wherever the text may seem to require them.
In acting thus Mr. Punch feels, in the true spirit of the newest
and the Reviewest of Reviews, that he is conferring a favour on the
authors concerned by allowing them the publicity of these columns.
Sometimes pruning and condensation may be necessary. The opera-
tion will be performed as kindly as circumstances permit. It is
hardly necessary to add that Mr. Punch will give his own prize in
hit own way, and at hit own time, to the author he may deem the
best. And herewith Mr. Punch gives a specimen of—
No. I.—ONE MAN IN A COAT.
{By Abet O. K. Arby, Author of "Stigc Fices," "Cheap Words oj a
Chippy Chappie" etsetterer.)
[Fuefatory Note.—This Novel was carefully wrapped up in some odd
leaves of M ark Twain's Innocents Abroad, and was accompanied by a letter
in which the author declared that the boot was worth £3000, but that " to
save any more blooming trouble," he would be willing to take the prize of
£1000 by return of post, and say no more about it.—Ed.]
Chapter I.
It was all the Slavey what got us into the mess. Have you ever
notioed what a way a Slavey has of snaffling and saying, "Lor, Sir,
oo 'd 'a thought it f " on the slightest provocation. She comes into
your room just as you are about to fill your finest two-handed
meersohaum with Navy-out, and looks at you with a far-away look
in her eyes, and a wisp of hair winding carelessly round the neck of
her print dress. You murmur something in an insinuating way
about that box of Vestas you bought last night from the blind man
who stands outside "The Old King of Prussia" pub round the
corner. Then one of her hairpins drops into the fireplace, and you
rush to pick it up, and she rushes at the same moment, and your
head goes crack against her head, and you see some stars, and a
weary kind of sensation comes over you, and iuat as you feel
inclined to send for the cat's-meat man down the next court to
come and fetch you away to the Dogs' Home, in bounoes your land-
lady, and with two or three "Well, I nevers!" and "There's an
imperent 'ussey, for you!" nearly bursts the patent non-combustible
bootlace you lent her last night to hang the brass locket round her
neck by.
Pottle lays his landlady 'a different, but then Pottle always was
a rum 'un. and nobody knows what old rag-and-bone shop he gets
his landladies from. I always get mine only at the best plaoes, and
advise everybody else to do the same. I mentioned this once to Bill
Moser, who looks after the calico department in the big store in
the High Street, but he only sniffed, and said, "Game, you don't
know every think!" which was rude of him. I might nave given
him one for himself just then, but I didn't. I always was a lamb;
but I made up my mind that next time I go into the ham-and-beef
shop kept by old Mother Moser I '11 say something about "'orses
from Belgium" that the old lady won't like.
Did you ever go into a ham-atid-bsef shopP It's just like this.
L went into Moseb's last week. Just when I got in I tripped over
vox, xorx.

His Reverence. 'Dinner, 7-30. I'll give you a Quarter or an
Hour's Grace I"
His Irreverence. "Then commence at 7'30, and I'll be tbebe
AT 7 45 I"
some ribs of beef lying in the doorway, and before I had time to say
I preferred my beef without any boot-blacking, I fell head-first
against an immense sirloin on the parlour table. Mrs. Moser called
all the men who were loafing around, and all the boys and girls, and
they carved away at the sirloin for five hours without being able to
get my head out. At last an old gentleman, who was having his
dinner there, said he oouldn't bear whiskers served up as a vegetable
with his beef. Then they knew they'd got near my faoe, so they
sent away the Coroner and pulled me out, and when I got home my
coat-tail pockets were full of old ham-bones. The boy did that-
young varmint! I '11 ham-bone him when I catoh him next!
Chapter II.
Let me see, what was I after? Oh, yes, I remember. I w*s
going to tell you about our Slavey and the pretty piokle she got us
into. I'm not sure it wasn't Pottle's fault. 1 said to him, just
as he was wiping his mouth on the back of his hand after his fourth
pint of shandy-gaff, "Pottle, my boy," I said, "you're no end
of a ohap for shouting 'Cash forward!' so that all the girls in the
shop hear you and say to one another, 'My, what a lovely voice
that young Pottle's got!' But you 're not much good at helping
a pal to order a new ooat, nor for the matter of that, in helping him
to try it on." But Pottle only hooked up his nose and looked
scornful. Well, when the coat came home the Slavey brought it up,
and put it on my best three-legged chair, and then flung out of the
room with a toss of her head, as much as to say, "'Ere's extrava-
gance 1" First11 looked at the ooat, and then the coat seemed to
look at me. Then I lifted it up and put it down again, and sent
out for three-ha'porth of gin. Then 1 tackled the blooming thing
again. One arm went in with a ten-horse power shove. Next I
tried the other. After no end of fumbling I found the sleeve. "In
you go!" I said to my arm, and in he went, only it happened to be
the breast-pocket. I jammed, the pooket oreaked, but I jammed
hardest, and in went my fist, and out went the pooket.
Then I sat down, tired and sad, and the lodging-house oat came in
and lapped up the milk for my tea, and Moseb's bull-dog just
looked me up, and went off with the left leg of my trousers, and the
landlady's little boy peeped round the door and oned, "Oh, Mar, the
poor gentleman 'a red in the faoe—I 'ra sure he's on fire 1" Ana the
local fire-brigade was called up, and they pumped on me for ten
minutes, and then wrote "Inextinguishable" in their note-books,
and went home; and all the time I oouldn't move, because my arms
were stuck tight in a ooat two sizes too small for me.

A Briton in the saddle is a picture,
and our pride,
In scarlet or in uniform at least our
lads can ride.
Away, away they go,
With a tally, tally-ho!
With a tally, tally, tally, tally, tally,
tally-ho!
But riding, for our Cavalry, is, after
all, not all.
To lead the field, to leap a fence, to
bravely face a fall,
Are well enough. And first-rate stuff
from the hunting-field may oome,
But something more is wanted when
Bellona beats her drum,
And calls our lads to go,
With a rally, rally-ho! &o.
Good men and rattling horses are not
all that England needs;
She wants sound knowledge in the
men, and training in the steeds.
Scouting and reconnaissance are not
needed for the fox,
Nor " leading in big masses" for the
furious final shocks,
When away the troopers go,
With a rally, rally, ho! &c.
But when a squadron charges on the
real field of war,
Courage and a good seat alone will
not go very far;
Our lads must "know their busi-
ness," and their officers must
"lead."
Not with cross-country dash alone,
but skill and prudent heed,
When away the troopers go,
With a rally, rally, no! &o.
War's field will test the Cavalry, or clad in blue or red;
In all things they must " thorough" be, as well as thorough-bred.
"Heavy" or " light," they '11 have to fight; not suoh mad, head-
long fray,
As marked for fame with pride—and shame—that Balaklava day,
When away our lads did go,
With a rally, rally, ho J &o.
Eh ?" Inefficient," Mr. Bull, "and not prepared for war?"
That judgment, if 'tis near the truth, on patriot souls must jar.
And Mr. Punch (Umpire-in-Chief) to John (Paymaster), cries,
"You '11 have to test the truth of this before the need arise
For our lads away to go,
With a rally, rally-ho!" &o.
And since that Soldier's incomplete for Duty unprepared,
Although he's game to dare the worst that ever Briton dared,
To supplement our trooper's skill in saddle, pluck and dash, [cash!
You must have more manoeuvres, John, and—if needs be,—more
Then away away we '11 go
With a tally rally-ho!
And never be afraid to face the strongest, fiercest foe!
JOURNALISM IN FRANCE. JOURNALISM IN ENGLAND.
(A CONTRAST.)
HAD HE SUCCEEDED!
(A Possible Page in French History (hatprobably will never be torilten.)
The General-President had been established at the Elysee for
some three months, when his aides-de-camp found their labours
considerably increased. At all hours of the day and night they
were called up to receive persons who desired an interview with
their chief and master. As they had received strict orders from
His Highness never to appear in anything but full uniform (cloth
of gold tunics, silver-tissue trousers, and belts and epaulettes of
diamonds) they spent most of their time in changing their costume.
"I am here to Bee anyone and everyone," said His Highness;
"but I look to you, Gentlemen of the Ring, I should say Household,
to see that I am disturbed by only those who have the right of
entrie. And now, houp-ld! You can go."
Thus" dismissed, the unfortunate aides-de-camp could but bow,
and retire in silence. But, though they gave no utterance to their
thoughts, their reflections were of a painful character. They felt
what with five reviews a day, to say nothing of what might be
in the circle (attendances at the Bois, dances at the
Hdtel de Ville, and the like), their entire exhaustion was only a
question of weeks, or even days.
One morning the General-President, weary of interviews, was
about to retire into his salle-d-manger, there to discuss the twenty-
five courses of his simple dtjeuner d la fourchette, when he was
stopped by a person in a garb more remarkable for its eccentricity
than its richness. This person wore a coat with tails a yard long,
enormous boots, "a battered hat, and a red wig. A close observer
would have doubted whether his nose was real or artificial. The
strangely-garbed intruder bowed grotesquely.
"What do you want with me?" asked the General-President,
sharply. "Do you not know I am busy?"
"Not too busy to see me," retorted the unwelcome guest,
up a lively tune upon a banjo which he had concealed about
person while passing the Palace Guard, but which he now produced.
'■ I pray you step with me a measure."
Thu"'
.us courteously invited, His Highness could but comply, and for
some ten minutes host and guest indulged in a breakdown.
"And now, what do you want with me?" asked the General-Pre-
sident when the dance had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
"My reward," was the prompt reply,
"Reward 1" echoed His Highness. "Why, my good friend, I
have refused a Royal Duke, an Imperial Prince, a Powerful Order,
and any number of individuals, who have made a like demand."
"Ah I but they did not do so much for you as I did."
"Well, I don't know," returned the General-President, "but they
parted with their gold pretty freely."
"Gold!" retorted the visitor, contemptuously, "I gave you more
than gold. From me you had notes. Where would you have been
without my songs?" He took off his false nose, and thus enabled the
General-President to recognise the " Pride of the Music Halls!"
"You will find I am not ungrateful," said the Chief of the State,
with difficulty suppressing his emotion.
His Highness was as good as his word. The next night at the
Cafe" dee Ambastadturs there was a novel attraction. An old
favourite was described in the offiches as le Due de Nouveau- Cirque.
The reception that old favourite received in the course of the
evening was fairly, but not too cordial. But enthusiasm and hilarity
reached fever-heat when, on turning his face from them, the
audience discovered that their droll was wearing (in a somewhat
grotesque fashion) the grand cordon of the Legion of Honour on his
back! Then it was felt that France must be safe in the hands of a
man whose sense of the fitness of things rivalled the taste of the pig
whose soul soared above the charm of pearls!

ACT I.—A grand old Castle in the distance, with foreground of

duel P Fight about to commence according to Queensberry rules,
when Master sees portrait. Whose? Lucy's f "No," says Master;
"not to be taken in. I know Lucy's picture; it was done by
Ward." The Keeper explains that this is a portrait, not of the
author of The History of Two Parliaments, and Fleecing Gideon,
but of his daughter Lucy, which has never yet been seen in any
exhibition or loan collection. "Oho," says Master, "then I won't
fight a chap who has a daughter like that." Ha! Mad bull "heard

the cap of Master.
AN EMPEROR'S WILL.
[The German Emperor is an accomplished Sportsman. He- appears to be
able to bring down his birds at will.—Daily j\msk>*.]
Would you like to be an Emperor, and wear a golden crown,
With fifty different uniforms for every single day;
To make the nations shudder with the semblance of a frown,
And, if Bismabcks should oppose you, just to order them away?
With your actions autocratic,
And your poses so dramatic;
Yours the honour and the glory, while the country pays the bill,
With your Bhouting sempiternal,
And your Grandmamma a Colonel,
And the power—which is best of all—to shoot your birds by will.
Then the joy of gallopading with a helmet and a sword,
While the thunder of your oannons wakes the echoes from afar.
And if, while you 're in Germany, you happen to be bored,
Why, you rush away to Russia, and you call upon the Czar.
With your wordy perorations,
And your peaceful proclamations,
While you grind the nation's manhood in your military mill.
And whenever skies look pleasant
Out you go and shoot a pheasant,
Or as many as you want to, with your double-barrelled will.
You can always flout your father, too—he's dead, but never mind;
He and all who dream as he did are much better in their graves.
And you cross the sea to Osborne, and, if Grandmamma be kind,
You become a British Admiral, and help to role the waves;
With Jack Tars to say "Ay, Ay, Sir I"
To this nautical young Kaiser,
Who is like the waves he sails on, since he never can be still.
Who to every other blessing
Adds the proud one of possessing
A gun-replaoing, bird-destroying, game-bag-filling wilL
ACT IV.—Another splendid scene. Magnificently attired, Hayston
ofBucklaw attempts to raise a laugh. Success. Mrs. MacBouncer
coerces Lucy in white satin to sign the fatal contract that will settle
Master. Ah! that awful laugh—far more tragic than the one
secured by Bucklaw! It is Lucy going mad! 8ho has already
shown signs of incipient insanity by calltng Mr. Howe, otherwise
Bide-the-Bent, a " holy Father,"—much to that excellent comedian's
surprised content. Contract signed. Return of " Master." Henou-
ment must be seen to be appreciated. Here McMerivale bids Sir
"Hats Off ! "—Mr, Edward Crossley, M.P., is to be congratu-
lated on a narrow escape, according to the report in the Times last
week. Dnring service in the Free Church at Brodick, some portion of
the ceiling gave way, Mr. Cbosbley was covered with plasters-better
to be covered with plaster before than after an accident—and " his hat
was cut to pieces." From which it is to be inferred that "hats are
much worn" during Divine service in the Free Church, as in the
Synagogue. And so no fanatic can be admitted who has " a tile off.
How fortunate for Mr. E. Crossley that this ancient custom of ths
Hebrews is still observed in the Free Kirk. Since then Mr. Crossley
has bought a new tile, and is, therefore, perfectly re-covered.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Baron says that he has scarcely been able to get through the
first morning of The Last Days of Palmyra, which story, bo far,
reminds him —it being the fashion just now to mention Cardinal
Newman's works—of the latter's Callista. And apropos of Callista
let me refer my
readers to one of the
best written artioles
on the Cardinal that
I have seen. It is to
be found in Oood
Words for October,
and is by Mr. R. H.
Htjtton. The Baron
is coaching himself
! up for a visit to
the Lyceum to see
Ravenswood, of
which, on all hands,
he hears so much
that is good. What
a delightful soene
where Caleb steals
,. . . the wild-fowl from
EeTiewing. the spit, and the
subsequent one, where Dame Lightbody ouffs the astonished little
bairn's head I "As fresh to me," .protests the Baron, "laughing in
my chair, as I have been doing but a minute ago, as it was when I
read it, the Council and Kirk-session only know how long ago!"
And this farcical soene was considered so "grotesquely^ and ab-
surdly extravagant" by Sir Walteb's contemporary critics (peace
be to their hashes! "Who were they? What were their names? Who
cares f) that the great novelist actually explains how the incident
was founded on one in real life.
Now to my books. Gadzooks, what's here? Another'volume
of Obiter Dicta f By one author this time, for if my memory fails
me not, the previous little book was writ by two scribes. Well,
no matter—or rather lots of matter—and by Augustine Bibbeix,
who represents Obiter and Dicta too. With an unclassioal false
quantity anyone who so chooses to unscholarise himself, can speak
of him as the O'Biter, so sharp and pungent are some of his
remarks. Ah! here is something on' Lamb. For me, quoth the
Baron, Lamb is always in season, serve up the dish with what
trimmings you may, but, if you please, no sauce. Size and 'Bhape
are the only things against friend Obiter. It is not what this
■ort of book ought to be, portable and potable, like_ the craftily
qualified contents of a pocket-flask, refreshing on a tedious journey.
ad Obiter been the size of either The Handy Volume Shakspeare,
or of Messrs. Routledge's Redbacks — both the Baron's prime
favourites—the Baron would have been able to dip into it more
frequently, as he would into that same pocket-flask aforementioned.
Next, please!" Blackik's Modern Cyclopedia. Vol. VII., so
we're getting along,

versation will read and learn up all about Prooyon, Pizemysi, and
Pvrheliometer, Quotelet, Quintal, and Quito, Regulus, Ramazan,
Rheumatism, Rhynehops, Rum-Shrub, and Rupar, Samoyedes, Semi-
quaver, Sabjehanpur, oilket, Sinter, and Size. When it is known
what a gay conversationalist he is,'he may induce some one to put
him up for a cheery Club, where he will be Blaokie-balled. Still, by
studying the Cyclopedia carefully, with a view to being ready with
words for charades and dumb-crambo during the festive Christmas-
tide, he may once again achieve a certain amount of popularity, on
which, as on fresh laurels, he had better retire.
"Next, please!" Blow Stanley Wrote his Darkest Africa. By
I Mr. £. Marston. A most interesting little book, published by
| Sampson Low & Co., illustrated with excellent photographs, and
with a couple of light easy sketches, by, I suppose, the Author,
which makes the Baron regret that he didn't do more of them. "Buy
it," says the Baron. The Baron recommends the perusal of this little
book, if only to understand the full meaning of the old proverbial
expression Going on a wild-goose chase." The author is a wonder-
fully rapid-act traveller. He apparently can "run" round every
principal city in Europe and see everything that's worth seeing in
it in about an hour and a half at most. In this manner, and by
not comprehending a word of the language wherever he is, or at all
events only a very few of the words, he continues to piok up much
curiouB information which probably would be novel to slower coaches
than himself.
Interesting account of Josef Israels in the Magazine of Art;
but his portrait makes him look gigantio, which Josef is in Art, but
Inot in stature. Those who "know not Josef," if any such there be,
will learn much about him, and desire to know more. "Baroness,'
please: blackir s moaern uyewpeata. vol. vii., so
ting along. I '11 just oast my eye over it: one eye, not
the Baron, out of compliment to the Cyclops. This
sals with the letters "P," "R," "S," and any person
says the Baron, "you are right: let Hostesses and all dinner-
givers read 'Some Humours of the Cuisine' in The Woman's
World." The parodies of the style of Mr. Pates, and of a transla-
tion of a Tolstoian Romance in The Cornhiii Magazine, are capital.
In the same number, "Farmhouse Notes" are to The Baron like
the Rule of Three in the ancient rhyme to the youthful student,
—" it puzzles me." It includes a few anecdotes of some Farm'ons
Persons; so perhaps the title is a crypto-punnygraph.
All Etonians should possess The English Illustrated Magazine
(Macmillan's), 1889-90, for the sake of the series of papers and the
pictures of Eton College. There is also an interesting paper on the
Beefsteak Room at the Lyceum by Fbedkbick Hawkins. Delightful
Beefsteak Room! What pleasant little suppers But no matter
—my supper time is past—" Too late, too late, you cannot enter
here," ought to be the warning inscribed over every Club or other
supper-room, addressed chiefly to those who are of the Middle Ages,
as is the mediaeval Baron de Book-Wobms.
FASHIONS IN PHYSIC.
[The President of the Brituh Pharmaceutical Conference lately drew
attention to the prevalence of fashion in medicine.]
A fashion in physic, like fashions in frills:
The doctors at one time are mad upon pills;
And crystalline principles now have their day,
Where alkaloids once held an absolute sway.
The drugs of old times might be good, but it's true,
We discard them in favour of those that are new.
The salts and the senna have vanished, we fear,
As the poet has said, like the snows of last year:
And where is the mixture in boyhood we quaff'd.
That was known by the ominous name of Black Draught t
While Gregory's Powder has gone, we are told,
To the limbo of drugs that are worn out and old.
New fads and new fancies are reigning supreme,
And calomel one day will be but a dream;
While folks have asserted a chemist might toil
Through his shelves, and find out he had no castor oil;
While as to Infusions, they've long taken wings,
And they'd think you quite mad for prescribing such things.
The fashion to-day is a tincture so strong,
That, if dosing yourself, you are sure to go wrong.
What men learnt in the past they say brings them no pelf,
And the well-tried old remedies rest on the shelf.
But the patient may haply exclaim, "Don't be rash,
Lest your new-fangled physic should settle.my hash!"
"Twinkle. Twinkle, Little Stab.!"—Professor JohnTtndall
wrote to T. W. Russell last week commencing:—"Here, in the
Alps, at the height of more than 7,000 feet above the sea, have I
read your letter to the Times on 'the War in Tipperary.'" Prodigious!
"7,000 feet" up in the air. "How's that for highP" as the
Americans say. How misty his views must be in this olondland—
and that the Professor's writing should be above the heads of the
people, goes without saying.
Female Athleticism.—If Ladies go in for "the gloves," not as
formerly by the coward's blow on the lips
of a Bleeping victim — often uncommonly
wide-awake—thenobleart of self-defence can
be taught under the head of " Millin-ery."

"Change of Ant—Wanted," by a party
much broken up, a new tnne to replaoe the
"Boulanger March.'" If the new tune
cannot be found, we can at least suggest a
change of title for the old one. So. instead
of "En revenant de la Revue," let it be
"En rSvant d la Revue." It should com-
mence brilliantly, then intermediate varia-
. tions, in which sharps and flats would play
a considerable part, and, finally, after a
chromatic scale, down not up, of accidentals, it should finish in the
minor rallentando diminuendo, and end like the oomio overture (whose
we forget—Hatdn'b i), where all the performers sneak off, and the
conductor is left alone in his glory.

The crow's-feet gather in mazes queer
About their oorners most apt to choke
With grime of fuel and fume of smoke.

These are the matters that fill the brain

Only a Man, but away at his back,
In a dozen cars, on the steely traok,
A hundred passengers place their trust
In this fellow of fustian, grease, and dust.

Show at Chiswick) were clusters of grapes with the
scent and taste of strawberries and raspberries, as
grown in Transatlantic hothouses."—Daily Paper.]
I 'ix tell thee everything: I can;
There's little to relate:
I met a simple citizen
Of some " United State."
"Who are you, simple man P" I said,
"And how is it you live 1"'
And his answer seemed quite 'cute from one
So shy and sensitive.
He said, "I make electric cats
That prowl upon the leads,
To prey upon the brutes who raise
Mad music o'er our heads.
I also make all sorts of things
Which much convenience give;
In fact, I'm m inventor spry,
And that is how I live.
"And I am thinking of a plan
For artificial hens,
And automatic dairy-maids.
And self-propelling pens."
"Such things are stale," I made reply,
"They're old, and flat, and thin.
Tell me the last thing in your pate,
Or I will cave it in 1"
His accents mild took up the tale:
He said, "I' ve tried to make
A sirloin out of turnips, and
A vegetable steak."
I shook him well, from side to side,
To stimulate his brain;
"You've got some newer dodge." I cried,
"And that you must explain."
He said, "I always willingly
Bo anything to please.
What do you Bay to growing grapes
That taste like strawberr-ees 1
They 're showing off at Chiswick "now,
As I a sinner am,
Some big black Hamburgs which, when
pressed,
Taste just like raspberry jam."
So now whene'er I drink a glass
Of wine that seems like rum,
Or peel myself an orange that
Reminds me of a plum,
Or if I come across a peach
With flavour like a bilberry,
I weep, for it reminds me so
Of Chiswick's Grape and Dahlia Show,
And that 'cute man I used to know,
Who could at will transform a sloe
Into a thing with the aro-
-ma of all fruits known here below,
From apricot to mulberry.

know. But. without further allusion to the
baker, who has just dropped in accidentally
as he did into the conversation between Mrs.
Bardell and Mrs. Cluppins, when Sam
Weller joined in, and they all "got a talk-
ing," it is enough to make any oyster-
lover's mouth water—no doubt the worthy
Alderman's did water,—did water "like
Wilkin I—to hear that while everybody,
including the worthy Alderman aforesaid, was
paying Is. 6d., and 3s., and even 3s. 6d. for
real Natives, some people were gratifying
their molluscous tastes at the small charge
of One Shilling and Threepence for thirteen,
or were getting six oysters and a half—the
half be demm'd—for sixpence. Long time
is it since we paid Is. 3d. for Real Royal
Natives. They may have left Whitstable at
that price, but they never came to our Wits'
Table at anything like that figure. Still, to
the truly Christian mind it is pleasant, if
not I consoling, to know that some of our
fellow - creatures, not generally so well-
favoured as ourselves, Bhould have been able
to take advantage of the most favoured
Native clause in the Oyster Season of 1889.
.% By the way, in answer to a Corre-
spondent, who signs himself "An Artful
Dbedger, who Wishes to Live out of
Town," we beg to inform him that " Beds"
is not a county specially celebrated for
oysters.

LOST HAIRS-AT-LAW.
"Sequel to a Breach of Promise Case" is the heading
to a paragraph in the Daily Telegraph, recording how
Turner v. Avant was heard before Mr. Commissioner
Kebb, who adjourned the case for three weeks, because, as
Mr. Agabeg, the Counsel for the Plaintiff, observed, with-
out agabegging the question, they couldn't get any infor-
mation essential to the proceedings as to the whereabouts
of the Miss Hairs, who, after failing in her action against
Sir George Elliott, M.P., gave up minding her own busi-
ness, which she sold, and retired to the Continent; and
Plaintiffs also wanted to know the present address of a
oertain, or uncertain, Mr. Holland, somewhile Secretary to
the Avant Company. Odd this. Not find Hairs in Sep-
tember! Cry En Avant!" and let loose the harriers!—a
suggestion that might have been appropriately made by the
Commissioner whose name alone, with respect be it said,
should qualify him for the Chief Magistracy in the Isle of
Dogs. In the meantime the Plaintiffs have three weeks'
adjournment in order to search the maps and find Hollars.
Titled Mowths.—In the list given by the Figaro of those
present at Cardinal Lavigerie's great anti-slavery function
at Saint Sulpice was " un ancien ministre pISnipotentiare le
Baron d'Avril." What a set of new titles this suggests for
any creation of new Pecrs.in England! Duke of December!
Earl of Febbuary! Of course, the nearest title to Baron
s'Avbxl with us is the Earl of Maech. The Marquis of
Mat sounds nice; Lord August, Baron July; and, should
a certain eminent ecclesiastical lawyer ever become a Law
Lord, there will be yet another British cousin to Baron
d'AvRTL and the Earl of March in—Lord Jecne.
No More Law Officers !—" An Automatic Recorder on
the Forth Bridge" was a heading to a paragraph in the
St. James's last Saturday. The announcement must have
startled Sir Thomas Chambebs, Q.C. Heavens! If there
is one Automatio Recorder in the North, why not another
in the South? Automatic Recorders would be followed by
Automatic Common Serjeants, and Isn't it too awful!

RATHtR A LARGE ORDER.
The Berr Pmfessor. '' Ach—best Mirs Rosy, vill you kindly turn me oveb I *'
LOOKING FORWARD.
(Extract from " The Daily Prize-fighter," September 24, 1900.)
Yesterday morning Loo Bonn kit and Ben Mousetrap had an
interview with Mr. Pheasant, the Magistrate presiding in the North-
West London Police Court The approaches to the Court were crowded
from an early hour. Amongst those in the street we noticed Billy
Blowfboth, and Sam Snrezrr, the well-known pot-boys from " The
Glove and Wadding" and "The Tap o'Claret" Hotels, Shiny
Moses, Aaron Isaacs, and Sandy the Sossidge (so-called by his
friends on account of his appearance), the celebrated bankers from
the West-end of Whitechapel, and a large gathering of the elite
of the Lambeth Road. Inside the Court the company was, if pos-
sible, even more select. Mr. Titan Chapel, the proprietor of the
Featherbed Club, was the first to arrive in his private brougham,
and he was followed at short intervals by the Earl of Arbiemobe,
Lord Trimi Gloveson, Mr. Toowith Yew, Mr. Brandic Ohld,
Mr. Splitts Odeb, Mr. Gin cock Tale, and Mr. Angus Tewbeb, with
a heap more of the best known patrons of sport in the Metropolis.
Little time was out to waste in the preliminaries, and it was generally
acknowledged at the end of the day that no prettier set-to had been
witnessed for a long time than that whioh took place at the North-
West London Police Court. We append below some of the more
salient portions of the evidence.
Inspector Chialem. I produce a pair of gloves ordinarily used at
London boxing matches. [Produces them from his waistcoat pocket,
Mr. Pheasant (the Magistrate). Pardon me. I don't quite under-
stand. Were the gloves that you produce to be used at this
particular competition P
Inspector Chizzlem. No, your Worship. These are one ounce
gloves. The gloves with which these men were to.fight are known
as " feather-weight" gloves.
Mr. Pheasant. Ah, I see. Feather-weight, not feather-bed, I
presume. (Loud Laughter, in which both the accused joined.) Have
you the actual gloves with you P
Mr. Titan Chapel (from the Solicitor's table). I have brought
them, Sir. Here dear me, what oan I have done with them P I
thought I had them somewhere about me. (Pats his various pockets.
A thought strikes him. He pulls out his watch.) Ah, of course,
how foolish of me! I generally carry them in my watch-case.
[Opens watch, produces them, and hands them up to Magistrate.
Mr. Pheasant. Dear me!—so these are gloves. I know I am' in-
experienced in these matters, but they look to me rather like elastio
bands. (Boars of laughter. Mr. Pheasant frits them on.) How-
ever, they ■ eem to fit very nicely. Yes, who is the next witness P
The Earl of Arriemore (entering the witness-box). I am, my noble
sportsman.
Mr. Pheasant. Who are you P
The Earl of Arriemore.. Abriemobr's my name, yer Washup,
wioh I'ma bloomin' Lord.
Mr. Pheasant. Of course—of course. Now tell me, have you ever
boxed at all yourself P
The Earl of Arriemore. Never, thwulp me, never! But I like to
Bet the lads on to do a bit of millin' for me.
Mr. Pheasant. Quite so. Very right and proper. What do you
say to the gloves produced by the inspector P
The Earl of Arriemore. Call them gloves P Why, I calls 'em
woolsacks, that's what I calls 'em. [Much laughter.
Mr. Pheasant. No doubt, that would be so. But now with regard
to these other gloves, do you say they would be calculated to deaden
the force of a blow; in fact, to prevent suoh a contest from degene-
rating into a merely brutal exhibition, and to make it, as I under-
stand it ought to be, a contest of pure skill P
The Earl of Arriemore. That's just it. Why, two babbies might
box with them gloves and do themselves no harm. And, as to skill,
why it wants a lot of skill to hit with 'em at all.
[ Winks at Lord Tbimi Gloveson, who winks back.
Mr. Pheasant. Really? That is very interesting, very interesting
indeed! I think perhaps the best plan will be for the two principals
to accompany me into my private room, to give a practical exempli-
fication of the manner in wnich such a contest is generally conducted.
(At this point the learned Magistrate retired from the Bench, and
was followed into his private room by Loo Bobbett. Ben Mouse-
trap, and their Seconds. After an hour's interval, Mr. Pheasant
returned to the Bench alone.) 1 will give my decision at once.
The prize must be handed over to Mr. Mousetbap. That last cross-
counter of his fairly settled Mr. Bobbett. I held the watch myself,
and I know that he lay on the ground stunned for a full minute.
(To the Usher.) Send the Divisional Surgeon into my room at once,
and fetch an ambulance. The Court will now adjourn.
[Loud applause, which was instantly suppressed.
Mr. Pheasant (sternly). This Court is not a Prize-Ring.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE" AT THE AVENUE.
First of all, the title of the pieoo is against it. The Struggle for
Life suggests to the general British Public, unacquainted with the
name of Daudet, a melodrama of the type of Drink, in which a
variety of characters should be engaged in the great struggle for
existence. It is suggestive of strikes, the great struggle between
Labour and Capital, between class and class, between principal and
interest, between those with moral principles and those without
them. It is suggestive of the very climax of melodramatic sensation,
and, being suggestive
of all this to the ma-
jority, the majority
will be disappointed
when it doesn't get
all that this very re-
sponsible title has
led them to expect
Those who know the
Frenoh novel will be
dissatisfied with the
English adaptation
of it, filtered, as it
has been, through a
French dramatic
version of the story.
So muoh for the title.
For the play itself,
as given by Messrs.
Buchakait and Hob-
heb,—the latter of
whom, true to ances-
tral tradition, will
have his finger in
, the pie,—it is but an
AUzander uie Less and the preux Chevalier. ordinary drama
strongly reminding a public which knows its Dickers of the story of
Little Em'ly, with Vaillant for Old Peggotty, Li/die for Little Em'ly,
Antonin Caussade for Ham, and Paul Astier for Steerforth. Per-
haps it would be carrying the resemblance too far to see in Roie
Dartle, with her Bcorn for "that sort of oreature," the germ of
Either de Seliny. Mix this with a situation from Le Monde oit i'on
iennuie, spoilt in the mixing, and there's the drama.
For the acting—it is admirable. Miss Genevieve Wabd is superb
as Madame Paul Aitier, and it is not her fault, but the misfor-
tune of the part; and, while they profess to have adapted it freely,
the mistake of the adapters, that the wife of Paul is a woman old
enongh to be his mother, with whose sufferings, she,—with her
eyes wide open, having married a man of whose worthlessness
she was aware,—it is impossible to feel very much sympathy. She
is old enough to have known better. Mr. George Alexander's
performance of the scoundrel, Paul, leaves little to be desired, but
he must struggle for dear life against his—of course, unconscious—
imitation of Hkxry Ikying. Shut your
eyes to the facts, occasionally, especially in
the death scene, and it is the voice of
Irving; open them, and it is Alexander
agonising. No one can oarefor the fine lady,
statueiquelylimpersonated by Miss Alma
Stanley, who yields as easily to Paul'i
seductive wooing as does Lady Anne to
Richard the Thxrd. After Miss \\ aud and
Mr. Alexander, the best performance is
that of Miss Graves as Little Em'ly Lydie,
and of Mr. Frederick Kerb as Antonin
Ham Cauiiade,—the last-named enlisting
the genuine sympathy of the audienoe for a
character which, in less able hands, might
have bordered on the grotesque. The comio
parts have simply been made bores by the
adapters, and are not suited to the farcical
couple, Miss Kate Phillips and Mr. Albert
Chevalier, who are oast for them. If this
play is to struggle successfully for life, the
weakest, that is, the comio element, should
at once go to the wall, and the fittest alone,
that is, the tragic, should survive. Also, as
the play begins at the convenient hour of
8'45, it should end punctually at eleven.
The only realistic scene is in Paul Aitier'i
room, when he is dressing for dinner, and washes his hands with
real soap, uses real towels, and puts real studs and links into his
shirt, ana then suddenly reminded, as it were, by a titter which
pervades the house, that there are 1 ladies present," he disappears
tor a few seoonds, and returns in his evening-dress trowsers and
nioe olean shirt, looking, exoept for the absenoe of braoes, like a
oertain well - known haberdasher's pictorial advertisement. It is
vastly to the oredit of the management that all the articles of Paul's
toilet, including Soap (!!), are not turned to pecuniary advantage
in the advertisements on the programmes. But isn't it a chance lost
in The Struggle for Life at the Avenue?

The Avenger.
CITY VESTRIES AND CITY BENEFACTIONS.
I have lately had the distinguished honour conferred upon me of
being unanimously elected a Vestryman of the important Parish of
Saint Michael-Shear-the-Hog, which I need hardly say is situate in
the ancient and renowned City of London. I owe my election I believe,
to the undoubted fact that I am what is called—I scarcely know
why—a tooth-and-nail Conservative, no one of anything approach-
ing to Radicalism being ever allowed to enter within the sacred
precincts of our very select Body. Our number is small, but, I am
informed, we represent the very pick of the Parish, and we have
confided to us the somewhat desperate task of defending the funds
confided to us, oenturies ago, from the fierce attack of Commissioners
with almost unlimited powers, but with little or no sympathy with
the sacred wishes of deceased Parishioners.
Our contention is that wherever, from circumstances that our pious
ancestors could not have foreseen, it has become simply impossible
to carry out literally their instructions, the funds should be applied
to strictly analogous purposes. For instance, now in a neighbour-
ing Parish, I am not quite sure whether it is St. Margaret Moses, or
St. Peter the Queer, a considerable sum was bequeathed by a pious
parishioner in the reign of Queen Mabt, of blessed memory, the
income from_ which was to be applied to tie purchasing of faggots
for the burning of heretios, which it was probably considered would
be a considerable saving to the funds of the Parish in question. At
the present time, as we all know, although there are doubtless plenty
of heretics, it has ceased to be the custom to burn them, so the
bequest cannot be applied in accordance with the wishes of the pious
founder. The important question therefore arises, how should the
bequest be applied? Would it be believed that men are to be found,
and men having authority, more \s the pity, who can recommend
its application to the education of the poor, to the providing of con-
valescent hospitals, or even the preservation of open spaces for the
healthful enjoyment of the masses of the Metropolis! Yet such is
the sad fact. My Vestry, I am proud to say, are unanimously of
opinion that, in such a case as I have described, common sense and
common justice would dictate that, as the intentions of the pious
founder cannot be applied to the punishment of vice, it should be
devoted to the reward of virtue, and this would be best accomplished
by expending the fund in question in an annual banquet to those
vestrymen who attended the most assiduously to the arduous duties
of their important offioe. Joseph Gbeeshorn
ANOTHER TERC-ISH ATROCITY.
{By a Sceptical Sufferer.)
[An Austrian physician, Sr. Tsrc, prescribes bee-stings as a cure for

MODERN TYPES.
{By Mr. Punch's own Type Writer.)
No. XX.-THE DIVORCEE.
Thi Court oyer which Sir Jamfs Hannfn presides was instituted
for the purification of morals by the separation of ill-assorted
couples. Matrimonial errors, which had hitherto stood upon the
level of political grievances, capable of redress only after the careful
and unbiassed attention of British legislators had been, at much
expense both of time and money, devoted to tbem, were henceforth to
form the subject of a special procedure in a division of the Courts of
Law created for the purpose, and honestly calculated to bring: sepa-
ration and divorce witbin the reaoh even of the most modest incomes.
The tyrant man, as usual, favoured himself by the rules he laid down
for the playinir of the game. For whereas infidelity on the part of
the wife is held to be, in itself, a sufficient cause for pronouncing
a decree in favour of the husband, a kind, though constantly un-
faithful husband, is protected from divorce, and only punished by
separation from the wife he has wronged. It is necessary for a man
to add either cruelty or desertion to his other < fierce, in order that
his wife may obtain from the laws of her country the opportunity of
marrying someone else. But the wit of woman has proved equal to
the emergency. Nowhere, it may be safely stated, have more tales
of purely imaginative atrocity been lis-
tened to with greater attention, or with
more favourable results, than in the
Divorce Court. On an incautious hand-
shake a sprained wrist and an arm
bruised into all the colours of the rain-
bow have been not infrequently grafted.
A British impreoation, and a banged door,
have often become floods of invective ana
a knock-down blow; and a molehill of a
pinch has, under favourable cultivation,
been developed into a mountain of ill-
treatment, on the top of which a victorious
wife has in the end, triumphantly planted
the banner of freedom.
Hence the Divorce Court, after some
years of suspicion, has gradually come to
be looked upon as one of the sacred insti-
tutions of the country. And, speaking
generally, those who make use of its
facilities, however muoh certain of the
more strait-laced may frown, are con-
sidered by society at large to have done
a thing which is surprisingly right and
often enviable. The result at any rate
is that the number of the divorced
increases year by year, and that a lady
whose failings have been established
against her by a judicial decree, may be
quite sure of a band of ardent sympa-
thisers of both sexes, amongst whom
she can hold her head as high as her inclination prompts her
without exciting a larger number of spiteful comments than are
allotted to her immaculate and undeoreed sisters. She may not
have been able to abide the question of the Counsel who cross-
examined her, but she is certainly free, even in a wider sense
than before. She may not, perhaps, stand on so lofty a social
pinnacle aa the merely-separated lady whose husband still lives,
and to whose male friends the faot that she is practically husband-
less, and at the same time disabled from marriage, gives a delightful
sense both of zest and security. On the other hand, the separated
lady must be to a certain extent circumspect, lest she should place
a weapon for further punishment in the hands of her husband. But
to the Divorcee all things apparently, are permitted.
When she left the Court in which, to use her own words, "all
her budding hopes had been crushed by the triumph of injustice,"
the beautiful Divorcee (for in order to be truly typioal the
Divorcee is necessarily beautiful) might have proceeded immediately
to plant them afresh in tho old soil. The various gentlemen who
had sustained their reputation as men of honour by tampering
on her behalf and on their own, with the strict letter of the
truth, naturally felt that the boldness of their denials entitled
them to her lasting regard, and showed themselves ready to aid
her with their counsel. But, though she never ceased to protest
her innocence of all that had been laid to her charge and proved
against her, she was sufficiently sensible to give them to under-
stand that for a time, at least, her path in the world would be
easier if they ceased to accompany her. Tbey accepted the sentence
of banishment with a good grace, knowing perfectly well that it was
not for long. The Divorcee then withdrew from the flaming placards
of the daily papers, on which she had figured during the past week,
and betook herself to the seclusion of her bijou residence in the heart of
roi, xour.
the most fashionable quarter. Here she pondered for a short time upon
the doubtful unkindness of fate whioh had deprived her of a husband
whom she despised, and of a home whioh his presence had made
insupportable. But she soon roused herself to face her new lank of
responsibility, and to enjoy it. At first she moved cautiously. There
were numerous sympathisers who urged her to defy the world, such aa
it is. and to show herself everywhere entirely careless of what people
might, say. Such oonduot might possibly have been successful, but
the Divorcee foresaw a possible risk to her reputation, and abstained.
She began, therefore, by making her public appearances infrequent.
In company with the devoted widow, whose evidence had almost
saved her from an adverse verdiot, she arranged placid tea-parties
at which the casual observer might have imagined that the rules of
social deoorum were more strictly enforoed than in the household
of an archbishop. Inquiry, however, might have revealed the faot
that a large proportion of the ladies present at these gatherings had
either shaken off the matrimonial shackles, or proposed to do so,
whether as plaintiffs or as defendants, whenever a favourable
opportunity presented itself. The men, too, who were, after a time,
admitted to these staid feasts, were not altogether archiepiscopal,
though they behaved aa they were dressed, quite irreproachably.
To counter-balance them to some extent, the Divorcee determined to
secure the presence and the countenance of a olergyman.
After some search, she discovered one who was enthusiastic,
deficient in worldly knowledge, and sus-
ceptible. To him she related her own
private version of her wrongs, whioh
she seasoned with quite a pretty flow of
tears. The amiable cleric yielded without
a struggle, and readily placed at ber
servioe the protection of his white tie.
Thus strengthened, she moved forward a
little further. She revisited theatres;
she was beard of at Clubs; she shone
again at dinner-parties, and in a year or
so had organised for herself a social oircle
which entirely satisfied her desires.
Sometimes she even allowed herself to
dabble in good works. She was acoused
of having written a religious poem for a
serious Magazine; but all that was ever
proved against her was, that a remark-
able series of articles on The^Homet of the
Poor bore traces of a style that was said
to be hers. Evil tongues still whispered
in corners, and oynios were heard to scoff
occasionally; hut the larger world, which
abhors cynics, and only believes what is
good, began to smile upon her. She did
not appear to value its smiles,—but they
were useful. Whenever London tired
her.'she flitted to Paris, or to the Riviera,
or even to Egypt or Algiers. She sub-
scribed to charities, and acted in Amateur
Theatricals. Finally, she married a
gentleman who was believed by his friends to be a poet, and who
certainly qualified for the title by the romance he had woven about
her. With him she lived for many years a poetic and untrammelled
existenoe, and, when she died, many dowagers sent wreaths as
tokens of their sorrow at the loss of an admirable woman.

VERSES FOR A VIOLINIST.
"The violin has now fairly taken its place as an instrument for girls."
Daily Xewt.
In eld days of Art the painter much applause would surely win,
When he showed us Sunt Cecilia playing on the violin.
I've no skill of brush and palette like those unforgotten men;
My Cecilia must content herself with an unworthy pen.
Fairy fingers flash before me as the bow sweeps o'er each string;
Like the organ's vox humana, Hark! the instrument can sing.
That sonata of Taktini's in my ears will linger long;
It might be some prima donna scaling all the heights of song.
Every string a different language speaks beneath ber skilful sway.
Does the shade of Paoanini hover over her to-day?
All can feel the passion throbbing through the music fraught with
pain:
Then, with feminine mutation, comes a soft and tender strain.
Gracious curve of neok, and fiddle tucked 'neath that entrancing
chin—
Fain with you would I charge plaots, 0 thrice happy violin!

The Champions are mounted, a wonderful pair,
And the boldest who Bees them most e'en hold his breath.
Their breastplates and greaves glitter bright in the air;
They have sworn ere they met they would fight to the death.
And the heart of the Queen of the Tournament sinks
At the might of Sir Golf, the Red Knight of the Links.
But her Champion, Sir Tennis, the Knight of the Lawn,
At the throne of the lady who loves him bows low:
He fears not the fight, for his racket is drawn.
And he spurs his great steed as he charges the foe.
And the sound of his war-cry is heard in the din,
"Fifteen, thirty, forty, deuce, vantage, I win!"
But the Red Knight, Sir Golf, smiles a smile that is grim,
And a flash as of triumph has mantled his cheek;
And he shouts, "I would scorn to be vanquished by him,
With my driver, my iron, my niblick and cleek.
Now, Teiwis, I have thee; I charge from the Tee,
To the deuoe with thy racket, thy scoring, and thee!"
And the ladies all ory, " Oh, Sir Tennis, our own,
Drive him back whence he came to his bunkers and gorse.'
And the men shake their heads, for Sir Tennis seems blown,
There are cracks in his armour, and wounds on his horse.
But the Umpire, Sir Punch, as he watches says, " Pooh t
Let them fight and be friends; there it room fur the tioo."

A LAMB-LIKE GAMBOL.
Some little time ago we noticed with great satisfaction,
that the Committee of the Sunday School Union had
advertised in the Athenceum for the "best Tale on
Gambling," for which they were anxious to pay One
Hundred Pounds sterling. The principal "condition"
that the C. S. 8. U. attached to their competition was that
"the tale must be drawn as far as possible from actual
life, and must vividly depict the evils of gambling,
setting forth its ruinous effects sociably and morally on
the young people of our land." Perhaps the following
short story may serve as a model to the candidates.
This romance must be considered "outside the competi-
tion." Here it is.
PLEASANT POVERTY BETTEB THAN
WICKED WEALTH!
Petes was a good boy. He went to Sunday school
regularly, and always took off his hat to his superiors—
he so objected to gambling that he never called them
"betters." One day Petek found a sovereign, and
fearing, lest it might be a gilded jubilee shilling, decided
to spend it upon himself, rather than run the risk of pos-
sibly causing the Police to put it in circulation, under
the impression that it was a coin of the higher value.
He spent ten shillings on a ticket to Boulogne-sur-Mer,
and with the remaining half-sovereign played at Chemin
de Fer at the Casino. And, alas! this was his first
straying from the path of virtue. Unfortunately he
was most unlucky (from a moral point of view) in his
venture, leaving the tables with a sum exceeding forty
pounds. Feeling reluctant that money so ill-gained
should remain for very long in his possession, he spent
a large slice of it in securing a ticket for Monte
Carlo.
_ Arrived at this dreadful place he backed Zero fifteen
times running, was unhappy enough to break the bank,
and retired to rest with over ten thousand pounds. He
now decided, that he had best return to England,
where he felt sure he would be safe from further
temptation.
When he was onoe more in London, he could not make
up his mind whether he should contribute his greatly
scorned fortune to the Committee of the Sunday School
Union, or plank his last dollar on a rank outsider for a
place in the Derby. From a feeling of delicacy, he
adopted the latter course, and was indescribably shocked
to pull off his fancy at Epsom. Thinking that the Com-
mittee of the same useful body would refuse to receive
money obtained under such painful circumstances, he
plunged deeply on the Stock Exchange, and again
added considerably to his much-hated store. It was at
this period in his history that he married, and then the
punishment he had so justly merited overtook him. His
wife was a pushing young woman, whose great delight
was to see her name in the Society papers. This pleasure
she managed to secure by taking a large house, and
giving costly entertainments to all sorts and conditions
of individuals. Poor Petek soon found this mode of
life intolerably wearisome. He now never knew an
hour's peace, until one day he determined to run away
from home, leaving in the hands of his wife all that he
possessed. His absence made no perceptible difference
fa Mrs. Peter's menage. It was generally supposed that
he was living abroad. However, on one winter night
there was a large gathering at his wife's house, and,
it being very cold, the guests eagerly availed them-
selves of the services of the linkman, who had told
himself off to fetch their carriages.
And, when everyone was gone, the poor linkman asked
the mistress of the house for some broken victuals.
"Good gracious!" exclaimed that Lady, " if it isn't my
hnsband! What do you mean, Peter, by so disgracing
me?"
*' Disgrace you!—not 11" returned Peter. "No one
recognises me. Of all the guests that throng my house,
and eat my suppers, I don't believe there is a solitary
individual who knows me by sight."
And Peter was right. Ah, how much better would it
have been had Peter remained at school, and not found
that sovereign! Had he remained at school, he would
some day have acquired a mass of in formation that would
have been of immense assistance to him when his father
died, and he succeeded to the paternal broom, and the
right of sweep over the family street-crossing!

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Ostrich "Farming."—We are afraid we cannot give you any sound or
useful information to assist you in your project of keeping an ostrich-farm in a
retired street in Bayswater; but that you should have already reoeived a consign-
ment of fifty "fine, full-grown birds," and managed, with the aid of five
railway porters, and all the local police available, to get them from the van in
which they arrived up two flights of stairs, and locate them temporarily in your
back drawing-room, augurs at least for a good start to your undertaking. That
three should have escaped, and, after severely kicking the Vicar, who happened
to be dining with you, terrified the whole neighbourhood, and effected an en-
trance into an adjacent public-house, where they appear to have done a good deal
of damage to the glass and crockery, upsetting a ten-gallon cask of gin, and
frightening the barmaid into a fit of hysterics, being only finally captured by the
devioe of getting a coal-sack over their heads, was, after all, but a slight contre-
temps, and not one to be taken into account when measured against the grand
fact that you have got all your birds safely lodged for the night. A little arnica,
and a fortnight in bed, will, in all probability, set the Vicar all right. With
regard to their food, we should advise you to continue the tinned lobster and
muffins, which they seem to relish. You appear to be alarmed at their swal-
lowing the tins. There is no occasion for any anxiety on this point, the tin,
doubtless, serving as the proverbial " digestive " pebble with which ail birds, we
believe, accompany a hearty meal. We fear we cannot enlighten you as to how
you make your profits out of an ostrich-farm; but, speaking at random, we
should say they would probably arise by pulling the feathers out of the tails of
the birds and selling them to Court Milliners. Yonr idea of trying them in
harness in a Hansom seemB to have something in it. Turn it over, by all means.
Meantime, get a Shilling Handbook on the Management of the Ostrich. We
think you will have to cover in your garden with a tarpaulin as yon suggest.
You cannot expect the fifty birds to stay for ever in your back drawing-room;
and the fact that you mention, of their having already kicked down and eaten
one folding-door, is significant. They will be escaping from your balcony all
over the neighbourhood if you do not take care to secure them; and as they
seem fresh, very aggressive, and strong in the leg, such a catastrophe might lead
you into a good deal of unpleasantness. Take our advice, and get them down-
stairs, tight under a stout tarpaulin, as soon as possible.

HOW IT'S DONE.
A Handbook to Honesty.
No. I.—"I'm Monarch of All I SuRVEr/"
Sam—Interior of newly-erected building. Present, the Builder
and a Surveyor, the former looking timidly foxy, the latter
knowingly pompous, and floridly self-important: Builder, in
dusty suit of dittoes, carries me hand in his breeches-pocket,
where he chinks certain metallic substances—which may be coins
or keys —nervously and intermittently. Surveyor, a burly
mass of broadcloth and big watch-chain, carries an intimidating
note-book, and a menacing pencil, making mems. in a staccato
and stabbing fashion, which is singularly nerve-shaking.
Surveyor (speaking with his pencil in his mouth). Well, Mister—
er—er—er— Wotskbnamb, I—er—think—'m, 'm, 'm—things seem
to be pretty right as far's I oan see; though of course
Builder (hastily). Oh, I assure you I've taken the greatest pains
to conform to—er—rules in—er—in every way; though if there
should be any little thing that ketches your eye, why, you 'ye only
to
Surveyor. Oh, of course, of course! We know all about that.
You see / oan only go by rule. What's right's right; what's

wrong's wrong; that's about the size of it. J've nothing to do
with it, one way or another, exoept to see the law carried out.
Builder. Ex—aok—ly! However, if you've seen all you want
to, we may as well step over to the " Crown and Thistle," and
Surveyor {suddenly). By the way, I suppose this wall is properly
underpinned?
Builder (nervously). Well—er—not eiaokly—but, 'er, 'er—well,
the faot is I thought
Surveyor (sternly). What you thought. Sir, doesn't affect the
matter. The question is, what the Building Act says. The whole
thing must come down!
Builde-. But, I say, that '11 run me into ten pounds, at least, and
really the thing's as safe as
Surveyor. Maybe, maybe—ia fact, I don't say it isn't. But the
Aot says it's got to be done.
Builder. Well, well, if there 'a no help for it, I must do it, of
course.
Surveyor (looking somehow disappointed). Very sorry, of course,
but you see what must be must.
Builder (nailly). Yes, yes, no doubt. Well (brightening), anyhow,
we may as well step over to the "Crown and Thistle," and crack a
bottle of ohampagne.
Surveyor (also brightening). Well, ours is a dusty job, and I don't
care if I do.
[ They do so. Surveyor drinks his full share of Heidsieck, and
smokes a cigar of full site and flavour. He and Builder
builders ("not like you, you know"), who don't do the thing
handsome, often suffer by having to run themselves to ex-
penses that might have been avoided—and serve 'em right
too! Also, how others, without a temper above "tips," and
of a generally gentlemanly tone of mind, save themselves lots
of tttt e extras, which, maybe, the letter of the law would
exact, but which a Surveyor of sense and good feeling can
get over, ''and no harm done, neither, to nobody." As the
wine circulates, it is noticeable that good-fellowship grows
almost boisterous, and facetiousness mellows into chuckling
cynicism of the winking, waggish, "we all do it" sort.
Surveyor (tossing off last glass, and smacking his lips). Well, well,
the best of friends must part, and I guess I must be toddling. Very
glad to have met you, I'm sure, and a better bit of building than
yours yonder I haven't seen for some time. Seems a pity, hanged if
it don't, that you should have to put yourself to suoh an additional
outlay—ah, by the way, what did you say it would cost you f
Builder. Oh. about ten pounds, I suppose.
Surveyor (lighting another cigar). Humph I (Puff! puff!)
Pity—pity! (Puff! puff!) Now look here, my boy—(cor\fidentialiy)
—suppose you and me juBt divide that tenner between us. five to
you, and five to me; and, as to the "underpinning"—well,
nobody '11 be a bit the wiser, and the building won't be a halfpenny
the worse, I'll bet my boots. Come, is it a bargain?
[After a little beating about the bush, the little "job" is arranged
amicably, on the practical basis of " a fiver each, and mum's
the word on both sides," thus evading the law, saving the
Builder a few pounds, and supplementing the salary of the
Surveyor. Ulterior results, unsanitary or otherwise, do not
come within the compass of this sketch.
STRANGER THAN FICTION!
(Postmarks—Leeds, Hull, and Elsewhere.)
Mb. Pctncb: was assisting at a Congress. The large room in whioh
that Congress was being held was crowded, and consequently the
heat was oppressive. The speeches, too, were not particularly
interesting, and the Sage became drowsy. It was fortunate, there-
tore, that a fair maiden in a classical garb (who suddenly appeared
seated beside him) should have addressed him. The interruption
reassembled in their proper home his wandering senses.
"I fear, Mr. Punch." said the fair maiden, looking at herself in
a small mirror whioh she was holding in her right hand, "that you
are inolined to go to sleep."
"Well, I am," replied the Sage, with unaccountable bluntness:
"truth to tell, these orations about nothing in particular, spouted
by persons with an imperfect knowledge of, I should say, almost any
subject, bore me."
"The information is unnecessary," observed the young lady, with
a smile. "I share your feelings. But if you will be so kind as
to pay a little attention to the speakers while they are under my
inn uenoe, I think you will disoover a new interest in their utterances."
"Are you an hypnotist. Madam?" asked Mr. Punch.
"Well, not exactly. But, when I have the chance, I can make
people speak the Truth."
Then Mr. Punch listened, and was surprised at the strange things
that next happened.
"I wish to be perfectly frank with you," said a gentleman on
the platform; "I am here because I wish to see my name in the
pipers, and all the observations I have made up to date have been
addressed to the reporters. I am glad I can control my thoughts,
because I would not for worlds let you know the truth. It is my
ambition to figure as a philanthropist, and on my word, I think this
is the'cheapest and most effective mode of carrying out my
intention."
Then the gentleman resumed his seat with a smile that suggested
that he was under the impression that he had just delivered himself
of sentiments bound to extort universal admiration.
"That is not exactly my oase," observed a second speaker,
"because I do not oare two pins for anything save the entertain-
ments which are invariably associated with scientific research, or
philanthropical inquiry. I pay my guinea, after considerable delay,
and then expeot to take out five times that amount in grudgingly
bestowed, but oompetitionally provoked (if I may be pardoned the
expression) hospitality. I attend a portion—a small portion—of a
leoture, and then hurry off to the nearest free luncheon, or gratuitous
dinner, in the neighbourhood. I should be a tax upon my friends
if I dropped in at half-past one, or at a quarter to eight, punctually,
and my motives would be too wisely interpreted to a desire on my
part to reduce the sum total of my butcher s book. So I merely drop
in upon a place where a Congress is being held, and make the most
of my membership."
"These startling statements are deoidedly unconventional," said
Mr. Punch, turning towards his fair companion, "and that your
influence should cause them to be made, astounds me. I trust you
will not oonsider me indiscreet if I ask for"
"My name and address," returned the fair maiden, smilingly,
completing the sentence; "Learn, then, that I live at the bottom
of a well, to whioh rather damp resting-place I am about to return;
and that in England I am called Truth."
And as the lady disappeared, Mr. Punch fell from his chair, and
awoke I
"Dear me, I have been dreaming!" exolaimed the Sage, as he
left the meeting. "Well, as everyone knows, dreams are not in
the least like reality! But the strangest thing of all was to find
Truth in a Congress!"
And it was strange, indeed.

The Lyceum again. The Haymarkct once more.
"Grkat Scott !" we exclaim,—not Critical Clement of that ilk,
but Sir Waltku,—on again seeing Bavenswood. Since then an
alteration in the modus shootendi has been made, and Edgar no longer
takes a pot-shot at the bull from the window, bnt, ascertaining from
Sir William Aihton Bithop that Ellen Lucy Ttrry is being Terrjfied
by an Irish bull whioh has got

the report of the gun is, like the
Scotch oien, also "heard with -

the scene, having saved Ellen
Lucy Athlon by reducing the
fierce bull to potted beef.
"What shall he have who
kills the bull?" "The Dear!

Ellen Lucy Aihton aforesaid.
After this all goes well. Actin
excellent all round—or nearly all
round, the one exception being,
however, the very much "all-
round" representative of Lady
Aihton, whose misfortune it is to
have been selected for this par-
tic ular part. Scenery lovely, and
again and again must Hawks
McCkaven be congratulated on the beautiful scene of The Mer-
maiden'B Well (never better, in fact), Act III. The love-making bit
in this Act is charming, and the classic Sibyl, Ailiie, superb. Nothing
in stage effect within our memory has equalled the pathos of the final
tableau. It is most touching through its extreme simplicity.
The Haymarket has re-opened with the odd mixture of the excel-
lent French Abbi Conttantm and the weak, muddle-headed, Tree-
and-Grundy-ised " village Priest," known as the Abbi Dubois, or
"Abbi Do Bore," as 'Akhy might call him. Changes are in con-
templation, and may have been already announced. Whatever
they may be. it is some consolation to learn that this Tree-and-
Grundy-ised Frenoh Abbe is not likely to be a " perpetual Curate."

Murra Boko!
There came a sound in the night as of an elephant-herd trumpet-
ing in anger, and my liver was dissolved, and the heart within me
became as a Patoph But'ah under the noon-day sun. I made haste,
for there was fear in the air, Sahib, and the Pleez Mahn that
walketh by night was upon me. But, ob, Sahib, the cunning of
the serpent was with me, and as he passed I tripped him up, and
the raging river received him. Twice he rose, and the gleam of
his eyes spake in vain for help. And at last there eame a bubble
where the man had been, and he was seen no more. Burra Murra
Boko! Burra Murra Boko!
That night I spake unto her as she stood in the moonlight. "Oh,
sister of an oil-jar, and daughter of pig-troughs, what is it thou
hast done r" And she, laughing, spake naught in reply, but gave
me the Tchtke Slahp of her tribe, and her fingers fell upon my face,
and my teeth rattled within my mouth. But I, for my blood was
made hot within me, sped swiftly from her, making no halt, and the
noise of fifty thousand devils was in my ears, and the rage of the
Smak duns burnt fierce within the breast of me, and my tongue was
as a fresh fig that grows upon a southern wall. Auggrh! pass me
the peg, for my mouth is dry. Burra Murra Boko! Burra Murra
Boko! Then came the Yunkum Sahib, and the1 Bunkum Sahib,
and they spake awhile together. But I, like unto a Brerra-bit,
lay low, and my breath came softly, and they knew not that I
watched them as they spake. And they joked muoh together,
and told each to the other how that the wives of their friends
were to them as mice in the sight of the crouching Tabbikat, and
that the honour of a man was as sand, that is blown afar by the
storm-wind of the desert, whioh maketh blind the faithful, and
stoppeth their mouths. Such are all of them, Sahib, since I that
speak unto you know them for what they are, and thus I set forth
the tale that all men may read, and understand. Burra Murra
Boko! Burra Murra Boko!
"'Twas the most ondacint bedivilmint ever I set eyes on, Sorr.

"Pardon me." I said, "this is rather puzzling. A moment baok
you were a Mah ajun of Pali, in Marwur, or a Delhi Pathan, or a
Wali Dad, or something of that sort, and now you seem to have
turned into an Irishman. Can you tell me how it is done?"
"Whist, ye oncivilised, backslidhering pagin!" said my friend,
Private O'Rammis, for it was indeed he. Hould on there till I've
tould ye. Fwhat was I sayin'? Eyah, eyah, them was the bhoys

the belly-band av his new shoot tied round him, there was Porters
and Athtjs lyin' mixed up wid the brandy-kegs, and the houl of the
rigimint tearin' round like all the divils from hell bruk loose.
Thin I knew there'd be thrubble, for ye must know, Sorr, there
was a little orf oer bhoy oryin' as tho' his little heart was breakin',
an' the Colonel's wife's sister, wid her minowderin' voice"
"Look here, O'Rammis," I said, "I don't like to stop you; bnt
isn't it just a trifle rash—I mean," I added hastily, for I saw him
fingering his bayonet, "is it quite as wise as it might be to use up
all your materials at once P Besides, I seem to have met that little
Ort'cer bhoy and the Colonel's wife's sister before. I merely mention
it as a friend."
"You let 'im go, Sir," put in Poetess, with his cockney accent.
"Lor, Sir, Terence knows bloomin' well wot 'e's torkin' about, an'
wen 'e's got a Btory to tell you know there ain't one o' us wot '11
get a bloomin' word in; or leastways, Hi carn't."
"Sitha," added Jock Athtjs. "I never gotten but one story told
mysen, and he joomped down my throaat for that. Let un taalk,
Sir, let un taalk."
Very well," I said, producing one of the half-dozen bottles of
ohampagne that I always carried in my coat-tail pookets whenever
I went up to the Barracks to visit my friend O'Rammis, "very
well. Fire away, Terence, and let us have your story."
"I'm an ould fool." continued O'Rammis, in a convinced tone.
"But ye know, Jock, how 'twas. I misremember fwhat I said to her,
but she never stirred, and only luked at me wid her melancolionB
ois, and wid that my arm was round her waist, for bedad, it was
pretty, she was under the moon in the ould barrick square. 'Hould
on there,' she says, 'ye boiled thief of Deuteronomy. D' ye think
I've kern here to be philandhering afther you. I'd make a better
man than you out av empty kyartridges and putty.' Wid that
she turned on her heel, and was for marching away. But I was at
her Boide agin before she'd got her left fut on the beat. 1 That's
quare,' thinks I to myself; 1 but, Terence, me bhoy, 'tis you
know the thricks av the women. Shoulder arrums,' I thinks, 'and
let fly wid the back sight.' Wid that I just squeezed her hand
wid the most dellikit av all squeezing*, and, sez I, 'Mart, me
darlint,' I sez, 'ye 're not vexed wid Terence, I know;' but you
never can tell the way av a woman, for before the words was over
the tongue av me, the bhoys kem raging an' ramehackling"
"Really, O'Rammis," 1 ventured to observe, for I noticed that
he and his two friends had pulled all the other five bottles out of my
pocket, and had finished them, " I'm a little disappointed with you
to-day. I came out here for a little quiet blood-and-thunder before
f;oing to bed, and you are mixing up your stories like the regimental
aundress's soapsuds. It's not right of you. Now, honestly,
is it?"
But the Three Musketeers had vanished. Perhaps they may re-
appear, bound in blue-grey on the railway bookstalls. Perhaps not.
And the worst of it is, that the Colonel will never understand them,
and the gentlemen who write articles will never understand them.
There is only one man who knows all about them, and even he is
sometimes what my friend O'Rammis calls "a blandandhering,
philandhering, misundherstandbering civilian man."
Which his name is Kippierd Herrino. And that is perfectly true.

Statistics are sweet things, and full of
startling surprises. Like the Frenchman in
"Killaloe," "you never know what they'll
be up to next." Here, for instance, is a
"statement showing the decrease in price in
the United States of many articles within
the past ten years largely consumed by the
agricultural community." And among these
"many articles" "largely consumed," are
"mowing machines, barb fence-wire, horse-
shoes, forks, wire-oloth, slop-buckets, wheel-
barrows, and putty." No wonder dyspepsia
is the national disease in America. Fancy
"consuming" French staples, pie-plates
(though the;/ sound almost edible), and
putty! 1! The ostrich is supposed to be
capable of digesting such dainties as broken
bottles, and tenpenny nails, but that vora-
cious fowl is evidently not "in it" with the
"Agricultural oommunity " of America.

Ceremony rather funereal, at my Inn—but not the same at all Inns. About
twenty of us summoned one by one to the High Table; several go up before
me, and as there is a big screen I oan't Bee what happens to them. Only—
most remarkable circumstance this—not one of them comes back! Have the
Benchers decided to sternly limit the numbers of the Profession P Perhaps
they are " putting in an execution." Just thinking of escape, when my name
called out. March up to Table, determined not to perish without a spirited
resistanoe.
To complete the idea of its being an Execution, here is the Chaplain! Will
he say a "few last words" to the culprit—myself—prior to my being pinioned?
As matter of fact, Bencher at head of Table (portly old gentleman, who looks
as if he might be described as a " bottle-a-day-ol-port-ly " old gentleman) shakes
hands, coldly, and that's all. Not even a Queen's Shilling given me, as I am
conducted off to another table close by.
Mystery of disappearance of other candidates explained. Here they are—
all at .this table—"all silent, and all called"! It seems that this is the
Barristers' part of the Hall, other the Students'.
Ceremony not over yet. After dinner we are invited, all twenty, to dessert
and wine with the Benchers—or rather, at the Benchers' expense, because we
don't really see and chat with these great men, only a Bingle representative,
who presides at table in a long bare room downstairs, resembling a cellar.
Benchers' own Common-room above. Why don't they invite us up there?
Bencher, who has come down to preside over this entertainment, has a rather
forbidding air about him. Seems to be thinking—" I don't oare much for this
sort of function. Stupid old custom. But must keep it up, I suppose, for good
of Inn; and Benchers (hang them I) have deputed me to take head of the table
to-night—probably because I look so desperately lively."
There is a sort of "disinterred liveliness" (to quote Bishop Wilbkkfobce)
about him, after all. Tries to joke. No doubt regards us
all as a pack of fools to join over-crowded profession—
still, as we are here, he will try and forget that, in a few
years, the majority of us will probably be starving.
After an interval. Bored Bencher thinks it necessary
to rise and make little speech. Assures us (Query—
hyproorisy P) that we are all extremely likely to attain
to nigh positions at the Bar. Says something feebly
humorous about Woolsack. Bad taste, because we oan't
all sit on Woolsack at once; and mention of it excites
feelings of emulation, almost of animosity, towards other
new-fledged Barristers. I am conseious, for instance, of
distinct repulsion towards man on my right, who is
cracking nuts, and who must be a son or nephew of our
Chairman, judging by the familiarity with which he
treats latter. Probably his uncle will flood him with
briefs—and that will be called "making his own way
in the world." Pshaw 1
Wine-and-dessert entertainment only lasts an hour.
Forbidding Bencher evidently feels that an hour is as
much as he can possibly stand. So we all depart, except
the favoured nephew (or son), who, as I suspect,
1' remains to prey" on his uncle (or father), and pro-
bably to be invited in to the real feast which no doubt
the Inn worthies are enjoying upstairs.
Next morning meet a legal mend, who asks, "When
are you to be presented at Court f"
"Presented at CourtP"—I ask in surprise.
"Yes-Court of Queen's Bench—ha! ha! You'll
have to go one of these days in wig and gown to the
Q. B. D., and inscribe your name in a big book, and
bow to the Judges, and come out."
"What's the good of doing that P" I want to know.
"None whatever. An old custom,'that's all. A sort
of legal fiction, you know." (Query—If a Queen's
Counsel writes a novel, isn't that a real legal fiction ?)
"You'll feel rather like a little boy going to a new
school. Judges look at you with an air of I say, you
new feller, what's your name? Where do you come
from? What House are you in?—then a good kick.
They can't kick you, so they glare at you instead.
Interesting oeremony. Ta, ta!"
It turns out as my friend says. But previously there
is the other little formality of purchasing the trailing
garments of the Profession. Go to a wig-and-gown-
maker near the Law Courts. Ask to Bee different kinds
of wigs.
"We only make one kind," replies the wig-man,
pityingly. ''The Patent Ventilating Antioalvitium.
You'll find it as light as a feather, almost. Made of
superfine 'orse-'air." He says this as if he never got
his material from anything below the value of a Derby
Winner.
"Why do you call it the Antioalvitium?" I ask.
"Because it don't make the 'air fall off, Sir, as all
other wigs do."
Do they? Another objection to the profession. Wish
I had known this before I began to grind for the Bar
Exam. Wig-man measures my head.
"Bather large size, Sir," he remarks. Says it as if
I must have water on the brain at the very least.
"Middle Temple. I suppose?"—he queries. Why?
Somehow it would sound more flattering if he had
supposed Inner Temple, instead of Middle. _ Wonder if
I shall ever be described as an " Outer barrister, of the
Inner Temple, with Middling abilities." Is there a
special cut of face belonging to the Inner Temple,
another for the Middle (there is a "middle cut" in
salmon, why not in the law ?) and a third for Lincoln's Inn?
Find, while I am meditating these problems, that I
have been " suited" with a gown, also with a stock of
ridiculous little linen flaps, which are called "bands."
Think about "forbidding the bands," but don't know
how to.
MOTS FOB THE KKW UNIONISM.
"Union is Strength." Let lovers of communion
Remember Strength (of language) is not Union!
New DsytNTrioif of a "Fkathbb-Bed Fiqhtek."—
A Boxer with gloves over four ounces in weight. And
anything over that, we suppose, must be considered a
"feather-weight." This gives a new significance to the
saying, "You might have knocked me down with a
feather."

Mr. Ttms hired a Mount with the Staghoends, bdt quickly came to the ookclubion that it was a brutal shame to chase
the poor Deer up and down those hobbible Banks.
A TALE OF THE TELEPHONE.
(A Story of what may happen some day in George Street, Hanover Square.)
These were a few minutes unoccupied before the time appointed
for the ceremony, and so the Pew-opener thought he could not do
better than point oat the many excellences of the church to the
Bridegroom.
# " You see, 8ir," he said, "our pulpit is oooupied by the best pos-
sible talent. The Vicar takes the greatest interest in securing every
rising preacher, and thus, Sunday after Sunday, we have the most
startling orations."
_ The Bridegroom (slightly bored) said that if he had happened to
lire in the neighbourhood, he should certainly have taken sittings.
"But living in the neighbourhood is not necessary, Sir," persisted
the Pew-opener. "Let into the sounding-board is a telephone, and
bo our Vicar can supply the sermons preached here, hot and hot, to
residents in the London Postal District. Considering the quality of
the discourses, he charges a very low rate. The system nas been
largely adopted. As a matter of fact the whole service, and not
only the pulpit, has been laid on to the principal Hotels ana Clubs."
But further conversation was here cut short by the arrival of the
Bride, who, led by her brother, advanced towards the altar with an
air of confidence that charmed all beholders. This self-possession
was the outcome of the lady being—as her grey moire-antique indi-
cated—a widow. Congratulations passed round amongst the friends
and relatives, and then the bridal party was arranged in front of the
good old Vioar.
"Have you switched us on ?" said he to the Clerk.
"Yes, Sir," was the reply. "We are now in communication with
all the principal Hotels and Clubs."
"That's right. I am always anxious that my clients shall have
their full money's-worth." And then the Vicar read with much
emphasis the exhortation to the public to declare any "just cause or
impediment" to the marriage. Naturally there was no response,
and an opening hymn was sung by the choir, which, containing some
half- dozpn verses, lasted quite a quarter of an hour. At its conclu-
sion the Vioar, who had allowed his attention to become distracted,
instead of going on with the service, again read the exhortation.
He once more gave the names of " Harey Smith, baohelor," and
"Amy Jones, widow."
"If anyone knows any just cause or impediment," he continued.
"Stop; I do!" interrupted a gentleman in a dressing-gown, who
had hurriedly entered the Church. "I heard you about a quarter
of an hour ago, while I was breakfasting at the Shaftesbury Avenue
Hotel, ask the same question, and came here without changing my
coat. Very sorry to interrupt the ceremony, but this lady is my
'We
wife 1 Well, Amy, how are you?"
"What, Joey! "exclaimed the (now) ex-Bride, delightedly.
are glad to see you! We thought you were dead!"
Then the gentleman in the dressing-gown was heartily greeted on
all sides. He seemed to be a very popular personage.
"But where do I come in!*" asked Mr. Bbown, the ex-Bride-
groom, who bad, during this scene, shown signs of embarrassment.
"0 Joet, I quite forgot to introduce you to Habby," said the
ex-Bride. "You must know one another. I was going to marry
him when you, darling, turned up just in the nick of time, like a
dear good old boy!"
"Delighted to make your acquaintance, Sir," said Mr. Jones,
shaking Mr. Brown warmlv by the hand. "And now I must go
back to finish my breakfast!"
"Yes, with me," said the ex-Bride. "You must sit, darling, in
the seat intended for poor Harry. I know you won't mind, Habry
(or, perhaps, I ought to call you Mr. Bbown now ?), as 1 have to
much to say to dear Joey. And you can have your breakfast at a
side-table—now won't you, just to please me P You always are to
kind and considerate!"
And, as the wedding-party left the Church, the Clerk hastily
unswitohed the electric communication.
"Be quiet, Sir!" he whispered, sternly, to Mr. Bbown, who had
been talking to himself. "If our clients heard you, we should be
ruined 1 We guarantee that our telephonic supply shall be perfectly
free from bad language!"
Pbophet and Lobe.—Good Mussulmen, so it is said, object to a
play entitled Mahomet being produced in London. The objection
was successful in Paris. London Managers (except, perhaps, Sheriff
Drubiolanue, who revived Le Prophet* this season) will be on the
side of the objectors, as they would rather have to do with a genuine
profit than a fictitious one. Perhaps the non-production of Mahomet
may be a loss to Literature and the Drama.

Ye maidens, so cheerful and gay,
Whose words ever fulsomely fall,
Oh, pity your friend, who to-day
Has become a Society's thrall.
Allow me to muse and to sigh,
Nor talk of the change that ye find;
None once was more happy than I;
But, alas! I've left Gushing behind I
Now I know what it is to have strove *
With the tortures of verbal desire.
I must me measured terms, where I love,
And be moderate, when I admire.|
No slang must my diotion adorn,
I must never say " awfully swell."
Alas! I feel flat and forlorn,
I have bidden Girl-Gushing farewell I
Since I put down my name in that book
I have never called bonnets " divine,"
For our 8eo. with a soul-shaking look,
Would be down on your friend with a fine.

Though dearly they pleased me of yore;

A REALLY VALUABLE SUGGESTION.
[To the Editor of Punch.)
Dear Sir,—As the conductor of the recog-
nised organ of the legal profession, 1 have
the honour to address you. My learned and
accomplished friend, Mr. Montagu Wil-
liams, (l.C, complained the other day that
there was a right of appeal from the Police
Court to the Benoh of Middlesex Magistrates.
He said that his colleagues were barristers,
and gentlemen of considerable eminence, and
in those characters were better able to deoide
upon the merits of a case than the persons who
compose the Tribunal to which appeal from
their decision is permissible. I have not re-
cently looked through the list of Metropolitan
Police Magistrates, but. if they have been
chosen from the ranks of literature and law,
as they were thirty years ago, I oan well un-
derstand that they are an exceedingly capable
body of men. That so accomplished a littira-
teur and admirable an advocate as my friend
Mr. Montagu Williams himself should have
been raised to the Magisterial benoh, is a
proof that the standard has been maintained.
But, Sir, can nothing be done.for the other
tribunal?
Would it not be possible to appoint a
certain proportion of stipendiaries, with ample
salaries, to that body? What is wanted are
men with a perfect knowledge of the law,
and a large experience of the adversities as
well as the pleasures of life. If they occa-
sionally dabble in literature, so mach the
better. Bat, it may be said, where are such
men to be found? I answer, in very many
places, and, to encourage the authorities in
their search, shall be most happy to personally
head the list. Youn, very faithfully,
(Signed) A. Briefless, Juniob.

A Handbook to Honesty.
No. II.—The Straight "Tip."
Scene—Sanctum of " Large Wholesale Mouse." Present, one of
the Principals, a pompous personage, with imposing toatch-chain,
and abundant space for it to meander over, and a sleekly sub-
servient "Head of Department." Principal looks irritated,
Head of Department apprehensive, the former angrily shuffling
some papers, the latter nervously "washing his hands with
invisible soap, in imperceptible water."
Principal. Well, Mr.—er—er—Sckoop, we—er—my partners and
self, are not quite satisfied with the way in which things are going
in—er—in your department.
Head of Department. Indeed, Sir. Sorry to hear that, Sir. May
I ask, Sir, in—er—in what particular I have—er—failed to give com-
plete satisfac-
tion. {Aside.)
On the screw
again, the old
skinflint — I
know him.
Principal,
Well, in point
of fact, the
profits on your
branch nave
lately been
very — have
seemed—er—
have been by
no means—
what we could
wish, Mr.
Scroop, what
we could wish,
Sir.
H of D.
Really, Sir, I
—ah, am grieved to hear it, for, upon my word, I hardly know
Principal {abruptly). There must be cutting down somewhere—I
■ay somewhere, Mr. Scroop—where, I must leave to you. By the
way, it seems to me that Puddicombe's prices are a bit high for a
beginner in the trade as he is. I think his ," lines " ought to run a
little lower—eh?
H. of D. Well, Sir, I've suggested it to him myself, but he pro-
tested there was hardly a margin left. However, since you name it,
Sir, I '11 see what I can do with him. {Aside.) Ruthless old grinder,
that's his game, is it? Wants a few extra" pounds to play with,
and means squeezing them out of Pcddicombe. Poor Pcddicombe,
I've already put the screw on him pretty tightly. However, I must
give it another turn, 1 suppose.
Scene II.—Head of Department and Pcddicombe, a hard-working,
struggling manufacturer, who has schemed and screwed for
years to keep in with the Big House.
Puddirombe Upon my word, Mr. Scboop, I can't—I really oan't,
knock off another quarter per cent. It's a tight fight already, and I
can't do it.

Plenty who will, you know.
Puddicombe. Really, Mr. Scroop, I don't see how they oan
H. of D. {rudely). That's their business. I only know they will,
and jump at it.
Puddicombe {hesitatingly). But—er—I thought, when I made that
little arrangement with you, a year ago, about the trilling bonus to
you, you know, I thought you as good as promised
H. of D. {severely). Mr. Pcddicombe, you surprise me. I am
here, 8ir, to do the hest I oan for the Firm—and / shall do it. If
somebody else's prices are better than yours, somebody else gets the
line, that's all. Good day, Mr. Pcddicombe. {Aside.) Confound
his impudence!—he shan't have another order if I can help it!
Trifling bonus, indeed! One thing, he daren't split—so /'m safe.
{Exit Pcddicombe, despondently. Enter, presently, a hopeful-
looking person, with a sample-bag.
H. of D. {cheerily). Ah, Mr. Pincher, how do—how do? Haven't
■een you for an age.
Mr. Pincher. Good day, Mr. Scroop. I heard you wanted to see
me, and, as I've a very cheap line in your way, I thought, as I was
passing, I'd venture to look in.
H. of D. Quite right, Pincher. What '• the figure, my boy f
Pincher (slily). A shade lower than the lowest you've been giving.
Is that good enough?
H. of D. Well—ahem!—yes—of course, if the quality is right.
Pincher. 0. K., I assure yon, Sir I
H. of D. Well, we 're quoted as low as forty-five, li you oan
beat that, I think I can place the order with you.
Pincher {aside). Liar I Even poor Pcddicombe wouldn't go under
fifty. However, here goes! {Aloud.) Will five off meet your views?
H. of D. Say seven and a half, and I'm on.
Pincher. Done with you, Sir. {Aside.) With what he '11 want
for himself, there's " nothing in it! "—this time.
H. of D. Well—subject, of course, to our Principal's approval,
I think I may say the line is yours, Pincher. (Aside.) Don't know
how the doose he does it! Well, that's none o' my business. Won't
old Skinflint be pleased? Must try and spring him for a holiday,
on the strength of it.
Pincher. Thanks—many thanks. (Books it.) Hope we shall do
more business together,—to our mutual advantage. By the way,
Mr. Scroop—(in a low voice)—if there is any little thing I can put in
your way, you know, I, er—er!
H. of D. Oh, don't mention it, Pincher. Give me a look up on
Tuesday evening, at home. You know my little place at Peckham.
My good lady '11 give you a little music.
Pmcher. Ah, I've a good deal of influenoe in that line. Now, if
there's anything Mrs. Scroop might fanoy—I know "perks"are
not in your line, but the ladies, my boy, the ladies!
H. of D. (laughing). You will have your joke, Pincher. Well,
oddly enough, the Missis was only saying last night she wanted a
new piano—one of Broadwood's grands, for ohoioe—and if you

to me. If Mrs. Scroop isn't satisfied by this day week, why—never
give me another line. Ha! ha! Good day, Mr. Scroop I

ROBERTS RETURN TO THE CITY.
I've bin jolly cumferal lately at the Grand Hotel, as ewerybody
in fao seems to be, for they cums in a smilin with hope, and gos
away smilin with satisfacshun, and with the thorow oonwioshun of
soom cumming again, and sum on 'em says to me, says they,
"Oh rewor! Mr. Robert!" and others
says, "Oh Plezzeer! Mr. Robert!" which
both means, as my yung French frend tells
me, "Here s to our nex merry meetirig!"
but that Bounds more like a parting Toast
with a bumper of good old Port to drink it
in, but I dezzay as he's right. But larst
week I receeves a most prumptery order
from the Lord Mark, "to oum baok to the
City, if it were ony for a week." So in
coarse back I cums, and a grand sort of a
week we has all had on it1 I shall fust
begin with a reelar staggerer of a dinner at
the Manshuu House on Munday, given, as
I was told, to all the Horthers and Hartists
of Urope, who had jest bin a holding of a Meeting to let ewerybody
kno as how as they ment for to have their rites in their hone ritings
and picters, or they woodn't rite no more, nor paint no more!
My prefound estonishment may be more heasily described than
oonseeved when I says as they was amost all Forreners of warious
countries! so that when I handed any think werry speshal to sum
on 'em they would shake their heds and say, No mercy!" or
"Nine damker!" as the case mite be.
Well, so much for Monday. On Toosday I spent nearly the hole
day at Gildhall in snrveyin, and criticism, hay, and in one caee,
acshally tasting the wundrus collecshun of all kinds and condishuns
of Frute that the hole Country can perduce, that had been oolleckted
there! I wunders how many of the tens of thousands who came to
Gildhall to see the temting sight, can say the same. But ewery
wise perducer of heatables or drinkables alius tries to captiwate the
good opinyon of a Hed Waiter. The hidear jest ocurs to my mind
to ask at about what part of the next Sentry the County Counsil
will be a dewoting of their time and money to a similar nsefool
purpuss! And hecco answers, Wen! The uniwersal werdiok of
neverybody as was there agreed in saying, that nothink like it in
buty, and wariety, and size, wasn't never seen nowheres before.
And then came the werry natural enquiry, what on airth's a going
to be done with it all? And then came the equally nateral answer.
The Fruiterers' Company is a going to send all the werry best of
it to the Lord Mare?" And then, "Hey, Presto!" as the ounjurer
says, and on Wensday evening there it was on the table at another
Grand Bankwet at the Manshun House, and quite a number of
the Fruiterers' Company a sitting a smiling at the Lord Mare's
horspitable table, and the werry head on 'em all, Sir James White-
head, giving the distingwished oompny sitoh a delightful acount
of what they had bin and gone and done, and was a going to do, as
made ewerybody rejoice to think that we had such a nobel Company
as the Fruiterers' Company, and such a prince of Masters to govern
'em. And I feels bound in honor to say, that the black grapes was
about the werry finest as ewer I ewer tasted. Robert.

TO ENQELBERQ AND BACK.
Being a Few Notes taken en route in Search of a Perfect Cure.
1 don't exactly know how I got mixed up with it, hut I found
myself somehow "fixed," as our American cousins would say, to
join a party who were going to see Old Jephson (the Q.C.), who had
broken "down," or broken up," or had gone through some mental
and physical smashing process or other, that necessitated an imme-
diate recourse to mountain air,—to where he could get it of the right
sort and quality with as little strain or tax on his somewhat shat-
tered nerves as might be compatible with a dash into the heart of
Switzerland at the fag-end of the swarming tourists' season. "Mur-
ren will be too high for him: distinctly too high for him,"
thoughtfully observed the distinguished specialist who had been
called in, and had at once prescribed the "air tonic" in question;
"and the Burgenstock would be too low. His condition requires an
elevation of about 3500 feet. Let me see. Ha! Engelberg is the plaoe
for him. My dear lady," he continued, addressing Mrs. Jephson,
who had already imbibed the theory that every altitude, from Prim-
rose Hill to Mont Blanc, suited its special ailment, the only thing
necessary being to hit on the right one, "My dear lady, get your
good husband to Engelberg at once. Write to Heku Cattani, Hotel
Titlis, Engelberg, Unterwalden, asking what day he can receive you
(use my name), and then, as soon as you can possibly get off, start.
I can promise you it will do wonders for our patient."
So, in about five days, we found ourselves, ajparty of six (including
young Jebbyhan,
who said that, though
he saw no difference
between Lucerne and
Bayswater, except
that Bayswater was a
'' howling site bigger,"
he would come, "if
only for the lark of
seeing the dilapidated
old boy" (his way of
referringto his invalid
Q. C. Uncle) "sho-
velled about the Ber-
nese Oberland like a
seedy Guy Faux,")
crossing the silver
streak on that valued,
steady - going, and
excellently well-found
Channel friend, the
Calais - Douvres. Of
course we made a fresh
friend for life on board
— one always does.
We counted up fifty-
seven fresh friends for
life we had made, one
way and another, on
our way, before we got
home again. This was

a Dr. Melchisidec, who at once yielded his folding-chair to the
Dilapidated One, and, finding himself bound also for Engelberg,
attaohed himself as a sort of General-Director and Personal Con-
ductor to our party. "Had we got our tickets through Cook, and
asked him to secure our places in the train?" he inquired. "We
had." "Ha! then it would be all right." And it was. On our
arriving at Calais, no crush, or excitement, and fighting for places.
We were met by three oourteous, military-looking officials, who
talked four languages between them, and ushered us to our
"reserved" places. Royalty oould not have fared better. "You 're
all right with Cook," observed Dr. Melchisidec. "He's got a
man everywhere; and, if there's any hitch, you've only got to call
him in. A clear case of too many Cooks not spoiling the broth."
And so we found it. I had always hitherto considered Cook's
Exoursionists as rather a comic institution, and 'as something to be
laughed at. Nothing of the sort. "Blessed be Cook I" say I. All
1 know is, that we found his name a perfect tower of strength along
the entire route we traversed.
And now we were whirling along towards Basle in the rather stuffy
splendours provided for us by the Compagnie Internationale des
Wagons Lite, that reminded one, as much as anything of being
fixed into one's allotted place in a sort of gigantic Gladstone Bay—an
illusion assisted, no doubt, by the prominence of a deal of silver-
plated fittings, in the shape of knobs and door-handles, all somewhat
tarnished and dusty. True, the compartment, which gave on to a
corridor running the whole length of the carriage, was provided with
a table, an inkstand, a large pan for cigar-ash, and a colossal
spittoon; but as one had no immediate need of any of these things,

C'est tout, Monsieur?'
and they filled up the already sufficiently limited space, one was
strongly disposed, but for the presenoe of tie military official of the
Wagons Lits who paced the corridor before alluded to, to pitch them
all out of the window then and there. But it was drawing on
towards seven o'olock, and the question of feeding naturally came
to the fore. How was the Dilapidated One to get his meal at
Tergnier, the plaoe where the military official informed us we should
find "an excellent repast, 'ot, and ready, with plenty of time to
dispose of 'im with every facility." waiting for us.
Young Jebbthait suggested the luncheon-basket, which he saw
an American get through the
other day, containing two pork
sandwiches, nine inches long;
half a fowl, a couple of rolls,
three peaches, a bunch of grapes,
a jam-tart, and a bottle of wine;
but Dr. Melchisidec put his
veto on this, and, looking at the
Dilapidated One critically, as if
he was wondering how much he
weighed, if it oame to
him, came in with a
"No! no '. I think we can
manage to get him to the Buffet,"
which settled the matter; and
with the announcement that we
had all of us " vingt-trois minutes
d'arret," we found ourselves
stepping across the growing
dusk of the platform, into the
cheerful and brightly - lighted
Station Restaurant, where a
capital and comfortable meal,
excellently served, was awaiting
us. And, 0 ye shades of Rugby, Swindon, Crewe, Grantham, and
I know not what other British Railway feeding centres, at which I
have been harassed, scalded, and finally hurried away unfed, would
that you could take a lesson from the admirable management, con-
sideration for the digestion of the hungry passengers, and general
all-round thoughtfulness that characterises the taking of that meal
"de voyage" at Tergnier.
To begin with, you have about finished your soup, when a station
official appears at the door and informs all the feeding passengers in
an assuring and encouraging voice that they have " encore dtx-huit
minutes"—as much as to say, " Pray, my dear Monsieur, or Madame,
as the case may be, do not hurry over that capital portion oi boeuf
braise d I'Imperials, but enjoy its full flavour at your perfect leisure.
There is not, pray believe
me, the remotest.occasion for
any excitement or hurry."
A little later on, in your
repast, when you are just,
perhaps, beginning to won-
der whether you oughtn't
to he thinking about return-
ing to the 'train, the good
fairy official again appears
at the door, this time an-
nouncing that you have
"encore douze minutes" in
the same encouraging tones,
that seem to say, "Now, I
beg you will quite finish that
excellent 'poulet' and '»a-
lade.' Believe me, you have
ample time. Trust to me. I
charge myself with the re-
sponsibility of seeing that
you catch your train oalmly
and comfortably ;" which he
certainly does, looking in
again as Madame comes
round, and you pay her her
modest demand of three
francs fifty for her excel-
lently - cooked and well -
served repast [vin compris),
with the final announcement
of, "Maintenant en voilure,

with three minutes to spare before the departure of the train.
But perhaps the best testimony to the excellence of the manage-
ment may be found in the faot that the Dilapidated One was not only
got out, but well fed, and put back in his plaoe, with a.whole minute

to spare, without any excitement, or more than the usual expendi-
ture of nerve-force required for the undertaking.
"I will, when Monsieur desires it, make up the bed for 'im," volun-
teers the military officer, towards eleven o'olook; and, as there isn't
muoh going: on, we say, "All right—we'11 have it now," and we
disport ourselves in the corridor, while he works a sort of transfor-
mation in our Gladstone Bag compartment, which seems greatly to
diminish its "containing" capacity. Indeed, if it were not for the
floor, the ceiling, and the walls, one would hardly know where to
stow one's packages. Le train de Luxe I know has come in, of late,
for some abuse, and some grumblers have made a dead set at it. I
don't know what their experience of a lit de luxe may have been,
but, if it was anything like mine, they must have experienced a
general feeling of wanting about a foot more room every way,
coupled with a strong and morbid inclination to kick off roof, sides,
back, and, in fact, everything, so as, somehow, to secure it.
However, the night passed, the unceasing rattle of the train being
occasionally changed tor the momentary dead stillness, when it
stopped, as it did now and then, at some small place on the way, for
apparently no better reason than that of pulling the station-master
out of bea to report it. Practically I was undisturbed, except at, I
think, a place called Delle, where, in the very small hours of the
morning, a gentleman opened the door of my bedroom de Luxe, and
asked me in a voioe, in which melancholy and sleep seemed to be
struggling for the mastery, whether " I had any declaration I wished
to make to the Swiss Douanes," and on my assuring .him that I had
"none whatever," he sadly and silently withdrew.
Nothing further till Basle, where we lhalted at 6 a.m. for break-
fast and a ohange of trains, and where I was much impressed with
the carrying power of the local porter, whom I met loaded with the
Dilapidated One's effects, apparently surprised that that " was all"
he was expected to take charge ofLucerne in a blaze of stifling heat,
with struggling Yankee and British tourists being turned away from
the doors of all the hotels, eo we were glad to get our telegram from
Herr Cattani announcing that he was able to offer us rooms that he
had "disponible;" and at 3 p.m. we commenced our carriage-drive
to Engelberg. Towards five we quitted the plain and began the
it.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A promising series, so far, is this re-issue by Messrs. Chatto and
Windus of "The Barber's Chair, Etc.," by Douglas Jbrrold;
"Gulliver's Travels, by Dean Swift, Etc.;" and Sheridan's Plays.
"Etc," in both the first-mentioned books, forms a considerable
portion of each volume. "Eto.,"in the first
includes the Hedgehog Letters, which are very
Jerroldian; and in the second it means the
immortal Tale of a Tub, the Battle of the
Books, and a fragment from the Dean's corre-
spondence.
The Baron begs to return thanks for an odd
volume, one of privately printed opuscula of
"The Sette of Odd Volumes," which has been
presented to him by the Author, Mr. Walter
Hamilton, F.R.G.S., and F.R.H.8., who has
the honour of filling the important post of
"Parodist" in the above-mentioned society or
"Sette." This little odd volume epitomises
the Drama of England within the last three
centuries in most interesting fashion, without
- losing a single important point. Why it
> should have fallen to the lot of the " Parodist
to the Sette " to do this, is only explained by
Bound m Boards. the Sette being made up of Odd, very odd,
Volumes. What are their rules? Do they go "odd man out" to decide
who shall pay for the banquet? Must they dine in the daytime,
because, being an odd lot, they cannot sit down to dinner at even-
tide ? _
A list of the Odd members is given in the little book; but who
cares what, or who, the Odds are, as long as they each and all are
happy? 'Tis a pity that, in this multum in parvo of a book, the
author should have spoken disparagingly of Glorious John." It
would be worth while to refer to Macaulay's Dramatists of the
Restoration, and to compare the licence of that age with that of
Shakspeare's time, when a Virgin Queen, and not a Merry
Monarch, was on the throne. And, when we come to Sheridan's
time, how about The Duenna, and The Trip to Scarborough, which
was supposed to be an improvement on the original? However,
puris pura puerisque puellis, as my excellent friend. Miss Maxima
Db Betur observes. But one ought not to look a gift pony in the
mouth any more than one ought to oritioally examine a jest which is
passed off in good company. The jest was not meant to be criticised,
and the pony wasn't given you in order that you might critically
express an opinion on its age. If a pony—a very quiet, steady
grey pony—were presented as a mark of affection and esteem to the

Baron, he most oertainly would not inspeot its mouth, seeing that
he would not be a tooth the wiser for the operation; hut, if the
Baron had a friendly vet. or a hipposcientist at hand, he would
certainly ask him to examine the gift cob before the Baron either
drove or rode him.
Quo tendimus t In Latium? Verily, for the next work at hand
is Mr. Htjtton's Monooraph on Cardinal Newman, whioh, of all the
writings about his Eminenoe that I've lately read, I can (says the
Baron, in one of his more severely sedate moods,) most confidently
recommend to general readers of all denominations, and of all shades
of opinion, whom Mr. Hutton may address as " Friends, Romans,
Countrymen!" That learned Theban, "John Oldcastle," has
written an interesting Biography of "The noblest Roman of them
all," which forms a special number of the Merry England
Magazine.
Margaret Byng, by F. C. Phillips and Fendall, is a clever
sensational story, spun out into two volumes, which can be devoured
by the accomplished novel-swallower in any two hours' train journey,
and can be highly recommended for this particular purpose. It
would have been better, because less expensive and more portable,
had it been in one volume; but the Baron strongly recommends it
for the above space of time in a train, or whenever you've nothing
better to do, which will happen occasionally even to the wisest and
best of us. The secret is very well kept to the end; and an expert in
novel-reading oan do the first volume in three-quarters of an hour,
and the next in half an hour easily, and be none the worse for the
tour de force, as he will have amused and interested himself for the
time being, will forget all about it in an hour or so, and wonder
what it was all about if at any future time the name of the book
should be mentioned in his hearing. It's the sort of book that
ought to be the size of a Tauohnitz edition, in one volume only, and
sold for a couple of shillings.
The facsimile of Dickens's MS. of the Christmas Carol, published
by Messrs. Elliott Stock, is a happy thought for the coming
Christmas, and that Christmas is coming is a matter about which
publishers within the next six weeks will not allow anyone to
entertain the shadow or the ghost of a doubt. What a good subject
for a Christmas story, The Ghost of a Doubt: or, The Shadow of a
Reason !" Methinks," quoth the Baron, "it would be as well to
register these two titles and couple of subjects before anyone seizes
them as his own." Most interesting is this facsimile MS., showing
how Dickens wrote it, corrected it, and polished it up. Though,
that this was the only MS. of this work, the Baron doubts. It may
have been the only complete M8., but where are all the notes, rough
or smooth, of the inspirations as they occurred? Those, the germs
of this Btory or of any story, would be the most interesting of all; that
is, to the confraternity of Authors. There is a pleasant preface,
lively, of course, it should be, as coming from a Kitten who might
have given us a catty-logue of the works of Dickens in his pos-
session

published in that still more pocketable form whioh has made the
Routledgean series of portable-readables so popular with the Baron,
and those who are guided by his advice, the book would be still
better. As it is, it is clever, because the astute novel-reader at onoe
discards the real and only solution of the mystery as far too common-
place, and this solution is the one which Mr. Farjeon has adopted.
It is the expected-unexpected that happens in this case, and the
astute reader is particularly pleased with himself, because he
finishes by saying, *' I knew how it would be, all along."

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Steam-rolling Experiences.
—That you should have en-
deavoured to have turned the
birthday-gift of your eccentric
nephews to account, and made
an offer to the Municipality of
West Bloxham to " set" the High
Street for them by going over it
with the seventeen-ton steam-
roller, with which your youthful
relatives had presented you, was
only a nice and generous im-
pulse on your part; and it is
undeniably a great pity that,
owing to your not fully under-
standing the working of the
machine, you should have torn
away the front of three of the
principal shops, finally going
through the floor of a fourth, and
getting yourself apparently per-
manently embedded in a position
from which you cannot extricate
yourself, in the very centre of the
leading thoroughfare. Your idea
of getting out of the difficulty by
presenting the steam-roller then
and there to the Borough was a
happy one, and it is to be re-
gretted that, under the circum-
stances, they felt no inclination
to accept your offer. Their threat
of further proceedings against you
unless you take immediate steps
to remove your machine, though,
perhaps, to be expected, is cer-
tainly a little unhandsome. Per-
haps your best plan will be to try
and start your Steam-roller as a
"Suburban Omnibus Company,"
as you propose. Certainly secure
that Duke you mention for Chair-
man, and, with one or two good
City names on the Directorate, it
is possible you may be successful
in your efforts to float the affair.

A HERO FIN DE SltCLE."
Podgers (of Sandboys Golf Club). "My dear Miss Robinson, Golf's
tiik only Game nowadays for the Men. Lawn-Tennis is ail
very well for you olrls, you know."
Meantime, sinoe the proprietor of
the premises in which your Steam-
roller has fixed itself refuses to
allow you to try to remove it by
dynamite, leave it where it is.
Put the whole matter into the
hands of a sharp local lawyer,
and go on to the Continent until
it has blown over.
HIGHWAYS AND LOW WAYS.
There is evidently all the dif-
ference in the world between
"The King's Highway "— of song
—and the Kingsland highway—
of fact. Song says all is equal
to—
"High and low on the King's high-
way."
Experience teaches that a sober
citizen traversing the highway
unf avourably known as the Kings-
land Road, is liable to be tripped
up, robbed and thumped sense-
less by organised gangs of Kings-
land roughs. It seems doubtful
whether Neapolitan banditti or
Australian bush-whackers are
much worse than these Cockney
ruffians, these vulgar, vicious and
villanous "Knights of the (Kings-
land) Road." Is it not high time
that the local authorities—and
the local police—looked to this
particular "highway," which
seems so much more like a "by-
way " not to say a " by-word and
a reproaoh" to a city suburb?

THE MODERN MILKMAID'S SONG.
(At the Dairy Show.)
An Extract from the "Complete Angler" of the
Future.
Pucator. Maudlin, I pray you, do in the
courtesy to sing a song concerning your late
visit to London.
Maudlin tings:—
Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove,
That come in competition's field
From reckoning up the Shorthorn's "yield."
To Town we '11 come in modish frocks,
Where swells appraise our herds and flocks,
By days "in profit" great or small,
All in the Agricultural Hall.
Cockneys shall come and poke their noses
Into our churns as sweet as roses;
And to quiz Maudlin in clean kirtle
The toffs of Town will crush and hurtle.
You'll see the Queen, of pride chock-full,
Take first prize with her Shorthorn bull;
Dr. H. Watney, of Buckhold,
With " Cleopatra" hit the gold.
A medal or a champion cup
For cheese to munch, or cream to sup,
Are pleasures rural souls to move,
So live with me and be my love.
Butter and eggs, milch cows and churns,
With cattle foods shall take their turns;
If Dairy Shows thy mind have won,
Then'come with me to Islington.
Viator. Trust me, Mister, it is an apt song,
and archly sung by modish Maudlin. 1 ll
bestow a buoolio Cockney's wish upon her, that
she may live to marry a Competitive Dairy-
man, and have good store of champion cups
and first prizes stuck about her best parlour.
A LICENCE FOR LORDS.
[At the Blackheath Petty Sessions, Mr. Law-
less, stated that the Trafalgar Hotel, belonged to
the Lords of the Admiralty, and asked the Bench to
transfer the licence to the resident caretaker.
Captain Kobertson-Shbbshy, J. P. : Why not
transfer it to the First Lord of the Admiralty?
Are there no whitebait dinners held there?
Mr. Lawless said that he was afraid that the
da\B of whitebait dinners were over.
The Bench, finding the Admiralty held the hotel
for charitable purposes, granted the application.]
Come, landsmen, give ear to'my ditty,
I '11 make it as short as I can.
There was once—was it London ?—a city
Which stretched from Beersheba to Dan.
Of course that is gammon and spinach,
Or, to put it correctly, a joke.
It extended from Richmond to Greenwich,
This city of darkness and smoke.
It had sailors who ruled o'er the ocean,
And sat all the day upon Boards,
And described, with delightful emotion,
Themselves and their colleagues as'1 Lords."
They had tubes that were always exploding,
And boilers that never were right,
But had all got a trick of exploding,
And blowing a crew out of eight.
They had docks (and, alas! they had dockers),
They had ships that kept sinking like fctones,
Which resulted in filling the lockers
Provided below by D. Jones.
Of their country these lineal successors
Of Nelson deserved very well,
When at last they became the possessors
Of an old fully-licensed hotel.
And they made up a case which was flawless,
For the Sessions that sat at Blackheath,
And they sent — which was strange —
Mr. Lawless,
Who was crammed full of law to the
teeth.
"The days when we all lived in clover,
With whitebait, can never revive,
I assure you," said Lawless, "they 're over,
But, oh, keep the licence alive."
But the Bench, when they heard him, grew
bolder—
"Make it out to Geobgb Hamilton—he
Is the man who should figure as holder,"
Said Robkhtson-Shebsby, J.P.
Just to think of the head of the Navy,
The proudest and strongest afloat,
Cutting joints or distributing gravy,
First Lord of his own table d'hote!
Will their Charity be a beginner
At home? Will they dine there each day,
These Lords, on a succulent dinner.
Free, gratis, and nothing to pay r
Well, well, though we'd rather prefer ships
That burst not, we '11 take what they give.
So we offer our thanks to their Worships
For permitting the licence to live.

No. III.-JOANNA OF THE CROSS WAYS.
(By Geobgs Verimyth, Author of "Richard's Several Editions,"
"The Aphorist," "Shampoo's Shaving-Pot.")
[With this story came a long, explanatory letter. The story, however, is
itaelf so clear and easy to understand (as is all the work of this matter), that
the accompanying commentary is unnecessary.]
Chapter I.
Ik the earlier portion of the lives of all of us there is a time,
heaven-given without doubt, for all things, as we know, draw their
origin thence, if only in our blunder-
ing, ill-conditioned way we trace them
back far enough with the finger of fate
pointing to us as in mockery of all
striving of ours on this rough bosom of
our mother earth, a time there comes
when the senses rebel, first faintly,
and then with ever-increasing' vehem-
ence, panting, beating, buffeting and
breasting the torrent of necessity,
against the parental decree that would
drench our inmost being in the remedial
rwder of a Gregorian doctor, famous,
doubt not, in his day, and much
bepraised by them that walked deli-
cately in the light of pure reason and
the healthful flow of an untainted soul,
but now cast out and abhorred of child-
hood soaring on uplifted wing through
the vast blue of the modern pharma-
copoeia. Yet to them is there not
comfort too in the symbolic outpour
ings of a primaeval wisdom which,
embodied for all time in imperishable
verse, are chanted in the haunts of the very young like the soft
lappings of the incoming tide on a beach where rounded pebble
disputes with shining sand the mastery of the foreshore P
So, too. while the infant chariot with its slow motion of treble
wheels advances obedient to the hand of the wimpled maid who

from the rear directs its ambiguous progress, the dozing occupant
may not always understand, but, hearing, cannot fail to be moved to
tears by the simple tale of Joanna crossed in all her depth and scope
of free vigorous life by him that should have stood her friend. For
the man had wedded her. Of that there can be no doubt, since the
chronicles have handed down the date of it. Wedded her with the
fatal " yes" that binds a trusting soul in the world's chains. A
man, too. A reckless, mutton-munching, beer-swilling animal I
And yet a man. A dear, brave, human heart, as it should have
been; capable, it may be, of unselfishness and devotion; but, alas!
how fadly twisted to the devil's purposes on earth, an image of per-
petual chatter, like the putty-faced street-pictures of morning
soapsuds. His names stand in full in the verse. John, shortened
familiarly, but not without a hint of
contempt, to Jack, stares at you in all
the bravery of a Christian name. And
Spratt follows with a breath of musty
antiquity. Spratt that is indeed a
Spratt, sunk in the oil of a slothful
imagination and bearing no impress of
the sirname that should raise its owner
to cloudy peaks of despotic magni-
ficence.
But of the lady's names no hint is
given. We may conjecture Spratt to
have been hers too, poor young soul
that should have been dancing instead
of fastened to a table in front of an
eternal platter. And of all names to
§recede it the fittest surely is Joanna.
or what is that but the glorification
with many feminine thrills of the
unromantic chawbaoon John masti-
cating at home in semi-privacy the
husks of contentment, the lean scrap-
ings of the divine dish which is offered
once in every life to all. So Joanna
she shall be and is, and as Joanna shall her story be told.
Chapter II.
Many are the tales concerning Joanna's flashing wit. There

lugs she observes that, "The knitting-needles are long, bat the
of the heel is a teaser." Here there is a delightful irony of
interest amongst the reviewing herd, a booklet whereof the title
furnished little if any indication to the contents. The Spiruter's
Meticule, for so the name ran, came forth with no blare of journalistic
trumpets challenging approval from the towers of critical sagacity.
It appeared and lived. But between its cardboard covers the bruised
heart ef Joanna beats before the world. She shines most in these
aphorisms. Her private talk, too, has its own brilliancy, spun, as
it was here and there, out of a museful mind at the cooking of the
dinner or of the family aocounts. She said of love that it is the
sputter of grease in a frying-pan; where it falls the lire burns with
a higher flame to consume it." * Of man, that "he may navigate
Mormon Bay, but he cannot sail to Khiva Point." The meaning is
too obvious it may be, but the thought is well imaged.
She is delightful when she touohes on life. "Two." she says,
"may sit at a feast, but the feast is not thereby doubled." And,
again, "Passion may lift us to Himalaya heights, but the hams
are smoked in a chimney." And this of the soul, "He who fashions
a waterproof prevents not the_clouds from dripping moisture." Of
Btockini
turn
which matrons and maids may take note,
Such, then, was our Joanna—Joanna Mekesia Spkatt, to give
her that full name by which posterity is to know her—an ardent,
bubbling, bacon-loving girl-nature, with hands reaching from earth
to the stars, that blinked egregiously at the sight of her innocent
beauty, and hid themselves in winding clouds for very love of her.
Chapter III.
Sib John Spbatt had fashions that were peculiarly his own.
Vain it were to inquire how, from the long-perished Spratts that
went before him, he drew that form of human mind which was his.
Laws that are hidden from our prying eyes ordain that a man shall
be the visible exemplar of vanished ages, offering here and there a
hook of remembrance, on which a philosopher may hang a theory for
the world's admiring gaze. Far back in the misty past, of which
the fabulists bear record, there have swum Spratts within this
human ocean, and of these the ultimate and proudest was he with
whose life-story we are concerned. It was his habit to oarry with him
on all journeys a bulky note-book, the store in which he laid by for
occasions of use the thoughts that thronged upon him, now feverishly,
as with the exultant leap of a rough-coated canine companion,
released from the thraldom of chain and kennel, and eager to seek
the Serpentine haunts of water-nymphs, and of sticks that fell with
a splash, and are brought back time and again whilst the shaken
spray bedews the onlookers; now with the staid and solemn progres-
sion that is beloved of the equine drawers of four-wheeled chariots,
protesting with many growls against a load of occupants.
He had met Joanna. They had conversed. "An empty table, is
it not?" said she. "Nowhere 1" said he, and. they proceeded.
His " Nowhere!" had a penetrating significance—the more signifi-
cant for the sense that it left vague.
And so the marriage was arranged, the word that was to make
one of those who had hitherto been two had been spoken, and the
celebrating gifts came pouring in to the pair.
Sir John walked home with triumph swelling high in his heart.
Overhead the storm-clouds gathered ominously. First with a patter,
then with a drenching flood, the prisoned rain burst its bars, and
dashed clamouring down to the free earth. He paused, umbrella-
less, under a glimmering lamp-post. The hurrying steeds of a
carriage, passing at great speed, dashed the gathered slush of the
street over his dark-blue Melton over-ooat. The imprecations of the
coachman and his jeers mingled strangely with the elemental roar.
Sir John heeded them not. He stood moveless for a space, then
Blowly drawing forth his note-book, and sharpening his pencil, he
wrote the following phrase:—" Laid Brother to Baiyo, one, two,
three, 5 to 4."
Chapter IV.
A tear had gone by, and with the spring that whispered softly
in the blossoming hedge-rows, and the melancholy ory of the female
fowl calling to her downy brood, Joanna had learnt new lessons of
a beneficent life, and had crystallised.them in aphorisms, shaken
like dew from the morning leaf of her teeming fancy.
They sat at table together. Binns, the butler, who himself
dabbled in aphorism, and had sucked wisdom from the privy perusal
of Sir John's note-book, had laid before them a dish on whioh
reposed a small but well-boiled leg of one that had trod the South-
downs but a week before in all the pride of lusty life. There was
a silence for a moment.
"You will, as usual, take the fat P" queried Sir John.
"Lean for me to-day," retorted Joanna, with one of her bright
flashes,
"Nay, nay," said her husband, "that were agaiiBt tradition,
whioh assigns to you the fat."
• I guarantee all these remarks to be intensely humorous and brilliant. It
you can't see it, so much the worse for you. They are tcreamert.—G. V.
Joanna pouted. Her mind rebelled against dictation. Besides,
were not her aphorisms superior to those of her husband? The cold
face of Sir John grew eloquent in protest. She paused, and then
with one wave of her stately arm swept mutton, platter, knife, fork,
and caper sauce into the lap of Sir John, whence the astonished
Binns, gasping in pain, with much labour rescued them. Joanna
had disappeared in a flame of mocking laughter, and was heard
above calling on her maid for Baits. But Sir John ere yet the
sauce had been fairly scraped from him, unclasped his note-book,
and with trembling fingers wrote therein, "Poole's master-pieces
are ever at the mercy of an angry woman."
Chapter V.
But the world is hard, and there was little mercy shown for
Joanna's freak. Her husband had slain her. That was all. She
with her flashes, her gaiety, her laughter, was consigned to dust.
But in Sir John's note-book it was written that, "The hob-nailed
boot is but a bungling weapon. The drawing-room poker is better."
THE END.

THE GRASSHOPPERA" AT THE LYRIC.
Nothing prettier than La Cigalt at the Lyric Theatre has been
seen in London for a very long time. The dreeses are perfect, and
the three stage pictures whioh illustrate the graceful story could not
be better. Then the book is admittedly a model libreito, set to musio
at once fresh and charming. W hat more
could be desired? "Why capable exponents.
Here, again, Mr. Sedoer is in luck's way.
With Miss Geraldine TTlmar as the Grass-
hopper, and Miss Kfkik Clements as the
Ant, who could ask for more? Without
replying to the question, it may be slid at
onbe that " more " is excellently represented
by Mr. Ebic Lewis as a Duke, Mr. Lionel
B rough as a Landlord (by the way the
Uncle of the Ant), and Mr. E. W. Garden
as the Bill of the Play. Perhaps on the first
night the Chevalier Scovel as the Chevalier
de Bernheim was not quite at home in his
new surroundings. Accustomed to a more
serious kind of entertainment, he appeared a
trifle heavy, and his tenor notes (not unsnggestive of the Bank of
Elegance) were sometimes of doubtful value. By this time, how-
ever, no doubt, he has regained his normal composure, and sings as
successfully as any of his colleagues.
After the last Aot everyone was called, inclusive of the composers
and the author; the latter, being at that very moment on his way to
France, could not respond to the hearty applause with whioh his name
was greeted, and must accordingly await the personal congratula-
tions of the audience until his return from foreign parts. Mr. Cartll
who had done so much to musically illustrate the Christmas Tree
Scene (thus meriting the title of Mr. Christkas Cartll), was also
not to be found when wanted, and so the Sole Lessee and Manager had
nothing more to do than return thanks for all concerned, and make
up his mind to a run that seems likely to keep him on his legs until
Easter.
TO MR. STANLEY.
[At a meeting of the Cardiff Corporation on Tuesday, October 7, a letter
was read from Mr. H. M. Stanlky stating, that he would be unable to
fulfil his engagement to visit Cardiff and accept the freedom of the borough.
AH preparation for the ceremony had been made, and a costly silver caeki-t,
which is now utcless, was specially ordered. Mr. Stanlby'b excuse was
pressure of business in preparing for his American tour.—Daily Paper.]
The Council at Cardiff looked angry and glum,
Their chagrin was so great it was useless to mask it,
They had only just heard you were not going to oome.
And alack! and alas! they had ordered the casket!
The address had been settled; the language was tall,
The phrases were apt and so beautifully rounded.
They had told of your pluck so well known to us all,
And your praises, of course, they had suitably sounded.
And then you can't come! —But it scarcely avails
To become of excuses a common oonoocter,
For if "pressure of business" will keep you from Wales,
Why go down to Cambridge to pose as a Dootor?
Yes, think onoe again of your promise, and so
Just alter your mind, it would be much too hard if
You left unfulfilled your engagement to go
And receive (in a casket) the Freedom of Cardiff.

MR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.
No. IV.-BOB SILLIMERE.
(By Mrs. Humphry John Ward Preacher, Author of "Master
Sisterson.")
[On the paper in -which the MS. of this novel wag wrapped, the following
Dote was written in a bold feminine hand :—" This is a highly religious story.
Geokob Eliot was unable to write properly about religion. The novel is
certain to be well reviewed. It is calculated to adorn the study-table of a
Bishop. The £1000 prize must be handed over at once to the Institute
which is to be founded to encourage new religions in the alleys of St.
Pancras.—H. J. W. P."]
Chapter I.
It was evening—evening in Oxford. There are evenings in other
places occasionally. Cambridge sometimes pats forward weak
imitations. But, on the whole, there are no evenings which have so
much of the true, inward, mystio spirit as Oxford evenings. A
solemn hash broods over the grey quadrangles, and this, too, in spite
of the happy laughter of the undergraduate s playing tonoh last on
the grass-plots, and leaping, like a merry army of marsh-dwellers,
each over the back of the other, on their way to the deeply impressive
services of their respective college chapels. Inside, the organs
were pealing majestically, in response to the deft fingers of many
highly respectable mnsioians, and all the proud traditions, the
legendary struggles, the well-loved
examinations, the affectionate memo-
ries of generations of proctorial officers,
the innocent rustications, the warning
appeals of authoritative Deans — all
these seemed gathered together into
one last loud trumpet-call, as a tall,
impressionable youth, carrying with
him a spasm of feeling, a Celtic tem-
perament, a moved, flashing look, and
a surplice many sizes too large for him,
dashed with a kind of quivering,
breathless sigh, into the chapel of St.
Boniface's just as the porter was about
to close the door. This was Robert,
or, as his friends lovingly called him,
Bob Silllvsre. His mother had been
an Irish lady, full of the best Irish
humour; after a short trial, she was,
however, found to be a superfluous
character, and as she began to develop
differences with Catherine, she caught
acute inflammation of the lungs,
and died after a few days, in the
eleventh chapter.
Bob sat still awhile, his agitation
soothed by the comforting sense of the
oaken seat beneath him. At school he
had been called by his school-fellows
"the Knitting-needle," a remarkable
example of the well-known fondness of boys for sharp, short nioknames;
but this did not trouble him now. He and his eagerness, his boundless
curiosity, and his lovable mistakes, were now part and parcel of the
new life of Oxford—new to him, but old as the ages, that, with their
rhythmic recurrent flow, like the pulse of \Two pages of fancy
tcriiing are here omitted. En.] Brioham and Black were in chapel,
too. They were Dons, older than Bob, but his intimate friends
They had but little belief, but Black often preached, and Brioiiam
held undecided views on life and matrimony, having been brought
up in the cramped atmosphere of a middle-class parlour. At Oxford,
the two took pupils, and helped to shape Bob's life. Once Brioham
had pretended, as an act of pure benevolence, to be a Pro-Proctor,
but as he had a sardonic scorn, and a face which could become a
marble mask, the Vice-Chancellor called upon him to resign his
position, and he never afterwards repeated the experiment.
Chapter II.
One evening Bob was wandering dreamily on the banks of the
Upper River. He sat down, and thought deeply. Opposite to him
was a wide green expanse dotted with white patches of geese. There
and then, by the gliding river, with a mass of reeds and a few
poplars to fill in the landscape, he determined to become a clergyman.
How strange that he should never have thought of this before; how
sudden it was; how wonderful! But the die was oast; alea jacta
est, as he had read yesterday in an early edition of St. Augustine;
and, when Bob rose, there was a new brightness in his eye, and a
fresh springiness in his steps. And at that moment the deep bell of
St. Mary's [Three page* omitted. Ed.]
Chapter III.
And thus Bob was ordained, and, having married Catherine, he
accepted the family living of Wendover, though not before he had
taken occasion topoint out to Black that family livings were corrupt
and indefensible institutions. Still, the thing had to be done; and
bitterly as Bob pined for the bracing air of the East End of London,
he acknowledged, with one of his quiok, bright flashes, that, unless
he went to Wendover, he could never meet Squire Murewkll,
whose powerful arguments were to drive him from positions he had
never qualified himself, except by an irrational enthusiasm, to defend.
Of Catherine a word must be said. Cold, with the delicate but
austere firmness of a Westmoreland daisy, gifted with fatally sharp
lines about the chin and mouth, and habitually wearing loose grey
gowns, with bodices to match, she was admirably calculated, with
her narrow, meat-tea proclivities, to embitter the amiable Silli-
mere's existence, and to produce, in conjunction with him, that
storm and stress, that perpetual dashing of two estimates without
whioh no modern religious novel could be written, and which not
even her pale virginal grace of look and form could subdue. That is
a long sentence, but, ah! how short is a merely mortal sentence,
with its tyrannous full stop, against the immeasurable background
of the December stars, by whose light Bob was now walking, with
heightened colour, along the vast avenue that led to Wendover Hall,
the residence of the ogre Squire.
Chapter IV.
The Squire was at home. On the door-step Bob was greeted by
Mrs. Farcey, the Squire's sister. She looked at him in her bird-like
way. At other times she was elf-like,
and played tricks with a lace hand-
kerchief.
"You know," she whispered to Bob,
"we're all mad here. I'm mad, and
he," she continued, bobbing diminu-
tively towards the Squire's study-door,
"he « mad too—as mad as a hatter."
Before Bob had time to answer this
strange remark, the study-door flew
open, and Squire Murewell stepped
forth. He rapped out an oath or two,
which Bob noticed with faint polite-
ness, and ordered his visitor to enter,
The Squire was rough—very rough;
but he had studied hard in Germany,
"So you're the young fool," he
observed, "who intends to tackle me,
Ha, ha, that's a good joke. I '11 have
you round my little finger in two twos,
Here," he went on gruffly, "take this
book of mine in your right hand.
Throw your eyes up to the ceiling."
Robert, wishing to conciliate him, did
as he desired. The eyes stuok there,
and looked down with a quiok lovable
look on the two men below. "Now,"
said the Squire, "you can't see.
Pronounce the word ' testimony' twice,
slowly. Think of a number, multiply
by four, subtraot the Thirty-nine Articles, add a 8unday School and
a packet of buns. Result, you 're a freethinker." And with that
he bowed Bob out of the room.
Chapter V.
A terrible storm was raging in the Rector's breast as he strode,
regardless of the cold, along the verdant lanes of Wendover. "Fool
that I was' " he muttered, pressing both hands convulsively to his
sides. "Why did I not pay more attention to arithmetic at school P
I could have orushed him, but I was ignorant. Was that result
right P" He reflected awhile mournfully, but he could bring it out
in no other way. "I must go through with it to the bitter end," he
concluded, "and Catherine must be told." But the thought of
Catherine knitting quietly at home, while she read Fox's Book
of Martyrs, with a tender smile on her thin lips, unmanned him.
He sobbed bitterly. The front-door of the Rectory was open. He
walked in. The rest is Boon told. He resigned the_ Rectory, and
made a brand-new religion. Catherine frowned, but it was useless.
Thereupon she gave him cold bacon for lunch during a whole fort-
night, and the brave young soul whioh had endured so much
withered under this blight. _ And thus, acknowledging the novelist's
artistic necessity, Robert died.— [The End ]
Winter Season at Covent Garden.—Opening of Italian Opera
last Saturday, with Aida. Very well done. "Wait" between Second
and Third Aot too long: "Waiters" in Gallery whistling. Wind
whistling, too, in Stalls. Operatic and rheumatic. Rugs and fur capes
might be kept on hire by Stall-keepers. Airs in Aida delightful:
draughts in Stalls awful. Signor Lago called before Curtain to reoeive
First Night congratulations. Signor Lago ought to do good business
'' in front," as there's evidently no difficulty in " raising the wind."

His hair is of flame fizzing oyer bis head,
As likewise his beard and eye-lashes;

who-must-be-obeyed, and who dwelt in a place called K6r, and you
will also doubtless remember how she was in the 'abit of repairing,
at certain intervals, to a cavern, and renooing her youth in a fiery
piller. On one occasion, wishing to indooce her lover to toiler her
example, she stepped into the name to encourage him—something
went wrong with the works, and she was instantly redoooed to
a cinder. I fortunately 'appened to be near at the time (you will
escuse a little wild fib from a showman, I 'm sure!) I 'appened to be

Showman. Some people think this is all done by mirrors, but it is
not so; it is managed by a simple arrangement of light and shade.
She will now turn slowly round, to convince you that she is really
inside the urn and not merely beyind it. (She turns round conde-
scendingly.) She will next pass her 'ands completely round her,
thereby demonstrating the utter impossibility of there being any
wires to support her. New she will rap on the walls on each side of
her, proving to you that she is no reflection, but a solid reality, after
whioh the will tap the bottom of the urn beneath her, so that you

TO ENGELBERQ AND BACK.
Being a tew Notes taken en route in search of a Perfect Cure.
The Engineer! who constructed the gradually ascending road
which, slowly mounting the valley, finally takes you over the ridge,
as it were, and deposits you at a height of 3800 feet, dusty but
grateful, on the plain of Engelberg, must have been practical jokers
of the first water. They lead you up in the right direction several
thousand feet, then suddenly turn you round, and apparently take
you clean back again. And this not once, but a dozen times. They
seem to say, "You think you must reaoh the top this time, my fine
fellow? Not a bit of it. Back you go again."
Still we kept turning and turning whither Lthe Practical-joking
Engineers led us, but seemed as far off from our journey's end as
ever. A roadside inn for a moment deluded us with its light, but
we only drew up in front of this while our gloomy charioteer
sat down to a good square meal, the third he had had since three
o'clock, over whioh he consumed exactly five-and-twenty minutes,
keeping us waiting while he disposed of it at his leisure, in a fit of
depressing but greedy sulks.
At length we moved on again, and in about another half-an-hour
apparently reached the limit of the Practical-joking Engineers'
work, for our surly charioteer suddenly jumped on the box, and
cracking his whip furiously, got all the pace that was left in them
out of our three sagacious horses, and in a few more minutes we
were tearing along a level road past scattered chalets, little wooden
toy-shops, and isolated pensions, towards a oolossal-looking white
palace that stood out a grateful sight in the distance before us,
basking in the calm white-blue blaze shed upon it from a couple of
lofty electrio lights, that told us that up here in the mountains we
were not coming to rough it, but to be welcomed by the latest
luxuries and refinements of first-rate modern hotel accommodation.
And this proved to be the case. Immediately he arrived in the large
entrance-hall, the Dilapidated One was greeted by the Landlord of
the Hotel et Eurhaus, Titlis, politely assisted to the lift, and finally
deposited in the comfortable and electrically-lighted room whioh
had been assigned to him.
"We are extremely full," announced the polite Herr to Dr. Mel-
chibtdec; "and we just come from finishing the second dinner,"—
which seemed to account for his being " extremely full,"—" but as
soon as you will descend from your rooms, there will be supper ready
at your disposition."
"You'll just oome and look at the Bath-chair before you turn
in?" inquired Dr. Melchibidec, of the Dilapidated One, "It's
arrived ail right from Zurich. Come by post, apparently."
"Oh, that's nothing," continued young Jehbyman, "why,
there's nothing you can't send by post in Switzerland, from a house
full of furniture, down to a grand piano or oage of canaries. You 've
only got to clap a postage-stamp on it, and there you are!" And
the arrival of the Bath-chair certainly seemed to indicate that he
was telling something very like the truth.
"I don't quite see how this guiding-wheel is to act," remarked
Dr. Mbichisidec, examining the chair, whioh was of rather pan-
tomimic proportions, critically; "but suppose you just get in and
try it! 'Pon my word it almost looks like a ' trick-chair !" whioh

The Trick Chair.
indeed it proved itself to be, jerking up in a most unaccountable
fashion the moment the Dilapidated One put his foot into it, and
unceremoniously sending him flying out on to his head forthwith.
"A little awkward at first," he remarked, assisting the Dilapidated
One on to his feet "One has to get accustomed to these things, you
see; but, bless yon, in a day or two you won't want it at all. You '11
find the air here like a continual draught of champagne. 'Pon my
word, I believe you feel better already," and with this inspiriting
assurance the Dilapidated One, who had not only covered himself
with dust, but severely bruised his shins, saying that " he thought,
perhaps, he did—just a little," was again assisted to the lift, and
safely consigned to his room, where he was comfortably packed away
for the night.
"I say,'' says young Jibbyman, next morning, "what a place for
bells!"
And young Jebryman was right, for I was awoke in the small
hours of the morning by a loud peal from the Monastery, as if the

A Peripatetic Peal.
Prior had suddenly said to himself, "What's the use of the bells
if you don't ring 'em f By Jove. I will!" and had then and there
jumped from his couch, seized hold of the ropes, and set to
work with a right good will. Then the hotels and pensions took it
up, and so, what with seven o'olock, eight o'clock, and nine o'clock
breakfasts, first and second dejeuners, first and second dinners,
interspersed with "Office Hours" sounded by the Monastery, ana
the sound of the dinner-bells carried by the cattle, Dingle-berg,
rather than Engelberg, would be a highly appropriate name for this
somewhat noisy, but otherwise delightful health-resort.
"I call this 'fatal dull' after Paris," remarked a fair Americaine
to young Jerky man; and, perhaps, from a certain point of view,
she may have been right; hut, fatal dull, or lively, there can be
no two opinions about the life-giving properties of the air.
Old Joe Encore.—Last Wednesday in the Farrar v. Publisher
discussion, a Correspondent, signing himself John Taylob, of
Dagnall Park, Selhurst, wrote to The Times to " quote an anecdote"
about Douglas Jebbold and "a Publisher." Rarely has a good old
story been so spoilt in the telling as in this instance. The true story is
of Albert Smith and Douglas J errold, and has been already told in
the Times by a Correspondent signing himself " E. Y." It is of the
same respectable age as that one of Albert Smith signing his initials
"A. S.," and Jerrold observing, "He only tells two-thirds of the
truth." Perhaps Mr. John Taylob, of Dagnall Park, Selhurst, is going
to favour us with a little volume of "new sayings by old worthies
at Christmas time, and we shall hear how Sheridan once asked
Tom B "why a miller wore a white hat f" And how Ebskinb,
on hearing a witness's evidence about a door being open, explained
to him that his evidence would be worthless, because a door could not
be considered as a door "if it were a jar," and several other excellent
stories, which, being told for the first time with the verve and local
colouring of which the writer of the letter to The Times is evidently
a past-master, will secure for the little work an enormous popularity.
A Scott and a Lot.—" Thirty Years at the Play " is the title of
Mr. Clement Scott's Lecture to be delivered next Saturday at the
Garrick Theatre, for the benefit of the Actors' Benevolent Fund.
Thirty years of Play-time 1 All play, and lots of work. Mr. Ibvtno
is to introduce the lecturer to his audience, who, up to that moment,
will have been "Strangers Yet," and this Clement will be Scott-
free to say what he likes, and to tell 'em all about it generally.
"Scott" will be on the stage, and the "Lot" in the auditorium.
Lot's Wife also.
Ether-Drinking in Ireland.—Mr. Ernest Habt (bless his
heart and earnestness!) lectured last week on "Ether-Drinking in
Ireland." He lectured "The Society for the Study of Inebriety "—
a Society whioh must be slightly " mixed"—on this bad habit, and
no doubt implored them to give it up. The party sang, "Sow
Happy could we be with Ether," and the discussion was continued
until there was nothing more to be said.
Clebot in Parliament.—As Bishops "sit" in the Upper House,
why should not "the inferior olergy" "stand" for the Lower
House f If they get in, why shouldn't they be seated? Surely
what's right in the Bishop isn't wrong in the Rector P

Royalty was swallowed up by an earthquake
of republican tendencies. Jamaica, of course,
is a great place for spices; but, in spite of all
the highly spiced stories, the origin of which
is more or less sus-spioe-ious, it is to be

the original Mace, cannot be found.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WANTED-A SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF "CELEBRITIES."
Whk some yean ago Edmundus Ed. Mundi first introduced to
London the gentle art of Interviewing, the idea was in a general way
a novelty in this country. It "caught on," and achieved success.
Some public men affected, privately, not to like the extra pablioity
given to their words and
actions; but it was only an
affectation, and in a general
way a great many suddenly
found themselves dubbed
"Celebrities," hall-marked
as suoh by The World, and
able therefore to hand them-
selves down to posterity, in
bound volumes containing
this one invaluable number,
as having been recognised
by the world at large as
undoubted Celebrities, igno-
rance of whose existence
would argue utter social
insignificance. So great
was the World's success in
this particular line, that at
once there sprang up a host
of imitators, ana the Cele-
brities were again tempted
to make themselves still
more celebrated by having
good-natured caricatures of themselves made by " Ape " and " Spy.''
After this, the deluge, of biographies, autobiographies, interview-
ing, photographic realities, portraits plain and coloured—many of
them uncommonly plain, and some of them wonderfully coloured,
—until a Celebrity who has not been done and served up, with or
without a plate, is a Celebrity indeed.
"Celebrities" have hitherto been valuable to the interviewer,
photographer, and proprietor of a Magazine in due proportion. Is it
not high time that the Celebrities themselves have a slice or two out
of the cake P If they consent to sit as models to the interviewer
and photographer, let them price their own time. The Baron offers
a model of correspondence on both sides, and, if his example is
followed, up goes the price of "Celebrities," and, consequently, of
interviewed and interviewers, there will be only a survival of the
fittest.
From A. Sophie Super to the Baron de Book- Worms,
Sib,—Messrs. Toweb, Fondles, Tbotting & Co., are now engaged
in bringing out a series of the leading Literary, Dramatic and Artistic
Notabilities of the present day, and feeling that the work which
has now reached its hundred-and-second number, would indeed
be incomplete did it not include your name, the above-mentioned
firm has commissioned me to request you to accord me an inter-
view as soon as possible. I propose bringing with me an eminent
photographer, and also an artist who will make a sketch of your
surroundings, and so contribute towards producing a complete
Eicture which cannot fail to interest and delight the thousands at

who will be delighted to possess a portrait of one whose works have
given them so much pleasure, and to obtain a closer and more
intimate acquaintance with the modus operandi pursued by one of

A. Sophte Sopkr.
To the Baron- de Book-Worms, Vermoulen Lodge.
From the Baron de Book- Worms to A. Sophte Soper, Esq.
Deab Sib,—Thanks. I quite appreciate your appreciation. My
terms for an article in a Magazine, are twenty guineas the first
hour, ten guineas the second, and so on. For dinner-table anecdotes,
the property in which once made publio is lost for ever to the
originator, special terms. As to photographs, I will sign every copy,
and take twopence on every copy. I'm a little pressed for time
now, so if you can manage it, we will defer the visit for a week or
two, and then I'm your man.
Yours truly,
Bakon de Book-Wobms.
Mr. A. Sophte Soper to the Baron de Book- Worms.
Mr Dfar Bahon-, — I'm afraid I didn't quite make myself
understood. I did not ask you to write the article, being com-
missioned by the firm to do it myself. The photographs will not be
■old apart from the Magazine. Awaiting your favourable response,—
I am, Sir, Yours, A. Sophte Sopbb.
From the Baron to A. Sophte Soper.
Dear Sib,—I quite understood. With the generous view of doing
me a good turn by giving me the almost inestimable advantage
»* advertising myself in Messrs. Towers & Co.'s widely-circulated
of
Magazine, you propose to interview me, and receive from me suoh
orally given information as you may require concerning my life,
history, work, and everything about myself which, in your opinion,
would interest the readers of this Magazine. I quite appreciate all
this. You propose to write the article, and I'm to find you the materials
for it. Good. I don't venture to put any price on the admirable work
whioh your talent will produce,—that's for you and your publishers to
settle between you, ana, as a matter of fact, it has been already settled,
as you are in their employ. But I can put a price on my own, and
I do. I collaborate with you in furnishing all the materials of
whioh you are in need. Suit. For the use of my Pegasus, no matter
what its breed, ana, as it isn't a gift-horse, but a hired one, you can
examine its mouth and legs critically whenever you are going to
mount and guide it at your own sweet will, / charge twenty guineas
for the first hour, and ten for the second. It may be dear, or it may
be cheap. That s not my affair. C'est d laisser ou d prendre.
The Magazine in which the article is to appear k not given away
with a pound of tea, or anything of that sort I presume, so that
your strictly honourable and business-like firm of employers, and you
also, Sir, in the regular course of your relations with them, intend
making something out of me, more or less, but something, while I
get nothing at all for my time, whioh is decidedly as valuable to me
as, I presume, is yours to you. What have your publishers ever
done for me that I should give them my work for nothing P Time
is money; why should I make Messrs. Toweb, Fondleb & Co. a
present of twenty pounds, or, for the matter of that, even ten shillings?
If I misapprehend the situation, and you are doing your work gratis
and for the love of the thing, then that is your affair, not mine: I'm
glad to hear it, and regret my inability to join you in the luxury of
giving away what it is an imperative necessity of my existence to sell
at thejbest price I can. Do you honestly imagine, Sir, that my literary
position will be one farthing's-worth improved by a memoir and a
portrait of me appearing in your widely-circulated journal? If you
do, / don't; and I prefer to be paid for my work, whether I dictate
the material to a scribe, who is to serve it up in his own fashion, or
whether I write it myself. And now I come to consider it, I should
be inclined to make an additional charge for not writing it myself.
Not to take you and your worthy firm of employers by surprise, I will
make out beforehand a supposititious bill, and then Messrs. Tower
& Co. can close with my offer or not, as they please. £, s. d.

To the above a reply may be expeoted, and, if received, it will
probably be in a different tone from Mr. Sophie Sofbb's previous
communications. No matter. There's an end of it. The Baron's
advice to all " Celebrities," when asked to permit themselves to be
interviewed, is, in the language of the poet,—
"Charge, Chester, charge!"
then they will have benefited other Celebrities all round, and the result
will be that either only those authors will be interviewed who are
worth the price of interviewing, or the professional biographical com-
pilers will nave to hunt up nobodies, dress up jays as peacocks, and so
bring the legitimate business of "Interviewing " into well-deserved
contempt.

crammer who has made a study of the subject she

crammer spends an hour or two with the pupil,
and coaches her up in general conversation.]
It really took us by surprise,
We thought her but a mere beginner,
And widely opened were our eyes
To hear her brilliant talk at dinner.
She always knew just what to say,
And said it well, nor for a minute

As well confess—we men weren't in it 1
The talk was of Roumania's Queen,
And was she equal, say, to Dante P—
The way that raoe was won by Sheen,
And not the horse called Alicante—
Of how some charities were frauds,
How some again were quite desert ing—

But yet the time, it's clear, you *ve passed
In reading must be something frightful.
Come—do you trouble thus your head
Because you want to go to College
By getting out of Mr. Stfad

"Kind Sir," she promptly then replied,
"Your guess, I quite admit, was olever,
And, if I now in you confide,
You '11 keep it dark, I'm sure, for ever.
Yet do not get, I pray, enraged,
For how I got my information

SERVED A LA RUSSE.
Mr Dear Mb. Punch,
Will you allow me, as one who
knows Russia by heart, to express my intense
admiration for the new pieoe at the Shaftes-
bury Theatre, in which is given, in my
opinion, the most faithful picture of the
Czar's dominions as yet exhibited to the
British Public ACT I. is devoted to "a
Street near the Banks of the Neva, St.
Petersburg," and here we have a splendid
view of the Winter Palace, and what I took
to be the Kremlin at Moscow. On one side
is the house of a money-lender, and on the
other the shelter afforded to a drosky-driver
and his starving family. The author, whose
name must he Buchananoff (though he
modestly drops the ultimate syllable), gives
as a second title to this portion of his won-
derful work, " The Dirge for the Dead." It is
very appropriate. A student, whose funds are
at the lowest ebb, commits a purposeless
murder, and a "pope" who has been on the
look-out no doubt for years, seizes the oppor-
tunity to rush into the murdered man's
dwelling, and sing over his inanimate body
a little thing of his own composition. Anyone
who has been in Russia will immediately re-
cognise this inoident as absolutely true to
life. Amongst my own acquaintance I know
three priests who did precisely the same thing
—they are called Brownoff, Jonbsxi, and
Robinsonoff.
Next we have the Palace of the Princess
Orenburg, and make the acquaintance of
Anna Ivanovna, a young lady who is the
sister of the aimless murderer, and owner
of untold riches. We are also introduced to
the Head of Police, who, as everyone knows,
is a cross between a surburban inspector, a
low-class inquiry agent, and a flaneur moving
in the best Society. We find, too, naturally
enough, an English attache, whose chief aim
is to insult an aged Russian General, whose
sobriquet is, " the Hero of Sebastopol." Then
the aimless murderer reveals his crime, which,
of course, escapes detection save at the hands
of Prince Zotxmoff, a nobleman, who I fancy,
from his name, must have discovered a new
kind of tooth-powder.
Next we have the "Interior of a"Common
Lodging House," the 'counterpart of which
may be found in almost any street in the
modern capital of Russia. There are the
religions pictures, the cathedral immediately
opposite, with its stained-glass windows and
intermittent organ, and the air of sanotity
without whioh no Russian Common Lodging
House is complete. Needless to say that
Prince Tooth-powder — I beg pardon —
Zotimoff and Anna listen while Fedor Ivano-
vitch again confesses his crime, this time to
the daughter of the drosky-driver, for whom
he has a sincere regard, and I may add,
affection. Although with a well-timed scream
his sister might interrupt the awkward
avowal, she prefers/to listen to the bitter end.
This reminds me of several cases recorded in
the Newgatekoff Calendaroff, a miscellany of
Russian crimes.
After this we come to the Gardens of the
Palace Taurida, when Fedor is at length
arrested and carted off to Siberia, an excel-
lent picture of which is given in the last
Act. Those who really know Russian Society
will not be surprised to find that the Chief
of the Police (promoted to a new position and

a fur-trimmed coat), and the principal characters of the drama have
also found their way to the Military Outpost on the borders of the
dreaded region. I say dreaded, hut should have added, without
cause. M. Bucbananoff shows us a very pleasant picture. The
prisoners seem to have very little to do save to preserve the life of
the Governor, and to talk heroics about liberty and other kindred
subjects. Prince Zoiimoff attempts, for the fourth or fifth time, to
make Anna his own—he calls the pursuit " a caprice." and it is
indeed a strange one—and is, in the nick of time, arrested, by order of
the Czar. After this pleasing and natural little inoident, everyone
prepares to go baok to St. Petersburg, with the solitary exception
of the Prince, who is ordered off to the Mines. No doubt the Emperor
of Russia had used the tooth-powder, and, finding it distasteful to
him, had taken speedy vengeanoe upon its presumed inventor.
I have but one fault to find with the representation. The play is
capital, the scenery excellent, and the acting beyond all praise. But
I am not quite sure about the title. M. Bcchananoff calls his
play "The Sixth Commandment"—he would have been, in my
opinion, nearer the mark, had he brought it into oloser association
with the Ninth! Believe me, dear Mr. Punch,
Tours, respectfully, Russ in Urbe.
IN OUR GARDEN.

TJPPOSE, Toby dear boy,"
said the Member for
Bark, "we start a garden,
and work in it ourselves.
Temple did it, you know,
when he was tired of
affairs of State."
"Sir Richard?" I
asked, never remembering
to have seen the Member
for Evesham in the com-
pany of a rake.
"No; ClTABIES THE
Second's Minister, who
went down to Sheen two
centuries before the Orle-
anist Princes, and grew
roses. Of course I don't
mean to be there much in
the Session. The thing
is to have something dur-
ing Recess to gently engage the mind and fully occupy the body."
Thin conversation took plane towards the end of last Session but one.
By odd coincidence I had met the Member for Sark as I was coming
from Old Morality's room, where I had been quietly dining with
him. Jackson and Akrrs-Douglas made up party of four, it was
second week of August; everybody tired to death. Old Morality
asked me to look in and join them about eight o'clock. Knocked at
door; no answer; curious scurrying going round; somebody running
and jumping; heard Old Morality's voice, in gleeful notes, "Now
then, Douglas, tuck in your tuppenny! Here you are, Jackson '.
keep the mill a goin' 1" Knocked again; no answer; opened door
gently; beheld strange sight. The Patronage Secretary was " giving
a baok " to the First Lord of the Treasury. Old Morality, taking
running jump, cleared it with surprising agility considering Akf.rs-
Douolas's inches. Then he trotted on a few paces, folded his arms
and bent his head ; Financial Secretary to Treasury, clearing Akers-
Douolas, took Old Morality in his stride, and "tuoktd in his
tuppenny" in turn.
Thought I had better retire. Seemed on the whole tho proceedings
demanded privacy; but Old Morality, catohing sight of me, called
out, "Come along, Toby! Only our little game. Fall in, and take
your turn."
Rather afraid of falling over, but didn't like to spoil sport; cleared
Old Morality capitally; scrambled over Akers-Douolas; but
couldn't manage Jackson.
"I can't get over him," I said, apologetically.
"No," said Akkrs-Douolas, he's a Yorkshireman."
'"lis but a primitive pastime," observed Old Morality, when,
later, we sat down to dinner ■ '1 but remarkably refreshing; a great
stimulant for the appetite. Indeed," he added, as he transferred a
whole grouse to his plate, "1 do not know anything that more for-
cibly brings home to the mind the truth underlying the old Greek
aphorism, that a bird on your plate is worth two in the dish."
I gathered in conversation that when business gets a little heavy,
when time presses, and leisure for exercise is curtailed, Old
Morality generally has ten minutes leap-frog before dinner.
"We used at first to play it in the corridor; an excellent place;
apparently especially designed for the purpose; but we were always
liable to interruption, and by putting the chairs on the table here
we manage well enough. It's been the making of me, and I may
add, has enabled my Right Hon. friends with increased vigour and
ease to perform their duty to their Queen and Country. The great
thing, dear Toby, is to judiciously commingle physical exercise with
mental activity. What says the great bard of Abydos? Mem
sana in corpore tano, which being translated means, mens—or per-
haps I should say, men—should incorporate bodily exercise with
mental exeroitation."
Of course I did not disclose to the Member for Sark, what had
taken place in the privity of Old Morality's room. That is not
my way. The secret is ever sacred with me, and shall he carried
with me to the silent tomb. But I was much impressed with the
practical suggestions of my esteemed Leader, and allured by their
evident effect upon his appetite.
"Men," continued the Member for Sark, moodily, "do all kinds
of things in the Recess to make up for the inroads on the constitution
suffered during the Session. They go to La Bourboule like the
Markiss and Raikes; or they play Golf like Prince Arthur: or
they pay visits to their Mothers-in-law in the United States, like
Chamberlain and Lyon Platfaib; or they go to Switzerland,
India, Russia, Australia, and Sierra Leone. Now if we had a
garden, which we dug, and weeded, and clipped, and pruned
ourselves, never eating a potato the sapling of which we had
not planted, watered, and if necessarv grafted, with our own
hands, we should live happy, healthful lives for at least a month
or two, coming baok to our work having renewed our youth like th e
rhinoceros."
"But you don't know anything about gardening, do you P"
"That's just it. Anyone can keep a garden that has been
brought up to the business. But look what chances there are before
two statesmen of, I trust I may say without egotism, average intelli-
gence, who take to gardening without, as you may say, knowing
anything about it. Think of the charm of being able to call a spade
a Hoe! without your companion, however contentious, capping the
exclamation. Then think of the long vista of possible surprises.
You dig a trenoh, and 1 gently sprinkle seed in it"
"Excuse me," I said, "but supposing I sprinkle the seed, and
you dig the trenoh P"
"The seed is carrot, let us suppose," the Member for Sark
continued, disregarding my interruption, his fine face aglow with
honest enthusiasm. "I, not being an adept, feeling my way, as it
were, towards the perfection of knowledge, put in the teed the
wrong end up, and, instead of the carrots presenting themselves to
the earnest inquirer in what is, I believe, the ordinary fashion, with
the green tops showing above the generous earth, and the spiral,
rosy-tinted, cylindrical form hidden in the soil, the limb were
to grow out of the ground, its head downward; would that be
nothing, do you think P I mention that only as a possibility that
flashed across my mind. There are an illimitable series of possi-
bilities that might grow out of Our Garden. Of course we don't
mean to make money out of it. It's only fair to you, Toby, that I
should, at the outset, beg you to hustle out of your mind any sordid
ideas of that kind. What we seek is, health and honest occupation,
and here they lie open to our hand."
This conversation, as I mentioned, took plaoe a little more than a
year ago. I was carried away, as the House of Commons never is,
by my Hon. friend's eloquenoe. We got the garden. We have it
now; but I do not trust myself on this page to dwell on the subject.

MODERN TYPES.
{By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.)
No. XXI.-THE AVERAGE UNDERGRADUATE.
Those who live much in the society of the very middle-aged, hear
from them loud and frequent complaints of the decay of courtesy
and the general deterioration, both of manners and of habits, obser-
vable in the young men of the day. With many portentous shakings
of the head, these grizzling censors inform those who care to listen
to their wailings, that in the time of their own youth it was under-
stood to be the duty of young men to be modest, considerate, gene-
rous in their treatment of one another, and chivalrous in their beha-
viour to women. And every one of them will probably suggest to
his hearers that he was intimately acquainted with at least one young
man who fulfilled that duty with a completeness and a perfection
never since attained. Now, however, they will declare, the case is
different. Young men have become selfish and arrogant. Their
respect for age has vanished, their behaviour to ladies is familiar
and flippant, their style of conversation is slangy and disreputable,
they are wanting in all proper reverence, they are pampered, luxu-
rious, affected, foolish, and disingenuous; unworthy, in short, to be
mentioned in the same breath with those who have preceded them,
and have left to their degenerate successors a brilliant but unavailing
example of youthful conduct. These diatribes may or may not be
founded to some extent in truth. At the best, however, their truth
is only a half-truth. So long as the world
endures, it is probable that young men will
have a large allowance of follies, of affecta-
tions, of extravagances, and the young men
of to-day are certainly not without them.
But, in the main, though the task of com-
parison is difficult, they do not appear to be
at all inferior in manliness, in modesty of
bearing, and in reverence to the generations
that have gone before. Here and there in
London the antics of some youth plunged
into a torrent of folly before he had had
time even to think of being wise, excite the
comments of the world. But London is not
the school to which one would look for youth
at its best To find that in any considerable
quantity one must travel either to Cambridge
or to Oxford, and inspect the average under-
graduates, who form the vast majority at
both these Universities.
Now the Average Undergraduate, as he
exists, and has for ages existed, is not,
perhaps, a very wise young man. Nor
does he possess those brilliant qualities
whioh bring the Precocious Undergraduate
to premature ruin. He has his follies, but
they are not very foolish; he has his affec-
tations, but they are innocent; he has his'extravagances, but they
pass away, and leave him not very much the worse for the experience.
On the whole, however, he is a fine specimen of the young English-
man—brave, manly, loyal, and upright. He is the salt of his
University, and an honour to the country that produces him.
The Average Undergraduate will have been an average schoolboy,
not afflicted with too great a love of classics or mathematics, and
gifted, unfortunately, with a fine contempt for modern languages.
But he will have taken an honourable part in all school-games, and
will have acquired through them not only vigorous health and
strength, but that tolerant and generous spirit of forbearance with-
out which no manly game can be carried on. These qualities he will
carry with him to the University whioh his father chooses for him,
and to which he himself looks forward rather las a home of liberty
slightly tempered by Proctors, than as a temple of learning, mode-
rated by examiners.
During the October term which makes him a freshman, the
Average Undergraduate devotes a considerable time to mastering the
etiquette of his University and College. He learns that it is not
customary to shake hands with his friends more than twice in each
term, once at the beginning, and again at the end of the term. If
he is a Cambridge man, he will out the tassel of his academical cap
short; at Oxford he will leave it long; but at both he will discover
that sugar-tongs are never used, and that the race of Dons exists
merely to plague him and his fellows with lectures, to which he pays
small attention, with enforced chapels, whioh he sometimes dares to
out, and, with general disciplinary regulations, to which he con-
siders it advisable to submit, though he is never inclined to admit
their necessity. He becomes a member of his college boat-club, and
learns that one of the objects of a regular attendance at College
Chapel is, to enable the freshman to practise keeping his back
■ straight. Similarly, Latin Dictionaries and Greek Lexicons are,
I necessarily, bulky, since, otherwise, they would be useless as seats
vol. XCTT.

on whioh the budding oarsman may improve the length of his swing
in the privaoy of his own rooms. These rooms are all furnished on
the same pattern. A table, a pedestal desk for writing, half-a-dozen
ordinary chairs, a basket arm-chair, perhaps a sofa, some photo-
graphs of school-groups, family photographs in frames, a cup or two,
won at the school athletic sports, a football cap, and a few prints of
popular pictures, complete the furniture and decorations of the
average College rooms. Of course there are, even amongst under-
graduates, wealthy aesthetes, who furnish their rooms extravagantly
—but the Average Undergraduate is not one of them.
On the fifth of November the freshman sallies forth only to find, with
a sense of bitter disappointment, that the rows between Town and Gown
are things of the past. He will have discovered ere this that under-
graduate etiquette, has ordained that while he wears a cap and gown
he must forswear gloves, and leave his umbrella at home, even though
the rain should pour down in torrents. All these ordinances he
observes strictly, though he can neither be "hauled" nor " gated"
for setting them at defiance. Towards the end of his first term he
begins to realise more accurately the joys and privileges of University
life ; he has formed his set, and more or less found his level, he has
become a connoisseur of cheap wine, he has with pain and labour
learned to smoke, he has certainly exceeded his allowance, and he
returns to his home with the firm conviction that he knows a great
deal of life. He will terrify his mother with tales of proctorial
misadventures, and will exoite the suspicions of his father by the
new brilliance of his attire. Indeed it is a curious fact that what-
ever the special pursuit of the Average
Undergraduate may he, and whatever may
be the calling and profession of his father,
the two are generally engaged in a financial
war. This always ends in the triumph of
the older man, who never scruples to use
the power whioh the possession of the purse
gives him in order to discomfit his son.
From a University point of view, the
average father has as little variety as the
average son.
It must be noted that away from the
University or bis family oircle, and in the
sooiety of ladies, the Average Undergradu-
ate is shy. The wit that flashed so brilli-
antly in the College Debating Club is
extinguished, the stream of humour that
flowed amidst shouts of laughter in the
Essay Sooiety is frozen at its Bource, the
conversation that delighted the frequenters
of his rooms is turned into an irresponsive
mumble. But as soon as he returns to the
academic groves, and knows that petticoats
are absent, and that his own beloved
"blazer" is on his baok, Richard is him-
self again. He has his undergraduate
heroes whom he worships blindly, hoping
himself to be some day a hero and worthy of worship. Moreover, there
are in every College traditions which cause the undergraduate who is
a member of it to believe that the men of that particular society are
finer fellows than the men of any other. These traditions the Average
Undergraduate holds as though they were articles of his religion.
The Average Undergraduate generally takes a respectable position
as a College oarsman or cricketer, though he may fail to attain to the
University Eight or to the Eleveu. He passes his examinations with
effort, but still he passes them. He recks not of Honours. The "poll"
or the pass contents him. Sometimes he makes too muoh noise, occa-
sionally he dines too well. In London, too, his conduct during vacations
is perhaps a little exuberant, and he is often inclined to treat the
promenades at the Leicester Square Variet y Palaces as though he had
purchased them. But, on the whole, he does but little harm to himself
and others. He is truthful and ingenuous, and although he knows
himself to be a man, he never tries to be a very old or a very wicked
one. In a word, he is wholesome. In the end he takes his degree
creditably enough. His years at the University have been years of
pure delight to him, and he will always look back to them as the
happiest of his life. He has not become very learned, hut he will
always he a useful member of the community, and whether as
barrister, clergyman, oountry gentleman, or business man, he will
show an example of manly uprightness which his countrymen could
ill afford to lose.
Fints.—The last nights on earth at the Haymarket are announced
of A Village Priett. May he rest in piece. The play that imme-
diately follows is, Called Sack; naturally enough a revival, as the
title implies. But one thing is absolutely certain, and that is, that
A Village Priett will never be Called Back. Perhaps L'Abbe" Con-
stantin may now have a chance. Eminently good, but not absolutely
saintly. Is there any chance of the Abbe being translated?"

Sniff the fetid sewer Smells-
Loathsome Smells!
What a lot of typhoid their
intensity foretells I
Through the pleasant air of
night, [blight!
How they spread, a noxious
Fall of bad baoterianmotes,
Quickening soon.
What a lethal vapour floats
To the foul Smell-fiend who
glistens as he gloats
On the boon.
Oh, from subterranean cells
What a gush of sewer-gas
voluminously wells I
How it swells I
How it dwells
In our houses 1 How it tells
Of the folly that impels
To the breeding and the
speeding
Of the Smells, Smells,
Smells,
Of the Smells, Smells, Smell?,
Smells,
Smells, Smells, Smells—
To the festering and the pes-
tering of the Smells 1

See the Spectre of the Smells-
London Smells!
What a world of retrospect
his tyranny compels 1
In the silence of the night
How we muse on the old
Of Kensington, — a Dismal
Swamp, and lone I
Still the old Swamp -
Demon floats
O'er the City, as our throats
Have long known.
And the people — ah, the
people—
Though as high as a church
steeple
They have gone
For fresh air, that Demon's tolling
In a muffled monotone
Their doom, and rolling, rolling
O'er the City overgrown.
He is neither man nor woman,
He is neither brute nor human,
He's a Ghoul;
Spectre King of Smells, he tolls,
And he rolls, rolls, rolls.
Rolls.
With his cohort of Bad Smells!
And his cruel bosom swells
With the triumph of the Smells.
Whose long tale the scribbler tells
To the Times, Timet, Timet,
Telling of " local" crimes
In the gendering of the Smells,
Of the Smells:
To the Timet, Timet, Timet,
Telling of Railway crimes,
In the fostering of Smells,—
Of the Smells, Smells, Smells,
Brick-field Smells, bone-boiling Smells,
Whilst the Demon of old times
With us dwells, dwells, dwells.
The old Swamp Fiend of moist climes 1
See him rolling with his Smells—
Awful Smells, Smells. Smells—
See him prowling with his Smells,

SEEING THE STARS.
The following paragraph appears in the
columns of the Scottish Leader:—
"Those who were out of doors in Edinburgh at
three o'clock on Saturday morning were startled by
the appearance of a brilliant meteorite in the
northern hemisphere. Its advent was announced
by a flash of light which illuminattd the whole
city. A long fiery streak marked its course, and
remained risible for more than a minute. At first
this streak was perfectly straight, but, after it had
begun to fade, it broke into a zig-zag."
The phenomenon so graphically described,
though remarkable, is not, we believe, in the
circumstances, entirely novel. Perhaps it is
noteworthy as coming a little early in the
year. We understand that on New Year'sDay,
those who are out of doors in Edinburgh at
three o'clock in the morning," are not unfre-
quently startled in somewhat similar manner.
The Tootheriks.— " Tooth's Gallery"
always strikes us as a somewhat misleading
appellation. It always appears to|have more to
do with palates than pictures, and to be more
concerned with gums than gold frames. No
doubt the head of the firm of Messrs. Arthur
Tooth and Sons is a wise Tooth, so let him
ohristen his gallery the "Arthurnreum." He
is a Tooth that you cannot stop, he is always
coming out, and this autumn he comes out
stronger than ever with a most interesting
and varied collection. Excellent examples you
may find of J. B. Burgess, J. C. Hook,
Basttkn Lepage, Tadkma.YicatColr, Peter
Graham, Mxllais, Leader, C. Calthrop,
Marcus Stone, and other notables.
THE LAST OF "MARY'S LAMB."
["A firm in Sydney have completed arrange-
ments whereby frozen sheep or lambs can be de-
livered at any address in the United Kingdom."]
Mary had a little lamb,
Which she desired to send
Across the mighty ocean as
A present to a friend.
That friend was partial to lamb chops,
Likewise to devilled kidney;
So friendly Mary promptly went
Unto "a firm in Sydney."
That firm replied, "the lamb we '11 send
By parcel to your cousin;
That is, if you do not object
To have your darling frozen."
Then Mary wept. She said, "My lamb
Has wool as white as snow;
But packed in ice? It don't sound nice,
No, Sydney Merohant, No!
'' Refrigerate my darling! Oh!
It makes my bosom bleed.
Still, go it must. I think you said,
'Delivery guaranteed!'"
So Mary's lamb the ocean crossed
By " Frozen Parcel Post;"
And Mary's Cousin said its chops
Were most delioious—most!
Moral.
Science, though it pays "cent per cent.,"
Is destitute of pity;
And makes hash of the sentiment
Dear to the Nursery ditty.

ROBERT AS HUMPIRE.
I was a takin of my
favrit walk, larst Friday
was a week, from Charing
Cross round to my own
rivet residence in Queer
street, when a yung lad
tapped me on the sholder
and said to me, "Please.
Sir, are you the sillybrated
Mr. Robebt, the Citty
Waiter?" In course I
replied. "Yes, most sut-
tenly;" when he Baid,
Then this yere letter's
for you, and I wants a
emediat arnser." Conceal-
ing my wisibel estonish-
ment, I took him hup
Healy Plaoe, where the
werry famous Lawyer
lires, as can git you out
of any amownt of trubbel,
and then opened the letter,
and read the following
most estonishing words,
wiz.: — " Mr. Robebt, —
can you come immediately
to the Club, as you
alone can decide a very
heavy wager that is now
pending between two Noble
Lords who are here await-
ing your arrival. You will
be well paid for your
trouble. The Bearer will
show you the way.—J. N."
1 eoud learn nothink from
my jewwenile guide, so I
told him to lead the way.
and off we started, and
soon arived at the Club.
I need ardly say that,
being all quite fust-rate
swells, they receaved me in
the most kindest manner,
and ewen smiled upon me
mostfreely, whioh in course
I felt as a great comple-
ment.
One on 'em then adrest
me sumwot as toilers,
"I'm sure, Mr. Roisbrt,
we are all werry much
obliged to you for ooming
so reddily at my request.
At which they all cried, "Here!
here!" "You of coarse under-
stand what wc wish you to do."
To which I at once replide,
"Quite so, my noble swells.
At which they all larfed quite
lowd, tho' I'm sure I don't kno
why. He then said that it was
thort better not to menshun the
names of any of the Gents pre-
sent, and he then presented me
with a little packet, which he
requested I woud not open till I
got home, and then proseeded to
xplain the "Wager, somthink like
this. Two of the noble Lords
present, it apeared, had disagreed
upon a certain matter, and, want-
ing a Humpire of caracter and
xperience to decide between them,
had both agreed to a surgestion
that had bin made, that of all
the many men in Lundon none
coudn't be considered more titter
for the post than Mr. Robkbt, the
sillybrated Citty Waiter!
I rayther thinks as I blusht
wisibly, and I knos as I bust out
into a perfuse prusperashun, but
PHILOMELA AND AQUILA.
[It is stated that Madame Patti presented Mr. Gladstonb with a box of voice lozenges.]

Path, take, Path, take, Grand Old
Man!
Give him voice lozenges soon as you can.
Pack them, address them, as neat as can
be,
And courteously hand them to W. G. I
Mellifluous Nightingale, melody's source
Our Golden (mouthed) Eagle hath grown
a bit hoarse;
But though Aquila's husky with age and
long fights,
His sweet Philomela will set him to-
rights.
A cough-drop, a lozenge, a jube-jube,
from you,
His larynx will strengthen and lubri-
cate too. [pipe again yet;
His old "Camp Town Jtacee" he'll
Nay — who knows ? — with you may
arrange a duet 1
The eagle is scarcely a Bong-bird, but
still, [gale's trill!
He may have a good ear for the nightin
Fair Philomel comes to old Aquila's aid!!
Faith! the picture is pretty, bo here 'tis
portrayed?
CLEOPATRA IN PARIS.

The true History. Queen Cleopatra dying from the effects of several Bites of
A«p-aragus. Or is it truer that Queen Cleopatra died from eating too
much of something " En Aspic "? Ask Sardou, Sara, & Co.
didn't say a word, but
fulled myself together as
can ginerally do when I
feels as it's necessary to
manetane my good cha-
rackter. He then said,
"The question for you to
deside is this: At a great
and most himportant Din-
ner that is about to be held
Boon, at which most of the
werry grandest swells left
in Lundon will be present,
we intends to hinterduce
'The Loving Cup;* not,"
he added, smiling, "so
much to estonish the na-
tives, as to stagger the
strangers. The question,
therefore, thatyou, as the
leading Citty Waiter of the
day, have to settle, is,
How many of the Gests
stand up while one on 'em
drinks?" Delighted to
ti ml how heasy was my
tarsk, I ansers, without
a moment's hezzitation,
"Three!" One on 'em
turned garstly pale, and
shouted out,'' What for?"
To which I replied, "One
to take off and hold up
the cover, the second to
bow, and drink out of the
Cup, and the third to pro-
tect the Drinker while he
drinks, lest any ennemy
should stab him in the
baok."
The garstly pale Gent
wanted to arsk more ques-
tions, but the rest shouted,
"Horder! Horder!" and
the fust Gent coming up to
me again, thanked me for
what he called my kindness
in camming, so I made'em
my very best bow, which
I copied from a certain
Poplar Prince, and took my
departure.
Being, I hopes, a man
of strict werassity, I never
wunce took ewen so much
as a peep at the little packet
as the Gent gave me, but I couldn't
help feeling ewery now and then
to see if it was quite safe, which
of course it was, and ewen when
I reached my umbel abode, I still
restrained my natral cunoBsity,
and sat down, and told my wun-
drus tail to the wife of my buzzom,
and then placed the little packet
in her estonished ands, which she
hopened with a slite flutter, and
then perdoosed from it Five
Golden Souveringe I If any other
noble swells wants another Hum-
pire on the same libberal terms,
let 'em send to Robkbt.
At the Alhambba. — Claude
Duval, a new monologue, music
by Edwabd Solomon. Mr. Fbank
Cblli has to "stand and deliver"
the lines of Messrs. BowrEB and
Morton. As the description
"monologue" is not suggestive
of music, why didn't the authors
invent a special name for the
entertainment, and call it the
"Solomonologue."? Most ex-
pressive.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Dead Man's Oift, by Herbert Compton; the title of wbioh
might lead one to imagine something' very weird and uncanny.
Nothing of the sort. Mr. Com pton doesn't wish to "make your flesh
creep" like the Fat Boy in Pickwick. It is only the story of a tea-
planter's romance, though the finding of the gift is most exciting.
Interesting and well written.
The Cabinet Portrait Gallery, published by Cassell & Co., with
portraits of most of our Celebrities, by Messrs. 1 >o\vne y, is excellent.
Christmas Books now make their appearance, and the first and
principal offenders in disturbing the Calendar are Messrs. Blackxe &
Son. "Among the names," says the Baron's juvenile assistant Co.
Junior, "we recognise one of our boys' most favourite authors, G. A.
Henty, who this year gives
them another exciting histori-
cal tale. By England's Aid,
which deals with the closing
events of the War of Indepen-
dence in Holland. Also Maori
and Settler, a story of the New
Zealand War, when young
England was quite a settler
for the Maori. Both recom-
mended. Hal Hungerford,hy
J. It. Hutchinson, is a good
book for boys, and A Rash
Promise, or, Meg's Secret, by
Cecilia Sklby Lowndes, is an
equally good one for girls, and
finally The Girls' Own Paper
Blackie and Son." Annual, and The Boys' Own
Paper Annual, are two very
handsome capitally illustrated gift-books." Now the Baron's cheerful
assistants have done their work, he himself, has something to say.
"No, my dear and# venerable Mr. T. Sidney Cooper, R.A.," says
the Baron to that eminent octogenarian Academician, whose "remi-
niscences" Bentley and Son have just published; "if you are
oorreotly quoted in the P. M, G., your memory is absolutely at fault
in describing Douglas Jekhold as 'Editor of Punch.' He never
was. Your account of the doings at the hebdomadal board of the
Punch Staff College must be taken with several pinches of salt, as
never once in your lengthy career have you been present at any one
of these symposia. No matter. Your health, and book!"
Permit the Baron to strongly recommend Marion Crawford's A
Cigarette-Maker's Romance. Slight indeed is the plot, and few the
dramatis persona; but the
latter are drawn with a
Meissonier-like finish, and
the simple tale is charm-
ingly and touchingly told.
The wonder of it is that so
little to tell should have
oooupied two volumes; and
a greater wonder remains,
which is, that, at the olose,
the reader should wish
there were a third. To


create this desire is, after
all, the very perfection of
the art of novel - writing.
The novelist who does not
make the reader " wish as
there was more on it," ac-
cording to the philosophic
dictum of Sam Weller on
the art of epistolary cor-
respondence, has failed.
Henceforth this novel of
Mr. Crawford's goes forth
to the world with the
A Cigarette-Maker s Bomanoe. Baron's best imprimatur.
This poor little cigarette-maker requires no puffing of her wares.
Enough that the Baron should say to his readers, •" Tolls lege J
You will be delighted with it, "II cigarette per esser felxce." It is a
charming story, says emphatically, The Baron de Book-Works.
WINTER OPERA.
Royal Italian Opera is quite a winter rose in Coven t Garden. It
blossomed well, and is doing bloomingly. How lovely and of what
happy omen is the name of Mabia Peri, whose Valentino in Les
Huguenots is worth reoording, even though it does not beat the record.
It is said to be an uninteresting part, yet I remember everybody
being uncommonly enthusiastic about this same Valentina when
Gbisi played it, and her "Valentine" was .Romeo-like Mario.
Their struggle, his Leap for Life out of the window after the great
"Tu M'ami" solo and duet, her despair, will never be forgotten.
"Nothing in the part," quotha! Nothing in the person more likely.
Signor Padilla, excellent actor, is here again. Signor Ingenio Cobsi
Hope job the East End op London under the New
Mayoralty.—If South Kensington and the Fashionable West are
now complaining of smells everywhere in the S. and S.W. district,
the City and the East End may, for one year at least, rejoice in the
supreme rule of the Savory. We can't write of Savory without adding
Moore, bo we must mention that the name of Savory is ominous for
the continuation of the Mayoralty. The Guildhall Banquets end
with a Savory. Absit omen 1

Smiles !"—does she 1 Bless her heart! Signor Abd 'i rty, as 'Abry
would say, is the energetic "Conduotor, so that Signor Lago's
'bus "full inside—all right!" ought to go along pleasantly, and
do well.
Friday.—Lucia di Lammermoor, with Mile. Stromffld in the
title role, singing well, and recalled several times by a fairly filled
house. Signor Suane, the Edgardo, looking better than he sang.
But what a fine old crusted piece of Italianised conventionality the
Opera is, with about as much to do with Scotland as it has with
Scott! From the general demeanour and appearance of the Chorra
of "Ladies and Knights," and "Friends of Lord Ashton," the
Ash tons evidently in a very second-rate set at Lammermoor. How-
ever, it must be admitted that their attitude, as spectators of Lucia'i
delirium, left nothing to desire on the score of repose— the Vebe di
Veres themselves could not have been calmer, or less concerned,
Blue chins, and sympathy expressed by semaphore action in the
good old time-honoured fashion. The "Warriors of Ravenswood'
in Lincoln green hunting costume, and the tombs of Edgardo'i

Oh, politics puzzle, and partisans vary,
In holiday autumn on Albion's shore;
But ooh! there's good business in New Tip-

So to take a look round I will take a run

In New Tipperary!

Faith! John Morlet thinks he's leary,
And he's off to Tipperary;
My policy he thinks he'll be a thorn in;
But before he comes away
He will find to spoil my play
He must get up very early in the mornin'.
Wid his bundle on his shoulder,
He thinks no man could look boulder,
And he's lavin' for Auld Ireland widout
warnin'.
For he lately took the notion
For to oross the briny ocean,
And to start for Tipperary in the mornin'.
Jons Morlet sings':—

Ye desired to help me surely,
When ye went for Tipperary widout

Though your tale could scarce be boulder,

Of matter for speeches I shall have no lack.
O'Brien and Dillon from judgment have

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

TO ENGELBERG AND BACK.
Being a few Notes taken en route in search of a Perfect Cure.
"Oh! he's ever so much better. Why he only had two
stumbles, and one eropper, doing his three hundred yards this
morning. That beats the record, anyhow."
Young J kkktman is describing the effect the Engelberg air is
already having on the Dilapidated One to several people, who have
either been invalided them-
selves, or have had invalid
relatives, or met, seen, or
heard of invalids who have
had similar satisfactory ex-
periences.
"You know, I think the
dining has a great deal to
do with the beneficent effects
of the place," remarked,
meekly, a mild-mannered
Clergyman, who, had been
brought up here apparently
to"gettone." "You can't
sit down to table with three
hundred people," he con-
tinued, meditatively; as if
the solution of the social
problem had caused him
some anxious thought,
"without being inclined to
launoh out a little more
than one does under ordi-
nary conditions at home.
Only I wish they wouldn't
think it necessary to keep
their (lining-saloon'at such
A Pleasant Little Excursion. an excessive temperature,
and waste quite so much time between the different courses."
And here the mild-mannered Clergyman had real ground for
complaint, for the German recipe for table d'hote dinner seems to
be something very much like the following:—Get a room that has
been smoked in, with closed and tightly-fastened windows and
doors, all the morning. Light the stove, if there is one, and
turn on the gas, if there is any. You begin your dinner. Take
twice, thrice, or even four times of every course, glaring savagely
and defiantly at your neighbour as you pass the dish. Sit
over each, allowing a good quarter of an hour for its proper
digestion, and keep this up till the perspiration drops from your
face. Finally, in about two hours' time, having carefully mopped
your forehead, quit the table for the "Conversations Saal."
Here (still keeping in gas and stove, if there is one) smoke till you
can't see six feet before you. Keep this up till you have had enough
of it, and feel the time is getting on for you to go through a modified
edition of the same process at supper. At least, this is how the
German element—a very formidable one at the Hotel Titlis—for the
most part, conducted itself over the principal meal of the day. There
were, of course, exceptions, for all Germany is not essentially
German; yet it must be confessed that the prevailing features were
of this guzzling, and, for the want of a more descriptive word, 1
would add, "sweltering " type, not folly appreciated by the ordinary
travelling Briton, who, whatever else he may be, is not a gross
feeder, though he does set the proper value on a breath of pure
fresh air.
"Qet him up P Of course we can get him up," rejoined Br. Mel-
ciiisi dec, warmly. This in answer to some doubts expressed by one
of the more cautious spirits of our party as to the possibility of
dragging the Dilapidated One over one of the stock excursions of the
neighbourhood, to wit, the Fiirren Alp. "Why, put him into a
chaise a porteur. and we could get him up the Titlis itself, and
throw in the Schlossstock, and the Gross-Spannort, for the matter of
that, as.welL Baedeker makes only a two and a half hours' affair of it."
And so we find ourselves in due oourse, doing the " Fiirren-Alp"
in approved style.
"By Jove, 1 '11 be hanged if I think it's a bit better than going
up Primrose Hill, twenty times running: and not near such good
going either," observes young Jkhbyman, after we have been
struggling up a precipitous mountain path, occasionally fini3'-
ourselves sliding and slipping backwards in the bed of a disi

SCIENCE AND HEART.
"A Correspondent of ' the Field' records an experiment which he made
with a wasp. 'Having,' he says,' severed
a wasp in two pieces, I found that the
head and thorax with the uninjured
wings retained full vitality ... It tried
to ily, but evidently lacked the necessary
balance through the loss of the abdomen.
To test the matter further, I cut out an
artificial tail from a piece of thin card-
board, as nearly following the shape of the
natural body as possible. To fasten the
appendage to the wasp, I used a little
oxgall . . .; gum or more sticky sub-
stances would not do, as it impedes the
use of the wings in flight. Presently the
operation was complete, and, to my sur-
prise, the wasp, after one or two inef-
fectual efforts, flew in rather lopsided ~
fashion to the window. It then bussed
about for at least a quarter of an hour,
eventually flying out at the top . . . it was_vigorous when it flew away.

Witness the droll experiment
Of this same scientific gent.
For he, his frugal breakfast finishing,
(The eggs and bacon fast diminishing)
Noted how o'er his marmalade
A Wasp was buzzing undismayed.
We all are apt to be inhosp-

That Ishmael of domestic insects,
The terror of the feminine sex!
And our Philosopher, though cool,
Was no exception to the rule.
He let it settle on his plate;
He poised a knife above—like Fate.
Next—with a sudden flash it drops
Right on that unsuspecting Wopse I
Which, unprepared by previous omen,
Awestruck, confronts its own abdomen I
And sees its once attached tail-end dance

To see that ineffectual torso
Go fluttering about the floor so;
Science informs him that, divided,
A wasp for flight is too lopsided.
So, with remorsef illness acute,
He rigged it up a substitute;
Providing it a new posterior,
At least as good—if not superior.
He cut it out a tail of card,
And stuck it on with ox-gall, hard.

Away, with self-respect restored
To find that mutilated part of his

To pen and ink and paper hastened,

Told how the Wasp, though halved, was

And how, despite a treatment rigorous,
It left consoled—and even vigorous 1

"The labouring men, as a cl«s«. are rapidly

the stronger of the two. . . . They must be con-

Labour and Capital may hare separate interests,

united."—Mr. Gladstone at West Calder.

So the youthful Poet Laureate pictured it in limpid verse;
Now the Federations fight each other I Better is't, or worse?

"GIVE IT TO THE BARD I"
Mb. Robert Inqkrsoll speaking of. and at, Poet Walt Whit-
man on the occasion of presenting the aged and eccentric poet
with the "long contemplated testimonial," to quote The Time;
said, that "W. W. is intellectually hospitable"—this sounds like
* ready to take in anybody'—" but he refuses to acoept a creed
merely because it is wrinkled, old, and white-bearded. Hypocrisy
wears a venerable look; and relies on its mask to hide its stupidity
and fear." Now this was rather rough on the Bard, who is described
as " an interesting figure, with his long white hair falling over his
shoulders." It seemed as if Robert Ingf.rsoll wished to imply,
Don't be taken in and accept W. W. at his own poetic valuation as
a poet, simply because he is wrinkled, old, white-haired, and wears
a venerable look, which, after all, may be only a hypocritical mask?
Mr. Ingebsoll couldn't have been more infelicitous if he had
"come to bury 'W hitman,' not to praise him." Then he went on,
"Neither does Whitman accept everything new." This dearly
excepted the testimonial, which, we may suppose, was brand new,
or at all events, had been so at tome time or other, though having
been "long contemplated" it might have got a trifle dusty or
mouldy. Then finished the orator, magnificently, epigrammatically,
and emphatically, thus "He" (»'.«., Walt Whitman) "wants
truth." And with all our heart and soul we reply, " We wish he
may get it."

EMPLOYMENT OF CAPITAL.
Sib,—In the St. James's Gazette of Thursday week there was a
quotation from Mr. Buchanan's Modern Review, where, in support
of his opinions, he quotes "Pope passim." Whatever maybe the
outward and visible form of Mr. Buchanan's religion, it is dis-
courteous, at least, even for an ultra-Presbyterian Scotchman, to
spell the name of a Pope without making the initial letter a capital,
and it is unlike a Scotchman not to make capital out of anything.
Here, I may say, that Mr. Buchanan's contributions to recent
journalistic! literature have been mostly capital letters. But to
return. Why Pope passim, and not Pope Passim, or Pope Passim?
Is it not mis-spelt? In vain have I searched history for the name of
this Pope. Searehimus iterum. But I must protest, in the mean
time, of this particularly mean way of Bu-ohananising a Roman
Pontiff. Please accept this as a Memo fbom Nemo.
Something in a Name.—" Mora Tod Stobmouth Darling" (any
other names f) "Esq., Advocate, Q.C., H.M.'s Solicitor-General for
Scotland "—phew!—a good mouthful all this, almost as great as
"John Richard Thomas Alex ander D w yer," of Rejected Addresses

Moib the Merrier! Ton is the first half of Tod-dy which is the
foundation of whiskey. Your health, More Toddy! Stor- mouth is
as good a mouth as any other, whatever mouth may be chosen to store
away more Toddy. And finally, "Dablino " is a term sometimes
lawful, rarely legal, of endearment, and henceforth in Scotlaid
Stobmouth not " Chabue" is "our Dabling, our gay Cavalier'."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN OUR GARDEN.

VERY odd thing. Just as
we had got into Oar Garden,
were, so to speak, turning up
our sleeves to hoe and dig, I
hare been called away. It is
Mr. G. who has done it. The
other day the Member for
Sark and .1 were out weeding
the walk—at least he was
weeding, and I was remarking
to him on the health fulness of
out - door occupation, more
especially when pursued on
the knees. Up comes the gar-
dener with something on a
pitchfork. Thought at first it
was a new development of the
polyanthus. (We are always
growing strange things. The
Member for Sark says, "In
Our Garden it is the unex-
pected that happens."} Turned
out to be a post-card. Our
gardener is very careful to keep up our new character. If the missive had been
brought to us in the house, of course it would have been served up on a plate.
In the garden it is appropriately handed about on a pitch-fork.
"My dear Toby" (this is the post-oard), "I'm just going up to Edinburgh;
another Midlothian Campaign; You have been with me every time; don't desert
me now; have something quite new and original to say on the Irish Question;
would like you to hear it. Perhaps you never heard of Mitchelstown P Been
looking up particulars. Mean to tell the whole'story. Will be nioe and fresh;
come quite a shock on Balfock. Don't fail; Yours ever, W. E. G."
Didn't fail, and here I am, not in Our Garden, but in Edinburgh. Left the
Member for Sark in charge. A little uneasy; never know from day to day
what his well-meant but ill-directed energy may not achieve. At least the
oelery will be safe. One day, after I had worn myself out with watohing gardener
dig trenoh, Sark came along, and in our absence filled it up. Said it looked
untidy to have long hole like that in respectable garden. Supposed we had
been laying a drain; quite surprised we weren't pleased, when he gleefully
announced he had filled it up.
Just come back from great meeting in Corn Exchange. Diffioult to realise
that it's eleven years since Mr. G. here in first campaign. A great deal hap-
pened in meantime, but enthusiasm just the same. Mr. G. I suppose a trifle
older, but Rosebeby still boyish-looking. Proceedings opened with procession
of Delegates presenting addresses to Mr. G. Excellently arranged; reflects
great credit on Pat Campbell. (Capital name that for manager of variety
troupe.) Leading idea was to present imposing representation of Liberal Scotia
doing homage to its great chief. Pat oaught on at once. Engaged thirty stal-
wart men: none of your seedy sandwich-board fellows; responsible-looking
burghers of all ages and sizes. Got them together in room at left door of stage
—I mean of platform; free breakfast; oatmeal oake; unstinted heather-honey
and haddocks. Mr. G. seated in chair in very middle of stage, the place, you
know, where great tragedians insist upon dying. Prompter's bell rings; Dele-
gates file in, every man with what looks like a red truncheon in right hand;
advanoe slowly along front of stage till reach chair where Mr. G. sits, appa-
rently buried in deep thought.
"What ho!" he cries, looking up with a start.
"My liege," says the sandwich-board man—I mean the Delegate,"I bring
hither the addressof the Possilpark, Lambhill, Dykehead, Camburnathen, Wishaw,
Dalbeattie, Catrine, and Sorn Liberal and Radical Association. Will I read it t
"I think not," said Rosebeby, quietly, bnt firmly, and
the Delegate, handing the red thing to Mr. G., passed on.
Mr. G. smiling and bowing; audience applauded;
next man comes. He's from the Duntooher, Faifley,
Slamannan, Cockpen, Pennicuik, Clackmannan, Car-
noustie, Kirkintilloch, and Lenzie Junior Liberal Asso-
ciation. He also wants to read the Address, but is mer-
oifully hustled off, and the line, ever emerging from
L. of stage, crosses, and passes on. At other side, Pat
Campbell waiting; a little anxious lest anything should
go wrong to spoil his carefully-devised plan. But every-
thing went well.
"Get ye away now," Pat whispered in ear of the man
from Possilpark, &o.
Possilpark, &c, at the clue, darted round rear of stage:
got round in good time to L.; fell into line, and was
ready to come on again. Same with the rest. Immense
success I At the end of first three-quarters of an hour,
Pat Campbell arranged a block; pressure of innumerable
Delegates so great, doncha, couldn't move off the stage
in time. This gave opportunity for two of the stoutest
burghers to go through quick change; reappeared,
dressed in kilts. This fairly fetched down house.
"The interminable procession," as Rosbbeby slyly
called it, might have gone on till now, so perfect were
the arrangements. But there was some talk of Mr. 0.
making a speech, and, at end of hour and fifty minutes
the last Delegate slowly crossed in front of delighted
audience, handed his red baton to Mr. G., who, though
he had entered thoroughly into the' fun of the thing, was
beginning to look a little fagged, and the speaking began.
This was excellent, especially Rosebeby s introduction
of the travelling Star; a model of terse, felicitous lan
Cage. Only one hitch here. Speaking of Mr. G.'s
aoured age, he likened him to famous Doge of Venice,
"old Dahdolo." Rosebeby very popular in Edinburgh.
But audience didn't like this; something like groan oi
horror ran along crowded benches.
"Nae, nae," said one old gentleman, momentarily
taking his knees out of the small of my baok, "that
winna do. 'Auld Wr/Li.rE' is weel enoo, bnt to ca' a
man Auld Dandolo to his face gars me greet." (Often met
with this phrase in songs and Scotch novels: curious to
see how it was done: fancy, from what followed, it's Scotch
for taking snuff.)
Barring this slip, everything went well. Gladstone
delightful. So fresh, so informing, and so instructive!
Began with lucid account of Battle of Waterloo; lightly
sketched the state of parties at the period of the Reform
agitation in 1832; glanced in passing at the regrettable
conflict between the Northern and Southern States of
America ("sons of one mother" as he pathetically put
it); and so glided easily and naturally into a detailed
account of the meUe at Mitchelstown, which, as he in-
cidentally mentioned, took place four years and a half ago.
Audience sat entranced. You might have heard a
pin drop, if indeed you wanted to. I wish the Member
tor Sark had been here to hear it. He would have
been much more usefully employed than in that hopeless
pursuit to whioh he has given himself up, the growing of
the peelless potato. He '11 never do it.
Cornwall in Bakeb Street.—The worst of Cornwall
is, it is so far off—indeed, it has hitherto been quite out of
sight. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait.
We waited, and Mr. John Holllngshead brought Niagara
to Westminster. We waited again, and Mr. Abthcb
Vokiss brings Cornwall to Baker Street, and introduces
us to a very clever young sea-scapist, Mr. A. Wabbe-
Bbowne—altogether a misnomer, for he isn't a worn
brown at all, he is as fresh and bright and sharp as a newly
minted sovereign. Go and look at his "Lizard and Stags]'
—he isn't an animal-painter, though the title looks like it
—his "Breaking Weather," his "Sain Veils," his'[Innii
Head," or any one of his thirty pictures, and say if you
don't agree with Mr. Punch. The whole of them are so
true to Nature, are so faithful in their wave-drawing, there
is such a breeziness, such a saltness pervades them through-
out, and they 'so accurately convey the character of the
Cornish coast, that Mr. P. felt quite the Cornishman, and
is unable to decide whether he is the Tre Punch or the Pol
Punch. On mature deliberation, he concludes he is the
Pen Punch. There's no doubt about that'

{By Tom Rum Summer, Author of " Miqnon's Ma," "Mignoris Hub,"

[" This," writes (the] eminent Author, "is a real, true story of the life of
soldiers and children. Soldiers are grand, noble fellows. They are so
manly, and all smoke a great deal of tobacco. My drawl is the only genuine
one. I could do a lot more of the same sort, hut I charge extra for pathos.
I'm a man.-T. R. 8."]
Chapter I.
"Three blind mice—
See how they run."—Old Song.
The Officers of the Purple Dragoons were gathered together in
their ante-room. It was a way they had. They were all there.
Grand fellows, too, most of them—tall, broad-shouldered, and silky-
haired, and as good as gold. That gets tiresome after a time, hut
everything can be set right with one downright rascally villain—a
villain, mind you, that poor, weak women, know nothing about.
Gator was that kind of man. Of course that was why he was to
break his neck, and get smashed up generally. But I am anticipat-
ing, and a man should never anticipate. Emily, for 'instance, never
did. Emily— Captain Emily, of the Purple Dragoons—waB the
biggest fool in the Service.
Everybody told him so: and
Emily, who had a trustful, loving
nature, always believed what he
was told.
*'I_nev-ah twry," he used to
say—it was a difficult word to
pronounce, but Emily always
stuck to it as only a solJier can.
and got it out somehow—"I
nev-ah twry to wremember things
the wwrong way wround."
A roar of laughter greeted this
sally. They all knew he meant
"anticipate," but they all loved
their Emily far too well to set
him right.
"'Pon my soul," he continued,
"it's quite twrue. You fellows
may wroawr wiv laughtewr if
you like, but it's twrue, and
you know it's twrue."
There was another explosion
of what Emily would have
called "mewrwriment," at this,
for it was well-known to be
one of the gallant dragoon's
most humorous efforts. A
somewhat protracted silence fol-
lowed. Footles, however, took it in both hands, and broke it
with no greater emotion than he would have shown if he had been
called upon to charge a whole squadron of Leicestershire Bullfinches,
or to command a Lord Mayor's escort on the 9th of November.
Dear old Footles! He wasn't olever, no Purple Dragoon could be.
but he wasn't the biggest fool in the Service, like Emily, and all
the rest of them. Still he loved another's.
In faot, whenever a Purple Dragoon fell in love, the objeot of his
affections immediately pretended to love someone else. Hard lines,
but soldiers were born to suffer. It is so easy, so true, so usual to
say, "there's another day to-morrow," but that never helped even
a Purple Dragoon to worry through to-day any the quicker. Poor,
brave, noble, drawling, manly, pipe-Bmoking fellows! On this
particular occasion Footles uttered only one word. It was short,
and began with the fourth letter of the alphabet. But he may be
pardoned, for some of the glowing embers from his magnificent
briar-wood pipe had dropped on to his regulation overalls. The
result was painful—to Foott.es. All the others laughed as well as
they could, with clays, meerschaums, briars, and asbestos pipes in
their months. And through the thick cloud of scented smoke the
mess-waiter came into the room, bearing in his hand a large registered
letter, and coughing violently.
Chapter II.

"The mouse ran up the elock."—Nursery Rhyme.
The waiter advanced slowly to Footles, and handed him the
letter. Footles took it meditatively, and turned it over in both
hands. The post-marks were illegible, and the envelope much
crumpled. "Never mind," thought Footles, to himself, "it will
dry Btraight—it will dry straight. He always thought this twice,
because it was one of his favourite 'phrases. At last he decided to
open it. As he broke the seal a little cry was heard, and suddenly,
before even Emily had had time to say "I nev-ah!" a charming
and beautifully dressed girl, of about fifteen summers, sprang lightly
from the paoket on to the mess-room floor, and kissed her pretty
little hand to the astonished Dragoons.
"You're Footles," she said, skipping up to the thunder-stricken
owner of the name. "I know you very well. I'm going to be
your daughter, and you 're going to marry my mother. Oh, it's all
right," she continued, as she observed Footles press his right hand
convulsively to the precise spot on his gorgeous mess-waistcoat
under which he imagined his heart to be situated, "it's all right.
Pa's going to be comfortably killed, and put out of the way, and
then you'll marry darling Mamma. She'll be a thousand times
more beautiful at thirty-three than she was at twenty-two, and
ever so much more lovely at fifty-five than at thirty-three. So it's
a good bargain, isn't it, Em?" This to Emily, who appeared con-
fused. She trotted up to him, and laid her soft blooming cheek
against his blooming nard one. "Never mind, Em," she lisped,
"everything is bound to oome out right. I've settled it all "—this
with a triumphant look on her baby-face—" with the author; such
a splendid writer, none of your twaddling women-scribblers, but a
real man, and a great friend of mine. I'm to marry you, Em.
You don't know it, because you onoe loved Naomi, who 'mawrwried
the Wrevewrend Solomon'"—at this point most of the Purple
Dragoons were rude enough to yawn openly. She paid no attention
to them—" and now you love Olive, but she loves Parxack, and he
doesn't love her, so she has got
to marry Parkoss, whom she
doesn't love. Their initials are
the same, and everybody knows
their oaligraphy is exactly alike,"
she went on wearily, "so that's
how the mistake arose. It's a bit
far-fetched, but," and her arch
smile as she said this would have
melted a harder heart than
Captain Emily's, "we mustn't be
too particular in a soldier's tale,
you know."
As she concluded her remarks
the door opened, and Colonel
Purser entered the room.
Chapter III.
"Pat a cake, pat a cake, baker's man."
Old Ballad.
Colonel Purser was a stout,
plethoric man. He was five feet
seven inches high, forty-five
inches round the chest, fifty
inches round the waist, and every
inch of him was a soldier. He
was, therefore, a host in himself.
He gasped, and turned red, but,
like a real soldier, at onoe grasped
the situation. The Colonel was powerful, and the situation, in spite
of all mv pains, was not a strong one. The struggle was short.
"Pardon me," said the Colonel, when he had recovered his wind,
"is your name Mionon?"
"Yes," she replied, as the tears brimmed over in her lovely eyes,
"it is. I am a simple soldier's child, but, oh, I can run so beauti-
fully—through ever so many volumes, and lots of editions. In faot,"
she added, confidentially, "I don't see why I should stop at all, do
you? Emily mutt marry me. He can't marry Olive, because Dame
Nature put in her eyes with a dirty finger. Ugh! I've got
blue eyes."
"But," retorted the Colonel, quickly, "shall you never quarrel P"
"Oh yes," answered Mignon, "there will come a rift in the
hitherto perfect lute of our friendship (the rift's name will be
Darket), but we shall manage to bridge it over—at least Tom Rum
Summer says so." Here Emily broke in. He could stand it no
longer. "Dash it, you know, this is wewry extwraowrdinawry,
wewry extwraowrdinawry indeed," he observed; "You'wre a
most wremawrkable young woman, you know."
A shout of laughter followed this remark, and in the fog of
tobacco-Bmoke Colonel Purser could be dimly seen draining a
magnum of ohampagne.
Chapter IV.
"Hey diddle, diddle."—Songs and Romances.
EvERYTHlKO fell out exactly as Mignon prophesied. But if you
think that yon've come to the end of Mioron, I oan only say you 're
very much astray, or as Emily, with his smooth silky voice, and
his smoother silkier manners, would have said, "You'wre wewry
muoh astwray." See my next dozen stories.

A BOOTHIFUL IDEA!
Just finished my article on "Ante-
diluvian Archaeology in its relation
to Genesis and the Iliad," and now
all that remains to do is to carry the
rest of my books down to the new
library, make catalogue, consider
subjeots for five more speeches, write
thirty-six letters and postcards, and
polish off the ten last clauses of the
Home-Rule Bill. This idleness is
oppressive. Not used to it. What
shall I do?
Piles of correspondence by morning

tury just out, of course. Glad I
thought of starting " Society of Uni-
versal Beneficence." Will keep me
eoing after excitement of Midlothian.
Wonder how many people will " bind
themselves to give away a fixed pro-
portion of their income,"—also what
the proportion will be, if they do.
Don t know if I should have thought
of it, if it hadn't been for General
Booth's book. Remarkable person,
the General. Perhaps he'd order
his Army to vote solid for Home
Rule, if I offered him a place in my
next Cabinet? Must sound him on
the subject. Salvationists quite a
power now. Can't cut Field-Marshal
Von Booth up in a Magazine, so
must out him out instead!

ficenoe Society. Thought of doing

The R. L. Oh, I think yon are so right. Because, after all, it is
only a Pastel, isn't it? ana it oughtn't to pretend to be anything else.

as if it was successful, either—it won't bear being looked into
at all olosely.
The 8. P. Ton should never look at a Pastel closely; they are
meant to be seen from a distance.
The R. L. (brightly). Or else you miss the effect? I quite see.
Now, I like this—(indicating a vague and streaky little picture) —
don't you P That's what I call a real Pastel.
The S. P. {screwing up his eyes). H'm! Yes. Perhaps. Clever-
ish. Suggestive.
The R. L. (shocked). Oh, do you think so? I don't see anything
of that kind in it—at least, I don't think it can be intentional.
The 8. P. The beauty of Art is to suggest, to give work for the
imagination.
The R. L. (recovering herself). I know so exactly what you mean
just as one makes all sorts of things out of the patches of damp on
an old ceiling?
The S. P. Hardly. I should define Damp as the product of
Nature—not Art.
The R. L. Oh, yes; if you put it in that way, of course .' I only
meant it as an illustration—the two things are really as different as
possible. (Changes the subject.) They don't seem to mind what
coloured paper they use for Pastels, do they?
The 8. P. (oracularly). It is—er—always advisable in Pastels to
use a tone of paper to harmonise as nearly as possible with the par-
ticular tone you—er—want. Because, you see, as the colour
doesn't always cover the whole of the paper, if the paper whioh
shows through is different in tone, it—er
The R. L. Won't match? I see. How olcverl (She arrives at
a highly eccentric composition, and ventures upon an independent
opinion.) Now I can't say I oare for that—there s so very little done
to it, and what there is is so glaring and crude, don't you think?
I oall it stupid.
The S. P. I was just about to say that it is the cleverest thing in
the Exhibition—from an artistic point of view. No special interest
in it, but the scheme of colour very harmonious—and very decorative.
The R. L. Oh, isn't it P That's just the right word for it-it is
so decorative 1 and I do like the scheme of colour. Yes, it's very
clever. I quite feel that about it. (With a gush.) It is so nice

EXCELLENT EXA.MPLE.
In a recent trial for Breaoh of Promise, a letter was read from
Defendant saying that'' he must now get a monkey ;" whereupon the
"learned Under-Sheriff," as reported in the Daily Telegraph, ex-
claimed, "A Monkey'. What the goodness does he mean?' Now,
im'tthat better than saying, "What the deuoe?" Of oourse, no
doubt the learned Under- Sheriff is sufficiently learned to remember the
old rhyme— « There was an old man of Domingo
Who'd a habit of Bwearing, ' By Jingo!'
But a friend having come
Who suggested ' By Gum!'
He preferred it at once to 1 By Jingo!'"
The goodness of the learned Under-Sheriff is worthy of all praise,
and of general imitation.
Sweets to the Sweet.—It is stated that one of the features of
the Lord Mayor's Show this year is to be a Detachment of the Sur-
vivors of the Balaclava Charge. This is an excellent idea, that may
be developed to almost any extent. Could we not have the Hero who
had read every Novel that has been published during the last six
months; the Brave Man who has been to every Dramatic Matinee
since January; and the Scorner of Death, who has existed during
an entire season in the odours (sweet, or otherwise) of Kensington and
Tyburnia? The latter on the present occasion might immediately
precede the Lord Mayor Eleot, for, by association of ideas, he would
certainly serve as an excellent foil to Mr. Alderman Savory!

Monday.—Rentrie of Miss Maggie McInttbe. appropriately enough
ji Marmmrite. "She's Maointyrely first-rate," says our blast' young
man, on being caught napping after the Opera,
and interviewed on the spot, "hut oan't say much
for the rest,"—except the rest he took himself.
Tuesday.—Our blase young man went to this,
but as we only saw him for a moment passing in
a cab, when he looked out, and bade us a " Good
night," we can only suppose that it was " a good
night" at the Opera. He writes to say that the
performance of The Huguenots was excellent,
Gidlia Ravooli being specially good, but the
draughts too strong. What draughts t
Wednesday.—La Oioconda. A good perform-
ance all round. But the night specially memor-
able as being the first appearance of Miss Grack
Damian on the stage of the Royal Italian Opera
anywhere. It is a good omen for her that she
appeared in Signor Ponchielli's Opera, the oom-
Uur Importer hoff to pogg, faing a distant connection of the great
theiiopera. Italian family of the Poncinelli, of
which Mr. Punch is now the chief universal representative. It
is a remarkable fact, too, showing the strong force of canine attach-
ment, whioh centuries cannot obliterate, that the Libretto of La
Oioconda, set to music by Signor Ponchiblli (the "h" came in
when the genuine liquid "n" was
dropped) was written by Tobia
Gokivio. That an Opera, written by
Tobia, or Tobt, and com-
posed by Pr/RCDTELLO,
should possess all the ele-
ments of success, goes with-
out saying. We welcome
Signor Galassi (a sporting
title, reminding us of Gay
Lass), with Mahia Peri (who must
appear in II Paradiso), and Giulia
Ravooli. Her Oraoe of Damian
made a most successful debut as La
Cieca, and was oheered to the echo.
Thank Heaven, there isn't an echo in
Co vent Garden—but, if there had
been, Echo would have repeated hos-
pitably the "good cheer" a dozen
times, as she does somewhere about
Killarney. Signor Laoo stars "Her
Majesty the Qoebn" at the head of
his bill, but it is only to say that Her
Mim Damian m La Cieca feeling Gracious Majestt has been graciously
ei way' pleased to honour him by subscribing
for the Royal Box during the present season, which is, in effect,
Baying that he has let the best box in the house for a Sovereign .'
Thursday Night.—Albani as the unhappy Traviata. Big and
enthusiastic House. Signor Papilla, as the Elder Germont, excel-
lent, and jutt contrived moat gracefully to refuse the honour of
an encore for his " Di Provenza." Since Ronconi, it is difficult to call
to mind an artist equal histrionically to Signor Padilla, who is so
grave and impressive a*, that utter bore, "the Elder Germont," so gay
and eccentric as Figaro, and so dashing and reckless as the unscru-
pulous Don Giovanni. That milksop, Germont Junior, known as
tely played by Signor Giannini, whi

.ose name,
would partly describe the character he
Alfredo, was adequal
were it spelt Gia-" kinny,
represented.
Friday Night.—Oxa blase" young man writes to say, "I am
suffering from effects of draughts at Opera. Think it must be some
Operatic air which has given me cold. It's a gruel case for yours
truly."
Saturday Night.—Occasion described as "popular;" and, conse-
quently, II Trovalore announced. A little old-fashioned, but what
of that? Verdi just the composer "to keep your memory green."
Alas! cold once more to the front. The blase" one still off duty, so
no reliable report to hand. No doubt everything passed off plea-
santly. Manrico obviously, when on the stage, more of a man than
Germont Junior. The standing line has been, large audience much
pleased with the entertainment." Altogether a successful week.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO ENGELBESG AND BACK.
Being a few Notes taken en route in starch of a Perfect Cure.
"Give him another month here, and he '11 be giving? yon all the
slip, and walking back to Calais on foot." Young Jerryman is
commenting on the wonderful restoration that has taken place in
the condition of the Dilapidated One, who has just been detected
having a row on the lake, all by himself. Not that this is a very
prodigious aquatic feat, seeing that three or four good strokes
either way take yon either into the bank, or on to the heels or tails
of a couple of very ill-tempered and irascible swans, who appear
to think, and with some reason, that there's not too much water-
way as it is, and resent the intrusion of the boat on their domain
as a ridiculous superfluity. However, the effort is one that the
Dilapidated One would not have ventured on at his arrival a month
since, and as our time is up, and we are starting on our return
journey home in about half-an-hour's time, we hail it as an indica-
tion that if he has not quite obtained the Perfect Cure, that Mb
medical man promised him, as the result of a trip to this delightful
spot, he is certainly not far off it.
But the best things must come to an end, and so we find ourselves
at length, with much regret, taking our farewell of that excellent
and capitally-conducted " Perfect Kurhaus" the Hotel Titlis. And
this reminds me, that in justice to that establishment, I ought to
state that some comments I made last week on German feeding in
general, in no way were meant to refer to the table d'hote at the
Hotel Titlis, which, served in a lofty and well-ventilated salon,
lighted by electricity, to four hundred people daily, a capitally well-
appointed meal, is one of the notable features of the place. The
smoke-stifled children of the Fatherland, who Bhut every window
they come across when they get a chance, though they would dearly
like to, cannot carry their tricks on here. Sometimes, but not very
often, they rally in force, and render the "Grosser Gesellschafts
Saal" a sort of Tophet to the ordinary Briton: but the "Speise
Saal," where smoking is " verboten," is happily beyond their reaoh.
But the hour of departure has come, and quitting his comfortable
establishment with much regret, we bid good-bye to the courteous
Herr Cattani, and with a crack of the whip we arc off, dashing
down the valley, and leaving Engelberg up on its heights as a
pleasant dream behind us.
And what is Engelberg? There is, first and foremost, par excel-
lence, the feature of the place—the Hotel Titlis; then the Monastery,
with the Brethren of the Bell-rope; and the Street. This is unique.
Set out with a Chalet here, a Swiss Pension there, a Chapel perched
up on a little hill on one side, and a neatly new-made farmhouse
stuck up on the other, with cattle (not omitting their dinner-bells)
dotted about
here and there
in the bright
green meadows
that creep up
to, and melt
into, the pine
woods stretch
ing from the
base of the
grand rugged
snow - capped
heights that
tower in every
direotion
above, you get
thoroughly
impressed with
,, ,,- , , ,, „ , tne idea that
Putting Up for the Winter. the whole
place is nothing but a box of toys, Bet out for the season (probably
by the Monks), who, you feel convinced, are only waiting for the
departure of the last visitor, to get out the box, and carefully pack
away Chalet, and Pension, Chapel and peasant for the winter
months, with a view to keeping them fresh for production in the
early summer of next year.
However, whatever its fate, Engelberg is left behind us, and we
find ourselves tearing down the Practical Joking Engineers' Road at
a break-neck pace, and hurrying on to Calais, once more to take our
places on our steady old friend, the Calais-Douvres, that helps to
deposit us finally at Charing Cross, where we are bound to admit
that the air, whatever it is, is emphatically not the air of Engelberg.
But everybody who has seen him, says the Dilapidated One has come
back "twice the man he was." So we must take it that our journey
has not been in vain.
Additional Title.—Sir Edwin Arnold, after his brilliant
letters in the D. T., worthy of The Light of the World, will be
remembered in Japan as a "first-rate sort of Jap."


OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Wells, Gardner, Dabton & Co. publish a very good selection of
tales for young people. Among the best are Tom's Opinion, a boy
whose ever readily-expressed opinion is made to change pretty often;
and Halt! by the same author. The title is suggestive of military
manoeuvres, but it's only
a term for obeying quickly,
which is hard to do some-
times. Gregory of the
Foretop, Abbot's Cleeye,
and Going for a Soldier,
are three books containing
several stories suitable to
more grown-up young
people,—so the sooner they
grow up the better for the
sale of the books. They
are all edited by J. E rsk i n- e
Clakkk, M.A.
Frederick Wabne & Co.
give us Young England's
Nursery Tales, illustrated
by Constance Haslewood.
Xw- Noah's Ark, by Darlet
'Dale, whioh is not the Ark
of the nursery, but a story of the Norfolk Broads. Perhaps
"Norfolk Broads" would have suggested stories that could not be
told in a drawing-room. As to Bits about Horses for Every Day,
selected and illustrated by S. Turner,—well, what would horses be
without " bits?" These are not tit-bits. Might do for a Bridle gift.
The Love of a Lady, by Miss Annie Thomas, otherwise Mrs.
Pender Cud lip, like most of this authoress's novels, is full of
interest. It is in the regulation three volumes, but appears as if it
had wished to be in two, and would have been had not large type
insisted upon the addition of a third tome. The love of a lady is
transferred, during the course of the story, from an artist, who
appears in the last chapter "in threadbare clothes, with broken,
patched boots on his feet" (not on his hands, bien entendu)l to a
"well-tailored" novelist. As the lady to whom the love" originally
belonged was "a popular illustrator," it was only natural that the
question of appearances should play an important part in deter-
mining its ultimate destination.
Mr. W. Outrah Tristram is never so muoh in his element as
when he revels in gore and guilt. In Locusta, in one bulky volume,
he tells of " the crime" and "the chastisement." The first is asso-
ciated with " a house with curtained windows." " an Italian swords-
man," "entombed," and "a maimed lion, and the second is
developed in ohapters headed, "The Hunter lets fly a Poisoned
8haft,fi "The Silver Dish of Tarts," "The First Victim Falls,"
"A Dreadful Accuser," and last, but not least, "The Vengeance is
Crowned." As the story begins in 1612, and ends with the words,
"Henry, Prince of Wales, art thou not avenged?" it will be seen,
that Mr. W. Outram Tristram has seized this opportunity to plea-
santly illustrate an incident from English history.
My faithful "Co." has been revelling in the Land of Fancy. He
expresses delight at two books called respectively, Dreams by
French Firesides and English Fairy Tales. The first is supposed
to have been written before Paris in 1870-71 by a German soldier
who had turned his thoughts to his home and children in the far-off
Fatherland. The second deals with British folk-lore, and is racy of
the soil. Both works are full of capital illustrations. He has, moreover,
read He Went for a Soldier, the Wtnter Annual of John Strangk
of that ilk. But what had the soldier done, that " he" should " go
for him" P The answer to this conundrum will be ascertained on
reading the book. Nutshell Novels, by J. Ashby Sterrt, is also a
volume that repays perusal. The Lazy Poet has turned his leisure
to good account—the stories he tells are excellent.
Had the delightfully original Alice in Wonderland, and Through
the Looking- Glass, never been written, I doubt mush if we should
ever have seen Maggie in Mythica, by F. B. Doveton, who
announces it apologetically, as "his first''—perhaps it may be his
"unique" fairy story,—and he adds, that ne has "kept out of
the beaten track as far as possible." As far as possible" is good,
for never was there such an example of the "sincerest flattery"
than in this undeniable imitation of Alice in Wonderland. Some
of the illustrations, by J. Harrington Wilson, are not quite as
weak as the text, while the best of them only serve to heighten our
appreciation of Our" Mr. Tennibl's pictures in Alice, and its
companion volume. But the very title, Maggie in Mythica, recalls
at once Alice in Wonderland, but the lovers of Alice, who being
attracted by this title may purchase this book under the impression
that "it is the same concern," will soon find out their mistake,
though it may perhaps amuse a very muoh younger generation who
know not Alice, if suoh a generation exist, whioh muchly we beg
to doubt.

square), at one of the Schools of Instruction.
The Com. Well, let us suppose that you have become duly qualified
to command a company—what next P
Off. Having reached this point. I find myself called upon to work
as hard as any Line offioer on full pay. True, I have not (except
when the battalion is camping out, or taking part in manoeuvres),
to trouble myself with matters connected with the Commissariat, but
in every other respect my position is exaotly analogous to my
brother officers in other branches of the Quint's Service. I have to
attend numerous drills, and perform the duties, at stated intervals,
of the Orderly Room. Besides this, I have to see that every parade
is well attended by the men of my company. This entails, as you
may imagine, time and trouble.
The Com. May I take it that it is less difficult to command
Volunteers than Regulars P
Off. That is a matter of opinion. If a Volunteer officer can bring
to bear his social position (for instance, should his men be his
tenants, or in his employment), he may find the task of command
an easy one. But should the battalion to which he belongs be
composed of that large class of persons who consider "one man
as good as another, and better," no little tact is required in
keeping up discipline. Besides this, he starts at a disadvantage.
Every retirement from the regiment means the loss of an earner of
the capitation grant; and as the maintenance of a Volunteer corps
is an exceedingly expensive matter, a "free and independent
private" feels that if he withdraws, or is forced to withdraw, his
officers are practically the pecuniary sufferers of the proceeding.
The Com. Am I to understand then that the cost of a battalion
falls upon the commissioned rank P
Off. Almost entirely. The officers have generally to pay a heavy
entrance fee, and subscription, and must, if they wish to be popular,
oontribute largely to prize funds, entertainments, and the cost of
"marching out." Besides these charges they have to be particularly
hospitable or benevolent (either word will do) to the companies to
whioh they specially belong.
The Com. Well, certainly, it seems that an Offioer of Volunteers
has many responsibilities—what are his privileges?
Off. Only one is officially recognised—the right to be snubbed 1
2'Ae Com. And the result?
Off. That there is scarcely a corps in the kingdom without vacancies,
lien nowadays, fail to see the fun of all work and no pay, play,
or anything else. This very week a meeting is being held at the
Royal United Service Institution, to consider what can be done to
advance the interests of the officers—another word for the interests
of the whole force.
The Com. Vou have my sympathy, and if I can help you
Off. Not another word, Sir. The good services of Mr. Punch
for the last thirty years are appreciated by all of us, and we know
we can rely upon him as confidently in the future as we have done
with good reason in the past. [The Witness then retired.

Simple Citizen, with budding
horticultural ambitions, and
Jobbing Gardener, "highly re-
commended" for skill and low

personage, very bowed as to
back, and baggy as to breeches,
but in his manner combining
oracular "knowingness" and
deferential plausibility in a
remarkable degree.
Simple Citizen. You see Smug-
gins, things are a little bit in
the rough here, at present.
Grand Old Gardener. Ah, you
may well say that, Sir! Bin
allowed to run to raok and ruin,
this here pooty bit o' garding
has. Want a lot o' clearing,
scurry f tinging, and topping and
lopping, afore it '11 look any think

S. C. Glad to hear you say so, Smcggins. Now what I propose
G. O. G. {laying a horny hand on S. C.'s coat-sleeve). If you'll
ascuse me, Sir, I 'II jest give yer my ideas. It '11 save time. {Lays
down artfully the tines of a plan involving radical alteration of
paths, and lawns, and beds, shifting of shrubs, cutting down of trees,
rooting up of trailers, and what he calls '' toppin' an' loppin'" to a
tremendous extent.) Then, Sir, you'll 'ave a bit o' garding as'11
be the pride o' yer eye, and. a tidy bit o' profit into the bargain, or
I don't know my bizness. An' I oughter too, seeing as I wos 'ed
gardener to the Dook of Fitz-Ftjzz for close on twenty year, afore
the rheumaticks took me like wot you see. Hu-a-a-h'.!!
S. C. Yes; but, Sjctjogins, all
these alterations will run into
time and—expense, I'm afraid.
G. O. G. {confidentially). You
leave that to me, Sir! The fust
expense '11 be the biggest, and a
saving in the long run, take my
word. And then you will 'ave a
garding, you will, one as that 'ere
muddled up bit o' greenery nex
door won't be a patch on it, for

night's absence). What, Sjct/ggins,
still at it? And—eh—by Jove,
what have you been up to? Why
I hardly know the place again 1
G. 0. G. {complacently). I should 'ope not, Sir It is a bit
different from when you last saw it, I flatter myself. Fact it is a
garding, now. Then it wos a wildernidge!
# 8. C. Yes, but Smtjggins, hang it all, you've cut almost every
bit of greenery away!
G. O. G. {contemptuously). Greenery!!! And who wants
greenery t Greenery ain't gardening, greenery ain't not by ohorks.
Any fool, even that cove nex door, can grow greenery!
8. C. Yes, but SsrrjGorNs, I don't like my limes to look like
gouty posts, my branchy elms to show as bare as broom-sticks, and
my fruit-trees to be trimmed into timber-screens!
G. O. G. {persuasively). No, Sir, cert'ny not. Fact is they'd
bin let grow wild so long that cutting on 'em freely back wos the
only way to save 'em. Jest wait till next year, Sir, and you '11 see.
8. C. {doubtfully). Humph! Looks beastly now, anyhow. And
you've altered all the paths, and nearly all the beds. I didn't tell
you

cart blarnch, you did, and I've done my level best. The Dook

'ad the same idees at first, but
when he comes to know me, he
says, says he, Smuggtns, you're
always right, he says. If you
wos to run a reaping-machine
through my horchids, or a trao-
tion-engine over my turf, I should
know as you wos a-doing of the
right thing— in the long run!
Oh, you leave it to me, Sir, and

8. C. {furiously). The sooundrel! —the sleek, insinuating,
slaughtering scoundrel! He tore up my paths, he altered my beds,
he mutilated my lawns, he stripped my trailers, he hacked my trees
into bare hideousness, all to make work and money for himself and
his partner in iniquity, that nefarious "florist" friend of his. I
was a greenhorn, Mumpson, a juggins, and I let them fool me to the
top of my bent. He cut up the shrubbery into those horrible flat
beds, in order that I might "grow my hown wegerbles," as he
phrased it. He got money from me for the best and most expensive
"ashleaf kidneys " and " Proosh-
ian Blues," then planted oheap re-
fuse from a small greengrocer's.
My "ashleaf kidneys" turned out
waxy marbles; my Frooshian
Blues refused to pod ; I spent—or
rather he reoeived—pounds upon
my vinery and cucumber frames.
My grape-bunches went mouldy,
and I never got a cucumber
more than six inches long. His
"friend, the florist," did, no
doubt. He stole my shrubs over-
night, and sold 'em back to me
next morning. He bled my
maidservants for "beer and
'baccy." In fact, it was the same
all round; he had, in every way,
ruined my garden, run me up
exorbitant bills, and then, when
the day of detection was immi-
nent—disappeared. If ever I
catch Bight of that mulberry nose
of his, I shall be tempted to
8. F. (soothingly). Ah, yes, just so. But let's hope that you '11
never come across this particular Grand Old Gardener—or his like—
again. (Waggishly.) By Jove, Appleyard, no wonder the world
went wrong, seeing that "the first man " was—a Gardener! 11

horny mental animals without being tossed, and staring at them with-
out being gored. In the same gallery may be seen a series of pastels
of Hampstead Heath, by Mr. Henry Mtjhrman—a merman ought to

convinces us it is the place to "pastelise," and he seems to have

PARS ABOUT
PICTURES.
Par ex—par Id!
"A good par here,
and a bad par there;
here a par, and there
a par, and every-
where a par!" In-
deed, as an Irishman
■would say, it is the
Judgment of Pars.
Let us look in at the

no doubt we shall be
iley delighted. We
go on the pre-private

weare parsimonious,
but we prefer to see
the piotures without
being scrouged.
"Ihe Release1' is
a puzzler. We have
taken stock of Mr.
Stock's pioture, and
fail to understand
it. Is it Lulu or
Zazel? There seems
to have been an ex-
plosion, and one pc r-
son, lightly attired,
is blown up; and
another, more
warmly olad, is
blown down. They
will both probably
oatoh cold. Nothing
hazy about Mr.
Hayes's pictures.
On the contrary,
fresh and brilliant—
notably. "A Orey
Sunset." If you are
subject to mal-de-
mer, his seas will make you onaisy. The President, Sir James Linton,
has only two (mail pictures, both cleverly painted, but eaoh may be
described as a little Linton; so let us give him a little bint on the
subject; like Oliver Twist, we ask for more. "Too Many Cooks"
by Burton Ba rbeb—a Barber who knows how to dresB hair. See the
dogs' coats. Miss Ethel Weight is not very far wrong in her pio-
ture of a fair canoiste, and Mr. W. L. Wtllie is both artful and
wily in his rendering of a." A Sou' Wester." "An Old Harbour
in Sussex" gives distinct evidence that Lewis (C. J.) has bten
moved to the coast, and it seems to be a move in the right direotion.
In " The Red Canoe" Mr. Alfbed Parsons delivers an eloquent
sermon on the joys of life on the Thames.
The Royal Society of British Artists have fewer piotures than
usual at their new show. Quality better than common. Mr. F.
Bbakgwth's "Funeral at Sea" is exoellent. Mr. R. Machell's
"Lakshmx" not easy to understand. It might be "Lakehmi, or the
Lost Bathing-dress." She might certainly say, " Hacks my costume
de bain." "Durham "— goodlandsoape by Mr. Yglesias. Mr. Nel-

Sir Golf and Sir Tennis are fighting like mad-
Now Sir Tennis is blown, and Sir Golf's right above him,
And his face has a look that is weary and sad,
As he hastily turns to the ladies, who love him,
But the racket falls from him, he totters, and swirls,
As he hears them ory, "Golf is the game for the girls!"
• •••••
The girls crave for freedom, they oannot endure
To be cramped up at Tennis in courts that are poky,
And they 're all of them certainly, perfectly sure
That they '11 never again touch that horrible Croquet,"
Where it's quite on the cards that they play with Papa,
And where ail that goes on is surveyed by Mamma.
To Golf on the downs for the whole of the day
Is "so awfully jolly," they keep on asserting,
With a good-looking fellow to teach you the way,
And to fill up the time with some innocent flirting,
And it may be the maiden is wooed and is won,
Ere the whole of the round is completed and dene.
Henceforward, then, Golf is the game for the fair—
At home, and abroad, or in pastures Colonial,
And the shouts of the ladies will quite fill the air
For the Links that will turn into bonds Matrimonial,
And for husbands our daughters in future will seek
With the powerful aid of the putter and oleek!

IN OUR GARDEN.

vssDAr Horning.—Still in Edin-
burgh, but going home to-night.
Just received telegram from
Member for Sarx. '' Come home
at once," he says; "the Pero-
notpora Schleideniana has got
at the onions."
Rather a shock to have news
like this flashed upon one with
that absence of deliberation that
sometimes marks the telegraph
service. But I cannot say I am
surprised. I had, indeed, before
leaving, called Sark's attention
to what I recognised as the
greyish mycelial threads of the
fungus spreading upon the pipes
and budding seed-heads. If
Sakk had steeped the seed in
sulphate of copper before planting it, this wouldn't have happened. It's
a pity, for I rather thought we would make something towards expenses
out of that onion-bed. There's no more profitable crop than your pickling
onions if well farmed. I know a man who made £150 an acre out of
his onions. But then he wasn't hampered in his arrangements with a
fellow like Sakk.
Called on Mr. G. to say good-bye. He was sympathetic about the
onion blight, but I could see that his mind was occupied with other and
perhaps equally saddening thoughts.
"I suppose you have been made aware of the intelligence that has
reached me through the usual souroes?" he said. "I have had a pretty
good time here. I have belaboured the Government from all points of
attack. I think I managed pretty well with the Disestablishment
Question. You don't think, Tonr," he said, with a passing look of
deeper apprehension, '' that I gave myself away at all on the matter P
The worst of these fellows is tnat they keep a record of every word I
say, a custom whioh seriously hampers one in his movements. What I
should like, if it were permitted, would be to come quite fresh to a ques-
tion year after year, and say upon it exactly what happened to be con-
venient, without having before my eyes the certainty that somebody
would dig out what I said on the same subject last year, or five years
ago."
I assured him that I thought not much could be made out of his
remarks on Disestablishment Question. In fact ic would he difficult to
prove that he had said anything at all. Brightened up at this; but
cloud again deepened over his mobile face.
"Yes, perhaps I've done pretty well," he said, with a sigh. "I have
steered through a very diffioult position without running ashore; I have
had an immense popular reception; I have stirred up the constituency,
and have, if I may say so, supplied with fresh oil the sacred lamp of
Liberalism. Now, just when I was beginning in some modest measure
to felicitate myself, there comes news of a crushing master-stroke devised
by the Government. Though I do not disguise my discomfiture, I would
not withhold my tribute of admiration at the brilliancy of the stroke, of
the genius of its conception, and of the completeness with which it has
been dealt. I have been here more than a week, and have delivered
four speeches. The Government and their friends on the platform and
in the press affect to sneer at my efforts and their influence. Still, they
feel it is neoessary to make a counter-demonstration, and to effeotually
undo whatever work I may have accomplished. What oourse do they
adopt? Why, they send down Ashmead-Bamlett. He was at
Dalkeith last night, and, in a single speech, destroyed the effect
of my great effort of Saturday. He will go to West Calder; he
will come here; he will follow me step by step with relentless
energy, tearing up, so to speak, the rails I have laid, and which
I had hoped would have safely conducted the Liberal train into
the Westminster station. Sic ros non vobis. It is cruel, it is
crushing. If I had only foreseen it, I would have remained at
Hawarden, and you might have averted the calamity that over-
shadows your Garden."
Quite distressed to see my venerated friend broken down. Bad
for him to stop at home and brood over calamity. Best thing
would be change of scene and thought. He had made engage-
ment to-day to go to Pumpherston and inspect oil and candle
works. Better keep it.
"No," said Mr. G., wearily, "oil comforts me not, nor candles
either. Now, if it were pork, it would be different. Few things
so interesting as pork. Not from a dietetic point of view, but re-
garded historically. As I mentioned to a Correspondent the other
day, in the course of Homeric work I have examined into the
use of pork by the ancients. A very curious subject. I shall
make some references to it in the closing paper which I am
writing for Good Words on the Old Testament. I am under the
impression that the dangers which lurk beneath the
of a leg (or sirloin) of pork, are speoially connected
of Southern climates.
Curious to see how rapidly his aspect changed as these thoughts
pressed upon his mind. When I came in, he had been sitting in
an arm-chair, with his head resting on his hand, and his brow
gainfully wrinkled. He looked quite old—at least seventy. Now
e was up, walking about the room with springy stride, his mind
actively engaged in framing theories on the use of pork by Homes'8
contemporaries. If I could only keep him engaged, he would
forget the blow that had descended upon him, and would regain
his usual equanimity. A question as to whether he thought
Achilles liked sage with his pork, cunningly led him on to a long
disquisition, till, in a quarter of an hour, ne was quite a changed
man, and set out with great energy for Pumpherston.
Fine enthusiasm along the route. Immense reception from the
working men. Splendid luncheon set out at one end of the shed
where we were assembled; bill of fare included crude oil, sulphate
of ammonia, various mineral oils, and candles made from paraffin.
There was no wine, but plenty of ammonia-water. Manager pre-
sented Mrs. G. with bust in paraffin wax, which he said was Mr.
G. Also handed her a packet of dips cunningly carved in the
likeness of Hebbebt, the wick combed out so as to represent
a shock of hair. Mr. G. delighted; standing on a barrel of paraffin,
he addressed the company in a luminous speech, tracing hack the
candle to the earliest times. That candles existed in the Mosaic
era, he reminded them, was shown by the question which had
puzzled succeeding ages—as to the precise locality in whioh the
great Law-giver stood when the medium of illumination provided
for his convenience was suddenly extinguished. This was a great
hit; enthusiasm knew no bounds. Hospitality of the Pumpherston
people really embarrassing; they filled our pockets with candles
of all si/es and descriptions, and insisted upon each of us taking
away a quart bottle of paraffin oil imperfeotly corked.
Never shall I forget the radiant look of Mr. G. as he left the
works loaded with candles and congratulations, whilst IMrs. G.,
walking by his side, carefully carried the bust in paraffin wax. He
hod evidently forgotten all about Abhmead-Bartlett.
DEATH-BALL; OR, A NEW NAME FOR IT.
Yesterdat the celebrated Midland Spine-splitters met the
Riboraoking Rovers at the prepared Ambulance Grounds re-
cently opened in conjunction with the local County Hospital. A
large staff of medical men, supplied with all the necessary sur-
gical appliances, were in attendance. Play commenced effectively,
the Rovers keeping the ball well before them, with only a few
broken arms, a dislocated thigh, and a fractured jaw or two.
Later, however, affairs moved more briskly, one of the Spine-
splitter forwards getting the ball well down to goal; but, being
met with "opposition," he was carried senseless from the field.
A lively scrimmage followed, amid a general cracking of ribs and
snapping of spines. The field now being covered with wounded,
the Police interfered, and the play terminated in a draw.

Chapieb I.
We were all sitting on the pig-sty at T'nowhead's Farm. A pig-
sty is not, perhaps, a Btriotly eligible seat, hut there were special
reasons, of which yon shall hear something later, for sitting on this
particular pig-sty.
The old sow was within, extended at fall length. Occasionally
she granted approval of what was said, bat, beyond that, she
seemed to show bat a faint interest in the proceedings. She had
been a witness of similar gatherings for some years, and, to tell the
truth, they had begun to bore her, hut, on the whole, I am not pre-
pared to deny that her ap-
preciation was an intelligent
one. Behind us was the
brae. Ah, that brae! Do
you remember how the child
you once were tat in the
brae, spinning the peerie, and
hunkering at I-dree 1-dree
I droppit-it? Do you lie-
member that t Do you even
know what I mean? Life
is like that. When we are
children the bread is thiok,
and the butter is thin; as
we grow to be lads and
lassies, the bread dwindles,
and the butter increases;
but the old men and women
who totter about the com-
monly, how shall they munch
when their teeth are gone?
That's the question. I'm
a Dominie. What! — no
answer? Go to the bottom
of the class, all of you.
Chapter II.
As I said, we were all on
the pig-sty. Of the habitues
I scarcely need to speak to
you, since you must know
their names, even if you
fail to pronounce them. But there was a stranger amongst us,
a stranger who, it was said, had come from London. Yesterday
when I went ben the house I found him sitting with Jess; to-day.
he too, was sitting with us on the pig-sty. There were tales told
about him, that he wrote for papers in London, and stuffed his
vases and his pillows with money, but Tammas Haggaht only
shook his head at what he called " such auld fowks' yeppins," and
evidently didn't believe a single word. Now Tammas, you must
know, was our humorist. It was not without difficulty that
Tammas had attained to this position, and he was resolved to keep
it. Possibly he scented in the stranger a rival humorist whom he
would have to crush. At any rate, his greeting was not marked
with the usual genial cordiality characteristic of Scotoh weavers,
and many were the anxious looks exchanged amongst us, as we
watched the preparations for the impending conflict.
Chapter III.
After Tammas had finished boring half-a-dozen holes in the old
sow with his sarcastic eye, he looked up, and addressed Hendry
McQumpha.
"Hendby," he said, "ve ken I'm a humorist, div ye no P"
Hendry scratched the old sow meditatively, before he answered.
"On ay," he said, at length. "I'm no saying'at ye're no a
humorist. I ken fine ye 're a sarcesticist, but there's other humorists
in the world, am thinkin."
This was scarcely what Tammas had expected. Hendry was
usually one of his most devoted admirers. There was an awkward
silence which made me feel uncomfortable. I am only a poor
Dominie, but some of my happiest hours had been passed on the pig-
sty. Were these merry meetings to come t j an end? , Fete took up
the talking.
"Hendry, my mm," he observed, as he helped'himself out of
Tammas's snuff-mull, "ye 're ower kyow-owy. Ye ken humour's
a thing 'at spouts out o' its ain aooord, an' there's no nae spouter in
Thrums 'at oan match wi' Tammas."
He looked defiantly at Hendry, who was engaged iu searohing for
coppers in his north-east-by-east-trouser pocket. T'nowkkad said
nothing, and Hookey was similarly occupied. At last, the stranger
spoke.
"Gentlemen," he began, "may I say a word? I may lay claim

He looked round interrogatively. Tammas eyed him with one of
his keen glances. Then he worked his mouth round and round to
dear the course for a sarcasm.
"So you're the puir crittur," said'the stone-breaker, "'at's
meinin' to be a humorist."
This was the challenge. We all knew what it meant, and fixed
our eyes on the stranger.
"Certainly," was his answer; "that is exaotly my meaning. I
trust I make myself plain. I'm willing to meet any man at catch-
weights. Now here, he oontinued, "are some of my samples. This
story about a house-boat, for instance, has been much appreciated.
It's almost in the style of Mr. Jerome's masterpiece; or this screamer
about my wife'B tobacco-pipe
and the smoking mixture.
"Observe," he went on,
holding the sample near to
his mouth, "I can expand it
to any extent. Puff, puff!
Ah! it has hurst. No
matter, these aocidenta some-
times happen to the best
regulated humorists. Now,
just look at these," he pro-
duced half-a-dozen packets
rapidly from his bundle.
"Here we have a paoket of
saroasm—equal to dynamite.
I left it on the steps of the
Savile Club, but it missed
fire somehow. Then here are
some particularly neat things
iu cheques. I use them
myself to paper my bed-
room. It's simpler and
easier than cashing them,
and besides," adjusting his
mouth to his sleeve, and
laughing, "it's quite kill-
ing when you come to think
of it in that way. Lastly,
there's this banking-account
sample, thoroughly suitable
for journalists and ohildren.
You see how it's done. I
open it, you draw on it. Oh, you don't want a drawine-master, any
fellow can do it, and the point is iCnever varies. Now," he con-
cluded, aggressively, "what have you got to Bet against that, my
friend P"
We all looked at Tammas. Hendry kicked the pail towards him,
and he put his foot on it. Thus we knew that Hbndry had
returned to his ancient allegiance, and that the stranger would he
crushed. Then Tammas began
"Man, man, there's no nae doubt at ye lauch at havers, an' there's
mony 'at lauohs 'at your olipper-clapper, but they're no Thrums
fowk, and they oanna' lauoh ncht. But we maun juist settle this

a' dependent on other fowk to tak' note o' the humour. There's no
nane o' us 'at's lanohed at anything you've telt us. But they '11
lauoh at me. Noo then," he roared out, "' A pie sat on a pear-tree.'"
We all knew this song of Tammas's. A shout of laughter went
up from the whole gathering. The stranger fell backwards into
the sty a senseless mass.
"Man, man," said Hooket to Tammas, as we walked home;
"what a orittur ye are I What pit that in y=>ur heed?"
"It juist took a grip o' me," replied Tammas, without moving a
muscle; "it flashed upon me 'at he'd no stand that auld song.
That's where the humour o' it comes in."
"On, ay," added Hendrt, "Thrums is the plaoe for rale humour."
On the whole, I agree with him.

PAES ABOUT PICTURES.
Close upon a hundred years ago, when George tee
Third was King, Mendoza opened a saloon in the
Strand, whereat various studies in Black and Blue
might be enjoyed. To-day Mendoza has a gallery in
King Street, which is devoted to studies in Black and
White. You may say, history repeats itself. Nothing
of the kind. The gentleman of George the Third's
time devoted himself to the pugilistic art; the gentle-
man of the time of Victoria gives his attention to
graphic art. The one was the patron of fists, the other
of lingers—that makes all the difference. Mendoza the
Past, closed eyes—Mendoza the Present opens them,
and, if you go to the St. James's Gallery, you will find a
pleasant collection of Eye Art—open to all peepers. It
is true it may not be High Art, but you will find it, like
Epps'B Cocoa, "grateful and comforting."

market since the days of George the Third, or rather
his ancestor had, is "quite up to time, and smiling."

THE GENTLE ART (OF SNIGGLING).
[" Whoever walks beside the river (the Ettrick), will observe
five or cix or more men and boya, equipped with gigantic
wading-breeches, busy in each pool. They are only armed with
reds and flies, and thus have a false appearance of being fair
fisberf. . . . The truth is that the apparent sportsmen are snig-
glers, not anglers. They drive the top part of their rods deep
into the water, so as to rake the bottom, and then bring the
hook out with a jerk. Every now and then .. . one of the perse-
cuted fishes ... is hauled out with short Bhrift."—Daily New J.]
Oh! the world's very bad, and our hearts they are sore
As we think of the errors and wrongs we have got to
Endure uncomplaining, and oh I we deplore
The things people do, that they really ought not to!
"With Courtesy dead, and with Justice a-bed,"
When the mention of Love only causes a giggle,—
But we'd manage to live and still hold up our head,
Were it not for the villain who ventures to sniggle.
With his rod and his hook see him carefully rake
The bed of the river, and gallantly wading,
Arrayed in his breeohes, endeavour to make
Of genuine sport but a mere masquerading.
You might think him a fool for his trouble—but look!
(And it's true, though at first it appears to be gammon)
With a horrible jerk, as he pulls up his hook.
The sportsmanlike sniggler has landed a Balmon!
As a nation of sportsmen, it rouses our ire
To hear of sport ruined by such a proceeding;
And to tnigglers we earnestly wish and .desire
To give the advice they so sadly seem needing.
Let them think, as they work their inglorious plan,
How old Izaak must turn in his grave and must
wriggle;
And may they in future all see if they can,
By learning to angle, forget how to sniggle!
IN OUR GARDEN.

discovered on returning home that
the Member for Sark had not at
all exaggerated the facts pioturing
disaster to our onion-bed. This
portion of the garden had been
disappointing from the first. Early
in the Spring, when hope beat
high, and the young gardener's
fancy lightly turned to thoughts
of large crops, Sark and I were
resting after a frugal luncheon,
when Arpachshad suddenly ap-
peared at the open window. I
knew from his beaming face that
something was wrong.
Perhaps I should explain that
Arpachshad is our head gardener.
We have no other, therefore he is
the head. Oat of the garden he is
known as Peter Wallops. It was
Sark who insisted upon calling
him Arpachshad. Bare had
noticed that about the time of the
Flood there was singular delibe-
. ration in entering upon the mar-
riage state. Matrimony did not seem to be thought of till a man had turned
the corner of a century. Shkm, himself, for example, was fully a hundred
before his third son, Arpachshad, was bom. But Arpachshad was already a
husband and a father at thirty-five.
"That," said Sare, "is a remarkable circumstance that has escaped the
notice of the commentators. It indicates unusual forwardness of character and
a habit of swift decision. We hear nothing more of Arpachshad, hut we may
be sure he made things move. Now what we want in this garden is a brisk man,
a fellow always up to date, if not ahead of it. Let us encourage Wallops by
oalling him Arpachshad."
Wallops on being consulted said, he thought it ought to be a matter of
another two shillings a-week in his wages; to whioh I demurred, and it was
finally compromised on the basis of a rise of a shilling a-week. As far as I have
observed, Sahk's device, like many others he has put forward, has nothing in it.
Wallops couldn't be slower in going round than is Arpachshad. The only
time he ever displays any animation is when he discovers some fresh disaster.
When things are going well (which isn't often) he is gloomy and apprehensive
of an early change for the worse. When the worst oomes he positively beams
over it. Difficult to say whether he enjoys himself more in an over-wet season,
or in one of drought. His special and ever-recurring joy is the disoovery of
some insect breaking out in a fresh place. He is always on the look-out for the
Mottled Amber Moth, or the Frit-fly, or the Currant Scale, or the Apple-bark
Beetle, or the Mustard Beetle,—" Blaok Jack," as he familiarly calls him. To
see, as is not unfrequent, a promising apple-tree, cherry-tree, or damson-tree,
fading under the attack of the caterpillars of the Winter Moth, makes Arpach-
shad a new man. His baok unbends, his wrinkles smooth out, the gleam of
faded youth reillumines his countenance, and his eyes melt in softer glance.
"The flies hev got at them honions," he said, on this Spring afternoon. "I
thought they would, and I reckon they 're done for. Ever seen a honion-fly. Sir?
A nice, lively, busy-looking thing; pretty reddish-grey coat, with a whitish
face, and pale grey wings. About this time of the year it lays its eggs on the
sheath of the onion-leaf, and within a week you've got the larvey burrowing
down into the bulb; after which, there's hardly any hope for your nonion."
"Can nothing be done to save them?" Sare asked. As fur me, I was too
down-hearted to speak.
_ " Well," said Arpachshad, ruefully, not liking the prospect of interfering
with beneficent Nature, '' if you was to get a bag of soot, wait about till a shower
was a coming on, carefully sprinkle the plant, and let the soot wash in, thai

might save a few here and there. Or if yon were to get a can of

Nater."
Bnt we didn't follow Aepachshad's advice. Having undertaken
to run this garden, we were determined to do it thoroughly; so I
got Sauk to sweep out the flues of the furnace in the greenhouse,
in the course of which he broke several panes of glass, not expect-
in?, so he explained, to find the handle of his brush so near
the roof. We half filled a sack with soot, and carried it to the
onion-bed. Then we waited for a wet day, usually plentiful enough
in haymaking time, now long deferred. Abpachshad insisted that
we were to make quite sure that rain was coming—then sprinkle the
soot over the unsuspectiong onion. We waited just too long, not
starting till the rain began to fall. Found it exceedingly unpleasant
handling the soot under conditions of moisture. But, as Sakk said,
having put our hands to the (soot-bag, we were not going to turn
back. Nor did we till we had completed the task, Abpachshad
looking on, cheered only by the hope that the heavy rain would
wash the soot off before it could have any effect on the fly. On the
whole, the task proved productive of reward. Either Abpachshad
had been mistaken, and the crop had not been attacked by the fly, or
the soot had done its work. Anyhow, the bed bloomed and
blossomed, and, at the time I left for Midlothian, was locking
exceedingly well. Then came Sauk's telegram, as described in the
last chapter. A ter the fly came the mildew. Close on the heels, or
rather the wings, of the Anthomyia Ceparum, foil the Peronospora
Schleideniana.
"It isn't often'it happens," said Arfachshad, rubbing his hands
gleefully;—" but, when you get one on the top of t'other, you don't
look for much crop in that particular year."

suddenly, starts ail. P., and addresses him.—

no, on second thoughts 1 won't go back. Unlucky, you know!

over together with a glass of sound port, my boy. Best glass of
port in London, Bum pus sells, and as an old Army Man I appreciate it.

way of "an early advance ' are smoothed away in a highly
satisfactory manner. A couple of references, of course,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Read The World and the WUl, by James Payn, says the Baron.
Successful novelist is our "J. P." for England and the Coloniet
generally. "The profits blazoned on the Payn," is a line he quotes
with a slight differenoe of spell-
in his present three volumes,
ids"> _
which is full of good things; his
own "asides " being, to my think-
ing, quoth the Baron, by far the
most enjoyable part of his books.
Herein he resembles Tbackerat,
who used to delight in taking the
reader behind the scenes, and
exhibiting the wires. Not sc
James Payn. He comes in front,
and comments upon the actions oi
his puppets, or upon men and
morals in general, or he makes a
quip, or utters a quirk, or pro-
poses a quiddity, and pauses to
laugh with you, before he resumes
the story, and says, with the older
romancers, "But to our tale."
Most companionable writer is James Patn. Tells his story so
clearly. A Patn to be seen through.
In the christening of his Christmas books, Mr. Merry Andrew
Lang has hit upon a genuine Happy Thought, on which the Baron
begs sincerely to congratulate him. It is a perfect little gold mine as
a book-title series. Last year M. Andrew Lang wrote, and Land-
man's—no, beg pardon—Longmans published The Blue Fairy
Book. The Blue Fairy Book, when it appeared, however, was read
everywhere, so this year the Merry Andrvw issues The Bed Fairy
Book, which, of course, will be more read than the other. Excellent
notion! Where will it stop? Why should it stop? Next year
there '11 be The Green Fairy Book; in '92 the Yellow FairyBook
(commencing with new version of Yellow Dwarf), then the White,
then the Black, then the Yer-millionth edition, and so on and so on, ad
infinitum, through all the possible stages of the combination and
permutation of colour.
The Magazine of Art for 1890, published by Cassell & Co., is
one of the best of its kind for pictures and Art-artioles. The Mixture
as before.
"Christmas is coming"—but the Publishers seem to think that
the Merry Old Gentleman will be here to-morrow. Yet we know
the proverbial history of to-morrow. However, to humour the up-
to-date notion, the Baron recommends to his young friends who
wifh to amuse their elders, Dolldom, a dolls' opera, by Clifton
Bingham, set to music by Florian Pascal. Some of the songs are
exquisite. It would make a very funny play, children imitating
dolls. Published by J. Williams.
Black ie and Son, are going it. Here are two more, by their
indefatigable writer, G. A. Hentt: By Right of Conquest; or,
With Cortez in Mexico. The young Sixteenth-Century boy, by
his marvellous adventures, proves his right to be a hero in the Con-
quest of Mexico. Of a more modem date is A Chapter of Accidents,
which deals with the Bombardment of Alexandria. The young
fisher-lad has to go through many chapters of adventure before he
reaches a happy ending. A Rough Shaking, by George Macdonald,
is a capital boys' book, while The Light Princess, and other Fairy
Stories, by the same author, will please the Baron's old-fashioned
fairy-book readers at Christmas-time.
Whoever possesses the Henry Irving Shakspeare,—started origi
nally by my dear old enthusiastic friend the late Frank Marshall,
and now concluded by the new volume of plays, poems, and sonnets,
—possesses a literary treasure. The notes are varied, interesting,
and all valuable. The illustrations exactly serve their purpose,
which is the highest praise.
Mr. Smallet's Letters are not to an Inconnue. They were
written to his paper, the Tribune, and have redressed the balance
between the Old World and the New by furnishing New York from
week to week with brilliant, incisive, and faithful pictures of life
in London. The initials, "G. W. S.," appended in their original
form, are as familiar throughout the United States as are those of
our own "G. A. S." in the still United Kingdom. Mr. 8malley
goes everywhere, sees everything, knows everybody, and his
readers in New York learn a great deal more of what is going
on in London than some of us who live here. Most public men of
the present day, whether in politics, literature, or art, have, all
unconsciously, sat to "G. W. S." He has a wonderful gift of
seizing the salient points of a character, and reproducing them in
a few pellucid sentences. The men he treats of have many friends
who will be delighted to find that Mr. Smallet's pen is dipped in
just enongh gall to make the writing pleasant to those who are
not its topic Personalities is the alluring title of the first
volume, which contains forty-two studies of character. It is
dangerous kind of work; but Mr. Smallet has skilfully steered
his passage. Written for a newspaper, London Letters (Macmlllan
& Co.) rank higher than journalism. They will take their place in
Literature.
November Number of the English Illustrated Magazine, excellent.
Wykehamists, please note Mr. Gale's article, and Lord Selbornk'c
introduction. The Cooke who presides in this particular kitchen
serves up a capital dish every month—and "quite English, yon
know."
My faithful "Co." has been rather startled by a volume called
The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, written by " Anony-
mous," and published by the Messrs. Trischler. The tome deals
with Australia, rather than England, and is dated a thousand years
hence; so those who have no immediate leisure will have plenty of
time to read it before the events therein recorded, so to speak, reach
maturity.
I notice an advertisement of a book by Major Ellis, entitled The
Ewe-speaking People of the Slave Coast of West Africa. _ These
Ewe-speaking folk must be a sheepish lot. Blaok-sheepish lot
apparently, as being in West Africa. Major Ellis is the author
also of The Tshi-speaking People. These last must be either

was still dreadfully intoxicated I am afraid!
Yery sad, of course, but we couldn't help laugh-
ing! She was such a figure before they got rid
of her 1 But this was only the overture to the
drama. After the night-charges were over, the
Court was cleared, but we were allowed to re-
main, as Mr. Wiginblock (our barrister friend)
declared we belonged to the Press! He said
that Mary contributed to the Blood and Thunder
Xtus, and I to the Murder Gazette! I am sure it must have
been in fun, for we have never seen the papers. When lunch
was over, in came the Magistrate with a number of the
"tmartest" people! Really, I was quite delighted to be in such
good company. All sorts of nice people. And then—oh—it was lovely!
We saw her quite close, and could watch the colour come and go in
her cheeks! She is rather pretty! She was wearing her ordinary
olothes; not the workhouse, nor the ones with the blood on them, but
some that had been sent in to her since the inquest. I tried your
opera-glasses. They are simply capital, darling! We were much
amused with his evidence; and it was really excellent fun to listen
to the howls of the crowd outside! But I am not sure he cared for
them! We got away in excellent time, and I hope to go again. I am
trying very hard (should it come to anything) to be present at the
last scene of all! Wouldn't that be lovely T I should have to be
at the place, though, at ten minutes to eight o'clock! I don't think I
should go to bed that night at all! If I did, I am sure I should not
sleep! It would be so very, very interesting! And now, my dearest,
good-bye. Your ever most affectionate friend, Ldcretia.
"Mine Ease at My Club."—In its most useful and instructive
theatrical column last Sunday's Observer (the only Observer of a
Sunday in London!) inserted this notice :—
"Mr. H. A. Jonbs is to read a paper at the Playgoers' Club, Henrietta
8treet, Tuesday neit."
Why announce it P Why not let the hard-worked Henry Author
Jones read his paper at his Clnb in peace and quietness? Very hard
on poor Henry Dramatic Author Jones, if he can't have a few
minutes of peace (not " piece," bien entendu) to himself. Leave him
alone to take his ease at his Club.

A LAMENT FROM THE NORTH.
'And then the Weatheb's been so bad, Donald I"
'Or at, Sir. Only Three Fine Days—and Twa or them snappit up by the SawbathI"
THE "LAIDLY WORM" OF LONDON;
Or, Tlie Great Slum Dragon and Little Mailer
County Council.
["The Worm (at first neglected) grew till it was
too large for its habitation. ... It became the
terror of the country, and, among other enormities,
levied a daily contribution ... in default of
which it would devour both man and beast. . . .
Toung Lambton was extremely shocked at wit-
nessing the effects of his youthful imprudence, and
immediately undertook the adventure."—Legend
of " The Lambton Worm," as related by Surlees.]
Old stories tell how Hercules
At Lerna slew a " Dragon;"
And the "Lambton Worm" (told by Sue-
tebs)
The Durham men still brag on.
How the "Laidly Worm" was made to
squirm
Old legends tell (they can't lie!);
And of Mokk, of More-hall, when, "with
nothing at all,"
He slew the Dragon of Wantley.
Our Dragon here is a bigger beast
Than Lambton slew, or Mobb did;
On poor men's bodies he doth feast,
And ill-got gold long hoarded.
He hath iron claws, and from his jaws
Foul f nmings are emitted.
The folks, his prey, who cross his way,
Are sorely to be pitied.
Have you not heard how the Trojan horse
Held seventy men inside him?
This Dragon's bigger, and of such force
That none may rein or ride him.
Men hour by hour he doth devour,
And would they with him grapple,
At one big sup he '11 gobble them up,
As schoolboys munch an apple.
All sorts of prey this Dragon doth eat;
But his favourite food's poor people,
But he'd swallow a oity. street by street,
From cottage to church steeple.
Like the Worm of Wear, this Dragon drear,
Hath grown, and grown, and grown, Sir,
And many a lair of dim despair
The Worm hath made its own, Sir.
In Bethnal Green our Laidly Worm
Hath made a loathly den,
And there hath fed for a weary term
On the bodies and souls of men.
There doth it writhe, and ramp, and glower.
Whilst in its coils close prest [Power,"
Are the things it thrives on—" Landlord
And " Vested Interest."
Now, who shall tackle this Dragon bold P
Lo! a champion appears.
He Beems but small, and he looks not old—
A youth of scarce three years.
But he hath put on his coat of mail,
Thick set with razors all,"
And a blade as big as a thresher's flail,
On that Dragon s crest to fall.
And like young Lambton, or young Mokk,
He to the fight advances.
Yet looks to that Slum Dragon o'er,
With oaution in his glances.
If he make shift that sword to lift,
And smite that Dragon dead,
No hero young song yet hath sung
A fouler pest hath sped.
Now guard ye, guard ye, young County C.!
That two-edged blade is big, Sir!
That Dragon's so spiky, he well might be
"Some Egyptian poroupig," Sir,
(As the singer of Wantley's Dragon says,
In his quaint and curious story.)
If this Dragon he slays, he shall win men's
And legendary glory. [praise,
When London's streets are haunts of health
(Ah! happy if distant, when)
And the death-rate ruleth low, and Wealth
Feeds not on the filthy den;
The men to this champion's memory
Shall lift the brimming flagon,
And drink with glee to young County C,
Who slew the Grim Slum Dragon!
A " Dakx Continent" Hint.—Mr. Stan-
ley, it is said, now wishes he had gone on
his exploration journey quite alone, without
any travelling Tbocp. It is a curious fact,
but worth mentioning here, that, up to now,
the only mention of difficulties with a "Tra-
velling Troupe" is to be found in a little
shilling book recently published by Messrs.
Teischlke & Co., at present nearing its fifty
thousandth copy, entitled, A New Light

H. M. Stanley will appeal to this as evidence
remains to be seen. We must have the whole

with silver serpents round their necks as com-

after which they exhibit Dutoh-metalled walking-

QUIS NOMINABIT?
(Being a few Remarks d propos of a" British Academy of Letters.")
Mb. Punch, Sir,
I have been reading with some morbid interest a series of
contributions to the pages of a contemporary from several more or
less distinguished literary men who have apparently been invited to
express their opinions, favourable or the reverse, on the recently
launched proposition to establish in our midst, after the French
model, a " British Academy of Letters." Some ask, "What's the
use? Others want to know who is to elect the elected, and seem
much exercised in their minds as to the status and qualifications of
those who ought to be chosen for the purpose of discharging this
all-important function. As to what would be the use of an institu-
tion of the kind, the answer is so obvious that I will not attempt to
reply to it. But if it comes to naming a representative body capable
of selecting the two or three thousand aspirants who have already,
in [imagination, seen their claims to the distinction recognised by
the elective body to which has been entrusted the duty of weighing
their respective merits—well then, to use a colloquial phrase, I may
confidently say that " I am all there!"
Of course. Royalty must head it, so I head the list of, say, twelve
Academic Electors, with the name of H. It IT. the Prince of Wales
This should be followed up by that of some generally widely-known
personage, who has the literary confidence of the public, and in this
connection, I have no hesitation in supplying it by that of the Com-
piler of Bradshaufs Railway Guide. Several now should follow, of
varied and even conflicting interests, so as to satisfy any over-captious
criticism inclined to question the thoroughly cosmopolitan character
of the elective body. And so I next add, Mr. Sheriff Augustus
Harris, H.R.H. the Duke of Camiiridge, the Proprietor of Pears'
Soap, and the Beadle of the Burlington Arcade.
It might now be well to give a distinctively literary flavour to the
body, and so I am disposed to continue my list with the names of the
Poet Laureate and the City Editor of Tit Sits, following them up
with the representatives of commercial enterprise, speculative art,
and sportive leisure, guaranteed respectively by the names of the
Chairman of the Chelsea Steam-boat Company, Mr. R. D'Oyly
Carte, and Prince Henry of Battenberg. For the twelfth, and
remaining name, I would suggest that of Mr. Henry Irving, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Manager of Madame Tcssaud's
Wax Works, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, General Booth, Mr. Slavin,
Mr. J. L. Toole, or any other striking or notable one that arrests
the eye with the familiarity of long acquaintance. With the exist-
ing deplorable position of the Pantomime literature of the country,
there can be little need to question further the necessity of a British
Academy of Letters. The naming of those who are to constitute
that institution is another thing; but if an authoritative fountain-
head, to discharge this inevitable function, is sought, and the publio
puts the question, " Quis Nominabitt" I think, Sir, you will
admit that I have most satisfactorily supplied the answer. Trusting
to your judicious appreciation of the full gravity of the matter at
issue, to publish this communication,
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
A very Possible Future Academician.
BEFORE AND BEHIND.
{From a Thoughtful Grammarian.)
Snt,—In the Times' Court Circular, on Friday last, I read that—
"Mr. William Nicholl had the honour of singing before Her Majesty
and i he Eojal Family."
This was indeed an honour. I regret that the Courtly Circnlarist
did not tell us what Mr. Nicholl sang before the Queen and Royal
Family, and also what the Queen and Royal Family sang (solo and
chorus?) after Mr. Nicholl. But suppose "before" does not here
relate to time, but to position. It would have been a novelty indeed,
and one well worth recording, if Mr. Nicholl had had the honour of
singing behind the Royal Family. And then, what a compliment if
Her Gracious Majesty and the Royal Family had all turned round to
listen to him! If I am wrong in my interpretation of the Court Cir-
cular's Circular Note, wouldn't it have prevented any possible error
to have said, " In the presence of"? I only ask for information,
and am Yours, Fideliter.
A New Tract for the Salvation Army.—The " General," who
is the biggest Booth in the show, announced last week that he had
been offered a big tract of land. Hear! Hear! Where? Where?
"Anywhere, anywhere out of the world "—at least, out of our little
world of Great Britain & Co. Let not " the General" be too par-
ticular, but accept the tract,—though he is more used to distributing
tracts than accepting them,—and let him and his army, his lads and
lasses, go away and leave us to enjoy our Sundays in peace and qniet.

VOCES POPULI.
AN\ EVENING WITH A CONJUROR.
Scute—A Suburban Hall. The Performance hat not yet begun.
The Audience it limited, and low-tpirited, and may perhaps
number—including the Attendant*—eighteen. The only people
in the front seats are, a man in full evening dress, which he
tries to conceal under a caped cloak, and two Ladies in plush
opera-cloaks. Fog it hanging about in the rafters, and the
gat-stars sing a melancholy dirge. Each casual cough arouses
dismal echoes. Enter an intending Spectator, who is conducted
to a seat in the middle of an empty row. After removing hit
hat and coat, he suddenly thinks better—or worte—of it, putt
them on again, and vanishes hurriedly.

ROBERT AT BURN'EM BEACHES.
They is still so jolly busy at the "Grand" that I
had sum dilferealty in getting leaf of habsense for
Satterday, larst week, for to go with a werry seleck
Copperashun Party on a most himportent hexcurshun to
Burn'em Beaches about cuttin all the trees down, so
that then it woodn't be not Burn'em Beaches not no
longer! Howewer, by promisin for to stick to the
"Grand" all thro' the cumming Winter, the too
Gentelmanly Managers let me go.
The fust thing as summat staggered me, in a long day
of staggerers, was the faek, that all the hole Party had
a grand Royal Saloon all to theirselves for to take them
to Slough, but my estonishment ceased when I saw
that they was Chairmaned by the same "King of good
fellers" as took 'em all to Ship Lake on a prewious
ocasion. They didn't have not no refreshments all the
way to Slough, so they was naterally all pretty well
harf starved by the time they got there, but there they
found a lovly Shampane Lunshon a waiting for to
refresh xhawBted Natur, and at it they went like One
o'Clock altho it wasn't only arf parst Elewen. Now for
the second staggerer! One of the party, a rayther
antient Deputty, insted of jining the rest of the Party,
deolared his intenshun to take his Lunch off the Sun-
shine which was shining most brillient outside the room,
and acordingly off he set a warking up and down in it
for three quorters of a hour, without not no wittels nor
no drink! till "the King of all good fellers" coodn't
stand it not no longer, and sent me out to him with
sum sangwidges and a bottel of Sham. He woodn't
not touch no sangwidges, and ony took one glass of
wine, and told me to put by the bottel for his dinner,
which I did in conrse; but somehows, when he arsked
for it arterwards, the cork had got out, and the wine
had got out, but I thinks I can wenture to say as that
not one drop of it was wasted, and werry good it was too.
We then set out on our luvly drive, me on the box-
seat of one of the Carridges, and the other pore fellers
cramped up hinside. Sumhows or other, weather it was
hoeing to the nobel Lunch or not, I don't kno, we lost
our way, and found ourselves at larst, not where we all
wanted to be, but at a most bewtifool House of call,
where they has the werry senBebel custom that, when
they thinks as wisiters has had enuff drink, they won't let 'em
have not a Drop More, and that is acshally the name by whioh the
ouse is known, both far and wide! Whether it's a good plan
for the howse, in course I don't kno, but Mr. Foubbes, the souper-
intendent of the Beeches, Bays as nothink woodn't injuice 'em to
alter the name. Whether that singler custom had anythink to do
with it I don't kno, but our party didn't stay there long, and we
soon found ourselves at bewtifool Burn'em Beaohes.
In course I didn't intrewde myself when they was a settling of the
himportant bizziness as they was onm about, so I strolled off to a
little willage as I seed in the distanoe. and which is acshally called
Egipt, tho it ain't much bieger than Whetstone Park, Hobern, the
ome of my herly birth I From a ravther hurryed conwersashun
with a real Native, I gathered the himportant faok that the one
reason why all the great big Beach Trees of the Forest had had their
tops cut off, was, that Oliwer Cromwbel wanted the bows for his
sojers to carry, so as to make 'em look more than they was when he
marched at their Hed to the Seege of Winsor Carsel! What curias
and hinteresting hinformashun we can get from the werry humblest
of our Feller Creturs when we goes the rite way to git it!
I got back to the Party jest as they had cum to the werry senser-
bil reserlushun that Nowember waB not at all the best mnnth to see
whether Trees was really dead, or was ony shamming, so they deter-
mined, like true patriots as they is, to adiourn the matter till the
1st of next April, by whioh time they wond be able to decide.
On our way back to Slough they all got out to see Stoke Pogies

wrote a most lovely Poem there, all about what could be seen from
the Churchyard of an evening, and one of the party said, that the
sperrit of the bewtifool seen and of the luvly Poem was so strong upon
him, that, if they woud stand ronnd the Toom, he woud try to
recite some of its sweetest lines, and he did so, and I heard one on
'em say, as we was a driving back, that more than one among them
had his eyes filled with plessant tears as he lissened. Ah, it isn't for
a pore Waiter like me to write on these matters, but I hopes as I
don't offend not anybody when I says, that praps if jest a leetle
more pains was taken for to make us pore fellers understand, and
feel, and share in the rapshur as such poems seems to inspire
betters, it might help to smooth, if not to shorten, the long
road as lies between the Hignorant and the Heddicated.

DOUBLING THE PART.
Mr. 8. B. B-ncr-ft, having retiredfrom the Stage, think* of taking to the Sooth.
"'When the Cd« comes, call me.' Aw !—Very like Him—vert I"
[One day laat week Mr. S. B. Bancroft wrote to the Daily Telegraphy
saying, that so struck was he by "General" Booth's scheme for relieving
everybody generally—of course "generally "—that he wished at once to
relieve himself of £1000, if be could only find out ninety-and-nine other
sheep in the wilderness of London to follow his example, and consent to be
shorn of a similar amount. Send your oheque to 85, Fleet Street, and we '11
undertake to use it for the benefit of most deserving objects.]
A GOOD-NATURED TEMPEST.
It was stated in the Echo that, daring the late storm, a brig
"brought into Dover harbour two men, with their ribs and arms
broken by a squall off Beachy Head. The deck-house and steering-
gear were carried away, and the men taken to Dover Hospital."
Who shall say, after this, that storms do not temper severity
with kindness? This particular one, it is true, broke some ribs and
arms, and carried away portions of a brig, but, in the very act of
doing this, it took the sufferers, and laid them, apparently, on the
steps of Dover Hospital. If we must have storms, may they all
imitate this motherly example.
"What a Wondebful Bo-ot!"—In the Htad-Master's Guide
for November, in the list of applicants for Masterships, appears a
gentleman who offers to teach Mathematics, Euclid, Arithmetic,
Algebra, Natural Science. History, Geography, Book-keeping,
French Grammar, Freehand, and Perspective Drawing, the Piano,
the Organ, and the Harmonium, and Singing, for the modest salary
of £20 a-year without a residence I But it is only just to add, that
this person seems to be of marvellous origin, for although he admits
extreme youth (he says he is only three years of age.') he boasts ten
years of experienceI O si sic omnes! So wise, so young, so cheap!

ALICE IN BLUNDERLAND.
{On the Ninth of November.)
[" Our difficulties are such as these—that America has instituted a vast
system of prohibitive tariffs, mainly, I believe, because . . . American pigs
do not receive proper treatment at the hands of Europe ... If we have
any difficulty with our good neighbours in France, it is because of that un-
intelligent animal the lobster; and if we have any difficulty with our good
neighbours in America, it is because of that not very much nobler animal,
the seal."—Lord Salisbury at the Mansion Mouse.']
The Real Turtle sang this, very slowly, and sadly:—
"We are getting quite important," said the Porker to the Seal,
"For we 're 'European Questions,' as a Premier seems to feel.
See the ' unintelligent' Lobster, even he, makes an advance!
Oh. we lead the Politicians of the earth a pretty dance.
Will you, won't you, Yankee Doodle, England, and gay France.
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, let us lead the dance P
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be,
When they take us up as matters of the High Diplomacee."
But the Seal replied, They brain us I" and he gave a look askance
At the goggle-eyed mailed Lobster, who was loved (and boiled) by
France.
"Would they, could they, would they, could they, give us half
a chance?
Lobsters, Pigs, and Seals all suffer, Commerce to advance 1"
"What matters it how grand we are!" his plated friend replied,
If our destiny is Salad, or the Sausage boiled or fried f
Though we breed strife 'twixt England, and America, and Franoe,
If we 're chopped up, or boi'ed, or brained where is our great advance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you chuck away a chance
Of peace in pig-stye, or at sea, to play the game of Franoe?"
"Thank you, it's a very amusing danoe— to watch" said Alice,
feeling very glad that she had not to stand up in it.
"You] may not have lived much under the Sea" (said the Real
Turtle) '(" I haven't," said Alice), "and perhaps you were never
introduced to a Lobster—" (Alice began to say I once tasted"
but checked herself hastily, and said, "No, never"),—" 8o you can
have no idea what a delightful danoe a (Diplomatic) Lobster Quad-
rille is 1"
"I dare say not," said Alice.
"Stand up and repeat "Tis the Voice of the Premier,'" said the
Griffin.
Alice got up and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of
Lobsters, Pigs, and Seals, that she hardly knew what she was say-
ing, and the words came very queer indeed :—
"'Tis the voioe of the Premier; I heard him complain
On the Ninth of November all propheoy's vain.
I must make some sort of a speech, I suppose.
Dear Dlkt (who led the whole world by the nose)
Said the world heard, for onoe, on this day, 'Truth and Sense'
(I.e. neatly phrased Make-believe and Pretence),
But when Gladdy's ' tide' rises, and lost seats abound,
One's voice has a oautious and timorous sound."
"I've heard this sort of thing so often before," said the Real
Turtle; "but it sounds uncommon nonsense. Go on with the next
verse."
Alice did not dare disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voioe:—
"I passed by the Session, and marked, by the way,
How the Lion and Eagles would share Af-ri-ca.
How the peoples, at peace, were not shooting with lead,
But bet humping each other with Tariffs'instead,
How the Eight Hours' Bill, on which Burns was so sweet,
Was (like bye-elections) a snare and a cheat;
How the Lobster, the Pig, and the Seal, I would say
At my sixth Lord Mayor's Banquet"
"What is the use of repeating all that stuff," the Real Turtle
interrupted, "if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the
most confuting thing /ever heard!"
"Yes, I think you'd better leave off," said the Griffin; and Alice
was only too glad to do so.
Games.—It being the season of burglaries, E. Wolf and Son—
("Wolf," most appropriate name,—hut Wolf nnd Moon would
have been still better than Wolf and 8on)—take the auspicious
time to bring out their new game of "Burglar and Bobbies." On
a sort of draught-board, so that both Burglar and Bobby play " on
the square," which is in itself a novelty. The thief may be caught
in thirteen moves. This won't do. We want him to be oaught
before he moves at all.

FROM OUR MUSIC HALL.
I had a fine performance at my little place last week. Gave the

I think though perhaps I say it who shouldn't, I never heard better
chorussing within my walls. Madame Schmidt-Koehne haB a good
voioe, but I can't say I approve of her German method, nor do I like
embellishments of text, even when they can be j ustified. The con-
tralto, Madame Syiatlovsxy (0 Heavenly name that ends in sky.')
is not what I should have expected, coming to us with such a name.

heard her. But Miss Sarah Beery brought down the house just

"As we are hearing Elijah," says Mr. Corner Man, " may I ask

me of?" Of course I reply, "I give it up, Sir." Whereupon he
answers, "She reminds me, Sir, of the Queen who was Berenice—
'Berry-Nicey'—see?"
Number next in the books. Mr. Watkin Mills was dignified
and impressive as Elijah; but, while admitting the excellence of
this profit, we can't forget our loss in the absence of Mr. Sant-
ley. Ben Mio Davies sang the tenor music, but apologised
for having unfortunately got a pony on the event,—that is, he
had got a little hoarse during the day. "Ben Mio" is—um—
rather troppo operatico for the oratorio. Mr. Barnby bravely
batoned, as usual. Bravo, BarnbyI He goes on with the work
because he likes t. Did he not, he would say with the General
Bombastes—
"Give o'er ! give o'er!

Chatter I.
I am a man stricken in years, and well-nigh spent with labour,
yet it behoves that, for the public good, I should take pen in hand,
and set down the truth of those matters wherein 1 played a part.
And, indeed, it may befall
that, when the tale is put
forth in print, the public
may find it to their liking,
ana buy it with no sparing
hand, so that, at the last,
the payment shall be worthy
of the labourer.
1 have never been gifted
with what pedants miscall
courage. That extreme rash-
ness of the temper which
drives fools to their destruc-
tion hath no place _ in my
disposition. A shrinking
meekness under provocation,
and a commendable absence
of body whenever blows fell
thick, seemed always to me
to be the better part. And
for this I have boldly en-
dured many taunts. Yet it
so chanced that in my life 1
fell in with many to whom
the cutting of throats was
but a moment's diversion.
Nay, more, in most of their
astounding ventures I shared
with them ; I made one upon
their reckless forays; I was
forced, sorely against my
will, to accompany them
upon their stormy voyages,
and to endure with them
their dangers; and there does not live one man, tince all of them are
dead, ana 1 alone survive, so well able as myself to narrate these
matters faithfully within the compass of a single five-shilling volume.
Chapter II.
On a December evening of the year 17—, ten men sat together in the
parlour of " The Haunted Man." Without, upon the desolate moor-
land, a windless stricture of frost had bound the air as though in boards,
but within, the tongues were loosened, and the talk flowed merrily,
and the clink of steaming tumblers filled the room. Dr. Deadete sat
with the rest at the long deal table, puffing mightily at the brown old
Broseley church-warden, whom the heat and the comfort of his
evening meal had so far oonquered, that he resented the doctor's
treatment of him only by an occasional splutter. For myself. I sat
where the warmth of the cheerful fire could reach my chilled toes,
close by the side of the good doctor. I was a mere lad, and even
now, as I search in my memory for these long-forgotten scenes, I
am prone to marvel at my own heedlessness in thus affronting these
lawless men. But, indeed, I knew them not to be lawless, or I
doubt not but that my prudence had counselled me to withdraw ere
the events befell which lam now about to narrate.
As I remember, the Doctor and Captain Jawkens were seated
opposite to one another, and, as their wont was, they were in high
debate upon a question of navigation, on which the Doctor held and
expressed an emphatic opinion,
starboard is starboard, and all the d—d sea-captains in the world
cannot move me from that." With that the Doctor beat his fist
Spon the table until the glasses rattled again and glared into the
aptain's weather-beaten face.*
Hear the man," said the Captain—" hear him. A man would
think he had spent his days and nights upon the sea, instead of
mixing pills and powders all his life in a snuffy village dispensary."
The quarrel seemed like to be fierce, when a sudden sound struck
upon our ears, and stopped all tongues. I cannot call it a song.
Rather, it was like the moon-struck wailing of some unhappy
dog, low, and unearthly; and yet not that, either, for 11
words to it. That much we all heard distinctly.
"Fifteen two and a pair make four,
Two for his heels, and that makes six."
We listened, awestruck, with blanched faces, scarce daring to look
at one another. For myself, I am bold to confess that I crept under
the sheltering table and hid my head in my hands. Again the
mournful notes were moaned forth—
"Fifteen two and a pair make four,
Two for his heels, and"
But ere it was ended, Captain Jawkins had sprung forward, and
rushed into the further corner of the parlour. "1 know that voioe,"
he cried aloud; "I know it amid a thousand I" And even as he
spoke, a strange light dis-
'IimA [MitM pelled the shadows, and by
its rays we could see the
crouching form of Bill Bluk-
nose, with the red seam
across his face where the
devil had long since done his
work.
Chapter III.
I has forgot to say that, as
he ran, the Captain had
drawn his sword. In the
oonfusion which followed on
the discovery of Bluenose,
I could not rightly tell how
each thing fell out; indeed,
from where I lay, with the
men crowding together in
front of me, to see at all was
no easy matter. But this I
saw dearly. The Captain
stood in the corner, his blade
raised to strike. Bluenose
never stirred, but his breath
came and went, and his eye-
lids blinked strangely, like
the, flutter of a sere leaf
against the wall. There came
a roar of voioes, and, in the
tumult, the Captain's sword
flashed quickly, and fell.
Then, with a broken ory like
a sheep's bleat, the great
seamed face fell separate

severed neok, and splashed heavily upon the sanded floor of the
parlour.

Ye've kilt Bluenose, and with him goes our chance of the treasure.
But, maybe, it's not yet too late."
Bo saying, he pluoked the head from the floor and clapped it again
upon its shoulders. Then, drawing a long stiok of sealing-wax from
his pocket, he held it well before the Captain's ruddy face. The
wax spluttered and melted. The Doctor applied it to the out with
deft fingers, and with a strange condescension of manner in one so
proud. My heart beat like a bird's, both quiok and little; and on a
Budden Bluenose raised his dripping hands, and in a quavering
kind of voice piped out—
"Fifteen two and a pair make four."
But we had heard too much, and the next moment we were speeding
with terror at our backs across the desert moorland.

the Master. His gallant bearing and handsome face served but to
oonoeal the black heart that beat within his breast. He gazed at me
with a curious look in his eyes.
"Souaretoes, Squaretoes," said he—it was thus he had named
me, and by that I knew that we were in Scotland, and that my name
was become Mackbllar—"I have a mind to end your prying and
your lectures here where we stand."
"End it," said I, with a boldness which seemed strange to me even
as I spoke; "end it, and where will you be P A penniless beggar
and an outcast."
"The old fool speaks truly," he continued, kioking me twice
violently in the back, but otherwise ignoring my presence; "and if
I end him, who shall tell the story? Nay, Suuarbtoes, let us make
a compact. I will play the villain, and brawl, and cheat, and murder;
you shall take notes of my actions, and, after I have died dramatically
in a North Amerioan forest, you shall set up a stone to my memory,
and publish the story. What say you P Your hand upon it."
Such was the fascination of the man that even then I could not
withstand him. Moreover, the measure of his misdeeds was not yet
full. My caution prevailed, and I gave him my hand.
"DoneI" said he; "and a very good bargain for you, Sqtjahe-
tom!"
Let the public, then, judge between me and the Master, since of his
house not one remains, and I alone may write the tale.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
3 he Children of the Cattle, by Mrs. Moleswortti (published by
Macmtllan), will certainly be a favourite with the children in the
house. A quaintly pretty story of child life and fairies, suoh as she
can write so well, it is valuably assisted
with Illustrations by Walter Crane.
Geobqe Koutledok evidently means to
catch the youthful book-worm's eye by
the brilliancy of his bindings, but the
attraction will not stay
there long, for the con-
tents are equal to the
covers.
These are days of re-
miniscences, so "Bob,"
the Spotted Terrier,
writes his own tale, or,
wags it. Illustrations
by Harrison Whir.
And here for the tiny
ones, blesB 'em, is The
House that Jack Built,
—a paper book in ac-
tually the very shape of
the nouse he built t
And then there's the melanoholy but moral tale of Froggy'wotUd
a- Wooing Oo. "Recommended," says the Baron.
Published by Dean and Son, who should call their publishing
establishment The Deanery," is The Doyle Fairy Book, a splendid
collection of regular fairy lore; and the Illustrations are by Richard
l)oylk, which needs nothing- more.
The Mistletoe Bough, edited by M. E. Braddon, is not only very
strong to send forth so many sprigs, but it is a curious branch, as
from each sprig hangs a tale. The first, by the Editor and Authoress,
Hie Oldeit Friends, is excellent.
Flowers of The Hunt, by Ftnch Mason, published by Messrs.
Fore*. Rather too spring-like a title for a sporting book, as it
suggests hunting for flowers. Sketohy and amusing.
Hacbkttb and Cie. getting ahead of Christmas, and neck and
neck with the New Year, issue a Nouveau Calendrier Perpfteul,
"Let Amis Fideles," representing three poodles, the first of which
carries in his mouth the day of the week, the second the day of the
month, and the third the name of the month. This design is quaint,
and if not absolutely original, is new in the combination and appli-
cation. Unfortunately it only suggests one period of the year, the
dog-days, but in 1892 this can be improved upon, and amplified.
No nursery would be complete without a Chatterbox, and, as a
reward to keep him quiet, The Prize would come in useful. Wells,
Darton, & Gardner^ can supply boWi of them.
F. Warne has another Birthday-book, Fortune's Mirror, Set in
Oems, by M. Halfobd, with Illustrations by Kate Crauford. A
novel idea of setting the mirror in the binding; but, te find your
fortune, you must look inside, and then you will Bee what gem
ought to be worn in the month of your birth.
Willert Bealk's Light of Other Days is most interesting to
those who, like the Baron, remember the latter days of Grisi and
Mario, who oan call to mind Mario in Let Huguenots, in Trovatore,
I in Rigoletto; and Grim in Norma, Valentino, Fides, Lucrezia, and

some others. It seems to me that the centre of attraction in these
two volumes is the history of Mario and Grist on and off the stage;
and the gem of all is the simple narrative of Mrs. Godfrey Pkarse,
their daughter, which M. Willert Be ale has had the good taste to
give verbatim, with few notes or comments. To think that only twenty
years ago we lost Grisi, and that only nine years ago Mario died in
Rome! Feaoe to them both I In Art they were a glorious couple,
and in their death our thoughts cannot divide them. Grisi and
Mario, Queen and King of song, inseparable. I have never looked
upon their like again, and probably never shall. My tribute to their
memory is, to advise all those to whom their memory is dear, and
those to whom their memory is but a tradition, to read these Remi-
niscences, of them and of others, by Willert Beale, in order to
learn all they oan about this romantio couple, who, oaring little
for money, and everything for their art, were united in life, in love,
in work, and, let us, peccatores, humbly hope, in death. Willert
Bxale has, in his Reminiscences, given us a greater romance of real
life than will be found in twenty volumes of novels, by the most
eminent authors. Yet all so naturally and so simply told. At least
so, with moist eyes, says your tender-hearted critic,
The Sympathetic Baron De Book-Worms.
WIGS AND RADICALS.

Brutus. Tell us what has chanced to-day, that Storey looks so sad.
Casca. Why, there was a wig and a cooked hat offered him, and
he put it away with the back of bis hand, thus; and then the
Sunderland Radicals fell a-snouting.

Casca. Ay, marry, was it, and he put the things by thrice, every
time more savagely than before.
Brutus. Who offered him the wig P
Casca. Why, the Sunderland Municipality, of course—stoopid 1
Brutus. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
Casca. I oan as well be hanged, as tell you. It was mere foolery,
I did not mark it. I saw the people offer a cocked hat to him—yet
'twas not to him neither, because he's only an Alderman, 'twas to
the Mayor and Town Clerk—and, as I told you, he put the things
by thrice; yet, to my thinking, had he been Mayor, ne would fain
have had them. And the rabblement, of course, cheered such an
exhibition of stern Radical simplicity, and Storey called the wig
a bauble, though, to my thinking, there's not much bauble about
it, and the cocked-hat he called a mediaeval intrusion, though, to
my thinking, there were precious few cocked-hats in the Middle
Ages. Then he said he would no more serve as Alderman; and
the Mayor and the Town Clerk cried—" Alas, good soul!"—and
accepted his resignation with all their hearts.
Brutus. Then will not the Sunderland Town Hall miss him P
Casca. Not it, as I am a true man 1 There '11 he a Storey the less
on it, that's all. Farewell!
"Not there.'.Not there, My Child 1»
By some misadventure I was unable to attend the pianoforte
reoital of Paddy Rewski, the player from Irish Poland at the St.
James's Hall last Wednesday. Everybody much pleased, I'm told.
Glad to hear it. I was "Not there, notithere.fc my child I" But
audience gratified—
"And Stalldom shrieked when Faddy Rewski played,''
as the Poet says, or something like it. I hear he made a hit. The
papers say he did, and if he didn't it's another thumper, that's all.
"So No Mayer at Present from Yours Truly the Entre-
preneur of the French Plays, St. James's Theatre."—It is
hard on the indefatigable M. Mayeb, but when Englishmen oan so
easily cross the Channel, and so willingly brave the mal-de-mer for
the sake of a week in Paris, it is not likely that they will patronise
Frenoh theatricals in London, even for their own linguistio and
artistio improvement, or solely for the benefit of the deserving and
enterprising M. Mayer. Even if it be mal-de-mer against bien de
Mayer, an English admirer of Frenoh acting would risk the former
to get a week in Paris. We are sorry 'tis so, out so 'tis.

AVENUE HUNCHBACK.
Of course there is nothing very new in the idea of a cripple loving
a beautiful maiden, while the beautiful maiden bestows her affec-
tions on somebody else. Sheridan Knowles's Hunchback, Matter
Waiter, is an exception to Hunchbacks generally, as he turns ont

to be the father, not the lover, of the leading lady. It has remained
for Mr. Carton to give us in an original three-act play a deformed
hero, who has to sacrifice love to duty, or, rather, to let self-abne-
gation triumph over the gratification ef self. This self-sacrificing
part is admirably played by Mr. George Alexander, whose simple
make-up for the character is irreproachable. That something more
can still be made by him of the scene of his great temptation I feel
sure, and if he does this he will have developed several full leaves
from his already budding laurels, and, which is presently important,
he will have added another 100 nights to the run.
Maud (without the final "<<") capitally played by Miss Maude

another name when this character was oast to Miss Millett P Not

And the author has already indulged his pungent humour by

This character of Maud is a sketch of an utterly odious girl,—

idiot Bamfield, well represented by Mr.

by Miss Matoe Millett, Miss ,ubjcct treated in Act II. of S. 4 S.

In Miss Marion Terry's _ Helen, the elder of the Doctor's
daughters, we have a oharming type, nor could Mr. Nutcombe
Gould's Dr. Latimer be improved upon as an artistic perform-
ance where repose and perfectly natural demeanour give a certain
coherence and solidity to the entire work. Mr. Yorkk Stephens
Mark Denzit is too heavy, and his manner conveys the im-
pression that, at some time or other, he will commit a crime,
such, perhaps, as stealing the money from the Doctor's desk; or,
when this danger is past and he hasn't done it, his still darkening,
melodramatic manner misleads the audience into supposing that in
Act III. he will make away with his objectionable wife, possess
himself of the two hundred pounds, and then, just at the moment
when, with a darkling scowl and a gleaming eye, he steps forward to
claim his affianced bride, Scollick, Mr. Alfred Holles, hitherto
only known as the drunken gardener, will throw off his disguise,
and, to a burst of applause from an excited audience, will say,
I "I arrest you for murder and robbery! and—I am Haweshaw the

Detective!!!" or words to this effect. In his impersonation of
Mark Denzil Mr. Stephens seems to have attempted an imitation o
the light and airy style of Mr. Arthur Stirling.
The end of the Second Aot is, to my thinking, a mistake in dramatio
art. Everyone of the audience knows that the woman who has
stolen the money is Mark Dentil's wife, and nobody requires from
Denzil himself oral confirmation of the fact, much less do the]

This is an anti-climax, weakening an otherwise effective situation,
as the immediate result of this scene could easily be given in a couple
of sentences of dialogue at the commencement of the last Act. It is
this fault, far more than the unpruned passages of dialogue, that
makes this interesting and well acted play seem too long— at least,
such is the honest opinion of A Friend in Front.

THE BURDEN OF BACILLUS.
Is there no one to protect us, is existence then a sin.
That we 're worried here in London and in Paris and Berlin?
We would live at peace with all men, but " Destroy them!" is the
cry,
Physiological assassins are not happy till we die.
With tne rights of man acknowledged, can you wonder that we squirm
At the endless persecution of the much-maltreated germ.
We are ta'en from home and hearthstone, from the newly-wedded
bride,
To be looked at by cold optics on a microscopic slide:
We are boiled and stewed together, and they never think it hurts;
We 're injected into rabbits by those hypodermic squirts:
Never safe, although so very insignificant in size,
There's no peace for poor Bacillus, so it seems, until he dies.
It is strange to think how men lived in the days of long ago,
When the f aot of our existence they had never chanced to know.
If the scientific ghouls are right who hunt us to the death,
Those who came before them surely had expired ere they drew
breath:
We were there in those old ages, thriving in our youthful bloom;
Then there was no Koch or Pasteur bent on compassing our doom.
Men humanity are preaching, and philanthropists elate
Point out he who injures horses shall be punished by the State;
Dogs are carefully protected, likewise the domestic cats,
Possibly kind-hearted people would not draw the line at rats:
If all that be right and proper, why then persecute and kill us t
Lo! the age's foremost martyr is the vilified Bacillus!

IN OUR GARDEN.

were, happily, dimmed by a month's use, mopped his eyes.
"You 'U excuse me, gents," he snuffled, but I never hear that
there tune, 'Rule Britanny' whistled or sung but I think of the time
when I went down to see my son off from Portsmouth for the Crimee,
'Rule Britanny' was the tune they played when he walked
proudly aboard. He was in all the battles, Almy, Inkerman, Bally-
klaver, Seringap&tam, and Sebastopol."
"And was he killed P" asked the Member for Sabk, making as
though he would help Abpachshad with the basket on to his
shoulder again.
"No," said Abpachshad, overlooking the attention—" he lived to
oome home; and last week he rode in the Lord Mayor's coach
through the streets of London, with all his medals on. Five shillings
for the day, and a good blow-out, presided over by Mr. Augcstix

Thunder,' in the Barbican."
Habtlnoton oame down to see us to-day. Mentioned Abpach-
shad, and his natural indisposition to hurry himself.
"Why should he?" asked Habtinqton, yawning, as he leaned
over the fence. "What's the use, as Whosthis says, of ever climb-
ing up the climbing wave? I can't understand how you fellows go
about here with your shirt-sleeves turned up, bustling along as if
you hadn't a minute to spare. It's just thi

gain the impression that the
Member for Sabk and I did

whilst our hired man looked
Sabk, to whom I have
put the case, says that is
precisely it. But I do not
agree with him. We have,
as I have already explained,
undertaken this new respon-
sibility from a desire to preserve health and strength useful to our
Queen and Country. Therefore we, as Abpachshad says, potter about
the Garden, get in each other's way, and in his ■ that is to say, we are
out working pretty well all day, with inadequate intervals for meals.
Abpachshad, to do him justice, is most anxious not to interfere
with our project by unduly taking labour on himself. When we
are shifting earth, and as we shift it backwards and forwards there
is a good deal to be done in that way, he is quite content to walk by
the side, or in front of the barrow, whilst Sabk wheels it, and I
walk behind, picking up any bits that have shaken out of the
rehicle. (Earth trodden into the gravel-walk would militate against
its efficiency.) But of course Abpachshad is, in the terms of his
oontraot, "a working gardener," and I see that he works.
At the same time it must be admitted that he does not display
any eagerness in engaging himself, nor does he rapidly and ener-
getically carry out little tasks whioh are set him. There are, for
example, the sods about the trees in the orchard. He says it's very
bad for the trees to have the sods close up to their trunks. There
should be a small space of open ground. Abpachshad thought
that perhaps "the gents," as ne calls us, would enjoy digging a
clear space round the trees. We thought we would, and set to
work. But Sauk having woefully hacked the stem of a young
apple-tree (Lord Suffield) and I having laboriously and carefully
out away the entire network of the roots of a damson-tree, under
the impression that it was a weed, it was decided that Abpachshad
had better do this skilled labour. We will attain to it by-and-by.
Abpachshad has now been engaged on the work for a fortnight,
and I think it will carry him on into the spring. The way he walks
round the harmless apple-tree before cautiously putting in the
spade, is very impressive. Having dug three exceedingly small
sods, he packs them in a basket, and then, with a great sigh, heaves
it on to his shoulder, and walks off to store the sods by the potting-
shed. _ Anything more solemn than his walk, more depressing than
his mien, has not been seen outside a churchyard. If he were bury-
ing the child of his old age, he could not look more cut up. Sabk,
who, probably owing to personal associations, is beginning to develop
some sense of humour, walked by the side of him this morning
whistling " The Dead March in Saul."
The effect was unexpected and embarrassing. Abpachshad
Blowly relieved himself of the burden of the three sods, dropped
them on the ground with a disproportionate thud, and, producing a
bustle everywhere; everybody straining

•'Well," said Sabk, "but you've been up in Scotland, making
quite a lot of speeches. Just as if you were Mr. G. himself."
"Yes," said Habtisoton, looking admiringly at Abpachshad,
who had taken off his coat, and was carefully folding it up, prepara-
tory to overtaking a snail, whose upward march on a peach-tree his
keen eye had noted: "hut that wasn't my fault. 1 was dragged
into it against my will. It oame about this way. Months ago, when
Mr. G.'s tour was settled, they said nothing would do but that I
must follow him over the same ground, speech by speech. If it had
been to take place in the next day or two, or in the next week, I
would have plumply said No. But, you see, it was a Ions; way off.
No one could say what might not happen in the interval. If I'd
said No, they would have worried me week after week. If I said
Yes, at least I wouldn't be bored on the matter for a month or two.
So I consented, and, when the time oame, I had to put in an appear-
ance. Bnt I mean to cut the whole business. Shall take a Garden,
like you and Sabk, only it shall be a place to lounge in, not to work
in. Should like to have a fellow like your Abpachshad: soothing
and comforting to see him going about his work."
"I suppose you '11 take a partner?" I asked. "Hope you '11 get
one more satisfactory than Sabk has proved."
Hahtinuton blushed a rosy red at this reference to a partner.
Didn't know he was so sensitive on account of Sabk; abruptly

PARS ABOUT PICTURES.
Yes, quite so. It's a very good excuse! Whenever I
do not turn up when I am expected, my children Bay,
"Pa's about pictures." It's just the same as a doctor,
when he forgets to keep an appointment, says, "he has
unexpectedly been called out. Yah 1 / 'd call some of
'em out if I had the chance. I took French leave the
other day, and went to the French Gallery, expecting to
?ee sketches in French chalk .or studies in Frenoh grey.
Nothing of the kind! Mr. Wallis will have his little
joke. The main part of the exhibition is essentially
English, and so I found my Parisian accent was entirely
thrown away. If it had only been Scotch, I could have
said something about " the Soots wha hae wi' Wallis,"
but I didn't have even that chance. Too bad, though,
the show is a good one. "English, you know, quite
English." Lots of good landscapes by Leader, bright,
fresh, breezy. Young painters should "follow their
Leader," and they oan't go very far wrong. I would
write a leader on the subject, and introduce something
about the land-scape-goat, only I know it would be cut
out. Being very busy, sent Young Par to see Miss
Charlotte Robinson "s Exhibition of Screens. He
behaved badly. Instead of looking at matters in a
serious light, he seemed to look upon the whole affair as
a " screening faroe," and began to sing—

They '11 screen you from the bitter breeze,
They '11 screen you when you take your teas,

Delightful Charlotte Robinson!
He then folded his arms, and began to ting, "with

all over the place, broke several valuable pieces of furni-

It is, Madam.
Mrs. Britannia. And I may take your word for it, that it is a
weapon I can with confidence place in the hands of my soldiers.
Head of Department. You may. Madam. Excellent as has been
all the work turned out by the Department I have the honour to
represent, I think I may fairly claim this as our greatest achieve-
ment. No less than nine firms have been employed in its construc-
tion, and I am proud to say that in one of the principal portions of
its intricate mechanism, fully seven-and-thirty different parts,
united by microscopic screws, are employed in the adjustment. But
allow me to explain. (Does so, giving an elaborate and confusing
account of the construction, showing that, without the greatest care,
and strictest attention to a series of minute precautions on the part
of the soldier, the weapon is likely to get suddenly out of order, and
prove worse than useless in action. This, however, he artfully glides
over in his description, minimising all its potsible defects, and finally
insisting that no power in Europe has turned out such a handy,
powerful, and serviceable rifle.
Mrs. Britannia. Ah, well, I don't profess to understand the
praotical working of the weapon. But I have trusted you implicitly
to provide me with a good one, and this being, as you tell me, what
I want, I herewith place it the hands of my Army. (Presents the
rifle to Tommy Atkins.) Here, Atkins, take your rifle, and I hope
you'll know how to use it.
Tommy Atkins (with a broad grin). Thank 'ee, Ma'am. I hope I
shall, for I shall be in a precious ole if I don't.

A Battle-field in time of War. Enter Tom my Atkins with his
rifle. In the interval, since the close of the last Act, he it
supposed to have been thoroughly instructed in its proper use,
and, though on one or two occasions, owing to disregard of some
tr{fling precaution, he has found it "jam," still, in the leisure of
the practice-field, he has been generally able to get it right again,
and put it in workable order. He is now hurrying along in all
the excitement of battle, and in face of the enemy, of whom a
butch appear on the horizon in front of him, when the word is
given to "fire."
Tommy Atkins (endeavours to execute the order, but he finds
something " stuck," and his rifle refuses to go off.) Dang it! What's
the matter with the beastly thin g! It's that there bolt that's caught
agin' (thumps it furiously in his excitement and makes matters worse.)
Dang the blooming thing; I oan't make it go. (Vainly endeavours
to recall some directions, committed in calmer moments, to memory.)

"Dombet, Monsieur, Jonnie Dombet. Jonnif. sans l'H."
"Il est noble?"
"Mais, non. Monsieur. Son père était baDqnie.*, financier, qu9
sais-je! Il faisait des affaires
énormes — gigantesques! Il re-

de nouveaux venus—il "et la
gentille petite Copperfield re
perdait dans un labyrinthe de
phrases, et se réfugiait dans une
énorme houppe à poudre-Sarah,
qu'elle portait toujours dans son
manchon.
"Mais il n'était pas noble," dit
le recteur, avec dureté; "je re-
grette fort. Madame, de ne pou-
voir accepter votre petit gosse—
votre fils—comme élève; mais
cette institution scolastique est
des plus fathionablee de Paris.
Si vous aviez une petite couronne

Madame Coppebfteld, qui était
entrée comme Zéphire partit
comme Borée. Sa robe de soie
faisait un frou-frou prodigieux
dans le vestibule. Elle monta
dans la voiture au cheval étique,
aux coussins moisis, tirant le petit Joxnik aveo une violence
térique.
"Parœque tu n'est pas fils de Marquis on m'outrage," elle dit,
fondant en larmes. "Et pourquoi n'est-tu pas fils de Marquis, petite
brute P Moi, je ne sais pas."
Le petit Dombet sautait sur les genoux de sa mère ; il la consolait,
et quelques instants plus tard mère et fils suçaient ensemble un grand
morceau de butter-scotch, pendant que la petite écervelée consi-
dérait le costume qu'elle devait porter le soir au Bal Huilier.
IL—Us GïMSisK À Toutes les Couleurs.
_ Madame Copperfield ne se tenait pas pour vaincue sur oette ques-
tion d'une pension pour le petit. Sa cuisinière lui soufflait le nom
d'un Monsieur Suckers, qui habitait dans les environs de Clichy, et
cette fois c'était la cuisinière qui conduisait le petit Jonnif. ohez son
alumnus; et la cuisinière ne faisait pas de façons; c'était à prendre
ou à laisser.
Le bon Squekes, qui avait habité auparavant le Yorkshire, avait
développé une goutte de sang nègre, et s'était établi avec la seconde
Madame Squeers (sœur cadette de la respectable Madame Micavoeb)
dans les environs de Clichy. Malheureusement il n'avait pas oublié
son système anglais, et quoiqu'il faisait bien des raffinements sur les

III.—Ce qu'on appelle un Beau-Pebe.
Il n'y a pas loin du premier chapitre dans la vie de Jonnie
jusqu'à l'entrée de Mubdstone—le Mubdstone français, dur, mais
poète, ainsi plus frivole que le Mubdstone anglais. Mais, puisque
pour le petit Abbie tout ce qu'il y a de pénible dans l'histoire de
son petit cousin anglais doit s augmenter, le Mubdstone français a
des traits des Nebon et des Caligula. Naturellement le jeune Dombet,
se souvenant des escapades du cousin, fait son petit voyage d'enfant
—une fuite de la pension jusqu'à la maison maternelle où la petite
dame s'est installée en secondes noces aveo Mubdstone d'Aboenton,
'e poète. Alors commencent l'éducation de l'enfant par le beau-père,
les lirmes de la mère, le martyre du petit. Que de gifles; que de
dictionnaire» Uncés à la tète du chétif bambin!
"Faut qu'il aille quelque part
gagner sa vie," dit Mubdstone,
qui s'enrageait de plus en plus, à
cause de deux incommodités dans
leur vie de famille, la première
que lui, Mubdstone, n'avait pas
le génie d'Alfred de Musset, la
seconde que l'enfant avait un
rhume de cerveau inourable.
"Eavoyez-le laver les bouteilles
ohez un marchand de vins," pro-
posait un ami de la maison.
"Mais, non, cela ne serait pas
assez dur," repondit le poète.
"Je Buis fâché qu'il n'y ait plus
à Londres ce bon système de
ramoneurs-garçons qu on faisait
brûler vifs quelquefois dans les
cheminées. Faute de cela je le
mettrai sur la voie ferrée, à
graisser les roues aveo son petit
pot de pommade jaune—et si par
hasard il se faisait écraser par un
train—tant pis pour lui."
Il était grand garçon main-
tenant, ce joli petit Jonnie du
premier chapitre, et avant de
partir pour se perdre entre les
Parias du pot à graisse sur la
ligne d'Est, il s'enhardit jusqu'à
questionner sa mère sur un sujet
qu'elle avait approché de temps
en temps gentiÛement du bout
des lèvres, en lui soufflant des
idées romanesques, des visions de
ducs espagnols et de millionnaires
anglais,
"Dis dono, ' p'tite Maman,
comment s'appelait - il, mon
père?"
"Mais, mon ohéri, naturellement, il B'appelait Copperfield."
"Mais, Maman, tu me disais autrefois qu'il était Dombet, un
grand financier, riche à millions. Se peut-il que de Dombet je sois
devenu Copperfield?"
La pauvre inconséquente sanglotait aveo véhémence—" Mon
Jonnie, je te trompais. Dombet, le financier raide et hautain,
n'a jamais existé dans la vie réelle. C'était un mannequin en bois.
Ton père était Dickens, le grand romancier anglais. Il est mort
avant ta naissance. Sans lui tu ne serais pas."

She makes herself offensive, just
Because she loves me so.

My pipe, he tastes of chocolate,
And he has grown so dear bo dear,
That I get up at half-past eight
And smoke till night is here.
My aunt informs me that the smell
Is ranker than before—
I could not love her half so well
Loved I not baccy more.
The female mind! The female mind!
How beautiful it is!
And yet it has to sit behind
When it's compared with'this—
This taste that falls upon my pipe,
That calms when woman clacks,
In the sweet season when he's ripe,
And just before he cracks.

"Hoodwink thyself, Sancho," said Bon Quixote,
"and get up. ... And supposing the success of the
adventure should not be equal to our hopes, yet of
the glory of so brave an attempt no malice can
deprive us. . . . The whole company raised their
vonea at once, calling out, * Speed you well,

Quiiot*.]
Yes. "Speed you well, most valorous Knight!
Heaven guide you!"—and sound sense
inspire you!
Small marvel that our land's black blight
Of want and misery should fire you,
Or any man whose heart will mourn
More for wrecked livesthan broken crookety.
This picture is not shaped in scorn,
Nor meant in mockery.
La Mancha's Enight, though brave, was
blind,
Squire Sancho just a trifle credulous,
But our dear Don was nobly kind,
And in the cause of suffering seduloa*.
If, mounting Malahbbudo's steed,
He showed more sanguine than sagacion^,
He was not moved by huckster greed,
Or pride edacious.
But "with what bridle is he led f
And with what halter is he guided?"
Asked Sancho, rubbing his clown's head.
So they who have the least derided
Your plan for floating " the submerged,"
Colossal, costly, wide extending,
Feel some few questions may be urged,
Without offending.
Benevolence the crupper mounts.

But it would seem, from all accounts.
He, like Don Quixote's Squire, rides blin!-

If all were sound that's well intended,
Q liiote't wild jaunt and Sancho'$ j ig

Zeal boldly mounts the Magic HorBe,
Charity on behind holds tightly,
Who will not wish them skill and force
To guide it rightly?
But Human Life's a complex msze,
And Nature's laws are most despotic.
V ice is not killed by kindly craze,
Nor suffering quelled by zeal Quixotic.
Big questions the Big Scheme beset.
Bid Pity think, and do not ask it
Too blindly all its eggs to get
In one huge basket.
Philanthropy, which facts will school,
Is not a theme for mocking merriment.
As Mobxky says, he is the fool
Who never ventures bold experiment.
Against the ills our State that shake,
The spectre Vice, Want the pale ogress,
Punch hopes the Magic Horse may make
Practical progress.

To the ambitious young entertainer, Magic at Home, translated

For drawing-room plays apply to Geobge Rout-

Charades and Proverbs, by Anne Bowman, will
be found very useful. A Bowman hits the mark.
Those who know their London au bout des ongles,
can tell you of many quaint spots of beauty,
which may be seen when it is not quite enveloped
in a cheerful fog, though several of the more
ancient landmarks are fast vanishing; yet in Pic-
turesque London, by Pebcy Fitzgerald, M.A.,
F.S.A., will be found a happy collection of all the
most taking parts, both in odd corners, and inter-
esting structures. Charming illustrations by Hume,
Nisbrt, and Hbbbkbt Railton.
Christmas special numbers are not exactly np to
date; they are turned out so early that by the
time they ought to be seasonable, they are almost

with short stories by popular authors, which are
well illustrated.

cences come within the memory of middle-aged men, then this said
memory doth run somewhat to the contrary of that of the veteran
painter who put the cart before the horse, so to speak, in his artistic
career, seeing that he commenced with carriages and ended with cows.
As far as Mr. Punch is concerned, the Baron has already denied
that Douglas Jebrold was ever the Editor of Mr. P.'s paper: and
Mr. Coofeb's account of the Punch dinners must be taken with the
contents of a well-filled salt-cellar, as Mr. Sidney Coopek was never
present at any one of them. Inaccurately he attributes a repartee of
Thackeray's to Douglas Jebrold; and the well-known retort of
Jebrold to Albert Smith he gives so incor-
rectly, that in this instance the Attic salt has
lost its savour. There is too much soft-soapi-
ness in his reminiscences of personal interviews
with Royalty to please robust readers. Judging
from the latter portion of the second volume,
wherein, as I should take it, there is considerable
"padding," it would seem that "the aged P." has
already secured an excellent position among " the
immortals." Hitherto it was generally supposed
that of the arts Musio alone would survive w
sacula steculorum; but perhaps, after all, Painting
has a chance, and especially animal painting, even
though the animals may be allegorical. With its
pardonable defects of memory, and its occasional
touch of Royal Windsor Livery complaint, the re-
miniscences of Sidney Coofeb, R.A., are pleasant
and, of the first volume especially be it said, inte-
resting reading.

No. VI.—" An Alarming Sacrifice "—Somewhere!
Bum* I.—A Suburban Drawing-room, old-fashionedly furnished;
brightly-bound books scattered about a solid, sombre-covered
table; oil portraits of elderly, stiffly attitudinising couple on the
walls; a general atmosphere of simple, pietistic propriety.
Present, Ed win and Angelina, a modest, but deeply-enamoured
pair, shortly about to be married.

lately.

(eage r ly).
Quite provi-
dential, I call
it. Yon know,
dearest, I've
saved three
hundred
pounds for
the express
purpose; and here is an advertisement, according to whioh, for about
that sum, we can secure a complete fit-out for our little villa, whioh,
I think, will exactly suit us. Quite an exceptional chance, as the
advertiser says. A gentleman, lately arrived in this country from India,
is unexpectedly compelled to return immediately. Consequently he is
obliged to dispose at once of his lately-purchased house of furniture,
at a great sacrifice. It is as good as new, in fact, has hardly been
used at all: is elegant and substantial, and oan be seen any day
at Tamp Villa, Barnsbury, upon presentation of visiting-card.
Suppose, dearest Angy, we run over to-morrow afternoon, and have
a look at it P Such a chance—in the very nick of time, too—may
never occur again 1
Angelina. Oh, Edwin, how fortunate! Should it suit us, what a
lot of trouble it will save!
Edioin. And money, too, darling, for the prices seem to be very
low. I'm to glad you agree, dear.
Angelina [with effusion). Of course I do, Edwin. And {with
tender glance at one of the oil pictures) how delighted dear Mamma
will be 1 [Osculation, appointment, and exit.
Scene II.—Mysterious-looking Villa at Barnsbury, permeated by
strong smell of French-polish and fusty straw. Large " House
to Let" boards and posters prominently disposed. Present.
Edwin and Angelina, and a blandly loquacious person, in
black broadcloth, with a big foolscap-paper Inventory, and a
blunt-pointed pencil.
Loquacious Person {fluently). Why you see, Madam, Mr. Pawnee
Ltverless 'ad to leave for Bombay early yesterday mornin', and
was therefore obliged to leave the sale of his furniture in our hands.
But he is an old client of ours, Mr. Liverless is, and he has given
us carte blanche as regards the disposition of his effects. Only they
must be sold at once. A retired Colonel at Notting Hill, who seemed
very sweet on the bargain, promised me a decided answer by
twelve o'clock to-day. It has not come, and I am free to negotiate
with the next comer for the furniture as it stands, provided an im-
mediate settlement can be arrived at. Wait I cannot, but in any
other pertikler I shall be only too 'appy to meet your views.
Edwin. I see the. furniture is quite new?
L. P. {with cheery candour). Well, no Sir, not quite. Oh, I '11
not deceive you! It has been in use a few months,'and, as you see,
is none the worse for that. Better, if anything, being fully tested as
to seasoning. I need 'ardly tell you, Sir, that new furniture nowadays
is a .ticklish, thing to invest in. Such tricks, my dear Sir, such
nefarious dodges and artful fakements 1 (Sighs.) But—(taking up
a chair and banging it vigorously but adroitly on the floor)—this is
stuff you can depend on, and '11 be better three years hence than it
is to-day. This saddle-bag sweet, Madam, is simply luxurious,
good enough for any doocal dinin'-room; the carpets throughout
are aa elegantly hesthetick in design, as they are substantial (in
fabric, whilst the—ahem! sleeping apartments, are perfect piokters
of combined solidity and ohaste elegance. I always say, that as
a real gentleman is known by his linen, so the 'ome of a party of
true taste may be tested by the bed-rooms. You '11 excuse me,
Madam—(smirks)—but such are my sentiments, not as a salesman,
but as a family man.
[L. P. takes Edwin and Angelina the round of the house,
expatiating glowingly but discreetly as he goes, and ulti-
mately effects sale of the "furniture as it stands"for a
liberally proffered ten-pun note off the advertised sum
toUle."
Scene III.—Interior of Greengage Villa. Angelina (now Mrs.
Canoodle) discovered in tears over the wreck of a" Saddlebag"
Sofa, very shaky as to legs, and shabby as to "pile"
Angelina (sobbing). And to think that dear Edwin should have
spent his long savings on such wretched stuff as this! Oh, that
talkative but treacherous tout at Vamp Villa! Why, 'tis only six
months since we were married—(bohoo .')—and there's scarcely a
thing in the house that's not either shaky, or shabby, or both!
[Breaks down.
Edwin (entering with a flushed face, and clenched fists). Angy,
my darling, don't waste your tears over that vile combination of
unseasoned timber and devil's-dust. Rather pluck up a spirit and
pitch into me, who was fool enough to be tricked by a plausible
advertisement, a soheming vendor of shoddy furniture, a hired
villa, a verbose villain, and the thrice-told tale of a mythical
"Indian gentleman," an imaginary "emergency," and a purely
supposititious " sacrifice." [Left'
"A DANIEL!"
Years ago, when Briton Riviere painted his picture of "Daniel
in the Lions' Den," which foppishly-speaking men would speak of
as " Deniel in the Lions' Dan." publio ouriosity was aroused by the
faot that Daniel was facing the lions with his back'

by an intending purchaser, Mr. William Aonew has only to give
an adaptation of the historic reply, and say, "Whiohever you like,
my little dear; if you pay your money, you may take your ohoioe."
Now in this grand picture there is no sort of doubt, "no possible
doubt whatever," as to which is Daniel and which are the Lions;
but there must arise in the spectator's mind the question, Who was
the painter's model for this figure of Daniel? To this there can
be but one answer, "the G.O.M." This is the painter's model for
Daniel. Here he stands looking up towards the opening and seeing
daylight. His hands are tied by the bonds of a majority against
him. As for the Lions they may be Irish Lions, who may be thinking
of another grand old Dan, The Liberator, but who, once upon a time,
in the good old Kilmainham Gaol days, would have fallen upon this
G.O.M. and torn him in pieces; not so now. It is a grand picture.

Ancient Mariner is now known unto all men, from repeated and prolix narra-
tions: the tale to wit of the Mariner's startling adventure in unsailed seaa
on board his suddenly launched Home Rule Argo; how that the Ancient
Mariner shot the Oof Bird (that made the (financial) mare to go, and the
(party) breeze to blow); how that his shipmates cried out against the
Anoient Mariner for killing the bird of good luck, which lay the golden eggs,
but how, when the fog cleared off, they justified the same, and thus made
themselves accomplices in the act; how "the spell began to break;" how " the
Mariner hath been cast into a trance, and the angelic power" (of speech)
"causeth the vessel to drive northward f.ister than " (ordinary) human " life

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MODERN HERO;
Or, Sow to DiscDurage Crime.
Henry Larrikin, who was recently convicted and sentenced to
death for the murder of a nursemaid and infant on Shooter's Hill,
is now confined in Gaol, and is reported to he in excellent
spirits. He passes his time in illuminating texts, which he presents
to the Governor and Warders, and some of which have been disposed
of for enormous sums. A petition has been circulated, and exten-
sively signed, praying for a remission of his sentence, on the ground
of provocation, it having since transpired that the infant put out
its tongue in passing. Several Jurymen have said, that had this
fact been brought before them at the trial, they would have returned
a very different verdict. Much sympathy is expressed with Larrikin,
who is quite a young man. He expresses himself as sanguine of a
reprieve.
Central News Telegram.—Later Intelligence.
Monday.—Larrikin was informed this afternoon, by the Governor
of the Gaol, that the Home Secretary saw no grounds for inter-
fering with the course of the Law, and that the sentence would
consequently be carried out on Friday next. Two of the Warders,
with whom Larrikin is a great favourite, on account of the
affability and singular modesty of his demeanour, were deeply
affected, but the prisoner himself bore the news with extraordinary
fortitude and composure. His sole comment upon the intelligence
was, that it was just his blooming luck." By special favour of
the Authorities he is allowed to see the comments of the Press upon
his case, in which he takes the keenest interest. A statement that
he had on one ocoasion been introduced to the nursemaid, through
whom his career has been so tragically out short, has caused him
the deepest irritation. He wishes it to be distinctly understood
that both she and her infant charge were absolute strangers to him.
Later Telegram.
Wednesday Morning.—Larrikin continues wonderfully calm.
He is writing his Memoirs, which he has already disposed of to a
Newspaper Syndicate for a handsome consideration. Those who
have been privileged to see the manuscript report that it reveals
traces of unsuspected literary talent, and is marked in places by a
genial and genuine humour. Larrikin's great regret is that he
will be unable to have an opportunity of perusing the press-notices
and reviews of this his first essay in authorship, for which he expects
a wide popularity.
From a Special Correspondent.
Thursday.—To-day Larrikin received a vhit from an old friend,
who was visibly moved during the interview, in spite of the
prisoner's efforts to console him. There's nothing to snivel about,
old man," he said repeatedly, with a tranquil smile. He then in-
quired if it was true that there were portraits of him in several of
the papers, and was anxious to know if they were like him. He has
executed his will, leaving the copyright of his manuscript, his sole
assets, to his father, who has been in a comparatively humble
position of life, but who will now be raised to a condition of
affluence. The father has been interviewed, and stated to a reporter
that he has been muoh gratified by the expressions of sympathy
which have been showered upon his son from all sides. This morning
a local florist sent Larrikin a beautiful wreath, in which the
prisoner's initials and those of his victims were tastefully inter-
twined in violets. Larrikin was much touched, and his eyes filled
with tears, which, however, he succeeded in repressing by a strong
effort. His self-control and courage are the admiration of the
officials, by whom he will be greatly missed. All day he has been
busy packing up the furniture with which, by special permission,
his little cell has been provided by his many admirers, and the in-
terior has already lost much of its late dainty and cosy appearance.
Larrikin has been whistling a good deal,—though, as the day wore
on, the tunes he executed became of a less lively character. Towards
evening, however, he recovered his ordinary high spirits, and even
danced a "cellar-flap" for the entertainment of his Warders. A
telegram has just been handed to him from an anonymous sender,
who is understood to be a person of some eminence in bird-stuffing
oircles, which contained these words—" You are to be hung on mv
Aunt's silver-wedding day. Keep your peokerup." On reading this
message, Larrikin came more near to breaking down than he has
done hitherto. He has selected the clothes he is to wear on his last
semi-public appearance; they consist of a plain black Angora three-
button lounge coat, a purple velvet waistcoat, soft doeskin trousers,
a lay-down striped collar and dickey, and a light-blue necktie with
a glass pin. _ He has presented his only other jewellery—an oroide ring,
set with Bristol diamonds—to the Warder who has been most atten-
tive and devoted to him during his stay in gaol. He is said to have
stated that he freely forgave the infant whose insulting conduct pro-
voked his outburst, as he did the nursemaid for not restraining her
charge's vivacity. This intimation, at his express desire, will be
oonveyed to the parents of the deceased, and will doubtless afford
them the highest consolation.

THE COUNTRY HOUSE.
(What Our Architect has to put up with.)
Fair Client. " I want it to be nice and baronial, Queen Anne
and Elizabethan, and all that; rind of quaint and Ncrem
berot, you know— regular old english, with french windows
OrENINO TO THE LaWN, AND VENETIAN BLINDS, AND SORT OF Swiss
Balconies, and a Loooia. But I'm sure you know what I mean I"
Thursday Night, Later.—Larrikin is sleeping peacefully. His
features—refined by the mental anxiety, and the almost monastio
seclusion to which he has been lately subjected—are extremely
pleasing, and even handsome, set-off as they are by the clean collar
which he has put on in anticipation of his approaching doom.
Before sinking into childlike slumber, he listened with evident
pleasure to a banjo which was being played outside a public-house
in the vicinity of the gaol. The banjoist is now being interviewed,
and believes that the air he must have been performing at the time
was "The Lost Chord." The scaffold on whioh the unfortunate
Larrikin is to expiate his imprudent act is now being erected, but
the workmen's hammers have been considerately covered with felt
to avoid disturbing the slumberer.
Friday Morning, 9 a.m.—All is now over. The prisoner rose
early and made a hearty breakfast, and plainly enjoyed the cigar
which he smoked afterwards with his friend the Governor, who
seemed to regard the entrance of the executioner as an untimely
interruption to the conversation. "You'll have to wait a bit for
the rest of that story, Governor," was Larrikin's light-hearted
oomment. The unhappy man then (Detail* follow which tee
prefer to leave to the reader's imagination—he will find them all in
the very next special description of such a scene). Larbiktn was
most anxious that it should be widely known that, in his own words,
"he was true to himself and the public, and game to the last."
Several reporters were present in the prison-yard, and also a
number of persons of distinction, who were only admitted as a great
favour. It is said that the prison Authorities were compelled to
disappoint thousands who had applied for permission to view the
last sad scene.
Larrikin's melancholy end will doubtless operate as a warning
and an example to many romantic youths, who are only too easily
led away by the morbid desire for notoriety, which is so prevalent
nowadays, and whioh is so difficult either to account for, or dis-
courage.— (Special Descriptive Report.)

IN OUR GARDEN.
Monday, November 24.

habmed to have a visit
from Old Morality to-
day. Most kind of him
to find time to run down,
seeing all he has on hand.
But he's a really good
fellow, of the kind who
in all circumstances find
time to do a friendly
thing. Always from the
first taken a friendly
interest in our little ex-
periment. He is, indeed,
indireotly personally re-
sponsible for its under-
taking. If I hadn't come
across him playing leap-
frog before dinner with
Akebs - Douglas _ and
J ackson, as mentioned
some weeks ago, Sauk
and I would never have tried tbis way of passing a Recess.
Hadn't heard Old Morality was going to look in. Expeot he wasn't
sure he could get away from Cabinet Council, and so didn't write. When
I came upon him he was standing absorbed in contemplation of Abpach-
shad. Abpachshad, himself, so engrossed in problem occupying his mind,
that he did not notice our visitor. Had started yesterday cutting grass
on lawn with machine. Getting on pretty well with it till, this morning,
wind rose, blowing half a gale from Westward. Arpachshad discovered
that, starting with machine from the Westward, he, with wind blowing
astern, got on capitally; but coming back, with wind ahead, there was
decided addition to labour of propelling machine. When Old Mobaiity
arrived, Abpachshad had halted midway across the lawn, and was
looking Westward with air of profound and troubled cogitation.
"I know what he's thinking of," said Old Morality, whose Parlia-
mentary experience has made him an adept at thought-reading; he's
wondering if it's possible to mow the lawn all from the Westward, so
that he would have the wind behind him throughout the operation."
No doubt Old Morality had fathomed depth of Arpachshad's medi-
tations. Pretty to see his manoeuvring: Went down full-sail with
assistance of favouring gale; tried to tack back, bearinir away to the
North; when he'd got a little way, slewed round to the West, going off
before the wind to edge of lawn. Finally borne in upon him that the
position was inexorable. He couldn't go with the wind all the time;
must retrace his steps; by tacking was really covering more ground than
need be; was, in fact, doing more work than he had intended. Shocked
at this disoovery proceeded to follow ordinary courEe. Presently catching
sight of solitary leaf careering down walk, fetched broom, and tenderly
tickled the gravel in pursuit of the leaf.
"There is," Sark sharply observed, " nothing Arpachshad enjoys more
than dusting the walk with a broom. It is a process that combines the
maximum of appearance of hard work with the minimum of exertion."
Old Morality pretty lively in anticipation of Session, which opens to-
morrow. Always inclined to take sanguine view of situation. Doesn't
vary now. "Oh, you leave it to us, Toby, dear boy." he said, when I
expressed hope that he would not risk his precious life and health by
overdoing it. "We've got a splendid programme, and mean to pall
through every Bill. Didn t do much last year, it is true: but don't you
see the advantage of that? If we'd passed all our Bills last Session,
must have arranged a new programme this year, involving considerable
labour. As it is we turn a handle, and there are all the old. things once
more; homely and (friendly; as the poet says,'All, all, are
come, the old familiar faces.' There's the Irish Local Govern-
ment Bill, the Tithes Bill, Employers' Liability, and a troop of
others. All been brought in before; everybody knows about
them; if we don't pass them this Session they must come up
again next."
"Ha!" said Sark; "so there is to be a next Session."
"Certainly," said Old Morality—"and we would have
another, if we could. In fact, I'm not quite sure whether it
may not be managed. We are always suspending Standing
Orders, of one kind or another. It is a Standing Order of the
Constitution that no Parliament shall sit longer than seven
years. Very good—in an ordinary way, excellent; though,
perhaps, a little too liberal in its arrangements when Mr. G. is
in power. Bat as you, Toby, may, in earlier years, diligently
striving after improvement in oaligraphy, have had occasion to
note, Circumstances alter Cases. Here we are, a contented
Government, with a Parliamentary majority always to be relied
upon. Why disturb an ordered state of affairs, and plunge the
country into the turmoil and expense of a General Election?
Why not bring in a short Bill to suspend the Septennial Act,
and let the present Parliament go on sitting indefinitely? Why
should the Long Parliament remain a monopoly of the Seven-
teenth Century P I do not mind telling you (this, of course, in
confidence) that we have talked the matter over in the Cabinet
It was the Markiss who first started it; and, though one or two
objections have been raised, the idea is rather growing upon us.
and I should not wonder if it oame to something. You will
find no mention of it in the Queen's Speech—but that is neither
there nor here."
"I have noticed," said Sark, "that of late it has happened
that Bills mentioned in the Queen's Speech come to nothing,
whilst the Session islargely taken up with discussion of Bills which
find no place in that catalogue. Last year, for example, Jokih's
Compensation Bill wasn't mentioned in the Queen's Speech; and
yet it filled a large part in the programme of the Session."
"Ah," said Old Morality, changing the subject, "I see
Arpachshad has nearly come up with that leaf. He '11 be going
to his dinner now, I suppose, and I think I must be off. Shall
see you at the House to-morrow. Sorry for you to break up the
associations of your rural life; but that only temporary."
Saw Old Morality off at the station. Came back to pack
up our spade and hoe, and leave some general instructions with
Abpachshad. He seems muoh touched at the approaching sepa-
ration. Quite unable to continue the lawn-mowing. Followed
us about with his jack-knife open, clipping here and there a
dead stem, so as to keep up an appearance of incessant labour.
"Ours is only a ohange of occupation, Abpachshad," said
8ark. "We cease to labour here, but we carry on onr work in
another field. We go to town, leaving, as the Poet Gray might
have said, the garden to solitude and you."
"Excuse me. Gents," said Abpachshad. a look of anxiety
crossing his mobile face, "but you can't leave it t) me alto-
gether. I could manage well enough when you were here, helpin'
and workin'. But, when you 're gone, I '11 have to have at least
one extry man." Sark pleased at this testimony to value of our
assistance; but it really means that Arpachshad intends to do
less than ever, running us into the expense of a second gardener.
PARS ABOUT PICTURES.
Arrive at Fine Art Society's Place, and there look at
Hokusai's drawings and engravings. Who was HokusaiP
Why, don't you know? He was our
own Lika-Joko's great-grandfather.
"Great-grandfather was a most won-
derful man, There's none of 'em does
what great-grandfather can," except
Lika Joko, of course. Obliged to say
this, because I know Lika Joko goes
about with a Daimio's two-handed
sword, and he would think nothing of
giving me the cut direct. But to re-
turn to Hokusai—sounds like sneezing
in a Dutoh dialect, doesn't it?—his
drawings are full of originality and
humour; he was possessed of wondrous
versatility and great industry. He
began to draw at six, and continued
till he was well-nigh ninety. Were he

MODERN TYPES.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.)
No. XXII.—THE MANLY MAIDEN.
The Manly Maiden may be defined as the feminine exaggeration
of those rougher qualities which men display in their intercourse
with one another, or in the pursuit of those sports in which courage,
strength, and endurance play a part. In a fatal moment she con-
ceives the idea that she can earn the proud title of "a good fellow"
by emulating the fashions and the habits of the robuster sex. She per-
ceives that men have a liking for men who are strong, bluff, outspoken,
and contemptuous of peril, and she infers mistakenly, that the same
tribute of admiration is certain to be paid to a woman who, setting
the traditions of her sex at defianoe, consciously apes the manly
model without a thought of all that the imitation involves. She
forgets that as soon as a woman steps down of her own free will
from the pedestal on which the chivalrous admiration of men has
placed her, she abandons at once her claim to that flattering reticence
of speech, and that specially attentive courtesy of bearing, which
are in men the outward and visible signs of the
spiritual grace whioh they assume as an attribute
of all women. In spite of what the crazy theo-
rists of the perfect equality school may say, men
still continue to expeot and to admire in women
precisely those qualities in which they feel
themselves to be chiefly deficient. Their rever-
ence and affection are bestowed upon her whose
voice is ever soft, gentla'and low, and whose
mild influence is shed like a balm upon the
labours and troubles of life. Of slang, and of
slaps upon the back, of strength, whether of
language or of body, they get enough and to
spare amongst themselves, and they are scarcely
to be blamed if at certain moments they should
prefer refinement to roughness, and gentleness
to gentlemen. However, these obvious conside-
rations have no weight with the Manly Maiden.
In fact they never occur to her, and hence arise
failures, and humiliations, and disappointments
not a few.
The Manly Maiden is not, as a rule, the
natural product of a genuine country life. The
daughter of rich parents, who have spent a
great part of their lives in a centre of com-
mercial activity, she is introduced to a new
home in the country at about the age of four-
teen. Seeing that all those who live in the neighbourhood are
in one way or another associated with outdoor sports, and that the
favour in whioh the men are held and their tame vary directly
as their power to ride or to shoot straight, she becomes possessed
by the notion that she too must, if she is to please at all, be proficient
in the sports of men. Merely to ride to hounds is, of course, not
sufficiently distinctive. Many women do that, without losing at all
the ordinary characteristics of women. She must ride bare-hacked,
she must understand a horse's ailments and his points, she must
trudge (in the constant society of men) over fallows and through
turnips in pursuit of partridges, she must be able to talk learnedly
of guns, of powders, and of snot, she must possess a gun of her own,
ana think she knows how to use it, she must own a retriever, and
herself make him submissive by the frequent application of a silver-
headed dog-whip.
These attainments are her ideals of earthly bliss, and she sets out
to realise them with a terrible perseverance. Her father, of course,
knows but little of sport. He is, however, afflicted with the ordinary
desire to shine as a sportsman, and as a host of sportsmen. He
stocks his coverts with game, and invites large shooting parties to
stay with him. He himself takes to a gun as a hen might take to
the water; although, as his daughter contemptuously expresses it,
be is calculated to miss a hippopotamus at ten yards, he seems to
imagine, if one may be permitted to judge from the wild frequenoy
of his shots, that it is the easiest thing in the world to hit a pheasant
or a partridge flying at ten times that distance. From such a
father the Manly Maiden easily secures permission, first of all, to
walk with the men while they are shooting, and subsequently to
carry a gun herself.
And now the difficulties of the situation begin to make themselves
felt, not, indeed, by her, for she remains sublimely unconscious to
the end, but by the men who are compelled to associate with her
upon her ventures. No man will ever hesitate to rebuke another for
carrying his gun in suoh a way as to threaten danger; but, when a
lady allows him to inspect the inside of her loaded gun-barrels, or
shoots down the line at an evasive rabbit, he must suffer in silence,
and can only seek compensation for restraining his tongue by in-
continent! '■
shoot nor
ly removing his body to a safe place, where he can neither
be shot. At luncheon, however, he may be gratified by
hearing the Manly Maiden rally him on the poor result of his morn-
ing's sport. She will then favour him, at length, with her opinions
as to how a driven partridge or a rocketing pheasant should be shot,
flavouring her discourse with copious extracts from the Badminton
books on shooting, and adding here and there imaginative remi-
niscences of her own exploits in dealing death. In the hunting-field
she will lose her groom, and babble sport to the Master, with whom
she further ingratiates herself by rating and lashing one of his
favourite hounds, or by heading the fox whenever he attempts to
break away. She then crosses him at an awkward fence, and con-
siders herself aggrieved by the strong language whioh breaks
irresistibly from the fallen sportsman's lips. Later on she astonishes
an elderly follower of the hounds by asking him for a draught from
his flask, and completes his amazement by complaining of the thought-
less manner in whioh he has diluted his brandy.
In the evening she will narrate her adventures at length, amidst
a chorus of admiring comments from her fond parents, and their
parasites, and will follow up her triumphs of the day by pursuing
the men into the smoking-room, where she permits one of them to
offer her a cigarette, and imagines that she delights him by accept-
ing it. On suoh an occasion she will inform one
of her friends that, on the whole, she has but a
poor opinion of Diana of the Ephesians, seeing
that she only hunted with women, and never
allowed men to approach her. From this it may be
'inferred that her stock of classical allusions is not
I quite so accurate and complete as that of a genuine
. jkUit! sportswoman should be. Next morning she may
.. .. •> '! be seen schooling her horses in the park. She
has a touching faith in the use both of spur
and of whip whenever the occasion seems least
to demand them, and she despises the man who
rides without rowels, and reverences one who
attempts impossible jumps without discrimi-
nation. During the summer she spends a con-
siderable part of her time in "getting fit" for
the labours of the autumn and winter. Some-
times she even plays cricket, and has been
known to address the ball that bowled her in
highly uncomplimentary terms.
So the years pass on. She never learns that
it is possible for a woman on certain occasions to
be in the way of men, nor does her accuracy or
her care with a gun increase. If she marries at
all, she will marry some feeble creature who
has no feeling for sport, and over whom she can
lord it to her heart's content. But it is more
probable that she fwill remain unwedded, and will develop eventu-
ally from a would-be harding-riding maiden, into a genuinely hard-
featured old maid.
A MUSICAL POLE STAR.
The Irish Polar Star Musical, yclept our Paddy Rewski, gave his
last " recital" at St. James's Hall, Thursday, November 27. Bedad,
then, 'tis Misther Paddy Rewski himself that is the broth of a boy
entirely at the piano-forte, but, Begorra, he'« better at the piano
than the forte. He gave us a nice mixture of Handel, Beethoven,
Chopin, Liszt, and then a neat little oompo of his own, consisting of
a charming theme, with mighty ingenious and beautiful variations,
all his own, divil a less. Great success for Paddy Rewski. The
Irish Pole, or Pole-ished Irishman, has thoroughly mastered his art.
but if he has learnt how to master tune he has not yet perfected
himself in keeping strict time, as he took his seat at the piano just
one quarter of an hour late. Paddy Rewski, me bhoy, when next
you give us a recital, remember that punctuality is the soul of
business. Au revoir, Paddy Rewski!

A CAUTION TO SNAKES.

"There is, however, another opinion prevalent among the less educated which gives to the Battle-snake the vindictive spirit of the North American
Indian, and asserts that it adds a new joint to its rattle whenever it has slain a human being, thus bearing in its tail the fearful trophies of its
prowess, just as the Indians wear the scalps of slain foes."— Wood's Natural llistory.

"iNonre is Snakes!" And from its lair
This snake seems stirring. Who cries
"Soare!"?
Well, they who hear the rattle
Close at their heels, its spring will dread,
And wary watch and cautions tread,
And arm as though for battle.
Even to drive the keen-fanged snake
From its old home in swamp or brake
Irks sensitive humanity;
But they who know the untamed thing,
Have felt its fang, have seen its spring,
Hold mercy mere insanity.
Untamed,'untameable,'it hides,
Anguis in herbd, coils and glides,
And strikes when least expeoter1,
And who shall blame its watchful foe
Who stands prepared to strike a blow,
When the swift death's deteoted.P
In the dark jungle dim and damp
It lurks, and Civilisation's tramp
Disturbs its sanctuary.
Hard on the snake? Perchance, p< r hince!
But Civilisation, to advance,
Must ruthless be, as wary.

Of slow extermination.

got together a pretty tidy Army, that should
beat Barnum into small potatoes. The Arabs
from Earl's Court will soon go along straight
enough. They seem to miss the Louvre
Theatre over yonder, where they were on the
free list Rather a pity I oan't start a Show
here, but I calculate the country is too dis
turbed.
Tuesday— Nothing much doing. Sent along
to Shall Bite, and he has promised to come
round along with a few of the Ghost-Dancers
to let me see what I think of them. Fancy
the ballet has been done before. That olever
cuss Gus, must have used it at Covent Garden
when he put up Robert the Devil. It
seems like the Nun Ballet—uncommonly.
Wednesday— Small Bite is here. He's
friendly enough, but his terms are too high.
Fancy they must have been trying to annex
him for the Aquarium. The Ghost-Dance is
a fraud. Nothing in it. Might fake it up a
bit with national flags and red fire. But it's
decidedly disappointing. Altogether small
pumpkins.
Thursday.—Settlers want to know when
I am going to begin. They are always in
such a darned hurry. They ought to know
I am the hero of a hundred fights (see my
Autobiography—a few copies of which may
still be had at the almost nominal price of
half-a-dollar) and should rely on me accord-
ingly. Am to visit the Indian Camp to-
morrow.
Friday.—Terms agreed. Small Bite and
fifty braves engage themselves for six months
certain, sharing terms, travelling exes, and
one clear benefit. I find front of the curtain
and advertising, they provide entertainment,
which is to include Ghost-Dance (with ban-
ners and red fire) religious rites, war-dance,
and scalping expedition with incidentals
(Small Bite says he knows "some useful
knockabout niggers ") and procession in and
out of towns. Think I can boom it.

And deep than that of I sis.

honi,u;able name fur the faci. We might have done with a few less,
perhaps, but, as in the celebrated case of the war-song of the Jingoes,
if we ve got the men, and the money too, then there was every
reason why the redoubtable Lewis (whose name, as brotherly Masons
will call to mind, means " Strength ") Bhould have put a whole army
of Romans on the stage, if it so pleased him.
For its mise-en-scene alone the revival should attract all London.
But there is more than this—there is the clever and careful imper-
sonation of Enoharbut by His Gracious Heaviness, Mr. Arthur
Stirling; then
there is a lighter-
comedy touoh in
the courteous and
gentlemanly ren-

—one of the best
things in the
piece, but from
the inheritor of
two such good old
theatrical name3,
much is expected.

nor is the play a good play for the matter of that. I believe it never
has been a success, but if, apart from the really great attraction of
gorgeous spectacular effects, there is any one scene above another
which might well draw all London, it is the death of Cleopatra,
which to my mind is—after the fall of Wolsey, and a long way
after, too,—one of the most pathetio pictures ever presented on the
stage. So lonely in her grandeur, so grand, and yet so pitiable in her
loneliness is this poor Queen of Beauty, this Empress-Butterfly, who
can conquer conquerors, and for whose sake not only her noble lovers,
but her poor humble serving-maids, are willing to die.

Her last scene is beyond all compare her best, and to those who
are inclined to be disappointed with the play after the First Act is

The Gaiety.—In calling their burlesque Carmen up to Data, pos-
sibly the two dear clever boys who wrote it
intended some crypto-jocosity of whioh the
hidden meaning is known only to the initiated
in these sublime mysteries. Why " Data"?
On the other hand, "Why not?"
However attractive or not as a heading in a
bill of the play, the Gaiety Carmen is, on the
whole, a merry, bright, and light burlesque-
ish piece, though, except in
the oostume and make-up
of Mr. Arthur Williams
as Captain Zuniga, there is
nothing extraordinarily
"burlesque" in the appear-
anoe of any of the charac-
ters, as the appearance of
Mr. Horace Mills as
Remendado belongs more to
Christmas pantomime than
to the sly suggestiveness of
real burlesque.
As Miss St. John simply
looks, aots, and sings as a
genuine Carmen, I can only
suppose that her voice is not
strong enough for the real
Opera; otherwise I doubt
whether any better operatic _ . _. _. , „
impertonator of the real 8cene from the Cigarette History of Carmm.
character could be found. She is not the least bit burlesque, and
though the songs she has to sing are nothing like so telling as those
she has had given her in former pieces, yet, through her rendering,
most are encored, and all thoroughly appreciated.
Mr. Arthur Williams as Zuniga is very droll, reminding some
— of us, by his make-up and jerky style,
of Milher as the comic Valentine in Le
Petit Fault. Mr. Lonnen is also uncom-
monly good as the spoony soldier, and
in the telling song of "The Bogie
Man:" and in the still more telling
dance with which he finishes it and
makes his exit, he makes the hit of the
evening,—in fact the hit by which the
piece will be remembered, and to whioh
it owes the greater part of its success.
In the authors' latest adaptation of
the very ancient "business of "the
statues''—consisting of a verse, and
then an attitude, I was disappointed,
as I had been led to believe that here
we should see what Mr. Lonnen could
do in the Robsonian or burlesque-
tragedy style. The brillianoy of the
costumes, of the scenery, the grace of
the four dancers, and the excellence of
band and chorus, under the direction
of that ancient mariner Meter Luiz,
are such as are rarely met with else-
where.
Mr. George Edwardes may now
attend to the building of his new theatre, as Carmen up to Data
will not give him any trouble for some time to come.

quite a bright
Easy for our very

Turning from novels, it
a relief to come across
inviting a little volume as the
Pocket Atlas, and Gazetteer
of Canada, which will be
found of the greatest possible
value to eccentric Londoners
who purpose visiting the Do-
minion during the coming
Winter.
"Persicos odi," but you
won't agree with Hoeacb if
you follow this " puer appa-
ratus" of G. Norway, who,
exciting adventures of a Persian boy,
'Twixt School and College, by Gordon Stables, has nothing to do
with horsey experiences, as suggested by the author's name, but is the
uneventful home-life of a poor Sootoh laddie, who triumphs by dint
of pluok.
Nutbrown Roger and I, by J. H. Yoxall, a romance of the
highway, quite in the correct style of disguises and blunderbusses
always so necessary for a tale of this kind.
Disenchantment is the—not altogether—enticing title of "an
everyday story," by F. Mabel Robinson, author of The Plan of
Campaign. It is rather a long tale to tell, for it takes 432 pages in
the unravelling. It ends with a beautiful avowal that "the heart i>
no more
but an
woman, it would seem that the foundation is laid for a liequel to
Disenchantment that might be appropriately called Divorce.
The Secret of the Old House, by Evelyn Everett Green, who
evidently can't keep a secret to himself, will be so no longer when
the ohildren have satisfied their curiosity by reading the book.
My faithful " Co." declares that he has been recently hard at work
novel-reading. He has been revelling in an atmosphere of romance.
He has been moved almost to tears by Lady Hazleton's Confession,
by Mrs. Kent Spenser, whioh, he says, includes, amongst many
moving passages, some glimpses of Parliamentary life. Friend
Olivia, in one bulky volume, takes the reader back to the days of
Cromwell, when people said " hath," instead of " has," and "pray
resolve-me truly,'' instead of "don't sell me;" and "Mr. John
Milton" played upon the organ. It has a fine old crusty Puritan
flavour about it, whioh, however, does not prevent the hero and
heroine, in the last page, reading a letter together, "with smiles,
and little laughs, and sweet asides, and sweeter kisses." Altogether,
a book to read when a library does not contain Walter Scott,
Alexandre Dumas pere, G. P. R. James, or Harrison Ainsworth.
Two Masters deals with passages in the life of a young lady who is
described as " a Boarding-school Miss" in Volume I., and " a young
she-fiend" in Volume III. However, it is only right to say, that
the last compliment is paid to her by a gentlemanly murderer, who
takes poison and a cigarette, with a view to escaping a justly-deserved
death on the gallows. From this it may be seen, that the novel is at
times slightly sensational. Fearing that his Christmas might be
saddened by this last ghastly incident, were not the impression

Schoolfellows, and Bonnie Boy's Soap Bubble. He considers the
first admirably adapted to the comprehension of the readers to whom
it is addressed, only the girls, he says, should be very young girls.
My Schoolfellows he intends reading again when he has reached his
second childhood, when he fanoies he will be better pleased with the
humours of " Guttling Gut" and " Ned Never Mind." In conclu-
sion, he admits that he is a little doubtful about the merits or
demerits of Bonnie Boy's Soap Bubble. He explains, that while he
was reading it he "feu a thinking," and that when he woke up, the
The Snake's Pais, by Beak Stoker, M.A. (Sampson Low), is a
simple love-story, a pure idyl of Ireland, whioh does not seem, after
all, to be so distressful a country to live in. Whiskey punch flows

knows the Irish peasant, and reproduces his talk with a fidelity
whioh almost suggests that he, too, is descended from one of the

respeot of the science of drainage, which, if all stories be true, he
might find opportunity of turning to account in the every-day (or,
rather, every-night) world of the theatre. In his novel he utilises
it in the preliminaries of shifting a mighty bog, the last stages
whereof are described in a ohapter that, for sustained interest,
recalls Charles Rkade's account of the breaking of the Sheffield

RED VERSUS BLACK.
{Two Views of the same place, by Gentlemen "who Write to the Papers.")
Opinion No. 1.—Monte Carlo I One of the most disgraceful places
in Europe—a blot upon our civilisation. The gambling is productive
of the greatest possible misery. It is an institution that should be
held up to the execration of mankind. All the riffraff of the globe
are attracted to this hideous spot. The place is like an upas-tree,
under whioh everything noble and good languishes and dies! The
form of Government is absolutely immoral. It is a scandal that
rates, and taxes, and publio improvements should be paid for out of
the private purse of the Director. He could not afford it had he not
made a fortune out of his ill-gotten gains! Anyone who has
watched at the tables knows that the chances are absolutely unfair—
that the Direction must win. Not that this matters much. It is the
general immorality of the place that is so alarming. The place
should be closed at once; ana persons who have lost anything, say,
during the last year, should have their money promptly returned to
them. And I say this without any bias, although I did back Red,
and Black came up ten times running I
P.S.—Just won a trifle. Not so sure that my pessimist view may
not be modified.
Opinion No. 2.—Monte Carlo! Without exception, the loveliest
spot in Europe. The so-called gambling is the cause of numberless
blessings. It is an institution that should be held up to the admira-
tion of mankind. All the aristocracy of the civilised world nook to
it to indulge in a recreation to which only the greatly prejudiced
can possibly take exception. The Government is benevolent to the
last degree. In what other country are rates, taxes, and improve-
ments paid for you P If the Direotor were not the best of men, how
could this be done? The play itself is absolutely fair. And, with
a system, and a sufficiency of capital, anyone is able to realise a
large fortune in less than no time. Not that this absolute certainty
should be taken into consideration. It is the general morality of
the place that is so encouraging. The place should never close.
And it would be a graceful thing if those who have laid, in a store
for their old age were to return a trifle, to be expended on some
charity. And I say this without any bias, although I have backed
Black ten times successfully.
P.S.—Just lost all I had. Not so sure that my optimist view is
not open to rectification!

"The hand of such as Mabmion!" Ay!
Great Singer of the knightly lay,
Thy tale of Flodden field
Is darkened by unknightly stain.
That slackened arm and burdened brain
Of him found low among the slain,
Constrained at last to yield
To a mere "base marauder's lance ;"
He, firm of front and cold of glance,
The dark, the dauntless Mabmion.—
The days of chivalry are gone,
Dispraisers of the present say,
Yet men arm still for party fray
As fierce as foray old;
And mail is donned, and steel is drawn,
And champions challenging at dawn
Ere night lie still and cold.
Two champions here 'midst loud applause,
Have led the lists in a joint cause
On many a tourney morn,
Have fought to van ward in the field
Full many an hour, and, sternly steeled,
One banner forward borne.
And now —ah, well, as Douglas old
On Marmion looked sternly cold,
8o looks this Chieftain grey
On his old comrade, though the fight
Is forward now, and many a knight
Is arming for the fray.
As " the demeanour changed and cold
Of Douglas fretted Marmion bold,"
Has this old greyhaired Chieftain's chill
Fretted that man of ioy will f
Who knows—or cares to know P
At least he "has to learn ere long
That constant mind, and hate of wrong"
Than steely pride are yet more strong;
That shame can strike a blow
At comradeship more fatal far
Thin any chance of fateful war
When faction howled with Cerberus throat,
When falsehood struok a felon stroke,
When forgery did its worst
To pull its hated quarry down,
To dim, disarm, degrade, discrown.
Against the array aocurst
That ancient chief made gallant head,
Dismayed not, nor disquieted
At rancour's rude assault.
He shared opprobrium undeserved,
But not for that had courage swerved,
Or loyalty made default.
But now r The hand that reared hath razed
And as old Angus stood amazed
At Wilton's shameful tale,
I So fealty here must bend the brow,
! And faith, though sorely tried, till now
Surviving, faint and fail;
As Douglas round him drew his cloak,
So, saddened by unknightly stroke,
The ancient chief must draw;
Nor in mere pharisaic scorn,
But in the name of faith foresworn
And honour's broken law.
'' 'Tig pity of him, too!" 'Twas so,
The half-relenting Angus, low
Spake in his snowy beard.
"Bold can he speak, and fairly ride:
I warrant him a warrior tried."
A foeman to be feared,
A leader to be trusted, seemed
This dark, cold chief, and few had dream id
Of suoh strange severance.
And any not ignoble eye
In sorrow more than mockery
Aside will gladly glance.
'Tie pity of it! Right or wrong,
The Cause needs champions true as s'long,
And blameless as they 're bold.'
"A sinful heart makes feeble hand,"
Cried Marmion, his " failing brand"
Cursing with lips grown cold.
Let vulgar venom triumph here,
And hate, itself from shame not clear,
Make haste to hurl the stone;
A nobler foe will stand aside,
And more in sorrow than in pride,
Xot hot to harry or deride,
Like Douglas in his halls abide,
But keep his hand—his own 1

A LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY VERY MUCH AT SEA.

"The Royal Society of Painters in Water-Colours P"
said young Par. "Nonsense! why all the water is
frozen now, and so they can't paint!" "Precisely,"
replied I; *' and that's why it is a nice exhibition I"
This so startled Young Par that he slipped and fell.
I turned into the Gallery in Pall Mall, and left him
sitting on the cold hard nags outside. Inside pleasant
enough. Birket Foster's " Island of Rum " very com-
forting—should like some hot. Herbert Marshall—
our own City Marshall—has gone further afield, to
"Old Cheltea." Should now he called the Field Mar

is a hail fellow well met! "The Corso, Veronal' by
8. J. Hodson, shows that Hodson's choice is a good one.
Henry Moore's sea-pieoes—the more the merrier, say I.
"Warkxcorth—Sunlit Shower," by A. W. Hunt: a walk
worth taking when the hunt is up. "Holidays Poet and
Future," suggests wide subjects and open spaces. Why,
then, is it painted by Smallfield?" Wreck of the
HalsweU," is a terrible catastrophe. Can't be "All's
Well." Possibly the painter, G. H. Andrews, means '' all
swell"—that seems a great deal more likely. Albert
Goodwin shows himself to be a good winner in the
"Ponte Vecchio, Florence." Du Mauhier delights us
with some clever Society sketches in pen and pencil. The
veteran, Sir John Gilbert, is as young, as dashing, as
vigorous as ever. H. G. Glindoni has two pictures full
of humour and character. Stacy Mares' Cockatoo"
looks as if it had just flown in from the Zoo. "Au
Sgarnach," by C. B. Phillip. Title difnoult to under-
stand. Landscape easy to comprehend. A close study
of Nature, admirably painted. A wholesome Phillippio
against namby-pamby prettiness. "On the Thames,"
by G. A. Fbipp, honestly painted, and no frippery
about it. Miss Clara Montalba has a large number of
piotures of Venice—and Mr. Ridge comes up and says
he is the Keeper. What Keeper P He whispers, he is
the Keeper of the Cold Out—What an oridginal remark!

remain there, and continue to be
Yours par-adoxically, Old Par.
ROBERT AT THE HOPERA.
I was babel the other day to do Brown a 'good turn by getting
him engaged at won of our big Otels, so he kindly offerd to stand a
supper, and then take me to the Hopera at Common Garden. We
went to see Horfay.
It seems that wunce upon a time, ever so many thowsand years
ago, before there was not no Lord Mares, nor no Slurry It's, nor not
ewen no Aldermen, a Gent of the name of Horfay lived in Grease.
He was the werry grandest Fiddler of his time, a regler Joey Kim.
Well, he married a werry bewtiful wife, of the name of Yourriditee,
and they was both werry appy, till one day, as she was a having a
run in a field, a norrid serpent bit her in her heel; so she died.
Well, while poor Mr. Horfay is a telling us all about his trubbel.
in comes a werry bewtiful young lady with a pair of most bewtiful
wings on, and she werry kindly gives him a new sort of magio Fiddle,
called, as I was told, A Liar! to go to—go down to you kno where, to
git his wife back! Off he goes, and the neks sean shows us the werry
plaice, all filled with savidges, and demons, and snakes, and things;
and presently, when Mr. Horfay is seen a dimming down, all the
demons and savidges runs at him to stop him; but he holds up the
Liar, and begins for to sing, and most bewtifully too, tho' I didn't kno
the tune; they all makes way for him, and he gos bang into lots of
big flames, and so I werry naturally thort as how it was all over.
But not a bit of it, for in the werry next sean we sees him with his
Liar in a most lovly garden, all full lof most lovly flowers and trees,
and numbers of bewtiful ladies, a dancing and enjoying theirselves
like fun, until his Liar leads him rite up to his wife, and then he
raps harf his scarf round her, and off they gos together, both on 'em
dowtless a longing for a reel nupshal kiss, but poor Mr. Horfay not
a daring for to look at her, becoz if he does before he gets her home,
she will be ded again direckly I Was there hever such a tanterlisiug
case ever known 1 When she sings to him to give her one loving look,
he sings to her to say he mustn t, until at Iarst she sets down on a
nice cumi'iTel-looking sofy, as appens for to be in the werry middel
of the street, and says, werry artfully, as she earn't go not one step
farther, when in course he turns round, and rushes up to her to have
one fond embrace, and, thank goodness, they has it, and then she
falls back dead 1
Well, now, I knos as I'm onv a mere Hed Waiter, and, therefore,
not xpected to have any werry fine feelings, like my betters has, but
I do declare that, when I saw this sad, sad end to all that grand
amount of reel true Love, the tears run down my cheeks like
rain, and I was a getting np to go away, when presently in came
the lovly angel again, whose name I was told was Love, and told
him that such love as his could conker Death itself; and she brort
the pore wife to life again, and all hended, as all things shood end,
jovial, and oumferal, and happy. What a wunderful thing is
Musio! It didn't seem at all1 strange to me that not one single word
was spoke all the heavening, but ewery word sung, and in a forren
tung, too, that I didn't ^understand, the bewtiful story kep my
atention fixt the hole time, and I warked home in the poring rain,
werry thankful, and jest a leetle prowd, that in one thing, at least, I
was not xacly like Brown, who slept carm and content thro the hole

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DRESS DRAMA.
(By a Pbrplixed Playwbight.)
I've sot myself into a horrible mess,
Of that there can be no manner of doubt,
And my forehead is aching, because 1 've been making
A desperate effort to get myself ont,
And I'm given away, so it seemeth to me,
Like a threepenny vase with a pound of tta.
I promised an aotress to write her a play,
With herself, of course, in the leading part,
With abundance of bathos paraded as pathos,
And a gallery death of a broken heart—
It's a capital plan, I fiDd, to try
To arrange apart where the audienca cry.
So I quickly think of a beautiful plot,
The interest ne'er for an instant nags;
The sorrowful ending is almost heart-rendinr,
As the heroine comes on in tatters and rags.
It is better than aught I have thought of before,
And will certainly run for a twelvemonth or more.
Yet, alas! for my prospect of glory and gain.
She has strangltd my play at its moment of birth,
For now she has written to Bay she is smitten
With the newest designs and creations of Worth,
And to quote her own words—" Ab a matter of fact,
I've a couple of cottumes for every act."
Then there follows a list of the things she has bought.
Though I'm puzzled indeed as to what it may mean.
(hi is painfully pat in her jargon cf satin,
Alpaca, nun's veiling, tulle, silk, grenadine,
And Bhe asks me to Bay if I honestly think
tone should die in pearl-grey, golden-brown, or shrimp-
pink P
So here I am left in this pitiful plight.
With nothing but dresses, what am I to do?
For I haven't a notion what kind of emotion
Is suited to ooral or proper for blue;
And if, when she faints, but they think she is dead,
Old-gold or sea-green would be better than red.
Will crushed strawberry do for an afternoon call?
For the evening would salmon or olive be right?
Miy a charming young fellow embrace her in yellow?
Must she sorrow in black '( Must I wtd her in white P
Till, dazed and bewildered, my eyesight grows dim,
And my head, throbbing wildly, commences to swim.
'Twere folly and madness to try any more,
I know what I '11 do—in a letter to-day
I will just tell her plainly how utterly vainly
I've striven and struggled to finish her play;
And then—happy thought 1—1 will mildly suggest
That she 'U fina for her purpose Buchanan the_best.
I shall now write a play without dresses at all,
A plan, which I'm sure will be perfectly new.
Yet opposed to convention, why merely the mention
Of a thing so immodest will startle a few;
And, although it's a pity, I shrewdly suspect
The Lord Chamberlain might deem it right to object.
Better still! from the French I will boldly convey
r What will be (in two senses) the talk of the town.
You insist on a moral? Well, pray do not quarrel
With the one that I now for your guidance lay down,
That of excellent maxims this isn't the worst—
Let the play, not the dresses, be settled the first!
Something jn a Name.—What a happily appropriate
name for the Chief Magistrate of so fashionable a water-
ing-place as Brighton is Mr. Soper! Whether he is soft
Soper, or Hard Soper, or Soented Soper, it matters not;
it is only a pity that after his year of office, if the
Brightoman Bathers can spare him, he should not be
transferred to Windsor. Old Windsor Sopbe—what a
spltndid title for the Mayor of the Koyal town! No doubt
he will show himself active and energetic during his
Mayoralty, and that at Brighton henceforth a totally
opposite meaning from the ordinary one will be given
to the description of a speech as a SoPKR-ifio." At
east, it is 'oped so, for the sake of Sofeb.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Hmise of Commons, Tuesday Night, November 25.—New Session opened to-
day. Remarkable gathering of Members in the Lords to hear Queen's Speech
read. Unusual excitement, though heroically restrained in presence of Lord
Chancellor, supported on Woolsack by four figures in red cloaks and cooked
bats, borrowed for occasion from Madame Tussaud's. Halsbury lost his temper
once when Commission being read. Tussaud's man, sent down to work the
figures - make them take off their cocked hats and nod upon cue being given
by Reading Clerk—was on duty for first time; mnch interested in arrival of
Commons at the Bar; instead of lying low behind Woolsack and minding his
business, kept poking his head round to peer forth on scene. At last, Lord
Chancellor in hoarse whisper threatened? to send him to Clock Tower if he
didn't behave properly.
After this ail went well; figures bringing their right elbow up with a jerk,
took off their hats at precisely right moment, and replaced them without a hitch.
They were labelled "Lord Lathom," "Earl of Coventry," "Lord Browslow,"
and "Lord Knctsfohd." Lobd Chancellor sat in the middle. The ladies on
floor of House watched them with much interest.
"Such dear old things," said one, when the figure labelled " Earl of Coventry"
oleverly pretended to sneeze. "I wish they'd do it all over again; but I
suppose the springs have run down."
In the Commons, everyone on the look out for Pa bnell. What would he do?
Where would he sit? What would he say? Or, would he oome at all?
Nobody knew. Some suspected last guess most probable. Towards Three
o'Clock whisper went round that he was here. Sabk had seen him crossing
Lobby, with green spectacles and umbrella, and his hair died crimson. Was
now in room with Irish Party, arranging about Leadership. Understood before
Home met that he was to retire from Leadership till fumes from Divorce Court
had passed away. Then alliance between Home Rulers and Liberals would go
on as before, and all would be well. Ministerialists downcast at this prospect;
Liberals chirpy: a great difficulty avoided. Scon be in smooth water again.
Waiting in House for business to commence. Speaker away for cause that
saddens everyone ; Coubtney to take the Chair at Four o'Clock; meeting of Irish
Members still going forward. When business concluded, Pabnell would quietly
walk out; they would take their places, and things would go on as if no one had

ever heard of Eltham, of alarums and excursions, of exits by fire-
escapes, and entrances by back doors.
Thinking of these things, I was standing by Serjeant-at-Arms'
chair; heard a scuffling noise behind; looked round, and lo! there
was Parnell entering House by Distinguished Strangers' Gallery,
descending by swarming
down the end pillar, which
supports Gallery from floor
of House.
'' Good graoious!" I oried.
"What are you doing P"
"I'm catching the last
post," said Parnell, smil-
ing blandly, as, reaohing
the floor, he unclasped arms
and legs from the pillar
and quietly walked over to
his ordinary place as if this
were the usual way of an
Hon. Member approaching
his seat.
Direful news rapidly spread.
Parnell not going to retire from
Leadership! On contrary, meant
to stay, ignoring little events
brought to light in the Divorce
Court. Ministerialists jubilant;
Liberals depressed; the whole
situation changed; prospects of
Liberal supremacy, so certain yes-
terday, suddenly blighted ; talk of
Mr. G. retiring from the fray;
spoke on Address just now, but no
fight left in him; the Opposition
wrung out like a damp cloth ; even
Geokge Campbell dumb, and
Dr. Clare indefinitely postponed
Amendment long threatened. By
ten o'clock the whole thing had
flickered out. Address, which of
late has taken three weeks to pass,
agreed to in three hours.
Mr. G. went off as soon as Old
Morality had finished his modest
speech. Walked with him across
the Park to Carlton Terrace.
Haven't seen him to speak to since
Midlothian. What a change I
Then elate, confident,, energetic

tingling with life to his finger-ends; to-night shrunken, limp, des-
pondent, almost heart-broken.
"Don't you think, Sir," I said, "that, after to-day's experience,
Home Rule has a new terror P You remember how, seven or
eight years ago', the Irish Members used to stand up in the House
and personally vilify you. Then, when you oame round to their
side, the very same men beslabbered you with fulsome adulation.
Now, when there is another parting of the ways, when you pit your-
self, your authority, and your character, against their chosen Leader,
they rudely turn their backs on you, and tell you to mind your own
business. How '11 it be, do you think, when you've finally served
their purpose, and made possible the accomplishment of their
aim P When you have made them Masters in Dublin, will they care
any more for the views and prejudices of you and your Liberal
Party than they have done to-day r"
"Toby, dear boy," said Mr. G., "you're a young dog yet.
When you come to my age, you'll have learned that there is no
gratitude in politics. But we won't talk of it any more. I'm a
little tired to-night."
So we walked in silence up the steps, by the Duke of York's
Column.
Business done.—Address agreed to. Mr. P. flouts Mr. G.
Thursday.—House up at twenty minutes to Six, having got
through rattling lot of business. Prince Arthur been sailing up
and down floor, bringing in Land Bills and Railway Bills. Hicks-
Beach depressed with legacy of Tithes Bill.
"Cheer up, Beach," says Cranborne, tugging at his moustache
d la GRandolph: "you may depend upon me. Keep your eye on
your young friend, and he will pull you through."
'1 Thank you," said Beach, with something more than his customary
ffusive manner.
Jackson toying round the table, packing and unpacking papers,
looking at his watch and the clock, vaguely whistling, and absently
rubbing his hands.
"What's the matter P" I asked. "You seem out of sorts."
"Matter 1" he cried. "Why, twenty minutes to Six is the

matter, and here's all the work done and the House up. It's
absolutely demoralising; portends something uncanny. On Tuesday
we got through the Address in a single
short sitting; yesterday, after meeting
at noon, had to adjourn for three hours
and a half; filled up remainder of time
with bringing in Bills; To-day we have
an Irish Land Bill brought in and read
a First Time, after a Debate confined
to Sage of Queen Anne's Gate, and
Wilfrid Lawson. Nothing like it
seen for sixteen years. If this kind of
thing goes on, yon know, we '11 get all
the work of the Session done in three
months, and perhaps done better than
when it took nine. It's the suddenness
that knocks me over, Toby. They
ought to be more considerate, and begin
more gently."
Great commotion in Irish circles.
Scene slightly shifted. It seems that
Irish Members in re-electing Parnell
on Tuesday, thought he would relieve
them of difficulty by forthwith resign-
ing. Mr. P. doesn't take that view;
thinks it would be rude, after having
been unanimously elected, to appear to
undervalue such remarkable, spon-
taneous aot of confidence; doesn't care
a rap for publio opinion.
"fy tuis, et j'y reste," he says,
smiling sweetly round the table, where
his friends forlornly sit. ,, _
"Begorra!" says Mr. O'Keef, in-«r. P-rn-U turns his Back ob
dignantly. "it's bad enough to have Public Opinion,
him ruining us and the oounthry, without using blasphaymious
language."
Business done.—Everything on the paper.
Friday Night. — Louis
ennings made capital
speech to-night on Motion
challenging commutation of
certain perpetual pensions.
Seems, among other little
jobs, we, the tax-payers of
Great Britain, with Income-
tax at sixpence in the pound,
have been paying pension of
f2,000 a year to descendant of the late
Ellen Gwynne. Seleot Committee ap-
pointed by present Government to con-
sider whole matter, recommended that
no pension should be commuted at rate

[Of this Btory the Author writes to us as follows :—" I can honestly recom-
mend it, as calculated to lower the exaggerated cheerfulness which is apt to
prevail at Christmas time. I consider it, therefore, to be eminently suited
for a Christmas Annual. Families are advised to read it in detachments of
four or fire at a time. Married men who owe their wives' mothers a grudge
should lock them into a bare room, with a guttering candle and this story.
Death will be certain, and not painless. I 've got one or too rods in pickle
for the publishers. Tou wait and see.—~W. D."]
Chapteb I.
George Ginsltjto was alone in his College-rooms at Cambridge.
His friends had j ust left him. They were quite the tip-top set in Christ's
College, and the ashes of the cigarettes they had been smoking lay
about the rich Axminster carpet. They had been talking abont many
things, as is the wont of young men, and one of them had particularly
bothered George by asking him why he had refused a seat in the
University Trial Eights after rowing
No. 5 in his College boat. George
had no answer ready, and had re-
plied angrily. Now, he thought of
many answers. This made him
nervous. He paced quickly up and
down the deserted room, sipping his
seventh tumbler of brandy, as he
walked. It was his invariable cus-
tom to drink seven tumblers of neat
brandy every night to steady him-
self, and his College oareer bad, in
consequence, been quite unexcep-
tionable up to the present moment.
He ueed playfully to remind his
Dean of Pobson's drunken epigram,
and the good man always accepted
this as an excuse for any false quan-
tities in George's Greek Iambics.
But to-night, as I have said,
George was nervous with a strange
nervousness, and he, therefore, went
to bed, having previously blown out
his candle and placed his Waterbur;
watoh under his pillow, on the top of which sat a Devil wearing a
thick jersey worked with large green Bpots on a yellow ground.
Chapter II.
Now this Devil was a Water-Devil of the most pronounced type.
His head-quarters were on the Thames at Barking, where there is a
sewage outfall, and he had lately established a branch-offioe on the
Cam, where he did a considerable business.
Occasionally, he would run down to Cambridge himself, to consult
with his manager, and on these occasions he would indulge his play-
ful humour by going out at night and sitting on the pillows of
Undergraduates.
This was one of his nights out,"and he had chosen George
Ginsling's pillow as his seat
• •••••
Geobge woke up with a start. "What was this feeling in his
throat? Had he swallowed his blanket, or his cocoa-nut matting P
No, they were still in their respective places. He tore out his
tongue and his tonsils, and examined them. They were on fire.
This puzzled him. He replaced them. As he did so, a shower of
red-hot coppers fell from his mouth on to his feet. The agony was
awful. _ He howled, and danced about the room. Then he dashed at
the whiskey, but the bottle duoked as he approached, and he failed
to tackle it. Poor George, you see, was a rowing-man, not a
football-player. Then he knew what he wanted. In his keeping-
room were six carafes, full of Cambridge water, and a dozen bottles
of Hunyadi Janos. He rushed in, and hurled himself upon the
bottles with all his weight. The crash was dreadful. The foreign
bottles, being poor, frail things, broke at onoe. He lapped up the
liquid like a thirsty dog. The carafes survived. He crammed
them with their awful contents, one after another, down his throat.
Then he returned to his bed-room, seized his jug, and emptied it at
one gulp. His bath was full. He lifted it in one hand, and drained
it as dry as a University sermon. The thirst compelled him—drove
him—made him—urged him—lashed him—forced him—shoved him
—goaded him to drink, drink, drink water, water, water I At
last he was appeased. He had cried bitterly, and drunk up all his
tears. He fell back on his bed, and slept for twenty-four hours, and
the Davil went out and gave his gyp, Starling, a complete set of
instructions for use in case of flood.
Chapteb III.
Stabling was a pale, greasy man. He was a devil of a gyp. He
went into Geobge's bed-room and shook his master by the shoulder.
George woke up.
"Bring me the College pump," he said. "I must have it. No,
stay," he continued, as Starling prepared to execute his orders, "a
hair of the dog—bring it, quick, quick!"
Stabling gave him three. He always carried them about with
him in case of accidents. George devoured them eagerly, reck-
lessly. Then with a deep sigh of relief, he went stark staring mad,
and bit Stabling in the fleshy part of the thigh, after which he fell
fast asleep again. On awaking, he took his name off the College
books, gave Stabling a oheque for £5000, broke off his engagement,
but forgot to post the letter, and oonsulted a Doctor.
"What you want," said the Doctor, "is to be shut up f»r a year
in the tap-room of a public-house. No water, only spirits. That
must cure you."
So Geobge ordered Starling to hire a public-home in a populous
district. When this was done, he went and lived there. But you
scarcely need to be told that Starling had not carried out his orders.
How could he be expected to do that? Only fifty-six pages of my
book had been written, and even pub-
lishers—the most abandoned people
on the face of the earth—know that
that amount won't make a Christmas
Annual. So Stabling hired a Tem-
perance Hotel. As I have said, he
was a devil of a gyp.
Chapteb IT.
The fact was this. 0 ne of Geobge's
great-great uncles had held a com-
mission in the Blue Ribbon Army.
Geobge remembered this too late.
The offer of a seat in the University
Trial Eights mnst have suggested
the blue ribbon which the University
Crew wear on their straw hats. Thus
the diabolical forces of heredity were
roused to fever-heat, and the great-
gTeat uncle, with his blue ribbon,
whose photograph bung in George's
home over the parlour mantelpiece,
became a living force in George's
brain.
George Ginslinq went and lived in a suburban neighbourhood.
It was useless. He married a sweet girl with various spiteful rela-
tions. In vain. He changed his name to Fcmpdbt, and conducted
a local newspaper. Profitless striving. Stabling was always at
hand, always ready with the patent filter, and as punctual in his
appearances as the washing-bill or the East wind. I repeat, he was
a devil of a gyp.
Chapteb V.
They found Geobge Ginslino feet uppermost in six inches of
water in the Daffodil Boad reservoir. It was a large reservoir, and
had been quite full before Geobge began upon it. This was his
record drink, and it killed him. His last words were, "If I had
stuck to whiskey, this would never have happened."

"It is the^ Bogie Man !"—Blackie's Modern Cyclopedia.
Nothing to do with the Christy Minstrel Entertainment, but a very
useful work of reference, issued from the ancient house of publishers
whioh is now quite Blackie with age. We have looked through the
"B's" for "Bogie," but "The Bogie Man" is "Not there, not
there, my child! ' but he is to be found in that other Blackie's

Pabs about Pictures (by Old Par).—At the Fine Art Society's
Gallery I gazed upon the pioturee of "Many-sided Nature " with
great content, and oame to the conclusion that Mr. Albert Goodwin
was a many-sided artist. "Now," said I, quoting Shaespeabe—
— Old Par s Improved Edition—"is the Goodwin of our great
content made glorious." 0. P., who knows every inch of Abingdon,
who has gazed upon Hastings from High Wickham, who is intimate
with every brick in Dorchester, who loves every reed and ripple
on the Thames, and has a considerable knowledge of the Rigi and
Venice, can bear witness to the truth of the painter. There are
over seventy pictures—every one worth looking at.

OUfi BOOKING-OFFICE.
In Camp and Studio, Mr. Ibvino Montagu, some time on the
artistic staff of The Illustrated London News, gives his experiences
of the Rosso-Turkish Campaign. He concisely sums up the quali-
fications of a War Correspondent by saying that he should "have an
iron constitution, a laoonio, inoisive style,
and sufficient tact to establish a safe and
rapid connecting link between the forefront
of battle and his own head-quarters in
Fleet Street or elsewhere." As Mr. Ibvino
Montagu seems to have lived up to his
ideal, it is a little astonishing to find the
last chapters of his book devoted to Sack
in Bohemia, wherein he discourses of going
to the Derby, a Hammersmith Detdemona,
and of the Postlethwaites and Maudlei,
"whose peculiarities have been recorded by
the facile pen of Dp Maubieb." But as
the author seems pleased with the reader,
it would be indeed sad were the reader to
find fault with the author. However, this
may be said in his favour—he tells (at
least) one good story. On his return from
Plevna to Bohemia, a dinner was given in his honour at the
Holborn Restaurant. Every detail was perfect—the only omission
was forgetfulness on the part of the Committee to invite the must of
the evening I At the last moment the mistake was discovered, and a
telegram was hurriedly despatched to Mr. Montaou, telling him that
he was " wanted." On his arrival he was refused admittance to the
dinner by the waiters, beoause he was not furnished with a ticket I
Ultimately he was ushered into the Banqueting Hall, when every-
thing necessarily ended happily.

Of many Beneficent and Useful Lives, you will hear "in

Unlucky will not be the little girl who reads the book with this
name, by Caroline Austin.
Everybody's Business, by Ism at Thorn, nobody likes interference,
but in this case it proved the friend in need.
Chivalry, by Leon Gautier, translated by Henry Frith, is a
chronicle of knighthood, its rules, and its deeds. To the scientific
student, Discoveries and Inventions of the Nineteenth Century, by
Robert Rout ledge, B.S., F.C.S., will be interesting, and help him
to discover a lot he does not know. Those who have not already
read it, A Wonder Book for Oirls and Boys, by Nathaniel Haw-
thorne, will have a real treat in the myths related; TangUwood
Tales are included, and these are delightful for all. Rosebud, by
Mrs. Adams Acton, a tale for girls, who will love this bright little
flower, bringing happiness all around.
Holly Leaves, the Special Number of The Sporting and Dramatic,
is quite a seasonable decoration for the drawing-room table during
the Christmas holidays.
My faithful "Co." has been reading Jack's Secret, by Mrs.
Lovett Cameron, which, he says, has greatly pleased him. It has an
interesting story, and is full of olever sketches of oharaoter. Jack,
himself, is rather a weak personage, and scarcely deserves the good
fortune which ultimately falls to his lot. After flirting with a born
coquette, who treats him with a cruelty which is not altogether
unmerited, he settles down with a thoroughly lovable little wife,
and a seat in the House of Lords. From this it will be gathered
that all ends happily. Jack's Secret will be let out by Mudie's, and
will be kept, for a considerable time—by the subscribers.
Girls will be .the richer this year by Fifty-two more Stories for
Oirls, and boys will be delighted with lifty-two more Stories for
Boys, by many of the best authors; both these books are edited by
Alfred Miles, and published by Hutchison & Co. Lion Jack, by
P. T. Babntjk, is an account of Jack's perilous adventures in
capturing wild animals. If they weren't, of course, all true, Lyin'
Jack would have been a better title.

AtioCMEVT.—Edwin has taken Angelina, his fiancee, to an entertain-
ment by a Mesmerist, and, wi-hing to set his doubt* at rest has gone upon
the platform, and placed hinnelf entirely at the Mesmerist's disposition. On
rejoining Angslina, she has insisted upon being taken home immediately,
and has cried all the way back in the hansom—much to Edwin's perplexity.
Ihey are alone together, in a Moming-room; Angelina is still sobbing in
an arm-chair, and Edwin is rubbing his ear as he stands on the hearthrug.
Edwin, I say, Angelina, don't go on like this, or we shall have
somebody coming in! I wouldn't have gone up if I'd known it

making hideous grimaces before a looking-glass? Do you suppose
I am given to over-indulgence in cod-liver oil and whatever the
other beastliness was? Am I acrobatic in my calmer moments? Did
you ever know me sing— with or without a broom? I'm a shy man

dence)—look at my own case. Being obliged to leave the country,
and give up my carriage, I put my horse into this sale, at a very low
reserve of twenty pounds. (Entre nous, it's worth at least doable
that.) Between the Auctioneer, and a couple of rascally horse-
dealers—who I found out, by pure accident, wanted my animal
particularly for a match pair—the sale of my horse is what they call
bunnicbed up." Then they come to me, and offer me money.
I spot their game, and am so indignant that I '11 have nothing to do
with them, at any price. Wouldn't sell dear eld Bogey, whom
my wife and children are so fond of, to such brutal blaokguards, en
any consideration. No, Sir, the horse has done me good service—a
sounder nag never walked on four hoofs; and I'd rather sell it to a
good, kind master, for twenty pounds, aye, or even eighteen, than
let these rascals have it, though they have run up as high as thirty
q , ahem! guineas.
I. P. Have they indeed, now P And what have you done with
the horse P
C. G. Put it into livery close by, Sir. And, unless I can find a
good master for it, by Jove, I '11 take it back again, and give it away
to a friend. Perhaps, Sir, you'd like to have a look at the animal.
The stables are only in the next street, and—as a friend, and with
no eye to business—I should be pleased to show poor Bogey to any-
one so sympathetic as yourself.
[J. P., after some further chat of a friendly nature, agrees to
go and " run his eye over him."
Scene II.—Greengrocer's yard at side of a seedy house tn a shabby
street, slimy and straw-bestrewn. Yard is paved with lumpy,
irregular cobbles, and some sooty and shaky-looking sheds stand
at the bottom thereof. Enter together, Clerical Gent and
Inexperienced Person.
C. G. (smiling apologetically). Not exactly palatial premises for
an animal used to my stables at Wiokham-in-the-Wold I But I
know these people, Sir; they are kind as Christians, and as honest
as the day. Hoy 1 Tom! Ton 11 Tost 111 Are you there, Tom P
[From the shed emerges a very small boy with very short hair, and
a very long livery, several sizes too large for him, the teal of the
brass-buttoned coat and the bottoms of the baggy trousers alike sweep-
ing the cobbles as he shambles forward."] (C. G. genially.) Ah, there
you are, Tom, my lad. Bring out dear old Bogey, and Bhow it to my
friend here. [Boy leads out a rusty roan Rosinante, high in bone,
and low in flesh, with prominent hocks, and splay hoofs, which
stumble gingerly over the cobbles.'] (Patting the horse affectionately.)
Ah, poor old Bogey, he doesn't like these lumpy stones, does he P
Not used to them, Sir. My stable-yard at Wiokham-in-the-Wold,
is as smoothly paved as—as the Alhambra, Sir. I always consider
my animals, Sir. A merciful man is merciful to his beast, as the
good book says. But isn't he a Beauty P
LP. Well—ahem!—ye—es; he looks a kind, gentle, steady
sort of a creature. But—ahem!—what's the matter with his
knees P
ft G. Oh, nothing, Sir, nothing at all. Only a habit he has got
along of kind treatment. Like us when we "stand at ease," you
know, a hit baggy, that's all. You should see him after a twenty
miles spin along our Wiokham roads, when my wife and I are
doing a round of visits among the neighbouring gentry.. Ah, Bogey,
Bogey, old boy—kissing his nose—I don't know what Mrs. G. ana
the girls will say when they hear I've parted with you—if I do,
i/I do.
Enter two horsey-looking Men as though in sear eh of something.
First Horsey Man. Ah, nere you are. Well, look 'ere, are you
going to take Thirty Pounds for that horse o' yournP Yes or No!
C. G. (turning upon them with dignity). No, Sir; most emphati-
cally No! I 'ye told you before I will not sell him to you at any
price. Have the goodness to leave us—at once. I'm engaged with
my friend here.
[Horsey Men turn away despondently. Enter hurriedly, a
shabby-looking Groom.
Groom. Oh, look here, Mister—er—er—wot's yer nameP His
Lordship wants to know whether you '11 take his offer of Thirty-five
Pounds—or Guineas—for that roan. He wouldn't offer as much,
only it happens jest to match
V. G. (with great decisiveness). Inform his Lordship, with my
compliments, that I regret to be entirely unable to entertain his
proposition.
Groom. Oh, very well. But I wish you'd jest step out and
tell his Lordship so yerself. He's jest round the corner at the 'otel
entrance, a flicking of his boots, as irritated as a blue-bottle caught
in a oowcumber frame.
C. G. Oh, certainly, with pleasure. {To I. P.) If you '11 excuse
me, Sir, just one moment, I '11 step out and speak to his Lordship.

appeared, speaking in a breathless hurry). Now lookye here, guv'nor

Clerical Gent (blandly). Ah! that's settled. His Lordship was
angry, but I was firm. Take Bogey back to the stable, Tom—unless,
of course—(looking significantly at Inexperienced Person).
Inexperienced Person (hesitating). Well, I'm not sure but what
the animal would suit me, and—ahem!—if you care to trust it
to me
Clerical Gent, (joyously). Trust it to you, SirP Why, with
pleasure, with every confidence. Dear old Bogey.' He '11 be happy
with such a master—ah, and do him service too. I tell you, Sir,
that horse, to a quiet, considerate sort o' gent like yourself, who
wants to work his animal, not to wear it out, is worth forty pound,
every penny of it—and oheap at the price!
I. P. Thanks! And—ah—what if the figure P
C. G. Why—ah—eighteen—no, dash it!—sixteen to you, and say
no more about it.
[Inexperienced Person closes with the offer, hands notes to
Clerical Gent (who, under pressure of business, hurries
off ), takes Bogey from the grinning groom-lad, leads him—
with difficulty—out into the street, searches vainly for the
two horsey Men, who, like " his Lordship," have utterly and
finally disappeared, and finds himself left alone in a bye-
thoroughfare with a " horse," which he cannot get along
anyhow, and which he is presently glad to part with to a
knacker for thirty shillings.

WRITE AND WRONG.
As so many private letters are sold at public sales nowadays, it
has become necessary to oonaider the purport of every epistle
regarded, so to speak, from a post-mortem point of view. If a
publio man expresses a confidential opinion in the fulness of his
heart to an intimate friend, or proposes an act of charity to a
cherished relative, he may rest assured that, sooner or later, both
communications will be published to an unsympathetic and auto-
graph-hunting world. Under these circumstances it may be well
to answer the simplest communications in the most guarded manner
possible. For instance, a reply to a tender of hospitality might run
as follows:—
Private and Confidential. Not negotiable.
Mr. Dash Blank has much pleasure in accepting Mr. Blank
Dash's invitation to dinner on the 8th inst.
N.B.—This letter it the property of the Writer. Not for publi-
cation. All right* reserved.
Or, if the writer feels that his letter, if it gets into the hands of the
executors, will be sold, he must adopt another plan. It will be
then his object to so mix up abuse of the possible vendors with ordi-
nary matter, that they (the possible vendors) may shrink, after the
death of the recipient, from making their own condemnation public
The following may serve as a model for a communication of this
oharaoter. The words printed in italics in the body of the letter
are the antidotal abuse introduced to prevent a posthumous sale by
possible executors.
Private and Confidential. Not to be published. Signature a forgery.
Dear Old Maw,—I nearly completed my book. Your nephew,
Tom Lislkiqh. is an ass. My wife is slowly recovering from influ-
enza. Your Aunt, Jans Jenkins, wears a wig. Tommy, you will be
glad to learn, has oome out first of twenty in his new class at school.
Your Uncle, Benjamin Graham, is a twaddling old bore. I am
thinking of spending the Midsummer holidays with the boys and
their mother at Broadstairs. Your Cousin, Jack Jcggerly, is a
sweep that doesn't belong to a single respectable Club. Trusting that
you will burn this letter, to prevent its sale after we are gone,
I remain, yours affectionately, Bob u y.
N.B.—The foregoing letter is the property of the Author, and, as
it it only intended for private circulation, must not be printed.
Solicitors address, — Ely Place.
But perhaps the best plan will be, not to write at all. The tele-
graph, at the end of the century, costs but a halfpenny a word, and
we seem to be within measurable distance of the universal adoption
of the telephone. Under these circumstances, it is easy to take heed
of the warning contained in that classical puzzle of our childhood,
Litera scripta manet.
A QUESTION OP TASTE.
Mr. Punch. Well, Madam, what can I do for you?
Female (of Uncertain Age, gushingly). A very great favour, my
dear Sir; it is a matter of sanitation.
Mr. P. (coldly). I am at your service, Madam, but I would
remind you that I have no time to listen to frivolous complaints.
Fern. I would ask you—do you think that a building open to
the publio should be crowded with double as many persons as it can
conveniently hold P
Mr. P. Depends upon circumstances, Madam. It might possibly
be excusable in a Church, assuming that the means of egress were
sufficient. Of what building do you wish to complain?
Fern. Of the Old Bailey—you know, the Central Criminal Court.
Mr. P. Have you to object to the accommodation afforded you

Mr. P. (dryly). That is the only place (when not in the Witness-
Box) suitable for women at the Old Bailey. I cannot imagine that
they would go to that unhappy spot of their own free will.
Fern, (astonished). Not to see a Murder trial P Then you are
evidently unaccustomed to ladies' society.
Mr. P. (severely). I do not meet ladies at the Old Bailey.
Fern, (bridling up). Indeed! But that is nothing to do with the
matter of the overcrowding. Fancy, with our boasted civilisation

YOUNO RAS0AL8, THEY 'LL BK SMASHING MY IIAT ONE OF THESE 1>AY» 1"
NONOGENARIAN NONSENSE.
(Compiled a la Mode.)
I hays so often been urged by my friends to write my autobiography, that at length
I have taken up my pen to comply with their wishes. My memory,
although I may occasionally become slightly mixed, is still excellent, and
having been born in the first year of the present century I consequently can
remember both the Plague and Fire of London. The latter is memorable to
me as having been the cause of my introduction to Sir Christopher Wren,
an architect of some note, and an intimate friend of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
and the late Mr. Turner, R.A. Sir Christopher had but one failing
—he was never sober. To the day of his death he was under the impression
that St Paul's was St. Peter's!
One of my earliest recollections is the great physician Harvey, who,
indeed, knew me from my birth. Although an exceedingly able man, he
was a confirmed glutton. He would at the most ceremonious of dinner-
parties push his way through the guests (treating ladies and gentlemen
with the like discourtesy) and plumping himself down in front of the
'turtle soup, would help himself to the entire contents of the tureen, plus
the green fat I During the last years of his life he abandoned medicine to give his
attention to cookery, and (so I have been told) ultimately invented a fish sauce!
I knew How ass, the so-called philanthropist, very well. He was particularly fond of dress,

although extremely economical in his washing
bill. It was his delight to visit the various
prisons and obtain a hideous pleasure in watch-
ing the tortures of the poor wretches therein
incarcerated. He was fined and imprisoned for
ill-treating a oat, if my memory does not play
me false. I have been told that he once stole a
pookethandkerohief, but at this distance of
time cannot remember where I heard the story.
It is one of my proudest recollections that,
in early youth, I had the honour of being
presented to her late most gracious Majesty,
Queen Anne, of glorious memory. The
drawing-room was held at Buckingham
Palace, which in those days was situated on
the site now occupied by Marlborough House.
I accompanied my mother, who wore, I re-
member, yellow brocade, and a wreath of red
roses, without feathers. Round the throne
were grouped—the Duke of Marlborough
(who kept in the background beoause he
had just been defeated at Fontenoy), Lord
Palmehston, niok-named "Cupid" by Mis-
tress Nell Gwynne (a well-known Court
beauty), Mr. Garrick, and Signor G rimaldi,
two Actors of repute, and Cardinal Wiseman,
the Papal Nunoio. Her Majesty was most
gracious to me, and introduced me to one of
her predecessors, Queen Elizabeth, a reputed
daughter of King Henry the Eighth. Both
Ladies laughed heartily at mv curls, whioh
in those days were more plentiful than they
are now. I was rather alarmed at their
lurohing forward as I passed them, but was
reassured when the Earl of Rochester (the
Lord Chamberlain) whispered in my ear that
the Royal relatives had been lunching. As I
left the presence, I notioed that both their
Majesties were fast asleep.
1 have just mentioned Lord Rochester,
whose acquaintance I had the honour to
possess. He was extremely austere, and very
much disliked by the fair sex. On one oc-
casion it was my privilege to clean his shoes.
He had but one failing—he habitually cheated
at oards. I will now tell a few stones of the
like oharaoter about Bishop Wilbebforce,
Thackeray, Mrs. Fry, Peabodt, Walter
Scott, and Father Matthew.
[No you don't, my venerable twaddler!—Ed.]
THE LARGE CIGAR.
You lie on the oaken mantle-shelf,
A cigar of high degree,
An old oigar, a large cigar,
A cigar that was given to me.
The house-flies bite
you day by day—
Bite you, and kick,
and sigh—
And I do not know
what the insects
say,
But they creep away
and die.
My friends they take
you gently up,
And lay you gently
down;
They never saw a weed so big,
Or quite so deadly brown.
They, as a rule, smoke anything
They pick up free of charge;
But they leave you to rest while the bulbula
Through the night, my own, my large 1
The dust lies thick on your bloated form,
And the year draws to its oloee,
And the baccy-jar's been emptied—by
My laundress, I suppose.
Smokeless and hopeless, with reeling brain,

And take you dawn, while my hot tears rain,
And smoke you, you brute, myself.

House of Common*, Monday, December 1.—Tithes Bill down for
Second Reading:- Gears Youho Gardner places Amendment on
the paper, which secures for him op-
portunity of making a speech. Haying
availed himself of this, did not move
his Amendment; opening thus made
for 8tuam-Rkn»el, who had another
Amendment on the paper. Would he
move it? Only excitement of Debate
settled round this point. Under good
old Tory Government new things in
Parliamentary procedure constantly
achieved. Supposing half - a - dozen
Members got together, drew up a num-
ber of Amendments, then ballot for
precedence, they might arrange Debate
without interposition of Speaker. First
man gets off nis speech, omits to move
Amendment: second would come on,
and so on, on to the end of list. But
Stuart - Rendel moved Amendment,
and on this Debate turned.
Not very lively affair, regarded as
reflex of passionate protestation of
angry little Wales. Osborne Ap Mor-
gan made capital speech, but few re-
mained to listen. Welshmen at outset
meant to carry Debate over to next day;
couldn't be done; and by half-past
eleven, Sttjart-Rkndkl's Amendment
negatived by rattling majority.
Fact is, gallant little Wales was
swamped by irruptive Ireland. To-
day, first meeting of actual Home Rule

ing its course. This historio meeting gathered in Committee-room

deliberation, that, in order to have proceedings in due dramatic form,
there should be incorporated with the meeting an eviction scene.
After prolonged Debate, concluded that, to do the thing thoroughly,
they should select Parnell as subject of eviction.
"No use," Tim Hkalt said, "in half-doing the thing. The eyes
of the Universe are fixed upon us. Let us give them a show for
their money."
Parnkll, at first, demurred; took exception on the ground that,
as he had no fixed place of residence, he was not convenient subject
for eviction; objection over-ruled; then Pabnf.ll insisted that, if
he yielded on this point, he must preside over proceedings. Tim and
the rest urged that it was not usual, when a man's conduct is
under consideration upon a grave charge, that he should take the
Chair. Drawing upon the resources of personal observation,
Dr. Tanner remarked that he did not remember any case in which
the holder of a tenure, suffering process of eviction, bossed the
concern, acting simultaneously, as it were, as the subjeot of the
eviction process, and the resident Magistrate.
Whilst conversation going on, Parnell had unobserved taken the
Chair, and now ruled Dr. Tanner out of order.
House sat at Twelve o'Clock; at One the Speaker (Mr. Pabnell),
interrupting Sexton in passage of passionate eloquence, said he
thought this would be convenient opportunity for going out to
his chop. So he went off; Debate interrupted for an hour; resumed
at One, and continued, with brief intervals for refreshment, up till
close upon midnight. Proceedings conducted with closed doors, but
along the corridor, from time to time, rolled echoes which seemed to
indicate that the first meeting of the Home-Rule Parliament was
not lacking in'animation.
"I think they are a little 'eated, Sir," said the policeman on duty
outside. "Man and boy I've been in charge of this beat for twenty
years; usually a quiet spot; this sudden row rather trying for one

whether the phrase was Parliamentary; would suggest, therefore,
that House should adjourn fire weeks. On this point Debate pro-
ceeded up to midnight.

occasionally through open doors and down long corridor. Once a
tremendous yell shook building.
"What's that P," I asked Dice Power, who happened to be taking
glass of sherry-wine at Bar in Lobby.
"That," said Richard, "is the Irish wolves crying for the blood
of Paknf.ll," and Dice, tossing down his sherry-wine, as if he had
a personal quarrel with it, hurried back to the shambles.
Quite a changed man 1 No longer the dtbonnaire Dice, whose light
heart and high spirits made him a favourite everywhere. Politics
have suddenly become a serious thing, and Dice Power is saddened
with them.
"I take bitters with my sherry-wine now," Dice mentioned just
now in sort of apologetio way at having been discovered, as it were,
feasting in the house of mourning. "At the present sad j tincture,
to drink sherry-wine with all its untamed richness might, I feel,
smack of callousness. Therefore I tell the man to dash it with
bitters, whioh, whilst it has a penitential sound, adds a not untooth-
some flavour in anticipation of dinner."
Even with this small comfort ten years added to his age; grey
hairs gleam among his hyacinthine looks; his baok is bent; his
shoes are clogged with lead. A sad sight; makes one wish the
pitiful business was over, and Richard
himself again.
All the best of the Irish Members,
whether Cavaliers or Cromwellians, are
depressed in same way. Came upon
Swift MacNeill in retired recess in
Library this afternoon; standing up with
right hand in trouser-pocket, and left
hand extended (his favourite oratorical
attitude in happier times) smiling in
really violent fashion.
"What are you playing atP" I asked
him, noticing with curiosity that whilst
his mouth was, so to1 speak, wreathed in
smiles, a tear dewed the fringe of his
closed eyelids.
"Ah, Toby, is that youP" he said,
"I didn't see you coming. The faot is
I came over here by myself to have me
last smile."
"Well, you're making the most of
it," I said, wishing to encourage him.
"I generally do, and as this is me last,

sorry he should take the matter to heart so seriously. We shall
miss that smile.
Burineit done.—Irish Land Bill in British Parliament.
Parliament still sitting.
Thursday.—Cork Parliament still sitting; Pahntll predominant;
issues getting a little mixed; understood that Session summoned to
decide whether, in view of certain proceedings before Mr. Justice
Butt, Parnf.ll should be permitted to retain Leadership. Every-
thing been discussed but that. Things got so muddled up, that
O'Keefe, walking about, bowed with anxious thought, not quite
certain whether it is Tm Healy,
8exton, or Justin McCarthy, who
was involved in recent Divorce
suit. Certainly, it couldn't have
been Farnfll, who to-day sug-
gests that the opportunity is fitting
for putting Mr. G. in a tirht place.
"You go to him," says Tahnux,
"and demand certain pledges on
Home Rule scheme. If he does
not consent, he will be in a hole;
threatened with loss of Irish Vote.
You will be in a dilemma, as you
cannot then side with him against
me, the real friend of Ireland;
whilst I shall be confirmed in my
position as the only possible Leader
of the Party. If, on the contrary,
this unrivalled sophist is drawn
into anything like a declaration
that will satisfy you in the face of
the Irish People, he will be hope-
lessly embarrassed with his English
friends; I shall have paid off an
old t c >re, and can afford to retire
from the Leadership, certain that
in a few months the Irish People
will clamour for the return of the
man who showed that, if only he
could serve them, he was ready to
sacrifice his personal position and advantages. Don't, Gentlemen,
let us, at a crisis like this, descend to topics of mere personality.
In spite of what has passed at this table, I should like to shield
my honourable friends, Mr. Timothy Healt, Mr. Sexton, and that
beau idtal of an Irish Member, Mr. Justin McCarthy, from refer-
ences, of a kind peculiarly painful to them, to certain proceedings in
a court of law with respect to which I will, before I sit down, say
this, that, if all the facts were known, they would be held abso-
lutely free from imputation of irregularity."
General oheering greeted this speech. Members shook hands all
round, and nominated Committee to go off and make things hot for
Mr. G. Business done.—In British House Prince Arthur ex-
pounded Scheme for Relief of Irish Distress.
Friday.—A dark shadow falls on House to-day. Mrs. Peel died
this morning, and our Speaker sits by a lonely hearth. Old
Morality, in his very best style, speaking with the simple language
of a kind heart, voices the prevalent feeling. Mr. G., always at his
best on these occasions, adds some words, though, as he finely says,
any expression of sympathy is but inadequate medicine for so severe
a hurt. Members reverently uncover whilst these brief speeches
are made. That is a movement shown only when a Royal
Message is read; and here is mention of a Message from the
greatest and final King. Mrs. Peel, though the wife of the First
Commoner in the land, was not une grande dame. She was a kindly,
homely lady, of unnffeoted manner, with keen sympathies for all
that was bright and good. Every Member feels that something is
lost to the House of Commons now that she lies still in her chamber
at Speaker's Court.
The Drama on Crutches.—A Mr. Grew has suggested, accord-
ing to some Friday notes in the Z>. 7'., a soheme for subsidising a
theatre and founding a Dramatic School. The latter, apparently, is
not to aid the healthy but the decrepit drama, as it is intended to
afford succour to old or disabled actors and actresses." Why then
call it a " Dramatic School P" Better style it, a " Dramatio-Seoond-
Infanoy-Sohool."
Death in the Field.—If things go on as they have been going
lately, the statisticians who compile the " Publio_Health" averages
will have to include, as one important item in their " Death Rates,"
the ravages of that annual epidemic popularly known as—Football 1
"Justice tor Ireland ! "—The contest on the Chairmanship of
the Irish Parliamentary Party may be summed up:—Justin

when he was a boy; but he has been out of practice lately, and so, as
the Doctor ordered him horse-exercise, I thought it would be wiser
for him to take a few lessons.
Such an excellent ohange
for any one with sedentary
pursuits!
The Friend. But isn't
riding a sedentary pursuit,
too?
Mrs. B.-K. Robert says
he doesn't find it so.
[Enter the Riding Master.
Riding Master {saluting
with cane). Evenin', Gentle-
men—your 'orses will be in
directly; 'ope we shall see
tome ridin' this time. (Clatter without; enter Stablemen with horses.)
Let me see—Mr. Bilbow-Kay, Sir, you'd better ride the Shar; he
ain't been out all day, so he '11 want some 'andlinr. (Mr. B.-K., with
a sickly smile, accepts a tall and lively horse.) No, Mr. Tokos, that
ain't your 'orse to-day—you've got beyond 'im, Sir. We '11 put you
up on Lady Loo; she's a bit rough till you get on terms with her, but
you '11 be all right on her after a bit Yes. Mr. Joggles, Sir, you
take Kangaroo, please. Mr. Bumf as, I 'ye 'ad the Artful Dodger
out for you; and mind he don't get rid of you so easy as he did
Mr. Gripper last time. Got a nice 'one for you, Mr. 'Arry
Sniggers, Sir—Frar Diavolo. You mustn't take no notioe of his
bucking a bit at starting—he'11 soon leave it off.
Mr. Sniggers {who conceals his qualms under a forced facetious-
ness). Soon leave me off, you mean!
R. M. {after distributing the remaining horses). Now then—bring
your 'orses up into line, and stand by, ready to mount at the word of
command, reins taken up in the left 'and with the seoond and little
fingers, and a lock of the 'one's mane twisted round the first,.
Mount! That'one ain't a bicycle, Mr. Sniggers. [Mr. S. (in an
undertone.) No—worse luok!] Number off! Walk 1 I shall giye
the word to trot direotly, so now's the time to improve your seats—
that back a bit straighter, Mr. 'Oofeb. No. 4, just fall out, and
we '11 let them stirrup-leathers down another 'ole or two for yer.
(iVb. 4, who has just been congratulating himself that his stirrups
were conveniently high, has to see them let down to a distance where
he can just touch them by stretching.) Now you're all comfortable.
[" Oh, are we P " from Mr. «.] Trot I Mr. Tongs, Sir. 'old that
rorse in—he's gettin' away with you already. Very bad,
Mr. Joggles, 8ir—keep those 'eels down! Lost your stirrup,
Mr. Jelly? Never mind that—feel for it, Sir. I want you to be
independent of the irons. I'm going to make you ride without
'em presently. (Mr. Jelly shivers in his saddle.) Captin' Chopper,
Sir; if that Volunteer ridgment as you 're goin' to be the Major of
sees you like you are now, on a field-day—they '11 'aye to fall out to

Senuout as to his motive for practising his riding.) Now, Mr.
niggers, make that 'one learn 'oo's the master! [Mr. S. "He
knows, the brute!]
Mrs. B.-K. He's yery rude to all the Class, except dear Robert—
but then Robert has suoh a nice easy seat.
The B. M. Mr. Bilbow-Kat, Sir, try and set a bit closer. Why,
you ain't no more 'old on that saddle than a stamp with the gum
licked off! Can-tor! You 're all right, Mr. Joggles—it's on'y his
play; set down on your saddle. Sir! . . . I didn't say on the ground!
Mrs. B.-K. (anxiously to her Son, as he passes). Bob, are you
quite sure you're safe? (To Friend.) His horse is snorting so
dreadfully 1
H. M. 'Alt! Eyery Gentleman take his feet out of the stirrups,
and oross them on the saddle in front of him. Not your feet, Mr.
Sniggers, we ain't Turks 'ere I
Mr. 8. (sotto voce). "There's one bloomin' Turk 'ere, anyway!"
Jl. M. Now then,—Walk! .. . Trot! Set baok, Gentlemen, set

Jelly, kitchin' 'old o' the mane—I shall 'aye to give you a 'ogged
'one next time you come. Quicken up a bit—this is a ride, not a
funeral. Why, I could roll faster than you're trotting! Lor,
you 're like a row o' Guy Foxes on 'orsebaok, you are! Ah, I
thought I'd see one o' you orf! Ooa-ron, all o' you, you don't

Mr. Bilbow-Kat, when your 'orse changes his pace sudden, it
don't look well for you to be found settin' 'aif way up his neck, and
it gives him a bad opinion of yer, Sir. Unoross sterrups! Trot on!
It ain't no mortal use your cluoking to that mare, Mr. Tongs, Sir,
because she don't understand the langwidge—touch her with your
'eel in the ribs. _ Mr. Sniggers, that 'one is doin' jest what he likes
with you. 'It 'im, Sir; he's no friends and few relations!

takin' that animal for a little ride all by himself, we 'U let you out
in the streets—otherwise p'raps you'll kindly follow yer leader.
Captin Cropper, Sir, if you let that ourb out a bit more, Reindeer
wouldn't be 'arf so nanty with yer. . . Ah, now you 'ave done it.
You want your reins painted different ooloun and labelled, Sir, you

your saddles a bit—["Shook up'* more like it!" from Mr. S.J—
we'll 'aye the 'urdles in and show you a bit o' Donnybrook! (The
Class endeavours to assume an air of delighted anticipation at this
pleasing prospect.) (To Assistant R.M., who has entered and said
something in an undertone.) Eh, Captin 'Edstall here, and wants
to try the grey cob over 'urdles? Ask him if he '11 come in now—
we're Just going to do some jumping.
Assist. R. M. This lot don't look muoh like going over 'urdles—

[The hurdles are brought in and propped up. Enter a well-
turned-out Stranger, on a grey cob.
Mr. Sniggers (to him). You ain't lost nothing by coming late. I

Capt. Headstall. Haw, really? Didn't get grassed, did you P

R. M. Now, Captin—not you, Captin Cropper—Captin 'Edstall,

[Captain H. rides at it; the cob jumps too short, and knocks the
hurdle dmcn—to his rider's intense disgust.
Mr. S. I say, Guv'nor, that was a near thing. I wonder you
weren't off.
Capt. H. I—ah—don't often oome off.

You see, they've put you on a quiet animal this journey. J shall

Capt. JET. You won't mount him, if you take my advice—he has
rather a delicate mouth.
Mr, S. Oh, I don't mind that—I should ride him on the ourb, o'

parent of the exact whereabouts of the school). It's all right with a

TIT-WILLOW.
(A New Version.)
[" Last year I fed the tomtits -with a cocoanut, impended on
a stick outside my window, and they came greedily. This
year I forgot all about it, but, hearing a clamour in a fuohsia-
bush outside my study window ... I found myself besieged by
an army of tomtits . .. Was it memory, or association of ideas,
or both ? •»—Sev. F. O. Montague Powell, in the " Spectator.")
On a bush in a garden a little Tomtit
Sang "Willow, Tit-willow, Tit-willow!"
And I said to him, "Dicky-bird, why do yon sit
Singing ' Willow, Tit-willow, Tit-willow' P"
"I've had nothing to eat for three days," he replied,
"Though in searching for berries I've gone far and
wide,
And I feel a pain here in my little inside,
O Willow, Tit-willow, Tit-willow I"
Now bis poor little cheeks had grown haggard and thin,
0 Willow, Tit-willow, Tit-willow 1
And his self was a shadow of what it bad been,
0 Willow, Tit-willow, Tit-willow!
"By the kind Mr. Powell last year was I fed
With a cocoanut stuck on a stick," so he said,
"And without this again I shall shortly be dead,
0 Willow, Tit-willow, Tit-willow I"
So he gathered an army wbo twittered all day
"0 Willow, Tit-willow, Tit-willow!"
But a cocoanut soon made them all cease to say
"0 Willow, Tit-willow, Tit-willow!"
And the truth of my story you must not assail,
For the dear old Spectator has published the tale.
Though those who will read it can scarcely well fail
To say "Willow, Tit-willow, Tit-willow I"

Which strike with awe and with timidity

I played the other day at Whist,
My partner was a comely maiden,
Her eyes so blue, her pretty wrist
With bracelets and with bangles laden,
She wore about ten thousand pounds,
Each finger had its priceless jewel,
She was, in fact, ablaze—but zounds 1
Her play, indeed, was "something cruel."
I called for trumps, and called in vain,
At intervals I dared to mention
How much her conduct caused me pain,
Yet paid she not the least attention.
I very nearly tore my hair,
I begged of her to play discreetly,
But no—the tricks I planned with care
Without exception failed completely.
Jewels, I have no doubt, are grand,
But even they are sometimes oloying.
I found at length her splendid hand
(Of shapely fingers) most annoying.
When next I'm playing, I confess
I 'd like a girl (and may I get her 1)
Who shows her hands a little less,
And plays her cards a little better.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Dkombeb 20, 1890.

A LAY OF LONDON.
Oh, London is a pleasant plaoe to live the whole year through,
I love it 'neath November s pall, or Summer's rarest blue,
When leafy planes to city courts still tell the tale of June,
Or when the homely fog brings out the lamplighter at noon.
I thought to go away this year, and yet in town I am.
I have not been to Hampstoad Heath, much less to Amsterdam;
And now December's here again I do not feel the loss,
Though all the summer I've not been four miles from Charing Cross.
'Twas pleasant in the office
when we'd gather in a
bunch.
A social, dreamy sort of
day, with lots of time for
lunch.
How commerce flagged Sep-
tember through, at 90,
Pinching Lane,
Till bronzed and bluff the
chief returned, and trade
revived again.
Why talk of Andalusia's
bulls, of Rooky-Mountain
bears,
Of Tyrolean alpenstocks—
though not of Alpen
shares;
Of seaside haunts where
fashion drives with ooro-
netted panels,
Or briny nooks, when all
you need is pipes, and
books, and flannels.
Of orange-groves, and cloister'd courts, of fountains, and of pines,
iilaok shadows at whose edge the sun intolerably shines,
Of tumbled mountain heights, like waves on some Titanic sea,
Caught by an age of ice at once, and fix'd eternally.
Of quiet river-villages, which woods and waters frame,
LulI'd in the lap of loveliness to the music of their name;
Of fallow-fields, of sheltered farms, of moorland and of mere:
Let others roam—I stay at home, and find their beauties here.
Not when the sun on London town incongruously smiles,
On the news-boys, and the traffic, and the advertisers' wiles;
But when the solar orb has ceased to mark the flight of time,
And three yards off is nothingness— indefinite, sublime,—
Then in the City's teeming streets eaoh soul can get its share,
Its concentrated essence of the high romance of air,
Whose cloudy symbols Kkats beheld, and yeara'd to jot them down,
But anybody nowadays can swallow them in town.
There are, who, fain to dry the tear, and soothe the choking throat,
Would burn those tokens of the hearth that fondly o'er us float;
They cannot trace amid the gloom each dainty spire and whorl,
But smoke, to the true poet's eye, is never out of curl.
The sardine in his oily den, his little house of tin,
Headless and heedless there he lies, no move of tail or fin,
Yet full as beauteous, I ween, that press'd and prison'd fish,
As when in sunny seas he swam unbroken to the dish.
A unit in the vasty world of waters far away,
We could nor taste his toothsome form, nor watch his merry play,
But, prison'd thus, to fanoy's eye, he brings his native seas,
The olive-groves of Southern France—perchanoe the Pyrenees.
The brown sails of the fishing-boats, the lithe sea-season'd crew,
The spray that shakes the sunlight off beneath the breezy blue,
The netted horde that shames the light with their refulgent sheen—
Suoh charm the gods who dwell on high have given the chill sardine.
So when we find long leagues of smoke compacted in the air,
'Tis not the philosophic part to murmur or to swear,
But patiently unravelling, the threads will soon appear.
In cottage hearths, and burning weeds, and misty woodland sere.
The day is fading, all the West with sunset's glow is bright,
And island clouds of orimson float in depths of emerald light,
Like circles on a rippled lake the tints spread up the sky,
Till, mingling with the purple shade, they touoh night's shore,
Down

'Tis this, in other guise, that wraps the town in sombre pall,
While like two endless funerals the lines of traffic crawl,
And from the abysmal vagueness where flows the turbid stream
Like madden'd nightmares neighing, the steamers hoarsely scream.
The Arab yearns for deserts free, the mariner for grog
The hielan laddie treads the heath, the croppy trots the bog;
The Switzer boasts his avalanche, the Eskimo his dog,
But only London in the world, can show a London fog.
nearly bare, spread o'er the red-leaf d
Where yet late-lingerers patter down, altho' the wind is still,
The oottage smoke climbs thinly up, and shades the black-boled trees,
\ nd hangs upon the misty air as blue as summer teas.
A WONDERFUL SHLLLINGSWORTH.
Mr Dear Mb. Punch,—Fresh from the country (which has been
my perpetual residence for the last twenty years), I came to London,
a few days ago, to visit an establishment which seemed to me to
represent that delight of ray childhood, the Polytechnic Institution,
in the time of Professor Pepper's Ghost, and glass-blowing by
machinery. I need scarcely say that the Royal Aquarium was the
attraction, where a shilling entrance fee I imagined would procure
for me almost endless enjoyment.
I had seen the appetising programme—how the doors were opened
at 10 a.m., to close a good thirteen hours later—after a round of
novelties full of interest to a provincial sight-seer, to say nothing
of a Londoner. I entered and found the Variety Entertainment was
"on." I was about to walk into an enclosure, and seat myself in
a first-rate position for witnessing the gambols of some talented
wolves, when I was informed that I could not do this without
extra payment. Unwilling to "bang" an extra sixpenoe (two
had already been expended) I tried to find a gratuitous coign of
vantage, but (I am sorry to add).unsuccessfully. But I was not
to be disheartened. Could I not see " Kennedy, King Laughter-
Maker of the World," or "a Grand Billiard Match," or (more interest-
ing still) "the Performing Fleas " P Yes, indeed I could, but only by
expending a shilling on the Mesmerist, a like sum for the Billiard
Match, and sixpence on the carefully-trained hoppers. Seeing that
"the Wonderful and Beautiful Mystic Muriel" was in the building,
I attempted to interview her, but was stopped at the door by a demand
for the fifth of half - a- crown. A like sum stood as a barrier between me
and an entertainment that I was told was " described by Mr. Rider
Haggard in his well-known romance, called She." Passing by a small
bower-like canvas erection, I was attracted by the declaration of its
custodian that it was "the most wonderful sight in the world/' a
statement he made, he said, "without fear of contradiction." But
"Eve's Garden" (asthe small bower-like canvas erection was called)
was inaccessible to those who did not expend tbe grudgingly-produced
but necessary sixpenoe. Foiled in this direction, I fain would have
visited the celebrated Beckwith Family performances, but was pre-
vented by finding that a shilling was the only passport to admission,
unless I happened to be a child, when the modified charge of sixpenoe
would be deemed sufficient. There was, however, one entertainment
almost free (only a penny was charged), an automatic sight-tester,
which pleased me greatly. By putting a copper in the slot, pressing
a pedal, and turning a handle, 1 learned that anyone could discover,
literally at a glance, the condition of his eyes. Had I not made up
my mind to disburse nothing further than the bare shilling I had
already expended, I should certainly have ascertained if the time
had arrive d for my regretful assumption of a pinch-nose or a pair
of spectacles.
I was now losing heart, when, to my great joy, 1 came upon " the
White Kangaroo, the Laughing Jackasses, &c," allot'which were to be
seen "free gratis and for nothing." It is right, however, that I should
add that I found some difficulty in distinguishing " the White Kan-
garoo" from"the Laughing Jackasses," and both from " &o." Inow
made for Mile. Paula's Crocodiles, but here, again, alas! I was
doomed to disappointment. As I approached the Reptile- House, in
whioh the fair dame was disporting herself (no doubt) amongst
"Indian Pythons and Boa Constrictors," I was warned off by the
legend, "Admission, Sixpence." It was then I remembered that,
after all, I was in an Aquarium, and, consequently, had no right to
expect anything but fish. So I approached the tanks, and, to my
great delight, found in one of them some floating bodies, that I am
almost sure must have been herrings. Having thus gratified my
curiosity for the strange and the curious, I returned, well satisfied, to
the country, where I purpose remaining a further term of next twenty
years. In the meanwhile, believe me, Dear Mr. Punch,
Yours sincerely, One Easily Pleased.
Something very Bio.—" Tha principal ro^lJWsii^), in Y Barn's

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Golden Sells, rung by Dean and Son,—quite appropriately ecole-
siastical this,—and edited by Mrs. Elizabeth Day, will ring forth
peals of delight in the nursery, it being
the Christmas number of The Little One's
Own Paper.
Arrowsmith's Christmas Annual, by
Walter Besant, bears the cheerful and
seasonable title of " The Demoniac."
Mr. Hyne's Four Red Nightcaps is some-
what in the style of Three Men in a Boat,
only there are Four men in a Yacht."
Most of the Magazines have their special
numbers of these. The English Illustrated
^ _ —. Harper's, The Century, are got up with the
^ moat charming illustrations.
The Gentlewoman has her first Christmas Number, and,—so like
her!—a ooloured satin picture! The Pictorial World has two good
pictures for framing.
The Baron liketh muoh the latest contribution to the Rosslyn
Series, edited by Earl Hodoson, who is of the Peerage of Par-
nassus, as you won't find this Earl in Brett's Peerage. The Baron
congratulates the Earl, and has also sent an order for a pound
of laurels wherewith to decorate the brow of "Walter Hebries
Pollock. Among the many gema of his songs let me seleot "A Con-
tinuation"—there would have been "a pair of continuations,"
oould he have rivalled himself; then Lalage," and" The
Chansonnette," which, with "Rixzio to Marie Stuart," ought to
be set to music by a gifted composer. There are also some
delightful verses to " Old Court Trinity," which will delight all
Trinitarians of Cambridge—"cum multis aliit"— to quote lie
ancient Roman singer, so, as a short way with our Poet Pollock,
the classic Baron, remembering how the ancients swore " By Pollux 1"
adapts the ejaculation, and says, "Buy Pollock's—book."
All Meredithians must possess George Meredith, Some Charac-
teristics, by Richard Le Gallienne. The book is a complete and
excellent guide to the novelist and the novels, a sort of Meredithian
Bradshaw, with pictures of the traffic superintendent, and of the
head office at Boxhill. Even Philistines may be won over by the
blandishments of Mr. Le Oalltebnb, from whom I learn, by the
way, that George Meredith is " the Harvey of the Ego," and that
he is not Adrian Harley. I hear, also, that "daily, from one quarter
or another, come critical cuff and kick, to impress upon a numb
public the latest example of its immemorial purbhndness." And the
Baron adds this cufflet to the rest. Mr. John Lane has added
a Bibliography, whioh is a model of minute industry. So here '• to
the book of Richard and John.
Among the Arts for obvious reasons not known to Ancient Greece
is The Art of Cooking by Gas. In a little book under this title,
published by Cassell, Mrs. 8ugo has undertaken to disclose its
mysteries, and set forth its attractions. No one oould be better
qualified for the task, since Mrs. Sugg is the wife of William Sugg
of Charing Cross, who has thrown more light on Modern London
than Camden did on its ancient ways. Cooking by gas, Mrs. Sugg
shows, is cleaner, cheaper, more convenient, and more artistio than
the older style. So widely is the practice now established, that
gas-cooking apparatus are made to suit all conditions of life, from
the kitchen of the Grand Hotel to the "Little Connaught," whioh
you can (if you like) carry about in your waistcoat-pocket; yet
when properly extended it will roast fowls, and small joints, grill
chops, steaks, and fish, boil eggs, and vegetables, and keep a large
family in hot water. "To gentlemen residing in Chambers, or
those reading for the Bar," Mrs. Sugg writes of another treasure,
"this little kitchener with the two grillers will prove a great
boon." If Sir Henry James had really been going to the Bench, he
could not have done better than study this book, and set himself up
with a "Little Connaught" or a "Double Griller." Sinoe that is
not the oase, it may be asked, Would they be worth the Lobd
Chancellor's attention? We unhesitatingly reply, "Why,
Sugg'nly!"
"Are you asleep, Buchanan?" inquired Archer. This is the
first sentence of a shilling novel, by Butdte Skottowe, with a
very sensational picture on the cover. I "read no more that day,"
but olosed the book, dreading lest, of the two figures on the thrilling
frontispiece, one should be the Buchanan, and the other the only
Archer in the world of Ibsenish proclivities.

for the former, they can be let out.

Dear Mr. Punch,
I must appeal to you, the unimpeachable Caesar, in athletics
as in all other matters, to secure me some small meed of public sym-
Sathy and consideration. During the, happily, almost past year, I
ave been the viotim of gross ill-treatment at the hands, nay, worse,
the feet, of athletes of various kinds. I have been out in public by
some of the best performers; I have been meroilessly beaten, and
persistently lowered, till it is a wonder to myself that I have any
self-respect left I am too good a sportsman at least Sir, to complain
of rough usage in a fair way, but while I must suffer for the ambi-
tion of every ped. and every wheel-man, my colleague and close
relation, who is generally] known as " The Standard," is put higher
and higher, without really doing anything at all to deserve his eleva-
tion. I have had the people all shouting about me; I have been the
subject of columns of statistical gush in the Sporting Press, and now
I am constrained to appeal to a non-professional for bare justice in
my orippled old age. Wishing you a happier New Year than the
old one has been to me, I am yours, in disgust,

A MUSICAL NOTE.
Very fine performance by Royal Choral Society, at my little
place in Kensington, on Wednesday evening, Dec. 10th, of
Mackenzie's "Rose of Sharon." Everything couleur de Rose,
except the atmosphere, whioh was couleur de pea-soup. Weather
responsible for a certain number of empty stalls in my hall. Madame
Albani in excellent voice—sang throughout gloriously. E. L., the
Squire of Hall Barn, says that, when the eminent soprano sings at
his place, he shall announoe her as Madame Hallux eni. Hilda
Wilson first-rate in "Lo! the King!'' Lloyd as good as ever;
can't say more. The duets between him and Albani, perfection.
Watkin Mills, an impressive Solomon, sang the difficult musio of
that character artistically. The Chorus superb in one of finest
choruses, written by an English composer, "Make a joyful Noise"—
a very joyful noise they made, and a considerable one. I consider
the "Rose of Sharon" a masterpiece, and the greatest work of
any Englishman—and, now I oome to think of it, Mackenzie's a
Scotchman. Yours truly, Albert Hall.
Pars about Pictures.—On to Dowdeswrll's—Piotures by the
Newlyn School. Interesting show this—especially good in land-
scapes. Disappointed there is no picture of tne town of Par, whence
the O. P.'s ancestors came. However, let that pass. Ladies, first,—
there is excellent work by Mrs. Stanhope Fobbes, Mrs. Gotch,
Miss Hayes, Miss Ford, and Miss Bird; and, be it said with all
politeness, equally excellent work by Messrs. Stanhope Forbes,
Titcombe, A. C. Tayler, and others. A good many of the tin
mines of Cornwall are said to be worked out, but I think not a
few of our young artists have found a mine of tin in this piotu-
resque country, which they are working both to their own advantage,
and that 'of the Art-loving public. In tne same gallery may be found
a small collection of pastels by Mr. James Guthrie. This artist
seems to thoroughly understand the scope of pastel—and has walked
his chalks about Scotland to considerable purpose. Old Par.

Ob, The St. Stephen's Tragedy.
An old (Ingoldtbyith) Song, to a tute {Irish)
Tune.
When M.P.'s were all honest and good,
(A long time ago, I'm afraid. Ma'am),
We heard of the Babes in the Wood,
Who were jockeyed, misled, and betrayed,
Ma'am.
Well, history, so we are'told,
Repeats itself—varying slightly—
Onoe again two poor Babes have been—told,
Let us say, jnst to put it politely.
Rom tiddy-um, tiddy-um-tay 1
Two innocent cherubs they were,
Master Qladdt, and young Miss Moob-
lkbna;
Such sweet little souls to ensnare,—
Why, no conduot could well have been
meaner.
But all things went well for a time;
The parties they trusted made much of them;
Little they fancied that crime
Would ever attempt to get dutch of them.
Rum tiddy, &o.
All the same, Ma'am, before very long, 1
The Babes found themselves in the
Wood. It
Was that which is known in Erse song
As the Wood of Shillelagh. Now could it
Be thought that two brave Oirish bhoys
Might be found so confoundedly cruel
As to rob two wee bairns of their toys,
And then give the poor darlings their
"gruel,??
Rum tiddy, &o.
But somehow one of them fell out
With his whilom pet Babe, little Gliddt,
Looked on him with anger and doubt,
And conspired to destroy him, poor laddie!
It seems that the once-admired kid"
Was a Turk, and a rogue, and a pickle,
Who wouldn't do what he was bid,
Bat was talkative, tricky, and tickle.
Rum tiddy, &o.
Clear oase of the Wolf and the Lamb 1
Said the Wolf, "I dielike, and distrust
him.
His innocence is but a sham,
I mean having the bleed of him, bust him!"
(Such language sounds vulgar and coarse,
And to put it in poesy's painful;
But Kipling will tell you that force
Of taste must be sometimes disdainful.)
Rum tiddy, &c.
Little Qladdt, he turned up his eyes
To his guide's now most truculent visage,
And feelings of doubt and surprise
Took hold on him, trying at his age.
Cried he, "Go away. Naughty Man 1
Mooblekna, this fellow's a rogue, he
Will kill us, I'm sure, if he can.
For his face looks as black as Old Bogey!"
Rum tiddy, &o.
Oh. then the First Robber looked mad,
And he ups, and says he to the Second,
"This impudent bit of a lad
No more a safe pal can be reckoned.
Oet him out of our way, or the swag
Will not be worth much when allotted.
Moobleena's small weasand you scrag.
Whilst I out young Billy's carotid!"
Rum tiddy, &o.
"Hal stop I" cried the milder of mood,
"Your conduct is savage and silly.
They will search for these Babes in this Wood,
And there '11 be a big row about Billy.
Don't fancy you '11 finish this job
When you've scragged 'em and stifled
their Bobbins' I
If these Babes we should murder and rob,
Their graves won't be left to the Robins 1"
Rum tiddy, &o.
Of course after language like this
Those Robbers' relations grew " squiffy."
Each drew, out and thrust, scored a miss,
And then they set-to in a jiffy.
The Babes, in no optimist mood,
Look on at the fight not unequal.
Will they safely get out of the Wood?
Well, that we shall see in the sequel!
Rum-tiddy-um, tiddy-um-tay!
An Anglo-Indian journal, quoted by the

Afghanistan "might construct a telegraph

"Now, 'bout dat time, honey," pursued Unole Remits, " Brer Fox

"Why was that P" asked the little boy.
"Dat," replied the old man, "was des Vathis frends wanted'fer

And kept him ten months on his back—?

To fade and sink, and keep his bed,
And finally go off his head P—
That Foot-ball!

What made the other lack a limb P

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTEACTED FEOM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday^ December 8.—Prince Arthur came
down to House this afternoon, with light heart, and un wrinkled brow.
The first section of Session was drawing to a close; truly a wonder-
ful time. Old Morality, in arranging for its disposal, had, as
usual, taken a sanguine view of his opportunities, and had crammed
the space with work to be done. There were the Tithes Bill and the
Land Purchase Bill, ineffectually struggled over last Session, and
finally abandoned. There was the Railways BUI, successfully
obstructed last Session, leading, on one occasion, to an All-night
Sitting; and there was the Seed Potato Bill, innocent enough in
appearance, but, like all Irish measures, oapable of blossoming into
portentous things. But everything had
gone smoothly. Here was the 8th of
December, not quite a fortnight after
opening of Session, and appointed work
nearly finished. To-night would read a
Second Time second portion of Land Bill,
and then, hey, for the Christmas holidays!
Prince Arthur, entering House with
long, swinging stride, smiling sweetly
around him, started at the prospect before
him. Hitherto Benches in Irish quarter
have been empty; accustomed occupants
wrestling with each other in Committee
Room No. 15. "For a fortnight," as
Sydnkt Herbert said, dropping into
poetry as he surveyed the battle-field from
the Bar, " all bloodless lay the untrodden
snow." Now Prinoe Arthur, like
"Lindeh, saw another sight" The Irish
quarter closely packed. At the corner
seat by the Gangway Tim Healt, terribly
truculent; a little further down the new
Leader of the regenerate party, bent on
making more History for Our Own Times.
Whilst Parkell was yet the unorowned
king, he eschewed the habit of Guerilla
Leaders (whether with or without a fol-
lowing) of appropriating a corner seat.
"For a very good reason," says Wil- Suive i the Battle-field.
liam Murphy, once mildest - mannered
man that ever built a tram or railway, now transformed into
exceedingly plain-spoken politician. "If Parwell had taken
corner seat, bis comings and goings — especially his goings—
would have been more easily marked. Sitting midway down the
Bench, amongst the ruck of Members, he was not noticeable except
when he wanted to be noticed. Could slink in and out without
attracting attention."
Not for that reason, but from sheer modesty, Justin McCarthy
has taken up almost identical position; Truculent Tim guards the
oorner seat,
where he can
snap and snarl
with fuller free-
dom. Fell upon
Prinoe Arthur
to - night with
fearsome ferocity.
The Prince, hav-
ing explained his
measure last
week, when Tix
and the rest
"deliberating " in
Committee Room
No. 15, he pre-
sumed to think
he needn't repeat
exercise, and so
moved Second
Reading by dumb
gesture. Tim on
his feet as if
propelled from
catapult. What!
the Chief Secre-
tary pot going


Not quite " 0 Keny 1 ■
to make a speeoL
when the new Irish Party had mustered for the first time in the
history of a reeling and revolving universe P Abominable Atro-
cious 1! ContumeUously contemptuous 11!
Tim moved Adjournment of Debate; wanted to discuss merits of
Bill on this motion. Deputy-Speaker interfered on point of order.
Tim must speak or burst. If he withdrew his Motion for Adjourn-
ment, he might get someone else to move rejection of Bill. Then his
opportunity would come. Eye fell on Seymour Eeay. dressed in
height of antique fashion, reclining on Bench below him. Eeay
always wanting to make speech. Not invariably coherent, but that
no consequence. He would be only too glad to move rejection of
Bill; then Tim would dive in and get off his speech.
Change of tactics too rapid for Eeay to follow. Tim's motion
withdrawn; question put was, "that Bill be read Second Time."
Now was Eeay's cue to rise and move its rejection; but Eeay failed
to grasp situation; sat smiling with inane adulation at tip of his
passionately polished patent-leather shoe, over which lay the fawn-
coloured "spat," like dun dawn rising over languid lustrous sea.
Not a second to be lost. Deputy-Chairman on his feet; if no
Amendment were submitted, he would declare Second Reading
carried. Tim stooped down, and with clenched fist smote Kkay
between the shoulder-blades. Eeay, startled out of pleased reverie,
turned round with frightened glance, as he beheld Tim blazing with
righteous fury, glowering over him: paralysed with fear; had heard
alarming rumours of methods of Debate introduced in Committee
Room No. 15. This sudden assault from the rear evidently one of
them. Who could say what might not be its most natural sequence f
"I expected every moment would be my next," Seymour Eeat
said, later, when, with still chattering teeth, he was describing the
episode.
''Tut I " said Tim. "I was only asking you to get up and move
that the Land Department (Ireland) Bill be read a Second Time on
that day six months."
While someone went for glass of water and smelling salts for
Seymour Eeay, Maurice Healy moved rejection of Bill; Debate
arose; Tim storming round the topic with undiminished vigour.
But no one would rice to his tempestuous heights; Debate flittered
out; Bill read Second Time; House up by Seven o'clock.
Business done.—A lot.
Tuttday.— Dreadful rumour when House met that Tim Healt
had ready for delivery speech two hours long, on Prinoe Arthur in
general, and Irish Land Bill in particular. Turned out to be only
Tim's fun. Once or twice in course of brief proceedings he jumped
up suddenly, and shouted out, "Bah!" but only meant to frighten
Old Morality. Momentarily had desired effect; soon clear that
nothing serious meant. Appointed Bills advanced through stipulated
stages, and Old Morality, modest in mien, even after the triumph
of matchless management displayed in brief Session, moved Adjourn-
ment over Christmas holidays.
Conversation as to arrangement of business on reassembling;
Truculent Tim, coming to the front at least urgent opportunity,
demanded that Irish business
should not be taken as first Order.
Old Morality promptly gave
desired pledge. Then Mabjoki-
banks, who, to travesty Tbevel-
yan's famous saying, Though a
Whip, is a Scottish gentleman,
broke the long pause of eloquent
silence cultivated in the Lobby;
protested against Scotch Members
being placed in inconvenient posi-
tion, by being obliged to put in
appearance on first day after holi-
days. Welsh Members echoed
plaint on their part. Why should
Tithes Bill be put down for first
dav?
Pretty to see Old Morality's
firm attitude, in face of this
demonstration. Had capitulated
to Irish at first sound of Toe's
low voice; quite a different thing
with inconsiderable people like the
Scotch or Welsh. Almost haughtily
protested against possibility of
alteration. Members," he said,
vaguely remembering copy-book
heading, "are made for business, _ "Au Bevoir!
not business for Members." That settled it. Motion for Adjourn-
ment carried; Young Gosset, with his beaver up, advanced to
remove Mace, and House went off for Christmas holidays.
Business done.—Sittings adjourned till 22nd of January.

Note oh tcir Westminster Play.—The notion of its being per-
formed in " The Dormitory" is delightful. None of the performers
could possibly be offended by the audience doing the right thing in
the right place, and going to sleep.

A STUDY FROM THE LIFE.
(Prophetically communicated by an Interviewer of the Future.)
Having to desoribe the person and abode of the Poet Podobrs, I
cannot do better than jot down in my note-book what I know about
those objects on my road to the abode of genius—otherwise, 126,
Bolingbroke Square, South Belgravia. That useful work, Men of
the Time, tells me that the Poet was educated
at Westminster and Christ Churoh — faots
that in themselves suggest a column of copy
about Football at Vinoent Square, the mys-
teries of Seniors, Juniors, and Second Elec-
tion, and the glories and humours of Tom's
Quad. Not much trouble about that. So
far, plain sailing. Bolingbroke Square, too,
helps one along. Historical reminiscences,
Pimlioo in time of Romans, ditto Normans,
ditto when Elizabeth was Queen. All this
can be worked up comfortably and conve-
niently in the Reading Room of the British
Museum. Then the Podgers' family history
should give a good third. Father made a
fortune in black in g, so daresay he recollects his
grandfather. No doubt latter settled in London
with the employment of junior office -sweeper,
and the capital of an eleemosynary half-crown. Need not trouble
about the Heraldic Visitations, or the coat and crest. Keep those
items for an interview characterised more by blood" than " brains."
Suppose he has received presentation copies of works of poetical
rivals. This will give an opportunity for introducing contemporary
biographical sketches, varying from three lines to half a oolumn.
Know his house, too—once occupied by a foreign fiddler, next a
Cabinet Minister, lastly, a successful artist, hints (if required) for
scenes on the Continent, in Parliament, and the Royal Aoademy.
Wife and children. Domestio soene—good for two-thirds. Wife
Slaying piano as the children spin their tops, or gambol with Collie
og. There now, I think I have got enough material for the present,
And here we are at Bolingbroke Square, South Kensington.
What's this! Podgers' servant says Podoers declines to tee
literary gents 1 He won't be interviewed!
Won't he 1 With my materials, soon arrange about that.' After
all, seeing him was only an empty form 1

CHRISTMAS AND CLEOPATRA.
Mr. Clement Scott, in his most useful 'column of theatrical
information in the _ Daily Telegraph, told us last Friday, that the
Princess's Theatre is now " heated by a new process," which must
mean the exceptionally warm reception
given every evening to Mrs. Langtry as
Cleopatra. In this favourable sense of
the phrase, "She gets it hot all round,"
and the public assists in "making it
warm" for her, in return for her making it
warm for them. The more than Clement
Scott writes of "extra rows of stalls,"
and of "money being turned away on
account of the success of Antony and
Cleopatra."lBn\o\ "0 rare for Antony.'"
and 0 most rare for Egypt's fairest
daughter! Of course when the money is "turned away," more
money is admitted. Great thing for a theatre when all the boxes
are money-boxes, and the pit a gold-mine. Those who are allowed
to enter will not complain of being "let in," unless they object to
being " let in for a good thing."
With its ballets and splendid mite-en-tcene, and its splendid
"Missis-i'n-irrne," too, "There would seem no reason," continues
the generous Scott, "why Antony and Cleopatra should not be
regarded as what is euphemistically (a deuoe of a word this) known
as a ' Christmas Piece.'" By all means. Be it bo. Will the fair
Manageress take the hint, and announce a grand Transformation
Scene for Boxing Night, with the pantomimic oast thus distributed:
—Harlequin, Colonel Antont Coghlan; Columbine, Mrs. Cleo-
patra Langtht; Pantaloon, Mr. Enobarbcs Stirling' and
Cloum— a real "Shakspearian Clown," by Mr. Everill, who, in
spite of his name, we hope will continue Ever-well, and be able to
indulge the public with the good old clastic song, "Puma Calida."
Mr. Clkmrxt Scott, at this inclement season, has hit on a first-rate
notion, of whioh, no donbt, Queen Cleopatra will avail herself, if
necessary.

A Christmas Par.—At this season we must mention Crackers,
that's the truth—and we can't let 'em off. Sparagnapase's
Jewelled Crackers are A1, and that's truth and no cracker.
While on the subject of Craokers, we are prepared for the question.
What next? and are equally prepared with the echoing reply
"Ward next,"—with his dainty oonfeotions in artistio cards and
booklets.

The origin of the phrase, Le Coup de Jarnac, is interesting,
and the story is well told by Mr. 3/Ucdowall in Maximilian's

In The Argosy, edited hy Mr. Charles Wood, there are two good
most seasonable Ghost Stories, by Chablks

is not new, as there is a similar legend

It lacked corroboration at the time, and is
likely to do so.
The Letters passing between a fine young
English Cantab, "all of the modern style,"
and his family at home, are uncommonly
amusing. Harry Fludyer at Cambridge is

wittioism in vogue tempore Edouardi Recti et Dos Paolo

Adelphians," as they were onoe called), "Things is worry much
as they used to was" at Cambridge, and University life of to-day
differs very little from that of yesterday, or the day before, or the
day before that. "B<ec olim meminitte juvabit, when, half a

CINDERELLA.; FIN DE SIECLE.
{A Fairy Tale for Christmas.)
Tee Lady Help was busy at her domestic duties when her God-
mother knocked at the kitchen-door, and entered.
"Alas, poor Cinderella!" said the Fairy, in a compassionate
tone, "and so your stepmother and sisters have gone to the Prince's
ball, and left you to cleanse the pots and pans f"
"Thank you," returned her God-daughter; "I am perfectly
well satisfied to be left with my books. As a matter of fact, dances
bore me."
And she carelessly glanced at some mathematical works that the
had used when cramming for the Senior Wranglership.
"Nonsense, my dear," responded the well-intentioned Fairy," Get
me a pumpkin, some mice"
"Quite out of date," interrupted Cinderella. "I presume you
intend to turn the pumpkin into a great ooaoh, and so forth. Eh?"
"Well," admitted the Fairy, taken abaok, "ye - es."
'' Quite so. Believe me, the idea is distinctly old-fashioned. Pray
understand, I don't say you can't do it. Nowadays, with Edison
and Kocn, it would be dangerous to suggest that anything was
impossible. No, I merely objeot to travel in a conveyance that
will naturally be redolent of the odours of the kitehen garden,
and to be driven by a coachman derived from a rodent."
"But this objection is contrary to precedent," urged the Fairy.
"You ought to express unbounded delight, and then depart in
your carnage with the greatest Mat possible."
"You are most kind, but, if I am to do anything of that sort,
I would prefer leaving the matter in the hands of Mr. Sheriff
Augustus Harris who thoroughly understands the entire business."
"It seems to me," said the Fairy, "you are very ungrateful.
But surely you want a magnifioent oostume?"
"Thanks, no j I get everything from Paris."
"And you think of the feelings of your modiste, and ignore those
of your poor old (but well-preserved) Godmother!" And the Fairy
was nearly moved to tears.
"Oh, I did not mean to pain you!" exclaimed Cinderella.
"Stay, my dear Lady, do you believe in hypnotism? No? Well, I
do, and exercise it. Pardon me!"
And as she made a few passes, the Fairy sank into a mesmeric
trance. Then Cinderella desired that her Godmother should
imagine that she had been the heroine of a Fairy Story.
"Dear me," oried the now-satisfied dame, as she regained con-
sciousness; "and so you went to the ball, lost your slipper, and
married the Prince?"
"That was the impression I wished to oonvey to you. And now,
my dear, good Lady, I am afraid I must ask you to leave me."
And as the Fairy disappeared, Cinderella resumed her self-
imposed tasks of making an omelette and squaring the circle.

Chaws* LXVII.
The fair girl stepped lightly into the room, and, haying daintily
removed the dost from her feet by wiping them on one of Biolow
add Sons' Patent Crocodile Matting Hugs (delivered carriage free
within a radius of twelve miles of their establishment at Lndgate
Circus) that was placed before the door, gave a hasty glance round
the apartment. She saw at once from the octagonal ebonised table three
feet six, by two feet five inches, the afternoon lounge couch (as adver-
tised), the gent's easy shake-down chair, ladies ditto, and half doxen
occasional chairs, all upholstered in rich material in Messrs. Mux-
geave & Co. of 170, Walbrook, City, E.C.'s best style, that a
refined taste inspired by a wholesome economy had been exercised in
the furnishing of the apartment, and she turned to the old Duke
with a grateful nod of recognition.
"What," he asked, in a feeble voioe, "is it my own Angelica.?
Surely it is! Come, my ohild, let me look at you f" He turned up
the burner of a Boycotle's Patent Incandescent Gas Lamp (price
13s. 9d. with full paper of instructions complete), and as he stood
erect in his rich calico-lined fox-fur dressing-gown (supplied in three
qualities by B&oham .& Co, with a discount of 15 per cent, for
cash), he looked, every foot of him, a worthy scion of that ancient
family of which he was the last living representative. "Let me
look at you," he again repeated, drawing his neatly-dressed grand-
daughter more fully into the light before him. As it fell upon
the graceful curves of her lissom figure, it was easy to peroeive that
she was wearing one of Madame Beaumont's celebrated Porcupine
Quill Corsets, which lent a wonderful finish to a two-guinea tailor-
made gingham cloth "Oem "costume, braided with best silk (horn
buttons included), whioh showed off her young form to suoh advantage.
He would have added more, but a sudden pallor stole over his
complex ion, and he reeled towards a chair.
In an instant the bright girl was on her knees at his side. "Dear
Grandfather, you are faint!" she cried, an expression of alarm
suffusing her beautiful features.
The Duke pointed to a small table—'' My Liquid Pork!" he
"Ah 1 of course 1" was her quiok response, as she bound*
the room, and returned with an eleven-and-sixpenny bottle of
"Bolxin's Liquid Pork, or, the Emaciated Invalid s Hog-wash "—
a stimulating, flesh-creating, life-sustaining food; sold in bottles
at It. l\d., 2s. 'Jc/., 5s. Id., and lis. 6A,—of which she quickly
poured out half a tumbler, and raised it to the quivering lips of the
staggering old nobleman by her side. "How foolish of me not to
have thought of this before I" she continued, replenishing the glass,
whioh he emptied in feverish haste.
"I save threepence-halfpenny in a sovereign," he went on, a
wicked twinkle kindling in his eye as he spoke, "by taking the
eleven-and-sixpenny size—and that is a consideration, my dear. If
you don't think so now, with all your young life before you, you
will when jou come to be my age 1"
He sank back in his arm-chair as he spoke, apparently about to
deliver himself to the calm delights of a retrospective reverie. But
he was not destined to enjoy it. At that
moment a whiff of stifling smoke, quite choking
in its intensity, forced itself under the door.
In another moment the matter was soon ex-
plained. With a wild rush the butler burst
into the room.
"Fly, your Grace, for your life I" he oried;
"the place is on fire!"
A blaze of flame that followed the terrified
menial into the room, only too truly cor-
roborated his statement. In a another moment
the fire had seized hold of the new furniture,
and in greedy fury, as if it were some demon
spirit, licked the walls with great tongues of
flame.
"In the cupboard, my dear," said the Duke,
the proud blood of his raoe coming to his aid
in a perfect and commanding coolness in
the face of the terrible danger that faced him, "you will find
three cans of Jobson's Patent Fire Annihilating Essence. It is
advertised as infallible. Give one to the butler, take one
and give the third to me. This appears to be a good opport
testing its efficacy."
The quick bright girl instantly obeyed his injunction. The cans
were distributed, and opened. A colourless gas was liberated. In
a few seconds the flames were entirely quenched.
"Ah 1" said the old Duke, flinging himself back into his arm-
chair with a sigh of relief. "Ana now, Angelica, my dear, you
can tell me why you came to see me!"

VOCES POPULI.
A CHRISTMAS ROMP.
Scene—Mrs. Chippebfield'sDrawing-room. Itisafter the Christmas
dinner, and the Gentlemen have not yet appeared. Mrs. C. is
laboriously attempting to be gracious to her Brother1'i Fiancee,
whoie acquaintance she has made for the first timef and with
whom she is disappointed. Married Sisters and Maiden Aunts
confer in comers with a sleepy acidity.
First Married Sister (to Second). I felt quite sorry for Feed, to
see him sitting there, looking—and no wonder—so ashamed of him-
self—but 1 always will say, and I always must Bay, Cakoli.ve, that
if you and Robkkt had been firmer
with him when he was younger, he
would never hare turned out so badly!

Mrs. C. {to the Fiancfe). Well, my
dear, I don't approve of young men
getting engaged until they have some
Srespects of being able to marry, and
ear Algy was always my favourite
brother, and I've seen so muoh misery
from long engagements. However, we
must hope for the best, that's all 1
A Maiden Aunt (to Second Ditto). Exactly what struck me,
Martha. One waiter would have been quite sufficient, and if Jambs
must be grand and give champagne, he might have given us a little
more of it; I'm sure I'd little more than foam in my glass! And
every plate as cold as a stone, and you and I the only people who
were not considered worthy of silver forks, and the children encour-
aged to behave as they please, and Joseph Podmorb made suoh a
fuss with, because he's well off—and not enough sweetbread to go
the round. Ah, well, thank goodness, we needn't dine here for
another year!
Mr. C'hipperfield (at the door). Sorry to cut you short in your
oigar, Uncle, and you Limpett; but fact is, being Christmas night,
I thought we'd come up a little sooner and all have a bit of a romp
. . . Well, Emily, my dear, here we are, all of us—ready for any-
thing in the way of a frolic— what's it to be? Forfeits, games,
Puss in the Corner, something to oheer us all up, eh P Won't anyone
make a suggestion? [General expression of gloomy blankness.
Algernon (to his Fiancfe—whom he wants to see shine). Zeffie,
you know no end of games—what's that one you played at home,
with potatoes and a salt-spoon, you know?
Zeffie (blushing). No, phase, Alot! I don't know any games,
indeed, I couldn t, really!
Mr. C. Uncle Josepd: will set us going, I'm sure—what do you
say. Unole?
Uncle Joseph. Well, I won't say "no " to a quiet rubber.
Mrs. C. But, you see, we can t all play in that, and there is a
paok of cards in the house somewhere; but I know two of the aoes
are gone, and I don't think all the court cards were there the last
time we played. Still, if you can manage with what is left, we
might get up a game for you.
Uncle J. (grimly). Thank you, my dear, but, on the whole, I think
I would almost rather romp
Mr. C. Unole Joseph votes for romping! What do you say to
Dumb Crambo P Great fun—half of us go out, and oome in on all-
fours, to rhyme to "oat," or "bat," or something—you can play
that, Limpett?
Mr. Limpett. If I must find a rhyme to oat, I prefer, so soon after
dinner, not to go on all-fours for it, I confess.
Mr. C. Well, let's have something quieter, then—only do settle.
Musical Chairs, eh?
Algy. Zeffie will play the piano for you—she plays beautifully.
Zeffie. Not without notes, Algy, and I forgot to bring my music
with me. Shall we play " Consequences " P It's a very quiet game
—you play it sitting down, with paper and pencil, you know!
Mr. Limpett (sardonically, and sotto voce). Ah, this is something
like a rollick now. "Consequences,'' eh?
Algy (who has overheard—in a savage undertone). If that isn't
good enough for you, suggest something better—or shut up!

[The Family Failure collapses.
Mr. Limpett. Well, as we've all got pencils, is there any reason
why the revelry should not commence P
Mr. C. No—don't let's waste anymore time. Miss Z bffir says
she will write down on the top ot her paper "Who met whom"
(must be a Lady and Gentleman in the party, you know), then she
folds it down, and passes it on to the next, who writes, What he
said to her"—the next, "What she said to him "—next, "What
the consequences were," and the last, "What the world said."
Capital game—first-rate. Now, then!
[ The whole party pass papers in silence from one to another, and
scribble industriously with knitted brows.
Mr. C. Time's up, all of you. I '11 read the first paper aloud.
(Glances at it, and explodes.) He-he!—this is really very funny.
(Reads.) "Unole Joseph met Aunt Caroline at the—ho—no!—the
Empire! He said to her, 1 What are the wild waves sayingt' and
she said to him, 'It's time you were taken away!' The consequences
were that they both went and had their hair cut. and the world said
they had always suspected there was something between them!"
Uncle J. I consider that a pieoe of confounded impertinenoe!
Aunt C. It's not true. I never met Joseph at the Empire. 1 don't
go to suoh places. I didn't think I should be insulted like this—1
(Weeps.) — on Christmas too!
Aunts' Chorus. Fred again.'
[ They regard Family Failure indignantly.
Mr. C. There, then, it was all fun—no harm meant I '11 read the
next. "Mr. Limpett met Miss Zeffie in the Burlington Aroade.
He said to her, '0, you little duok!' She said to him, 'Fowls are
cheap to-day!' The consequences were that they never smiled
again, and the world said, ' What prioe hot potatoes ?'" (Every-
body looks depressed.) H'm—not bad—but I think we'll play some-
thing else now. [Zeffie perceives that Algy is not pleased with her.
Tommy. (To Uncle Joseph). Uncle, why didn't you carve at
dinner?
Uncle J. Well, Tommy, because the oarving was done at a side
table—and uncommon badly done, too. Why do you want to know?
Tommy. Parpar thought you would carve, I know. He told
Mummy she must ask you, because
Mrs.'C. (With a prophetic instinct.) Now, Tommy, you mustn't
tease your Unole. Come away, and tell your new Aunt Zeffie what
you're going to do with your Christmas boxes.
Tommy. But mayn't I tell him what Parpar said, first?
Mrs. C. No, no; by and by—not now! [She averts the danger.
[Later ; the Company are playing "Side the Thimble:" i.e., lonu-
one has planted that article in a place so conspicuous that few
would expect to find it there. As each person catches sight of it, he
or she sits down. Uncle Joseph is still, to the general merriment,
wandering about and getting angrier every moment.
Mr. C. That 'sit, Uncle, you're warm—you 're gelling warm I
Uncle J. (Boiling over.) Warm, SirP I am warm—and some-
thing more, I can tell you! [Sits down with a bump.
Mr. C. Ton haven't seen it! I'm sure you haven't seen it.
Come now, Unole!
Uncle J. Never mind whether I have or have not. Perhaps I
don't want to see it, Sir!
The Children. Then do you give it up? Do you want to be
told P Why, it's staring you in the face all the time!
Uncle J. I don't care whether it 'a staring or not—I don't want
to be told anything more about it.
The Children. Then you're cheating, Unole—you must go on
walking till you Jo see it!
Uncle J. Oh, that's it, eh? Very well, then-I '11 walk!
[ Walks out, leaving the company paralysed.
Mrs. C. Run after him, Tommy, and tell him-quiok ! [Exit Tommy.
Mr. C. (feebly). I think when Uncle Joseph does oome baok,
we'd better try to think of some game he can't lose his temper at.
Ah, here's Tommy!
Tommy. I told him—but he went all the same, and slammed the
door. He said I was to go baok and tell you that you would find he
was cut up—and cut up rough, too!
Mrs. C. But what did you tell him t
Tommy. Why, only that Parpar asked him to oome to-night
because he was sure to out up well. You said I might!
[Sensation; Prompt departure of Tommy for bed; moralising by
Aunts; a spirit of perfect candour prevails; names are called—
also cabs; further hostilities postponed till next Christmas.
Note-Paper Currency at Christmas.—We see that a "Ri-
parian" note-paper has been brought out by Messrs. Goodall and
Sow. This'' Riparian Paper "—rather suggestive of '' Rupee Paper"
—ought to be as safe as the Bank. "G. aitd Son" (this suggests

—as a hoy—a bathing-machine for my pleasure along the wild coast
line of the great Congo Continent) was greatly attracted by a hack
standing within the shafts of a cart
belonging to a funeral furnisher. Like
many of its class, the horse was jet
black, with a long flowing tail and a
mane to match. As I gazed upon the
creature the driver came out of the
shop (to which doleful establishment the
equipage belonged) and drove slowly
away. I felt forced to follow, and soon
found myself outside a knacker's yard.
Guessing the intention of the driver to
treat his steed as only fit for canine
food, I offered to purohase the seemingly
doomed animal. To my surprise, the
man expressed his willingness to treat
with me, and suggested that I might
have the carcase at the rate of is Hid.
a pound. Considering the prioe not
exoessive, I agreed, and, having weighed
the horse at an automat io weighing
machine, I handed over £100—in notes.
Then the first strange thing happened.
Before I could replace my pocket-book
in its reoeptable in my coat, the driver
had absolutely vanished! I could not
see him anywhere. I was the more
annoyed at this, as I found that (by mistake) 1 had given him notes
on the Bank of Eleganoe, which everyone knows are of less value
than notes on the Bank of England. However, it was too late to
search for the vendor, and I walked away as I could, leading by the
bridle the steed I had so recently acquired.
It was now necessary to get quarters for the night, but I found,
at that advanoed hour, that many of the
leading hotels were either full or unwilling
to supply me with a bedroom-and-stable-
combined until the morning. I was refused
firmly but civilly at the Grand, the Metro-
?ole, the Grosvenor, and the Fig and Whistle
avem, South East Hackney. At the latter
caravanserai, the night-porter (who was
busying himself cleaning the pewter pots)
suggested that I should go to Bath. Adopt-
ing this idea, I mounted my steed (which
answered, after a little practice, to the name
of ('ats '-meat.), and took the Old Kent Road
~ until I reached St. Albans.
Everything comes to him it was now morning, and the old abbey
who watts. stood out in grand outline against the
glorious scarlet of the setting sun. Entering an inn, I called for
refreshment for man and beast, and, having authority for consider-
ing myself qualified to act as representative of both, consumed
the double portion. Thinking about the whiskey I had just
discussed, as I rode along, I came to a milestone, standing on its


head, and a sign-post in the last stage of hopeless intoxication.
It was here that a police constable turned his lantern upon me with
a pertinacity that apparently was calculated to challenge observation.
Annoyed, but not altogether surprised, I declared my opinion that
it was "all right," and fell asleep. When I awoke, I found that
I had travelled some hundreds of miles, and, strange to say, my
horse was as good as when it had started. From what I could
gather from the signs on the road (I have been accustomed to
Forestry from my earliest childhood), it
seemed to me that, while I was slumber-
ing, I must have passed Macclesfield,
Ramsgate, Richmond (both in Surrey
and in Yorkshire), and was now olose to
the weirdest spot in all phantom-popu-
lated Wiltshire—a plaoe in its rugged
desolation suggestive of the Boundless
Prairies and Buffalo Bill — Wild-
W est bury! G reatly fatigued, I entered
a second inn, and enjoyed a hearty meal,
whioh was also a simple one. I am a
liquidarian, and take no animal or
vegetable food, and have not tasted fish
for nearly a quarter of a century.
When I wished to continue my
journey to Bath, I found Cats'-meat to
disinclined to move, that I thought the
beet thing to do in the interest of pro-
gress, was to carry him myself. He was
very light—so light that I imagined the
automatic weighing-machine must have
been out of order when I tested it.
Almost in a trance I walked along, until,
stumbling, I fell, and dropped Cats'-meat
into a well. And then another strange
thing happened. The horse with its jet-blaek tail and mane, emerged
from the water as white as snow! Apparently annoyed at the treat-
ment to whioh it had been accidentally subjected, it fled away, and
I lost sight of it amongst the hills that
overlook Wild-Westbury. And then
the strangest thing of all happened, and
has been happening ever since!
In dear weather, on the side of one of
these hills, Cats'-meat, in the habit as
he stood when he left the well on that
fatal day, may be seen patiently waiting
until the time shall arrive when he shall
receive a coat of blacking, a companion
steed to share with him his labours, and
a hearse! I am not the only person who
has seen him thus. The spectre (if it
be a spectre) is known for miles around,
and has been watched by thousands.
Nay, more. On occasions of great re-
joicing, when merry-making has been
the orcler of the day or night, several Interesting to the Medical Pro-
Cats'meat* have appeared to the oarous- The Annual Indl-
ing watchers strangely blended together. 8'
Speaking for myself, if I have seen one I have seen half-a-dozen—nay,
more—with hills to matoh! And those who do not believe me can
continue the journey I onoe oommenoed, and (after I have wished
them a Herry Christmas and a Happy New Year) proceed to—Bath!

FIGHTING THB FOG.
[A Seasonable Hint )
Sir,—I have read several letters in the papers oomplaining of the
fog, and asking not only how one is to protect the system from its
injurious effects, but also soliciting information as to how one is to
safeguard oneself against street accident, if obliged to quit the
premises during its prevalence. The first is simple enough. Get a
complete diver s suit, put it on, and let an attendant follow you
with a pumping apparatus, for the purpose of supplying you with
the fumes of hydro-bi-carbon (Dafh's solution) in a state of sus-
pension. This will considerably assist the breathing. To avoid
street accident, wear an electric (Swann) light, five hundred candle
power, on the top of your hat, round the brim of which, in oase of
accident, you have arranged a dozen lighted night-lights. Strap a
Duplex Rttlector on to your back, and fasten a Hansom cab-lamp
on to each knee. Let a couple of boys, bearing flaming links, and
beating dinner-gongs, clear the way for you, while you yourself
shout "Here comet the Bogie Man!" or any other appropriate
ditty, through a fog-horn, which you carry in one hand, while vou
spring a policeman's ancient rattle vigorously with the other. You
will, if thus provided, get along capitally. Be careful at orossings,
for your sudden appearance might possibly frighten an omnibus
horse or two, and cause trouble.
I haven't tried all this yet myself, but a friend of mine at Colney
Hatch assures me he has, and found it a great suooess. As I think,
therefore, it may prove a boon to your numerous readers, I place it
at your disposal with muoh pleasure, and have the honour to be. Sir,
Your obedient servant, A Cautious Cabd.

THE CHRISTMAS COLLEGE FAIRY.
Chapter I.—The Strange VMor.
On the evening of the 24th of December, 1874, the Senior Dean of
St. Michael's, the Reverend H enby Burbowes, was sitting in his com-
fortable rooms in the Great Court. He had, for reasons of his own, de-
i oided to spend the
S . v > •,1 ,' Christmas Vaca-
tion in Cam-
bridge. His
bed-maker, Mrs.
Joooins, had
entered a mild
protest, but it
had been una-
vailing. Mr.
Burbowes was a
man of forbid-
ding aspect and
of unbending
character. Dur-
ing the fire years
that he had held
his office, he had
enforced disci-
pline at the point
of the bayonet,
as it were, and
he boasted with
pardonable pride
that he had
broken the spirit
of the haughtiest
and least tractable of the Undergraduates. Everybody had been
gated at eight o'clock. Many had been sent down. Tears and
denunciations were alike unavailing. The ruthless Dean had pur-
sued his course without flinching. A very mild reading-man had at-
tempted his life by dropping a Liddell and Scott on to his head from
a first-floor room. This abandoned youth had been screened by his
comrades, and had ultimately escaped in spite of the efforts of the
justly incensed Dean.
It was nine o'clock. The bells at St. Mary's were ringing the
customary curfew. The Dean was seated before the fire in his
arm-ohair. An open book, a treatise on some abstruse question of
pure mathematics, lay on the table by his side. He was meditating
on his past exploits, and planning new punishments. But somehow
there was a strange sinking at his heart. What oould be the reason
of it? The dinner in hall had been of the usual moderate excellence,
he had only drunk a bottle and a half of claret. "Pshaw,'' he said,
"this is folly. I have not been severe enough. Conscience re-
proaches me. I am unmanned." He rose and paoed about the room.
At this moment his door opened, and the familiar figure of Mrs.
Joooins appeared.
"Beg your pardon, Sir," she said, hesitatingly, "I thought you
called." ——
"No, Mrs. Joggiks," said the Dean. "I did not call.
Are you not rather late in College f Is it usual for you
to stay "Here the Dean stopped abruptly. He rubbed
his eyes, and clung to his book-shelf for support. His
hair stood on end, and his knees shook. In fact he ex-
Srested terror in a thoroughly orthodox manner, for he
ad suddenly become aware that there was in the face of
Mrs. Jogoins a strange radiance, and that two gossamer
wings had suddenly appeared on her back in place of the
substantial shawl she was wont to wear. Mr. Burbowes
gazed * * * then consciousness forsook him.
assuming kindness; _ but time presses; we must hurry on. By virtue
of the power vested in me by the Queen of the Fairies, whose ambas-
sadress I am in Grantaford, I have summoned baok to St. Michael's
all the Undergraduates. You shall see them." In vain the miser-
able Dean protested that he had seen too muoh of them. The Fairy
Joosens was inexorable. She waved her wand, a yard of butter
congealed to the hardness of oak by the frosty morning, and in a
moment the Court was filled with Undergraduates. They were all
smoking, and suddenly the Dean became aware that he too had a
lighted cigar in his mouth, and was puffing at it. At the tame
moment he discovered that he was wearing a disgracefully battered
college-cap, and a brilliant "blazer," lately invented by a rowdy
set as the badge of their dining Club. He shuddered, but it was
useless. He put his hand in his coat-pocket. It contained a
bottle of champagne.
The Undergraduates now formed a procession and began to defile
past him. _ Smoking in the Court, half-a-crown," said one, in a
dreadful voice. "Mr. Burbowes irregular in his attendance at
Chapel, gated at eight." roared a second. "Mr. Burbowes persist
ently disorderly, sent down for the term," shouted a third; and then
they all began to caper round the hapless man whom the Fairy Queen
had betrayed into their power. They taunted him and reviled him.
"You have ruined our homes, poisoned our fathers' happiness, under-
mined the trusting confidence of our mothers. You have been a bad
man. You must perish!" and thus the dreadful chorus went on
while the Dean stood stupidly in the centre of the throng puffing
violently at one of the largest cigars ever seen in St. Michael s. At
last the Fairy waved her wand again, and in a moment the shouts
ceased and the orowd disappeared. "See," she said, "the result of
intemperate disciplinarian zeal!" But Mr. Burbowes neither heard
nor heeded. He had collapsed.
Chapter III.— Wide]Awake!
It was Christmas Morning. Mr. Burbowes was still sitting in his
chair before the fire-place, but the fire was out. He woke and
looked round. Mrs. Joeonrs had just come in, and was staring at
him in surprise.
"Lor, Sir," Bhe said, "what a turn you give me, sitting here in
your keepin -room. I never knew you to do sech a thing before as
sit up all night." But the Dean had fallen on his knees before her,
and was babbling out prayers for pardon and vows of reform.
Chapter IV.—A Christmas Morn.
Is the following term the whole system of College management
was changed. Mr. Bubbowks from a tyrant turned into the most
amiable of men. The Undergraduates became idyllic Even Dr.
Qoboias submitted to the benign influence of the Fairy Jog oiks.
But it is noticeable that Mr. Bubbowks who still resides at St.
Michael's, objeots to any mention of the Christmas of 1874. This is
the only exception to his universal amiability.
THE END.
"A Tot Toujours."—Old French motto for Truth distribution of
Toys at Christmas time.
Chapter II.—A Strange Story.
How long he lay he knew not When he came to him-
self it was broad daylight, and he was walking through
the Great Court hand in hand withjMrs. Jooenrs.
"See," she said, "there is Dr. Goroias," and sure
enough there stood the redoubtable Master in the oentre
of on* of the grass-plots in a bright red dressing-gown
and slippers, with an embroidered smoking-oap upon his
head. He was engaged in distributing crumbs to a con-
gregation of sparrows and thrushes and redbreasts.
'"Good morning, Burbowes," said the Master; "how's
your poor feet? Can you catch. One, two, three, heads 1"
and with that he flung the crust he held in his hand at
the astounded Dean, and landed him fairly on the right
cheek. Dr. Gorgias then executed a pirouette, kissed
his hand to Mrs. Joqoins, and disappeared into the
Master's lodge. "From this good man," said Mrs.'
Joeenrs to the Dean, "you may learn a lesson of un-

"Certainly, my dear Jack,"
said SCHEHEBAZABB.
Now Dinarzase did not like
this flippant tone of address.
He was, as has been reoorded
by Sn ahstra d (a gentleman of
whose patronage he is proud)
not a man you may take
liberties with. For Schehe-
razade, taking mean advan-
tage of a Freneh agglome-
ration of letters which did not
represent his name, to hail him
as " Jack" was oharaoteristio,
and therefore undesirable.
But, as everybody knows,
Dinabzade, at the approach
of each successive merning,
was obliged to make this appeal to his brother, in order to oiroumvent the
bloodthirsty designs of the Saltan (for particulars of which, see original). So
he dissembled his anger, and Scheherazade proceeded to tell the History of
the Seoond Old Man, and the Black Dog.
"Sire," he said, "whilst the Merchant and the First Old Man. who con-
ducted the hind, went their way, there arrived another Old Man, who led a black
dog, and who forthwith proceeded to relate his history. 'We were, you know,'
he remarked, leaning wearily on his staff, 'two brothers, this dog that you see.
and myself. In early life we were not tied by those bonds of affection that should
exist in family circles. In fact, on one occasion, I had to put my brother in
prison. He had not at that period assumed the four-footed condition in which
you now behold him. He walked about on two legs, like the rest of us, ate and
drank, made love, and made merry. After he had been in prison some time, suc-
cessful interposition was made on his behalf by a friend named Le Sieur O'Shay,
But that (as Kodtard Kipplino observes) is another story.
"' Some time after my brother oame to me and proposed to make a long journey
involving close business relations with him. I at first declined his proposition.
"Ton have been in business some time," I said to him, " and what have you
gained? Who is to assure me that I shall be more fortunate than you F"
'"In vain he encouraged me to stake my fortune with him, but he returned so
often to the charge that, having through six years constantly resisted his
solicitations, I at last yielded. I realised all my property, took my brother into
partnership, stocked our vessel exclusively with Home Rule goods, and set out
on our voyage.
"1 We arrived safely, did a great stroke of business with our wares, bought those
of the country, and set forth on our return voyage. Just,as we were ready
to re-embark I met on the seashore a lady, not at all bad looking, but very
meanly dressed. She approached me, kissed my hand, begged me to take her
for my wife, and conduct her to my home across the sea. This may seem to our
friend Jack Morlky a somewhat hasty proceeding. Jack is a philosopher, but
I am the Second Old Man, a mere child ef nature. _ I took her into Bond Street,
and bought her a new dress, and, having duly married her, we set sail. Perhaps
I should add that her maiden name was Ireland.
"' My brother and she got on very well at first, and he loudly professed to
share the esteem and (considering she was my wife I may say) affection with
which I regarded her. But suddenly a change oame over him. One night
whilst we slept he threw us overboard into the sea. My wife turned out to
be a fairy, and, as you may imagine, she was not born to be drowned. As
for me I was, so to speak, on my way to be as dead as a herring, when she
seized me and transported me to an isle. When it was
day the fairy said to me, "You see, my husband, that in
saving your life I have not badly recompensed you. I
am, as you doubtless begin to suspect, a fairy. Finding
myself on the seashore when you were about to embark,
I felt strongly drawn towards you. Desiring to prove
the goodness of your heart, I presented myself in the
disguise with whioh you are familiar. It was. I admit,
a trifle shabby. You have used me generously. I am
delighted to have found occasion to repay you; but as
for that brother of yours, I am death on him. I shall
never rest till I have taken his life."
'""I beg you to do no such thing," I said.
"' " I will sink his vessel and send him to the bottom
of the sea," she insisted.
"' After much endeavour I managed to appease her
wrath, and in the twinkling of an eye, before you could
say " Ali Baba!" she had transported me back to my
own house. On entering I found this black dog who
stared strangely at me.
"'" My husband," said the fairy " do not be surprised
to see this dog here; he is your brother. He has behaved
in a most shocking way towards you. He has maligned
you, misrepresented you, threatened you, even called
you a Grand Old Spider. I have condemned him to
remain in this state till you have concluded your little
transactions in Home Rule."
"' " But my dear 1 "I said.'"
At these words Schbkkbazade, remarking that it was
daybreak, ceased to pursue his narrative.

Christmas fiumbfr, 1890.
INTRODUCTION.
The Old Year was fast nearing its close, the night
was clear and starry, and Father Time, from the top of
his observatory tower, was taking a last look round.
To him entered, unannounced save by the staccato
yap of the faithful Tobias, Time's unfailing friend, un-
erring Mentor, and immortal contemporary, Mr. Punch.
"I am not for an age, hut for All Time," freely quoted
the Swan's sole parallel. "And very much at Time's

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.

service," he added, throwing opeu his fur-lined "Immensikoff," and.
lighting a cigar at the Scythe-bearer's lantern.
"Happy to meet you once more, Mr. Punch," responded old Edax
Rerun), turning from what the poet calls his 'Optic Tube' tc welcome
his sprightly visitor. "Awfully good of you to turn up just now.
Like True Thomas's TeufeltdrOckh, 'I am alone with the Stars,' and was
beginning to feel just a little bit lonely."
: "Wi.h the Voces Stellarum to keep you company? You surprise me,"
said Mr. Punch. "But what is all this? he added, pointing with
accustomed eye to a pile of MS. at Time's elbew.
! If so old a stager as Father Time can blush, he certainly did so on
this occasion.
j "Fact is, Mr. Punch," he rejoined, " I, like younger and shall I
Bay lesser Celebrities, have been writing my ' Reminiscences.' Ha ha!
The Chronicles of Chronos in 6,000 volumes or so—up to now. This
js a small portion of my Magnum Opus. Can you recommend me to a
publisher ]".
"Ask my friend Archdeacon Farrar," responded the Sage, drily.
"What a work! And what a sensation! Talleyrand's long-talked-of
1 Memoira' not in it! Do you know, my dear Time, 1 think you had
better postpone the publication—for an eeon or so a' east. Your Magnum
Opus might become a Scandalum Magnatum."
"Ah, perhaps so," replied Time, with a sigh.
"Alone with the Stars," pursued Mr. Punch, meditatively. "Humph!
The Solar System alone ought to provide you with plenty of company."
"Ye?" responded Time, "but, after all, you know, telescopic in-
tercourse is not entirely satisfactory. Like Edgar Poe's Hans P/aal,
I feel I should like to come to closer quarters with the 'heavenly
bodies as the pedagogues call them."
"And wh; not 1" queried Mr. Punch, coolly.
"As how?' asked his companion.
"Time, my boy' laughed the Sage, "you seem a bit behind yourself.
Listen !' Mr. Edison is prosecuting an experiment designed to catch
and record the sounds made in the sun's photosphere when solar spots
are formed by eruptions beneath the surface.' Have you not read the
latest of the Edisoniana?"
Time admitted he had tot
"XiiiEj you rogue, you lore to get
S'weets. upon your .list—put that in/'

y
quoted the Sage. "Some-
thing piquant for the 6001 st
Vol. of your Chronicles. But, after all, what is Edison
compared with Me? If you really wish for a tarn round
the Solar System, a peregrination of the Planets, put aside
that antiquated spy-glass of yours and come with Me!"
And, "taking Time by the forelock," in a very real sense,
the Sage of Fleet Street rose with him like a Brock rocket,
high, and swift, and light-compelling, into the star-spangled
vault of heaven.
"Sic itcr ad Astra '" said the Sage.
"Twinkle, twinkle, Fleet Street Star 1
Saturn wonders who you are,
Up above the world so high,

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.
VISIT TO SATURN.
"I am glad to hear that, at any rate,"
said Saturn, welcoming the illustrious guests
to his remote golden-ringed realm.
Saturn, however, did not look exactly
comfortable, and his voice, how unlike
"To that large utterance of the early god.-,''
sounded quavering and querulous.
"It is customary," said he, "to talk, ai
the old Romans rather confusedly did, of
'the Saturnian reign' as the true ' Golden
Age,' identified with civilisation, social
order, economic perfection, ami agricul-
tural profusion. As a matter of fact, I've
always been treated badly, from the day
when Jupiter dethroned me to that when
the Grand Old Man—who ought to have
had more sympathy with me—banished
hither the strife-engendering Pedant's
hotch potch called Political Economy."
'Be comforted, Saturn, old boy—I am
here !" cried Mr Punch. "I am ' person-
ally conducting' Father Time in a tour of
the Planets. Let's have a look round your
realm!"
Mr. Punch sums up much of what he
saw in modern " S.iUtruian Verses."
Punch. Good gracious! my worthy old
Ancient, who once held the sway of
the heavens,
Your realm seems a little bit shaky; what
mortals call "sixes and sevens "!
Saturn. That 'a scarcely god-lingo, my
boy; but 'tis much as you say, and no
wonder.
Free imports have ruined my realm—I refer to Bad-Temper and
Blunder,
Two brutish and boobyish Titans—they've wholly corrupted our
morals,
And taught us "Boycotting," and "Strikes," and "Lock-outs," and
all sorts of mad quarrels.
I hope you don't know them down there, in your queer little speck
of a planet,
These hum bugging latter-day Titans?
Punch. That cannot concern you—now can it?
Saturn. Just look at the shindy down yonder!
Punch. By Jove, what the
doose are they doing?
Saturn. Oh, settling the Great Social
Question!
Father Time. It looks as
though mischief were brewing.
Saturn. Sort of parody of the old
fight, which was splendid at
least, if tremendous,
'Twixt Jove and the Titans of old.
That colossus, gold-armoured,
stupendous,
Perched high on the "Privilege"
ramparts, and bastioned by big
bags of bullion,
Is "Capital"; he's the new Jove,
and each Titan would treat as
his scullion,
But look at the huge Hundred-
Handed One, armed with the
scythe and the sickle,

The hammer, the spade, and
the pick!
Father Time. Things
appear in no end of a
pickle!
Saturn. Precisely! That's
Labour-Briareus; backed up by "Bad Temper" and
"Blunder,"
And egged on by "Spout" (with a Fog-Horn); he's "going
for" him of the Thunder,
And Gold ramparts headlong, a outrance.
Punch. But look at the spectres behind them!
Saturn. Ah! Terrors from Tartarus, those to which only Bad
Temper can blind them.
Those spectres foreshadow grim fate; they are Lawlessness, Ruin,
Starvation;
To the Thunderer dismal defeat, to the conquerors blank desolation.
allegory, perhaps, but of a
"Saturn, old boy" said he,

Th Sage looked serious.
These things, mused he, are an
significance not wholly Saturnian.
"cannot what sentimentalists call
'the Dismal Science,' wLich as you
say has been banished hither, do
anything to help you out of this
hobble?"
"The Dismal Science," responded
Saturn, whose panaceas of Unre-
stricted Competition, Free Combi-
nation, Cheap Markets, Supply and
Demand, &c, have landed its dis-
ciples in Sweating Dens on the one
side and Universal Strikes on the
other, can hardly offer itself as a
cure for the New Socialism. Like
Rhea of old, when asked for food,
it proffeTs a stone."
"Ah!" quoth Father Time,
"you manage these things much
better on the Earth, doubtless."
"Doubtless," replied the Sage,
drily, as lie and Father Time took
their departure.

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.

VISIT TO MARS.
So Mr. Pcsch, holding Time
1 v the forelock, continued his
j ourney.
"Where are we now?" asked
the more elderly gentleman.
"My good friend," replied
the Sage of Fleet Street, "we
are approaching Mars, which
as you know, or should know
(if your education has been
completed under the super-
vision of the School Board)
sometimes called the Red
Planet."
"So I have often heard.
But why 1"
"That is what we shall soon
discover. But now keep quiet,
a3 we have arrived."
With the gentlest of gentle
shocks Mr. Punch and his
companion found them-
selves on a mound, which
they soon recognised as a
mountain. Looking below
them, they saw masses of
scarlet, apparently in mo-
tion. It was then that Time regretted that he had not brought
with him his telescope.
"It would have been so useful," he murmured, "and if a little
bulky, what of that I Surely Mr. Punch is accustomed to make
light of everything?"
"See, some one is approaching," observed the Sage of Fleet
Street, whose eyesight was better than that of his companion. And
sure enough a lively young ofiber at this moment put in an appear-
ance, and saluted.
"Glad to see you both," said he; "and, by order of the General
Commander-in-Chief, you are to make what use you please of me.
I am entirely at your service."
"Why, you speak English !" exclaimed Mr. Punch.
"That is so!" re-
turned the young officer
in American; "and
why not? Besides I
know French, Russian,
German, and all the
languages spoken on
your little globe, to say
noth. lg of the dialects
used by those who in-
habit the rest of the
planets. It's our sys-
tem. Nowadays, a man
in the Service is ex-
pected to be up in eve ry-
thing. If he wasn't,
how on earth could he
fight, or do anything
else in a satisfactory
fashion? And nov,' let
us bustle along."
"But first," pnt in
Time, who did not relish
being silent, "will you
kindly tell us what
those n.asses of colour
uel"


"C ertainly.
They are troops.
We put them in
scarlet in peace,
but they appear
in their shirt-
sleeves the moment
war 's declared.
Novel idea, isn't
it?"
And then the
pleasant - spoken
young officer led
the way to a lift,
and, touching a
button, the three
descended from
the top of the
mountain to the
valley beneath.
"On the coun-
terweight system,"
explained the
A.D.C. "We
cribbed the idea from Folkestone, and Lynmouth. And here, Mr.
Punch, is something that will interest you. We absolutely howled
at that sketch of yours showing the mechanical policeman. Don't
you know—old woman puts a penny in the slot and stops the
traffic? And here's the idea developed. See that mechanical
sentry. I put a penny in the slot, and he pays me the usual
compliment. He shoulders arms, as I am only a captain—worse
luck! If I were of field rank he would come smartly t» the
present."
And sure enough the mechanical soldier saluted.
"It's not half a bad idea," continued the agreeable A.D.C.
"You see sentry-go is awfully unpopular, and a figure of iron in
limes of peace is every bit as good as a man of brass. The pence
go to the Canteen Fund along with the fines for drunkenness. It
seems reasonable enough that a fellow, if he wants to be saluted,
should pay for the swagger. If a fellow likes to turn out the
guard, he can do it with
sixpence—but then of
course he hasn't the
right unless his rank
permits it—see?"
By this time the me-
chanical soldier had re-
turned to the slope, and
was parading his beat in
a somewhat jerky man-
ner.
"And now what would
you fellows like to do 1"
asked the A.D.C. "Par-
don the familiarity, but
nowadays age doesn't
count, does it? Every-
body's young. One of
the best Juliets I ever
knew had turned sixty,
and played to a Pomeo
who was twenty years
her senior. Nothing like
that down below, I sup-
pose?"
"Nothing," returned
Mr. Punch.

"So I have always understood. Well, where shall we go first!" j "You'll have to fall In next, and Tommy will inspect you, and give
"Anywhere you like," said the Sage of Fleet Street. "But are you a couple of days' extra drill for not having cleaned your rifle!"

"Not at all—only too delighted. It's all in the day's work, punishment ; and, after all, it will only he a case of turn and turn
about," was the re-
ply. Then the
A.D.C. added,
"Hang me, too, I
believe, with all we
fellows have to do
nowadays, that if
we did change with
Tommy Atkins, we,
and not he, would
have the best of the
bargain!"
Leaving the Sol-
diers' Club, Mr.
Punch and Father
Time continued their
journey. They had
not proceeded far,
when the A.D.C.
invited them to enter
a building known as
the Museum.
"It really is a
most useful and inte-
resting institution,"
said the officer of the
Planet Mars. "Here,
you see, we have
portrait models of

We have a lot of
distinguished visi-
tors that we have to
take round. I like
it myself, but some
of our fellows kick
against it. Of course
it doesn't refer to
you two; but you
can fancy what a
nuisance it must be
for all our fellows
to have to get up in
full rig,and bow and
scrape, and march
and countermarch,
an.l go through the
whole bag of tricks,
to some third-rate
Royalty? Ah! they
are happier off at
Aldershot, aren't
they 1"
"No doubt," was
the prompt reply.
Mr. Punch and
Father Time had
now entered a bar-
rack square, wherein
a number of trembling recruits were standing in front of a sergeant.
"I am just putting them through their paces, Sir," said he:
"they are a bit rusty in bowing drill."
The A.D.C. nodded, and, turning on his heel, explained to the
visitors that it was the object of the Authorities to introduce as
much as possible of the civil element into the Army.
"You will see this idea carried out a liUle further in the institu-
tion we are now entering," he added, .'is the three walked into a
building that looked like a har.d o:ne Club-house. At the door
was an officer in the uniform of the Guards.
"Hullo, Hoghie," said the A.D.C, "on duty to-day?"
"As hall-porter. Charlie is smoking-room waiter. I say, do
you want to take your friends round I"
"Well, I should like to let them get a glimpse of Tommy Atkins
at his ease."
"All right, you ran pass. But, I say, just warn them to keep
quiet when they get near him. We have had no end of a time to
smooth him down."
Thus warned, the Sage and Father Time
passed through the hall and entered the smok-
ing-room. Stretched at full length on a couple
of chairs was a Private, lazily sipping a glass
of brandy and soda-water, that had just been
supplied to him by an officer of his
own battalion. On withdrawing,
the A.D.C. greeted the commis-
sioned waiter who answered to the
name of Charlie.
"Rather rough, eh?" said he,
with a glance at a tray containing a cork-screw and an empty
bottle.
"A bit better than Bermuda. If we don't coerce them, we must
be polite. After all, fagging turned out the heroes of Winchester
and Westminster, and wasn't Waterloo won on the playing-fields of
Eton?"
"Rather a dangerous game, isn't it?" observed Mr. Puncli.

the officer of the past and present. In the past, you will notice,
he sacrificed everything to athletic sports—if he could fence,
shoot, hunt, and play cricket, polo, and football, he was quite satis-
fied. His successor of to-day devotes all his time to study. He
must master the higher branches of mathematics before he is con-
sidered fit to inspect the rear-rank of a company, and know the
modern languages before he can be entrusted with the command of
a left half-battalion. Here again we have the uniform of an officer
in peace and war—swagger and gold lace on the one side, and stern
simplicity and kharki on the other."
In another room Mr. Punch and Father Time discovered
that everyone was fast asleep. There was a Cabinet Minister sup-
ported by two minor officials—all three of them absolutely uncon-
scious. There were any number of Generals decorated from belt
to neck—any quantity of higher-grade clerks—one and all slum-
bering !" This is culled the Intelligence Department of the Army,"
explained the A.D.C. "You have nothing like it in England 1"
"Nothing !" returned Mr. Punch, as he disappeared.

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.

VISIT TO MERCURY.
Mr. Punch and Father Time were once again
whirling on their way through boundless space.
They were approaching their next destination,
and the dark globe of the planet had just come
into view on the horizon. Rapidly it increased in
size as they neared it, and the seas and continents
could be easily traced.
"Dear me ?" exclaimed Mr. Pmich. "Why, I
declare if there is not something written upon it!"
and he put up his binoculars, " Why, it is nothing
more nor less than a big advertisement. Looks
like humbug," he continued. "What's the name
of the Planet, eh?"
"Mercury," replied Father Time, with cheery
spirit; "and with that device they try to catch
the eye of a passing Comet."
"Hum—they won't catch me!" observed the
Sage, brightly. "I brought my truth-compeller
with me—a little, patent, electrical hypnotic
arrangement, in the shape of this ring"—he
showed it as he spoke. "I have Otuy to tum it
on my finger, and it obliges anyone who may be
addressing me instantly to speak the truth."
They suddenly found themselves deposited in
the centre of a vast square, surrounded by large
palatial-looking buildings, public offices, stores,
shops, picture-galleries, gigantic blocks of private
residences, in flats five-and-twenty storeys high, and
other architectural developments of the latest con-
structive crazes, fashioned, apparently, after the
same models, and on similar lines, to those at
present so much in vogue in that now distant
planet, the Earth. There was a profusion of
advertisement-boards, these, in many instances,
entirely covering the whole facade of the building
with large-lettered announcements of the nature
of the trade or business conducted within. An eager and excited crowd thronging the pavements, and hustling each other, without
any apparent purpose or aim, was pushing in nil directions.
"I wonder what all this is about," observed Mr. Punch • "suppose we ask a Policeman 1"
They noticed a being attired in every respect like the familiar guardians of the peace on Earth, except that he carried a harmless
and gaily-decked bladder in place of the more serviceable bdton, and beckoned to him. He approached with polite alacrity.
"You want to know what 'a up, Gents 3" he commenced, divining their purpose instinctively. "It's the Half-Quarterly Meeting
of the Solid Gold Extract of Brick-Dust Company. There's been some little talk about the dividend not being quite so good as the
prospectus led the shareholders to believe, and as the shares have been mostly taksn up by widows and orphans, some of their friends,
you see, are a little anxious to hear the Chairman's Report. But, you see, it '11 be all right."
At this moment a widow, with blanched cheeks and dishevelled hair, who had been listening with an anxious and eager gaze to
what the Policeman had been saying, joined the group.
Mr. Punch looked at her with mournful sympathy, and slowly turning the ring on his finger, addressed the Policeman.
"Tell me, my good man," he said, persuasively, "is that the truth? Is it really all right f"
"All right!" rejoined the guardian of the peace in amazement, but apparently unconscious of the purport of his speech, " I should
rather think not. Call it 'all wrong' and then you '11 about hit it. Why it's well known that the patent's all fudge. It's the
biggest swindle out. No more in it than in this here bladder. But you'll see; the whole thing's burst, and you'll know it in a
minute."
The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a roar of a thousand angry voices, followed by a sudden rush from the building
ot a mad and raging crowd, obliged Mr. Punch, for a moment, to pause. When the uproar had somewhat subsided, he turned to the
Policeman, and pointed feelingly to the unfortunate widow, who had fallen on to an apple-stall in a fit of hysterics, and, locKing his
arm in that of his aged companion, proceeded to cross the square. "Give us a song, old 'un ''' shouted a portion of the mob, who had
followed them.
"Certainly. Oblige them :" added Mr Punch, taking a banjo from one of the crowd and placing it in Father Time's hands.
"Give them a stanza of the Ballad of Truth." '*'
He turned his ring, and his aged companion struck up the lollowing ditty :— >
"Know ye the land where dwells only mock-turtle,
Where wine that should gladden but makes you fell queer.
Where bayonets bend, where guns burst and hurtle
Their breech in the face of their friends at the rear,
Where lamps labelled 1 safety ' with just terrors fill you,
Where water supplied you for milk is no theft,
Where pills that should cure, if persisbed in, kill you
And the 'Hair Resurrector' takes all you've got left!
Where soap, that should soften your skin, only flays you,
Where a horse proves a screw though got through a friend,
Where the loss of your 'cover 'confoumds and dismays you,
Though assured by the Firm 'if yon bold on t'will mend '?

Time up tbe front steps, and ushered them into a large hall. It was thr.
of dirty and raggedly-dressed people, and partitioned off by a handsome anil
counter, beyond which sat a staff of clerks busily engaged in keeping the
discharging the duties of the institution.
"Ha, Mrs. MacStoggixs, and are we in your debt again?" asked the
browed woman of a sinister and forbidding expression, who was thrusting
counter to the cashier.
"Yes; and I '11 trouble you not to keep me waiting,
cither—seeing that it's gone three days since the burial."
"Is this woman demanding the insurance money f ,r the
burial of her own child f" asked Mr. Punch, 6temly. And
he turned his ring. "And pray, Madam," he continued,
addressing the beetle-browed woman, "tell me the truth."
"Certainly," replied the woman, as if in a trance. "First,
I insured my own Kate—then I starved her to death, and
took the money. Then little Bill followed. I let him
catch cold in the winter, and gave him a night or two
on the stones, and that finished him. Then came Tim
Flaherty, and I managed him with the beetle-poison,
and"
"Come," said Mr. Punch, taking Father Time's arm once
more, "let us get out of this—I can't breathe here."
Scarcely had they (putted the place ere they had to
encounter an appeal for custom, the applicant being ap-
parently one of the big guns in the Mercury wine trade,
and he was not long in importuning Mr. Punch just to
step inside his office, and sample a delicious Lafittc of the
1874 vintage.
"Now, try that, Sir," be said, at the same time offering
Mr. Punch a glass of the rich ruby-coloured beverage, "and
tell me what you think of it. We have a small parcel of it
still left, and could let you have it at the remarkably low-
figure of 112s. the doan."
"Ii, looks all right," drily replied Mr. Punch, "but I
can't think how you can sell it at the price." Then holding
Know ye, in fine, where by pushing and 'rushing,'
This—and much more, down the public throat crams,
Blatant Advertisement, brazen, unblushing?
If you do, then you've spotted the Planet of Shams."
Though a few paving-stones were hurled at the aged
singer, the conclusion of his song was greeted by 0
general roar of laughter, the populace apparently
recognising the picture of their own chicanery with
amusement and relish.
After that they held on their way for some
minutes in silence. They had now reached the
other side, and were confronted by a couple of
respectable - looking gentlemen of an almost
clerical aspect, who appeared to be catering in
the public streets in the interests of some insti-
tution. They approached Mr. Punch and Father
Time, and offered them a prospectus.
"' The dear Little Children's Happy
and Elegant Burial Institution,' read Mr.
Punch, surveying tbe paper presented to him,
and continuing, " 'A trivial payment of Ninepence
a Month Kill ensure the youthful Subscriber, or
his Representative, a sweet and elegantly construc-
ted little Coffin, beautifully frilled, with a one-
llack-horse Family Omnibus Hearse, and a tray of
Two Handsome Plumes. K.B.—if preferred,

up the glass critically, and turning liis ring, lie
continued, " How do you manage it?"
"How do I manage it 1" replied the unconscious
merchant, laughing heartily at the apparent joke.
"Why, my dear Sir, there's not much difficulty
about that. I just make it myself. Listen to my
receipt:—
"Potato spirit—that the ' body ' finds;
And then, as for colour,
Be it brighter or duller,
You see I am supplied with several kinds,
And as to flavour, I get that desired,
By adding various poisons as required.
Ha! ha! Let me send you in a few dozen." He
offered Mr. Punch an elaborate price-list as he con-
cltided his self-condemnatory verse with an ob-
sequious bow.
"Come," said Mr. Punch, once more taking
hold of his aged companion's arm, without con-
descending to give the cheating tradesman any
reply, "come—let us get out of this. 'Pon my
word, I think we've almost had enough of
Mercury!"
"Their morality does seem to have reached
rather a low ebb, I must confess," replied Father
TllIE.
"Nothing like this on our Earth, anyhow,"
continued Mr. Punch, with a satisfied sigh of relief.
But come, we '11 hear what the whole people say
of themselves. See here's
"Capital! Capital!" cried Mr. Punch,
H|||i J approrching the throng. "We'11 have that
II' again." He turned his ring once more as he
j^uj i spoke, and the mob responded by shouting

a chance. I believe
there's a lot of them
over th re singing their
National Anthem."
They listened as Mr.
Punch spoke. He was
right. There was a
vast crowd collected
outside one of the principal buildings
<m the other side of the square, and
they were clearly finishing some popu-
lar anthem in chorus, for, as Father
Time and Mr. Punch paused to lbten,
the well-known familiar refrain—
"Never, never, never,
Shall be slaves!"
smote their car.

'• Fool! Mercurius!
Of greed thy sons are slaves;
And they ever, ever, ever—
Shall be knaves!"
"Come," cried Mr. Punch, " I think that judgment of themselves
out of their own mouths settles the matter! I have done with
them. Come, let us seek some healthier place. L'p we go!"
He seized hold of Old Father Time as he spoke, and bounded with
him upwards suddenly into space. In another minute they were
in search of a brighter, a better, and a truer world.

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.
VISIT TO JUPITER.
Father Time with his glorious guide dropped gently down.
They found themselves in the centre of a bare expanse of dry,
grassy country, broken here and there by sand-hills. On their
right was the sea, dotted with ships. Parties of men in red
coats, and carrying in their hands curiously-shaped sticks, were
walking about in all directions. They all looked very earnest,
some of them were gloomy, some positively furious. Occasionally
they stopped, placed themselves in an uncouth straddle-legged
attitude, whirled their sticks, looked eagerly towards the horizon,
and then marched on again as solemnly as before. One party in
particular attracted the attention of Either Time. It was a large,
mixed gathering of men, and women, and children. They all
moved or stood at a respectful distance from the central figure, a
benevolent-looking gentle-
man, with a flowing white
beard. He too wore a red
coat, and carried a stick.
A crowd of attendants
bearing more sticks fol-
lowed him.
"Let me explain," said
the Arch-Provider of Mer-
riment to his companion,
"this ground is known as
Links; the game of'Golf'
is being played. These
gentlemen are golfers. The
sticks they carry arc called
clubs. That bearded old
gentleman is the King of
Jupiter, Foozler the
Fifth. He is playing his
morning round. I will
introduce you."
So saying, the King of
all Clubs advanced with
the Scythe-holder, and,
taking advantage of a
moment when King Fuoz-
lek, having made a long
shot, was in good humour,
rapidly effected the neces-
sary presentation.
'• I know this game
well," said Mr. Punch.
"It is said to be much
played in my own country
now. Permit me to have the honour of playing one hole against
your Majesty."
The King smiled a gracious arscnt. HU ball had been already
placed for him on a little heap of sand about an inch high. He
advanced towards it, anxiously measured his distance, waved his
club to and fro over his ball as if in blessing, and then, swinging it
through the air, struck—nothing. The ball remained unmoved.
"He's missit the globe," muttered one of the attendants; "I 'vc
aye tellt him to keep his eye furrmer on the ball."
Four times His Majesty, whose good humour was now entirely
gone, repeated the operation with similar results. At last he hurled
his club to the ground, breaking it into splinters, and addressed his
immovable ball in strung terms.
''Allow me, Your Majesty," said Mr. Punch, as he stepped airily
forward and selected the king's best driver from the heap of clubs
carried by the chief caddie, " I think 1 know how this ought to be
done," and without a moment's hesitation he delivered his stroke.
The ball Hew true and far until it was merely a speck in the air, and
finally dropped down about a quarter of a mile away. "You will
find it in the hole," said the Golfer of Golfer;, carele=slv turning to
the discomfited King; "Oh, my Royal and Ancient One," he con-
tinued, " there are certain things we do better in another country,
and Golf is one of them."
But at this moment a great commotion arose. A messenger on a
foaming steed dashed up, and handed a despatch to the king, who
at once read it.
"Dear me!" said His Majesty, "this is most annoying. The
Emperor of Barataria is to arrive in half an hour. He's a bit of a
young prig, and borc3 me dreadfully—but we must meet him."
With that he retired at once to the nearest palace, to change his
uniform. In about ten minutes he came forth a changed man.
On his head glittered an immense helmet, with a waving plume; a
tunic of gold lace was buttoned tightly round his chest. Row
upon row of stars and medals encircled hi:n like so many belts; his
legs were hidden in an enormous pair of jack-boots, to which were
fixed a pair of huge Mexi-
can spurs. An immense
sword dangled at his side.
"This," said the King,
as he motioned Mr. Punch
and Father Time into his
ttate carriage, and vaulted
in after them with as
much agility as his sword
and boots would permit,
"is the uniform of the
Baratarian Die-hauls, of
which regiment I am
honorary Colonel."
Thus they drove to the
balloon station, at which
the Imperial guest waa
expected. After a few
minutes, a sound of cheir-
ing was heard.
"He's com-
ing," observed
the King.
"Have I got
my kissing face
on" I''
Mr. Punch
reassured him. A moment afterwards
the state-balloon of Barataria soared
up to the platform, and a young man,
gorgeously attired in the uniform of the
Tenth (Jupiter's Own) Lancers, sprang
lightly from it.
Loud pealed the loyal anthem, and rattled all the drums,
And, as the guard presented, the cry went up, " He comes!"
He steps upon the platform, and, while the plaudits ring,
A King hangs round an Emperor's neck, an Emperor hugs a King;
And, with impartial kisses on both cheeks duly pressed,
The guest does homage to his host, the host salutes his guest.
The Emperor then, having shaken Mr. Punch warmly by the
hand, departed with his royal host. After this, the three poten-
tates, Punch the Only, Foozler the Fifth, and the Baratarian
Emperor, called upon one another at intervals of half an hour.
This process occupied the afternoon.
For the evening a state-ball at the Royal Palace had been
announced. Thither, at the appointed hour, Mr. Punch and his
hoary associate were conveyed. As they approached, the royal baud
struck up a martial air, the Lord Chamberlain advanced to meet
them, and ushered them into the magnificent hall in which the
guests were assembling. From this a wide double staircase led up
to a marble gallery. Hall, gallery, and staircase were filled with a
brilliant crowd : the men arrayed in even- variety of uniform; the

"A dress-maker," answered the Master, calmly.
"In her shop, ancient notions forsaking,
The proud Angelina unbends;
And her figure's a tall one for making
A fit for the figures of friends.
Our cynical latter-day Catos
Are dumb when invited to dine
With a Marquis who deals in potatoes,
Or an Earl who takes oulers for wine.
And, though old-fashioned folk think it funny,
It's as common as death, or as debts,
To find gentlemen making their money
Out of shops for the making of bets.
The stout puffy old fellow there is the wealthiest man in Jupiter.
He floats mines, asteroid mines mostly, and makes it pay him.
He can command the very best society. Those ladies clustering
round the Prince-Royal come from over the ocean. Pretty, but
twangy. A fresh consignment arrives every year. And the
Prince-Royal has the pick of them."
But before Mr. Punch could finish his explanatory sketch, a
tremendous uproar was heard in the court-yard of the Palace.
There was a sound as of a huge mob shouting in unison, shots
were heard, and cries of " Liberty for Ever !" rent the air. The
royal guests were in a state of teriible agitation. An orderly
covered with mud forced his way through the crowd, up the
stairs, and stood before the King.
"Your Majesty," he panted, "a revolution has broken out.
The populace has erected barricades, the deposition of your
House has been declared, and a Republic proclaimed. The mob
is now marching to the Palace."
The King drew himself up to his full height. Where are
my Golf-clubs? he asked in a calm voice.
"Your Majesty, they have been seized and secreted."
"Then all is lost. It only remains for me to depart," was
the King's heart-

VISIT TO URANUS.
The next place that the distinguished travellers visited was Uranus,
where Mr, Punch and his companion were much surprised to find the
entire population members of the legal profession.
"I have really no time to attend to you," said one of the inhabitant-:,
when (jucr-
rijHW jioned. "I

you noticed that the entire population is concerned in one vast Chancery
suit; consequently, on attaining majority, one man becomes a judge,
another a barrister, n third a solicitor, and so on, and so on. Why,
the place would be a perfect Paradise to your friend Mr. A. Briefless
Jl'NlOB! It is, at this time of day, to the interest of no one that
litigation should cease, and so the Chancery suit, in which we are
all concerned, is likely to go on for ever."
"But surely litigation is expensive?" suggested Mr. Punch.
"I should mther think it was," returned the wig-wearer. "The
Law is a noble profession, and it is only right and proper that those
who indulge in it should pay for it. In the present instance 0111
entire estate will be absolutely exhausted."
"But how will you all live?"
"On the costs!" was the reply, as the Inhabitant of Urami:
hurried away to attend his appointment.
"Lawyers keeping a suit alive to live upon the costs!" exclaimec
Mr. Punch, in tones of pained astonishment. "I never heard the
like!"
And, horrified and sorrowful, he seized Father Time by the forelock
and once more floated into space.

VISIT TO CASTOR.
Father Time shivered, and wrapped his ancient cloak more closely about him.
"Come, come," said Mr. Punch, "I understand your disgust. But there is still something left to us in which we may
t:ike pleasure. Upon a neighbouring star the people delight in horses. All day long they bestride them with a courage
Swift as the wind arc the steed?, and for me:e honour and glory are they matched one against the other,
and from all parts of the star the populace is gathered together in its hundreds of
thousands to applaud and to crown them that ride the victors in the races. Let us
fare thither, for the sport is splendid, and we shall there forget the pain we have
suffered here. Indeed, it is but a shoit flight to Castor."
Thus speaking, he seized the Father by his lock, and floated with him into
space. The roar of the Politician streets grew fainter and fainter, the
lights twinkled dimly, until at length they disappeared. Then gradually
the land loomed up above them out of a bank of clouds, and in another
moment the wandering pair stood once more on stellc Jtrma.
They had alighted on an immense grassy plain, which stretched away
in every direction, as far as the eye could reach. On every side were to
be seen men and women and children, mounted on horses. To their
right a band of youths, arrayed in coloured shirts, white linen breeches,
and yellow boots, and wearing little coloured caps, jauntily set upon their
heads, were careering wildly hither and thither on swift and wiry ponies.
They were wav-
ing in the air
long sticks, fit-
ted with a cross
block of wood
at the end, and
were pursuing
a wooden ball.
Many were the
collisions, the crashes, and the falls. , On every side men and ponies rolled over in the dust; but they
rose, shook themselves as though nothing had happened, and dashed again into the fray. Father Time
shouted with enthusiasm.
"Yes," said the Sage, "you do well to cheer them. They are gallant youngsters these. The game they
play U ' Polo,' and though the expense be great, the contempt of danger and pain is also great. They play it
well, but I doubt not we could match them at Hurlingham. But see," he added, "on our left. What rabble
is that?" As he spoke a panting deer flew past them hard pressed by a pack of yelping hounds. Close behind
came a mob of riders, two or three of them glittering in scarlet and gold, the rest in every variety of riding-dress.
"Behold," said the Arch-philosopher, "a Royal Sport. These are the Castorian Buck-hounds; that elder
gentleman is their master. They pay him £1500 a-year to provide sport for Cockneys. The spoit consists in
letting a deer out of a cart and chasing him till he nearly dies of fatigue.
Then they rope him and replace him in the cart. After that they all drain
their flasks, and consider themselves sportsmen. Poor stuff, I think."
"Of course," said the Father, " you have nothing of that sort in England."
Mr. Punch was about to reply when a
well-appointed four-in-hand drove up, and a
courteous gentleman who handled the rib-
bons, offered the two strangers seats.
"I will take you," he re-
marked, " to our great national
race-meeting. I assure you it
is well worth seeing."
The offer was accepted. A
leasant drive brought them to
the race-course.
To tell the
truth it was much like most other race-courses. A huge crowd was
assembled, and the din of roaring thousands filled the air. As they drove
up a race had just started, and it was pretty to see the flash of the coloured
raps and jackets in the sun. The horses came nearer and nearer. As
they rounded the bend which led into the straight run in, the excitement
iiecame almost too great for Father Time. A torrent of sporting phrases
iiroke from his lips. One after another he backed every horse on the

"That's just it," broke in the owner
of the coach; "the public thought so too,
anl they've lost their money."
"Jmt look at the mob," he continued, "crowding round the
jockey and the owner. 'Gad, I shouldn't care to be hooted like
that. But, of course, they've made their pile on it; never intended
him to win. Just sent him out for an airing. Pretty bit of
roping, wasn't it /" he continued, addressing Mr. Punch.
But the Sportsman of Sportsmen only frowned.
"In the land we come from," he rejoined, "the sport of racing
is pure, and only the most high-minded men take part in it.
Their desire is not to make money, but merely to improve the
breed of British horses. I grieve to find that here the ca3e is
otherwise. Reform the Sport, Sir; reform it, and make it worthy
of Castorian gentlemen."
His newly-found friend only smiled.
Then he winked as he hummed to himself the words of a song,
which ran something like this :—
"Come, sportsmen all, give ear to me, I '11 tell you what occurred,
But of course you won't repeat it when I've told you;
For with honourable gentlemen I hope that mum's the word,
When a hoiss you've laid your money on has sold you.
I presume you lost your shekels, and you think it rather low,
Since you 're none of you as rich as Nonin or Barixo.
But another time you '11 get them back by being 'in the know,'
When a favourite is started for an airing.
"That's an odd sort of song," said Mr. Punch.
"Not so odd as the subject," replied the singer. "But you have
only heard the first verse ; wait till you know the second."
"1 But they didn't tell the public ; it 'a a precious, jolly shame ;'
(Such behaviour to the public seems to shock it)—
Now if you'd been placed behind the scenes you wouldn't think the
same,
But put principles and winnings in your pocket.
A jent who owns a stable doesn't always think of you,
And he doesn't seem to fancy profit-sharing.
And you really shouldn't curse him when he manages a ' do.'
With a favourite who's only on an airing."
Before the singer could proceed any farther, a frightful
hubbub arose. A pale, gasping wretch, rushed past, pursued by n
howling, cursing mob of ruffians. As he fled, he tripped, and fell,
and in n moment they vec on the top of him, buffeting, and
beating the very life out of him.
"That's murder," said Mr. Punch. "Where are the police I"
And he was on the point of stepping down, to render assistance,
when his friend laid a hand upon his arm.
"Oh, thut 'a only a welshcr," he said; "he 'a bolting with
other people's money."
"Is it the owner of the chestnut?" inquired Father Time.
"Bless your heart, no," was the reply. "It '3 only a low-class
cheat. The ow ner of the chestnut is"
But Mr. Punch had no w ish to hear or see more.
He took Time's arm, and together they lloated away into space,
to land shortly afterwards in another sphere.
VISIT TO POLLUX.
The street in which they had descended was situated in the
heart of a great city. The roar of traffic sounded in their ears
from the larger thoroughfares close by. Most of the houses were
small and mean—a remarkable contrast to one large building,
brilliantly lighted, in front of which a mob was gathered together.
A more ruffianly-looking assemblage it would have been hard to
discover. The rest of the street was filled with hansoms, the long
line of which was constantly being augmented by fresh arrivals,
whose occupants sprang out and swiftly mounted a flight of steps
leading up to the entrance of the large building mentioned, and
passed through swing-doors of glass, which gave admission to a
broad passage. In front of this house the Sage paused, and
addressed his companion.
"Venerable One," he said, for he had become aware of a re-
luctance on the part of the Lord of the Hour-Glass, "have no fear.
We are now, as you know, in the metropolis of Pollux. This is
the country of the ni£ dyaBos, the home of the noble boxer; and
this," he added, pointing to the glittering palace, "is the head-
quarters, I am informed, of the boxer's ait. Let us enter, so that
I may show you how the game should really be played. I like not
the crowd without. Within we shall see something very different."
So saying, he linked his arm in that of the Paternal One, and
together they ascended the stairs. At the top stood an official
dressed in a dark uniform, his breast adorned with medals.
"I beg your pardon, Gentlemen," said the minion to the pair,
"are you Members i"
Mr. Punch vouchsafed no answer. He looked at the man, who
quailed under the eagle glance, and, muttering a hasty apology,
drew back. A door flew open; the Champion of Champions and
his friend passed through it. They found themselves in a spacious
hall. In the centre a square had been roped off. All round were
arranged seats and benches. In the square were four men, two of
them stripped to the waist sitting in chairs in opposite comer3,
while the two others were busily engaged in fanning them with
towels. The seats and benches were all occupied by a very motley
throng.
"Aha," said Mr. Punch, as lie made his way to the throne
reserved fur him, "this is good. I have done a little bit of fight-
ing myself in my time. My mill with the Tutbury Boy is still
remembered. One hundred and twenty rounds, at the end of
which I dropped him senseless. But that was with the knuckles.
Here they fight with glovts. But of course they fight now for the
mere honour of the thing, I presume."
But here the heroic Muse insists on taking up the strain :—
The Father spake—" 0 skilled in men and books,
Read me this crow d, inspect them, scan their looks;
See, from their shining heads electric rays,
.Reflected, sparkle in their barbers' praise.
Lo, on each bulging front's expansive white
A single jewel flames with central light;
To vacant eyes the haughty eye glass clings,
Stiff stand their collars, though their ties have wings.

A Path or Spectacles.

What of their faces? Bloodshot eyes that Wink,
And thick lips, framed for blasphemy and drink.
Here the grey hair, that should adorn the Sage,
Serves hut to mark a weak, unhonoured age;
There on t he hoy pale cheeks proclaim the truth,
The faded emblems of a wasted youth.
All, all are loathsome in this motley crew.
The Peer, the Snob, the Gentile, and the Jew,
Young men and old, the greybeards and the boys,
These dull professors of debauch and noise."
lie ceased. The Wise One gazed in silent gloom,
While oaths and uproar hurtled through the room—
"Hi, there, a monkey on the Pollux Pet;"
"Fifty to forty ;" " Blank your eyes, no bet;"
"A level thousand on the Castor Chick ;"
"Brandy for two, and, curse you, bring it quick."
While one who spake to Punch rapped out an oath—
"Who cares i" he said, " I stand to win on both.
Fair play be blowed, that's all a pack of lies,
Let fools fight fair, while these cut up the prize.
Old Cock, you needn't frown; I'm in the know,
And if you don't like barneys, dash it, go!"
One blow from Punch had quelled th' audacious man,
He raised his hand, when, lo, the fight began.
"Time! time!" called one; the cornered ruffians rose,
Sl-.ook hands, squared up, then swift' they rained in blow?
Feint follows feint, and whacks on whacks succeed,
Struck lips grow puffy, battered eye-brows bleed.
From simultaneous counters heads rebound,
And ruby drsps are scattered on the ground.
Abraded foreheads flushing show the raw,
And fistic showers clatter on the jaw.
* * * '. *
Now on "the mark" impinge the massive hands,
Now on the kissing-trap a crasher lands.
Blood-dripping noses lose their sense pj' ^mell, ,
And ribs are roasted that a crowd may" yell.'
Each round the other's neck the champions cling,
Then break away, and stagger round the ring.
Now panting Pollux fails, his fists move slow,
He trips, the Chicken plants a smashing blow.
The native "pug" lies spent upon the floor,
Lies for ten seconds,— and the fight is o'er.
*****
Thunders of cheering hail th' expected end,
High in the air ecstatic hats ascend.
While frenzied peers and joyous bookies drain
Promiscuous bumpers of the Club champagne.
But Mr. Punch had seen enough.

'• Do you call this one-round job a fight?" he said, as he rose to
depart. "I call it the work of curs and cowards. Who ctn call these
fellows lighting-men f They are merely mop-sticks. Men were
ruffianly enough years ago in the country we have left, but they were
nun at any rate. Here, they seem to be merely a pack of blood-
thirsty molly-coddles, crossed with calculating rogues. The mob
outside was better than this. But, thank Heaven, we have nothing
like this in London."
And with that he and Father Time walked gloomily from the hell,
and found themselves once more in the street.
''What ho! my trusty Shooting Star," cried Mr. Punch. Whiir-r i
And in the thousandth part of a second they found themselv
measurable distance of Toby^ own Planet. And hero the Dog speaks for himself.

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.
VISIT TO THE DOG-STAR.

"Take care of the plank, Sir," I said, as my
esteemed master lightly skipped across the gang-
way, marshalling a well-grown youth carrying n
scyttie; "we aon't have many visitors here. One
who looked in the other day slipped his foot, ftll
over, and we've never seen hiin since. Listening
intently, watch in hand, we heard a slight thud,
and have reason to believe he dropped on Jupiter.
It was useful to us, seeing that, by use of a well-
known formula, we wereuble to reckon our precise
distance from that planet. For him, I fancy, it
must have been inconvenient."
"Are you serious, Toby?" said Mr. Punch,
stepping with added caution.
"No, Sir, I'm not. This," I said, waving my
hand with graceful and comprehensive gesture
around the orb where I am temporarily located,
"(his is Sirius."
"Ah, I see," said Mr. P., glad to find himself
with his foot on our native heath; "I want to
present you to an old friend, whom, I am afraid,
you have sometimes misused. Time, this is Toby,
M.P., a humble but faithful member of my
terrestrial suite. I am showing the young fellow
round, Toby, and we looked in on you, hearing that you had
a Parliament that should serve as a model for the firmament."
"I am afraid," observed Time, whittling a piece of stick with his
fcythe, "that we may have looked in at a wrong season. As far as
I can judge from a consideration of the temperature, and a glance round
your landscape, we are now at Midsummer—in the dog days, if I may so
put it without offence. Of course your legislators would not be in Town just
now, sweltering nt work that might as well be performed in winter weather,
when, regarded as a place of business or residence, Town has attractions superior to
those of the country." "Ah, young fellow," I said, perhaps a little sharply, not
relishing his somewhat round-about way of putting things, "when you 're as old as me
or my esteemed master, you will not be so cock-sure of things. Our Parliamentary
Session begins on the threshold of Spring; we stop in Town hard at work, through the pleasantest months of the year; we toil
through Summer nights, see August out, and, somewhere about the first week in
September, when the days are growing short, the air is chill, and Autumn gets ready to
usher in Winter, we go oft" to make holiday."
"Dear me, dear me!" cried Afr. P., "how very sad. How deliberately foolish.
We manage thing3 much better than that down in our tight little Earth. When we
take that in turn, you will find, my good Time, that we burrow at our legislative
work through the Winter months, getting it done so as to leave us free to enjoy the
country in the prime of Spring, and amid the wealth of Summer. But come along,
Toby, let's get on to your House."
"It will be no use going now," said Time, holding up his hour glass; "it is five
o'clock; the working day is practically over, and we shall find these sensible dogs
travelling off to take a turn in the park, or pay a round of visits in search of the
culinary receptacle that cheers, but does not intoxicate."
'' Wrong again, young Cock-sure," I said; we shall just find our house of Com-
mons settling down to the business of the night. We begin about four o'clock in the
afternoon, and peg away till any hour to-morrow morning that one or two Members
please. It is true we have a rule which enjoins the suspension of business at midnight;
but instead of suspending business we can (and do) suspend the Rule, and sometimes
sit all night."
"Ah!" said Mr. Punch, gravely shaking his head, "we manage things much better
than that at Westminster."
Oot my two friends with some difficulty across Palace Yard, eyed suspiciously by the ^
police-dogs on duty. One concentrated his attention on Mr. Punch's dorsal peculiarity.
"We have strict orders from the Sergeant-at-Arms," he said, "to examine all parcels carried
by strangers.''
"That's not a parcel," I said, hurriedly, and taking him on one side, succinctly explained the
personal peculiarity of my esteemed Master. Humph!" said the police-dog. "Exactly," I re
let us pass on, though evidently with lingering apprehension that he was allowing a valuable cl
his hands, as it were.
"Wait here a moment," I said, "till I get an order for your admission."

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.

Absent only a few minutes ; when I got back terrible commotion;
Mr. P.'s friend was in the hands of the Police; they had attempted
I to take his scythe from him, and he had smartly rapped one on the
head with his hour-glass.
j "I Ye carried it a million years," he said, swinging the scythe
with practised hand, till he made a clean sweep of the police-dogs.
'•' Make it a couple of millions, whilst you are at it, young man,"
-aid a sarcastic police-dog.
With some difficulty calmed him; explained that no one, not
I even a Member, was permitted to enter House with a scythe, or
; other lethal weapon. Only exception made once a year, when Hon.
Members, moving and seconding Address, are allowed to carry
property-swords, which generally get between their legs. Timk
1 partially mollified at last, consented to leave scythe behind chair of
door-keeper, where the late Tom Collins used to secrete his gingham-
umbrella.
"It seems to me," he said, " that the public are treated in this
place worse than jackals. Hustled from pillar to post, suspected of
unnamed crimes, grudged every convenience, and generally regarded
as intolerable intruders."
"Ah," said Mr. P., "we manage things much better at
Westminster."
"Order! Order!" cried an angry voice, and Mr. P. and
his companion were within an ace of being trundled out of the
gallery, where strangers are permitted to see and hear what-
ever is possible from their position—and it is not much.
"What are they talking abont?" asked Time, in guarded
whisper, being, by this time, completely cowed.
"They haven't reached public business yet," I explained.
"Been for last two hours debating a private Hill, providing that
I lie pump-handle in the village of Plumbcrry shall be chained at
eight o'clock at night. The Opposition want it done at nine."
"Well, I suppose they know all about it," said Time.
"Probably been down to Plumbcrry, examined into bearing
of whole question, and formed their opinion accordingly?"
"Nothing of the sort; some of them don't even know when;
l'lumbcrry is—never heard its name before this Pump-handle
business came up. Don't even now wait in House to hear
question debated by Members with local knowledge. You see
only twenty or thirty Members in their places. But, when
bell rings for division, four hundred will troop in, and their
vote will settle the question whether Plumberry shall be privi-
leged to pump water as late as nine o'clock, or whether at
< i;iht the handle shall be chained."
So it turned out: In House of four hundred and seventy-nine
Members Bill was read a second time by majority of twenty-three.
Division occupied twenty minutes, which, with debate, appropriated
two of the most precious hours of the sitting.
Mr. P. narrowly escaped expulsion, attention being awkwardly
concentrated upon him, owing to the exuberance of his delight
in recollection of how much better these things are managed at
Westminster.
After this, public business was approached, beginning with ques-
tions. Of these there were a list of eighty, the large majority on
exceedingly trivial circumstances. Nine-tenths of them could have
bc-en answered in a sentence by the Minister addressed, supposing
the Member had dropped him a private note, or crossed the floor of
the House, to speak to him. Time openly contemptuous at such a
way of doing business, more especially when, on question which
appeared on printed paper having been answered, half-a-dozen
Members sprang up from different parts of House, and volleyed
forth supplementary nterrogations. Explained to him things used
to be worse when questions were propounded tv'ixJ voce, and at
length.
"Now," I said, not liking Mr. P.'s crowing over us, "the
Speaker will not allow the terms of a question to be recited.
They appear on printed paper, and are taken as read."
"Then,'' queried Time, " what are these Members putting ques-
tions'arising,' they say, 'out of the answer just given? They
don't spare a syllable, and take up five times as much of the Sitting
as Members who put their questions on the Paper, and are not
allowed to read them. You don't mean to say that such a trans-
parent evasion of the rule is permitted 1"
"It looks very like it," said Mr. P.; "but it's not at all the
sort of thing that would be permitted in our House of Commons.
We make Rules, and the Speaker sees that they are obeyed in the
:pirit, as well as in the letter."
By the time questions were over, following on the prelude of
private business, the evening was getting on. Members evidently
tired out; had crowded in to vote on the Pump-handle question;
sat in serried rows during the squabbles of question-time; and as
soon as business was actually reached, House swiftly emptied, leav-
ing about a score of Members. Time more than ever distracted.
Mr. P. increasingly perky.
"Ho! ho !" he said, rubbing his hands, "I don't wonder at
this Star going to the Dogs. Stop till you come over to West-
minster, Time, dear boy, and we '11 show yon how public business
should be carried on."
^ Explain to them that House is now in Committee
n~ on a Bill that had at earlier stages occupied some
months of the Session, practically the greater portion of
its working time. Now Session drawing to a close;
agreed on both sides that it is too late to conclude Bill
this Session; will be dropped after another night or
two; Members knowing this, do not think it worth
while to give up more
lime to Bill. Next
Session it will be
brought in again, and

"What!" shrieked Time, forgetting whore he was, "you don't
mean to say that after devoting nearly a whole Session to a measure,
laboriously shaping it up to a certain stage, you chuck away all
your work because the Almanack say3 it's August? Why don't
you, when you meet again in February, take the Bill up at the
stage you dropped it? Why don't you"
Here our friend's observations were brought to a sudden close.
Time was, as Mr. P. subsequently remarked, reduced to the status
of a half-Timer. Angry cries of " Order! Order!" broke in on
his unpremeditated speech. Two attendants, approaching him on
either flank, seized him, and led him forth under the personal
direction of the Sergeant-at-Arms. Mr. P., following his friend,
and endeavouring from the top of the staircase to assure him that,
"we manage these things better at Westminster," was promptly
taken into custody, and led forth beyond the precincts, a combina-
tion of circumstances that interrupted and, indeed, as fur as my
friends were concerne l, finally closed what was beginning to promise
to prove an agreeable and instructive evening.
Business Done.—Mr. Punch and another Stranger expelled from
the Gallery, and Toby's narrative completed.
The two
Travellers
made
their way
through
space in si- ^
lence, but
on a sud-
den Father
Time
piucked
his con-
ductor by
the sleeve,
and spoke.
"Sir," he
said, "I
perceive in
the dis-
tance a
wonderful
light, and
there is a
sound of
soft and
beautiful music that attracts me strangely.
Shall we approach the light, and listen mure
closely to these strains?"
"Have patience." replied the Sage. "The
light and the mu<ic come from the planet
Venus. Thither I am directing our course. In
wo shall arrive."
Even 03 he spoke the light grew brighter, the music of the
invisible choir swelled to a louder strain, and before the King of
I lie Hours had time to express his rapture, the pair had alighted in
a scene of veritable enchantment. Fairy-like structures of crystal,
sparkling with tii the hues of the rainbow, rose on every side.
Spires and domes of the most fantastic but graceful design seemed
to soar into the clear and perfect air. All were bathed in a rosy
glow, the source of which was hidden. Spacious walks paved with
huge blocks of opal divided the rows of palaces. Along them grew
tall and slender trees of a curious and delicate foliage. Birds of
Paradise, King Fishers and doves flitted from branch to branch.
The broadest of these avenues ended in a sweeping flight of steps of
alabaster which led to a vast and perfectly proportioned hall, the

roof of which was supported on columns of pure jewels, diamonds,
rubies, sapphires and emeralds.
A throng of maidens, in classical attire and wearing wreaths of
roses on their heads, made their way along this avenue to where
Mr, Punch and his companion were standing. Their leader, a fair
and lovely girl of seventeen, advanced to the Wise One and
addressed him.
"Sire," she sang in a low and gracious voice, "Our Queen has
sent me to say that she waits for your coming. She holds her
Court in yonder hall, and thither I am bidden to guide you. Is it
your pleasure to come at once?"
Mr. Punch signified his assent, the maiden took him by the hand,
and beckoning to Father Time to follow they walked slowly
towards the Royal Hall and mounted the step9. A double gate of
wrought gold opened as they reached the top, and passing through
it, they found themselves in the Court of Queen Callista. A
marvellous sight met their eyes. The Queen sat on a raised throne
in the midst of a throng of attendants. She was of surpassing
beauty. Her deep-blue eyes were set like jewels beneath a broad
low forehead on which a light crown of pearls and diamonds rested.
Her garments were of a soft gauzy material that half concealed and
half revealed the beautiful lines of heT bust and limbs. In one
hand she held a spray of myrtle, the other rested lovingly on the
head of the magnificent hound who sat beside her, looking trust-
fully into her face. The great hall was filled with beautiful
women grouped together here and there, some seated and some
standing. They were all talking. Suddenly the Queen raised her
hand and commanded silence. She then rose and thus addressed
the two visitors:—
"You liava come from below to the Realm of Women. Here we
abide as you behold us. Age and decay hold aloof from U3, and
we order our lives with wisdom and modesty. Speak, if you have
aught to ask."
"Pardon me, Madam," said Father Time, somewhat rashly, "are
we not here on the planet Venus! and have I not somewhere heard
strange tales of what was done by?"
But Callista interrupted him. She smiled a beautiful smile.
"Ah, yes/' she said, "those stories are of the vanished past.
Now wj blush even to think they might once have been true ;"
and surely enough the whole charming assemblage became suffused
with fi? prettiest imaginable blush. "I will speak plainly with
you," continued the Queen; "for plain speech is best. No men
live here. Therefore, we dwell in peace. But we permit the
fairest and best among our number to descend from time to time to
earth, and to dwell there in mortal shapes for awhile. You may
have seen them," she went on, mentioning some name3 well known
to Mr. Punch. "They are allowed to marry; but only the wisest
and noblest men may approach them. On earth their will is free,
and sometimes, alas, they fall away from righteousness, and pass
thro igh bitter tribulation."
"Yes," said the Fleet Street Sage, "We call it the Divorce
Court—your Majesty will pardon the rough speech of an old man—
and, somehow, we don't seem able to get on without it. But here,
of course, you have no such institution t"
"No," replied the Queen. "There once was such a court
among us, hundreds of years ago, ere we had banished the men
from our midst. Now, however, we use the building iu which
petitions used to be heard as our chief College. Come hither,
ZoE," bhe proceeded, addressing a sweet little girl of about
fifteen. "Tell this wise gentleman your solution of that pretty ques-
tion relating to the concomitants of a system of ternary quadrics."
Without a moment's hesitation, ZoE stated the question, and,
what is more, solved it with absolute correctness.
"Marvellous !" said Mr. Punch. "I congratulate you."
"Ctxthia," said the Queen, beckoning with her rosy fingers to
another maiden, "will you recite to me your Pindaric Ode on the
late foot-race?"
Cynthia at once complied, and Mr. Punch listened in amaze-
ment to the resound^? lines of an ode worthy of the great Greek.

And with this, he and the Father kissed the young Queen's

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.
VISIT TO SERIOCOMIX.
"And so," said Time, as he carefully arranged his forelock
before a mirror in the corridor, in reply to a communication recently
made to him by Mr. Punch en route, "and so we 're to make a
regular rollicking night of it 1 You insist on taking me into every
Music Hall in Serio-
comix, hey, you young
dog, you! Well, well,
Sir, I'm not so young
as I used to be—but
I'm as fond of a bit of
good honest wholesome
fun as ever I was. So
lead on!"
They were in Serio-
comic—a new and bril-
liantplanetrecentlydi3-
covered by Mr. Punch—
by the aid of Weller's
patent double-million
gas-magnifying micro-
scope (extra power).
This star, as all astro-
nomers are by this time
aware, is a howling
waste of extraordinary
density, and occupied
entirely by Music
Halls, which Time, for
some inexplicable rea-
son, was desirous of
visiting in Mr. Punch's
company.
Mr. Punch, though
considerably Time's
junior, almost envied his companion's boyish eagerness for pleasure;
he was so evidently unfamiliar with Music Halls.
"If you are expecting to be vastly amused, Sir," Mr. Punch
ventured to hint, "I am afraid you may be just a trifle dis-
appointed."
"Disappointed?" said Time; "not a bit of it, Sir; not a bit of
it! Isn't a Music Hall a place of entertainment? You've plenty
of them where you come from, haven't you? They wouldn't be
filled night after night, as I'm given to understand they are, if
they didn't succeed in entertaining, would they, now?"
Mr. Punch felt a natural reluctance to betray the weak points of
any terrestrial institution.
"Oh, our Music Hulls 1 they are perfection, of course," he said.
"The entertainments there are distinguished by humour of the most
refined and intellectual order. It only struck me that they mayn't
be quite the same here, you know, that's all."
"We shall see, Sir, we shall see," said Time. "I don't think
I'm particularly difficult to amuse." By this time they had
entered the dazzling hall, and, reclining on sumptuous seats, were
prepared to bestow their bast attention upon the proceedings.
A stout man with a fair wig, a dyed moustache and a blue chin,
occupied the stage. He was engaged in representing a Member of
the Seriocomican aristocracy with irresistible powers of social fasci-
nation, and he wore a loose-caped cloak over garments of closely-
fitting black, which openc in front to display a ma«s of crumpled
white, amidst which scintillated an enormous jewel. In his hand
he held a curious black disc, with which he beat time to a ditty, of
which Mr. Punch only succeeded in catching the following
refrain :—
"Oh, I 'ave sech a Vy with the loydies! All the dorlins
upon mo are gorn!
For they soy—' Yu't he noice! you can tell by his vice,
He's a toll and a gentleman born !'"

And here the singer suddenly caused the black disc to expand
with a faint report to a cylindrical form of head-dress, which ha
placed upon one side of his head, amidst thunders of approval.
But Time seemed rather depressed than exhilarated by this pev-
formance.
"He ought to be kicked off the stage," he muttered. "I'd do it
myself if I was younger!"
"You would make a mistake," said Mr. Punch; "he is just the
person that a Music Hall audience idolises as their highest ideal of
a man and gentleman—in Seriocomix."
"At least," said Time, "you wouldn't stand such an outrageous
cad as that in any of your Music Halls, I hope 1"
A deeper tinge stole into Mr. Punch's already highly-coloured
countenance. "Certainly not," he replied, with perhaps the
slightest suspicion of a gulp. "Our ' Lion Comiques ' are without
exception, persons of cidture and education, and, if they sing of love
at all, it is only to treat the subject in a chaste and chivalrous spirit.
They are worthy examples to all young people who arc privileged
to listen to their teachings."
"I wish you could send one or two out to Seriocomix, then, as
missionaries," said Time.
"I wish we could send them all," rejoined Mr. Punch, feelingly,
and they went on to another Music Hall. Here Time had no
sooner perceived the artist who was upon the stage than he ex-
claimed indignantly, " Disgraceful, Sir. This man is in no con-
dition to entertain a respectable audience—he is intoxicated, Sir—
look at his tie!"
"I think not," said Mr. Punch, after observing him attentively
through his opera-glass; "he merely affects to be so because the
point and humour of the song depend on it But he has evidently
forced himself to make a close study of the symptoms, or he could
hardly have produced so marvellous an imitation. Art does demand
these sacrifices. You will observe that he represents another Music-
Hail ideal—the hero who can absorb the largest known quantity of
ardent spirits, and whose prowess has earned for him the proud title
of the Boozer King."
It was a spirited chorus, and the accomplished vocalist reeled in
quite a natural
manner as
chanted :—
he

"So every pub I
enter, boys,
With welcome
the room will
ring;
Make room for him,
there, in the
centre, boys!
For he is the Boozer
King!
Yes, give him a seat
in the centre,
boys.
Three cheers for
our Boozer
King!"
But Time's worn
features exhibited
nothing but the
strongest disgust.
"Is it possible,"
he exclaimed, " that
this sort of thing can be considered amusing anywhere!"
"It is considered extremely facetious/' said Mr. Punch—liiu
Seriocomix."
"What would they think of such a—cuch an apcthcosb oi
degradation in one of your Music Halls at home, eh 1" demanded
Time.

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.

Privately, Mr. Punch was of opinion that it would not be at all'
unpopular. However, he was not going to admit this :—
"It would be hissed off the stage," he said, courageously. "The
fact is, that our Eccentric Vocalists have always shrunk from tb.3
responsibility of presenting a national
vice under an attractive light, and so
such exhibitions are absolutely un-
cnown among us."
"I respect them for their scruples,"
said Time; "they have their
reward in a clear conscience."
"No doubt," said Mr.
Punch. "Shall we go on ("
And as Time had had enough
of the Boozer King, they
went on, and entered th-i
next hall, just as a remark-
ably pretty young girl, with
an innocent rosebud mouth,,
and saucy bright eyes like a
bird's, tripped daintily on to
the platform.
"Come," said Time, with
more approval than he had
yet shown, "this is better—
much better. We need feel
no shame is listening to this
Iyoung lady, at all events.
What is she going to give
us? Some tender little love-
, ditty, 1 '11 be bound!"
She sang of love, certainh,
though she treated the sub-
ject from rather an advancel
point of view, and this was the song she sang :—
"True love—you tyke the tip from ine—'s all blooming
tommy-rot!
And the only test we go by is—'ow much a man has got?
So none of you need now despair a girlish 'art to mash,—
So long as you 're provided with the necessairy cash!"
And the chorus was ;—
"You may be an 'owling cad;
Or be gowing to the bad;
Or a hoary centenarian, or empty-headed lad;
Or the merest trifle mad —
If there's rhino to be had,
Why, a modern girl will tyke you—yes, and only be too
glad!"
As she carolled out this charming ditty in her thin high voice,
Time positively shivered in his stall, " Are all the girls like that in
S.-riocornix?" he moaned. "I trust not."
"It seems the fashion to assume so here, at any rate," said Mr.
Punch, not without a hazy recollection of having heard very similar
sentiments in Music Halls much nearer home than Serioeomix.
"The young woman is probably an authority on the subject. Are
you off already?"
"Yes,'' said Time, as he made for the exit. "I think she is
going to sing again presently. Come along!"
At the next Musi: Hall they were just in time to hear the an-
nouncement of a new Patriotic Song, and old Time, who had in his
day seen great and noble deeds accomplished by men who loved
and were proud of their Fatherland, was disposed to congratulate
lwth himself and the audience on the choice of topic.
Only, as the song went on, he seemed dissatisfied somehow, as if
he had expected some loftier and more exalted strain. And yet it
was a high-spirited song, too, and told the Seriocomicans what fine
fellows they were, and how naturally superior to the inhabitants of
all other planets, while the chorus ran as follows :—
"Yes, we never stand a foreigner's dictation!
No matter if we 're wrong or if we 're right;
We 're a breed of good old bulldogs as a nation,
And we never stop to bark before we bite!"
And then the singer, a fat-necked man, in a kind of military
uniform, drew a sword and struck an attitude, amidst red fire,
which aroused vociferous enthusiasm.
Time seemed to bj getting restless again, so they moved on once
more, and presently enterel a hall where they found a stout lady
with a powdsred face and extremely short skirts, about to ring a
pathetic song, which had been expressly written to suit her talents.
She bagan in a quavering treble that was instinct with intense
feeling:—-
"Under the dysies to rest I have lycd him;
My little cock-sparrer so fythful and tyme!
And the ehLkweed he loved so is blooming besoide him,
But I clean out his cyge ever)- d'y just the syine!
For it bring? him before me so sorcy and sproightly,
As with seed and fresh water his glorsis I fill:
Though the poor little tyle which he waggled so lytely
Loys under the dysies all stiffened and still!"
—And then, to a subdued obblijato upon a bird-whistle, came the
touching refrain:
"Yes, I hear him singing 'Tweet,' so melodious and sweet!
Till his shadier conus and flits about the room. 'Tweet-tweet-
tweet!'
All my sorrcr I forget. For I have the forncy yet,
That he twitters while he's loyin' in his tomb—' Tweet-tweet!'
Yes, he twitters to me softly from his tomb!"
Mr. Punch observed his elder attentively during this plaintive .
ditty, but there was no discernible moisture in Time's hard old
eyes, though among ths rest of the audience noses were being freely
blown.
"Well," he said, "it may be very touching and even elevating,
I for anything I know—but it's not my notion of cheerful entertain-
ment. 1 'm uff!"
"I should like," said Time, rather wistfully, as they proceeded
to visit yet another establishment, " yes, I should like to hear some-
thing comic before the evening is over."
"Now is your opportunity, then," said Mr. Punch, taking his
seat and inspecting the programme, "for I observe that the gentle-
man who is to appear next is described as a 1 Mastodon Mirth-
moving Mome.'"
"And does that mean that he is funny !" inquired Time, hope-
fully.
"If it doesn't, I don't know what it does mean," replied Mr.
Punch, as the Mastodon entered.
His mere appearance was calculated to provoke—and did provoke
—roars of laughter, though Time only gazed the more sadly at
him. He had coarse black hair falling about his ears, a white face,
and a crimson nose; he wore a suit of clingy plaid, a battered hat,
and long-fingered thread gloves. And he sang, very slowly and
dolefully, this side-splitting ballad :—
"We met at the corner, Marire and me.
Quite permiscuous! Who'd ha' thought of it 1
She took and invited me 'ome to tea;
Quite permiscuous'. Who \t ha' thought of it?
I sat in the parler along with her,
Tucking into the eggs and the bread and but-ter,—
When in corns her Par with the kitching po-ker!
Quite permiscuous! Who \l ha' thought of it i''
There was a chorus, of course : —
"Quite permiscuous' Who'd ha' thought of it!
Who can guess what's going to be!
Whatever you fancy '11 fall far short of it.
That's the way things 'appen with me!"

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.
It seemed that this was the first occasion on which the audience had had the privilege of hearing this chaste and simple production,
and nothing could exceed their frantic delight—the song was rapturously re-demanded again and again. Tears stood in Time's eyes,
but they were not the tears of excessive mirth; it was almost incredible—but the " Mastodon Mome " had only succeeded in rendering
his depression more acute.
"A melancholy performance that," he said, shaking his head, " a sorry piece of vulgar buffoonery, Sir!"
"Aren't you rather severe, Sir 1" remonstrated Mr. Punch; " the song is an immense hit—it has, as they say on this planet, 'knocked
them;' from henceforth that vocalist's fortune is made; he will receive the income of a Cabinet Minister, and his lame will spread
from planet to planet. Why, to-morrow, Sir, that commonplace phrase, ' Quite pcrmiscuous! If ho'd ha' thought of it f will be upon
the lips of every inhabitant; it will receive brevet-rank as a witticism of the first order, it will enrich the
language, and enjoy an immortality, which will endure—ah, till the introduction of a newer catchword!
I assure you the most successful book—the wittiest comedy, the divinest poem, have never won for
their authors the immediate and sensational reputation which this singer has obtained at a
bound with a few doggerel verses and an ungrammatical refrain. Isn't there genius in
that, Sir?"
Ah!" said Time, " I'm old-fashioned, I daresay. I'm no longer in the
movement. I might have been amused once by the story of a
clandestine tea-party and an outraged parent with a poker; I
don't know. All I do know is, that I find it rather dreary
at present. We 'll drop in at just one or two more
places, Sir, and then go quietly Lorn? to bed,
eh?" They entered a few m >re Music
Halls, and found the entertain-
ment at each pretty much
alike; now and then,
instead of songs
about

mothers-i n-
law, domestic dic-
agreer.-.ents, and current
scandals, they were entertained
by the spectacle of acrobats going
through horrible contortions, or women and
little children performing feats high up aloft to the
imminent peril of life and limb.
u With us," said Mr. Punch, complacently, "there is a net
stretched below the performers."
"An excellent arrangement," said Time; '•' and I suppose, if they did
happen to fall"
"The spectators underneath would be to some extent protected," said Mr. Punch.
Then there were ballets, so glittering and gorgeous and interminable, that poor old Time
droprel asl: ep more than once, in spite of the din of the orchestra. At last, although several other
] laces remained to be visited, he broke down altogether. "To tell you the truth," he said, " I've had
i.bout enough of it. At my age, Sir, the pursuit of thi3 sort of amusement is rather hard work. I '11 do no
more Music Halls on this planet. But I tell you what I mil do. After all this I want a little rational amusement. I want to be
cheered up. Now when will you take me round your Music Halls, eh? Any evening will suit me—shall we say Boxing Night?"
"Xot if 1 know it!" was Mr. Punch's internal reflection—but all he said was, " ' Boxing Night I' let me see, I'm going somewhere
on Boxing Night, I know. Well, I '11 look up my engagements when I get home, and drop you a line."
"Do," said Time —"mind you don't forget. I am sure we shall have capital fun."
"Oh, capital," replied Mr. Punch, hurriedly— " capital—but now for (excuse the paradox) the Land of the Sea."
And so again they started. But Mr. Punch's presentiment will turn out to be quite correct. He will be unfortunately engaged on
Boxing Night, and so his tour of the terrestrial Music Halls with Time will be postponed sine die.

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.
VISIT TO NEPTUNE.
Walk
up!!
Walk
up!!

In a very 6hort
time the two august
travellers found
themselves in Nep-
tune. To their sur-
prise they learned
that the planet con-
sisted entirely of
land. They were
met by one of the
inhabitants in full
naval uniform, who
heartily greeted
them, promising to
show tbem every-
thing lib country
contained.
"The only thing
that must for the
present be unex-
hibited is the sea,"
he concluded.
"Truth to speak, we
have lost sight of
it, and the disap-
pearance has caused
considerable incon-
venience."
Mr. Punch con-
doled with the son
of Neptune, and asked what were the chief amusements in the
plar.et.
"Well, badgering the Engineers is considered excellent sport —
especially just now when their services are not absolutely required.
We snub them and underpay them, we refuse them the rank due
to them, and lead them a generally happy life! Nothing of that
sort of thing down below, I suppose?"
Mr. Punch at the moment this question was put was probably
thiaking of something else—at any rate he gave no answer.
"But this is about the best thing wc have here," continued the
Resident, pointing to a scene recalling the traditional pictures of j
Greenwich Fair, "the Royal Naval Exhibition. You see we have
pictures and models and fireworks. Everything connected with
the Navy inclu-
sive of ladies'
foot-ball."
"Ladies' foot-
ball," echoed Mr.
Punch, "why
what has that to
do with matters
nautical?"
"Tardon me,
Mr. Punch," re-
turned the Resi-
dent in a tone of
impatience, " but
to-day you are
certainly dense.
Ladies' foot-ball
is entirely nauti-
cal. Are not the ladies, as they play it, quite at sea?"
The Sage of Fleet Street bowed, and admitted that second
thoughts were best.
11 And now you must really excuse me," continued the Resident,
"foj it is my duty, as a director of the Royal Naval Exhibition
to start the donkey races. I suppose you have had nothing like
our Exhibition down below?"

"Nothing," re-
turned the Sage.
"So I thought,"
was the reply. "If
you have time, you
can call upon the
Admiral Survival of
the Fittest"
"Gentlemen,"
said that illustrious
official, after they
had entered his
bureau, "it is usual
to salute me by
tugging at your
forelocks and scrap-
ing the deck with
your right feet.
While you perform
this operation, you
will notice that I
will hitch up my
trousers in true
nautical 6tyle."
"Oh, certainly,"
returned Mr. Punch.
"Delighted! But,
Admiral, isn't that
sort of thing a little
old-fashioned?"
"And what of that, Sir? In spite of everything %ce still have
hearts of oak. We have not changed since the time of Nelson and
Trafalgar. We can still run up the rigging (there isn't any, but that
is an unimportant detail) like kittens, and reef a sail (there's not one
left, but what does that matter ?) in a Nor-Wester as our ancestors
did before us. And if you don't believe me, go to any public dinner
when response is being made for the Navy."
"But if the ships have changed, would it not be better if the
crews had undergone an appropriate transformation?"
"We don't think so. But, there,
it's no use palavering. Some day
the matter will be put to the test I" j
"By a war?"

"No; by the Fleet starting for a cruise in calm weather. Some
say we should all go to the bottom. But I am talking of the Planet
Neptune. On your little Earth, I suppose, things are very different?"
"Very," replied Mr. Pundt. "We have the Admiralty!"
And considering this an appropriate moment for departure, the
Sage and his Venerable Companion floated amongst the stars.

ARTISTIC STARS.

"It 'a wonderful!" ex-
claimed Time. "We haven't
git anything like this on
Earth."
"Plenty more where they
come from," said his Guide
Philosopher and Friend;
"but now just give me a
lock of your hair, and I '11
stand you a fly through the
artistic quarter."
And Mr. Punch, like
Beauty, "drawing him with
a single hair," carried the
Ancient Wanderer along with
him, past galaxies of talent,
musical, dramatic, and ope-
ratic, refusing to stop and
gratify the old Gentleman's
pardonable curiosity.
"I know I've got Time
for it all," quoth the flying
Sage, "but I haven't space,
that's where the difficulty is.
As for Literary Stars, from
Tennyson and Swinburne,
to Lano, Stevenson, Black,
Besant, and our excellent
friend, Miss Braddon, with
other novelists too numerous
to mention, we must leave
our cards on them, pay a
flying visit, and just skirt the
aitistic quarter."
"There's the President!"
exclaimed Old Time.
"Ah! even*one knows him," said Mr.
orator, and ever a Grand Young Man, the
Academy."
"Sir John, too," cried Time.
"As fresh as his own paint is our Millais," returned Mr. Punch.
"But ' 0:1 we goes again,' as the showman said, and you can pick

"Rather!" cried Mr.

Tenniel at their head. But
they 're all so busy just now
that I couldn't take up their
time."
"But you 're taking me
up," observed the aged T.,
slily.
"Quite so," returned his
guide—who if, per impossibile,
he ever could be old, would
I be "the aged P.,"—and then giving another tug at his companion's
forelock, he cried, "On we goes again! We'll be invisible for
awhile, and I '11 show you our 'Arry in the clouds. You
remember Ixion in Heaven, or as 'Arry would call him, IxTon
in 'Eaven. Now see 'Arry dreamin' o' Goddesses. Here we go
Up! Up! Up!"
And what happened is told by 'Arry in the following letter.

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.
Dear Charlie,— I've bin on the scoop,
and no error this time, my dear boy!
I must tell yer my rounds; it 'a a barney I
know you are bound to enjoy.
Talk of Zadkiel's Halmanack, Charlie, John
Keats, or the Man in the Moon—
Yah! I've cut all tlmr records as clean as
a comet would lick a balloon.
'Arry ain't no Astronomer, leastways I ain't
never made it my mark
To go nap on star gazing; I've mostly got
other good biz arter dark.
But when Mister Punch give me the tip 'ow
he'd take poor old Time on the fly,
Wy I tumbled to it like a shot; 'Arry's
bound to be in it, sez I.
So I took on the Lockyers and Procters,
and mugged up the planets and stars.
With their gods and their goddesses, likeways
their thunderbolt", tridents and cars.
I jogged on with old Jupiter, Charlie, and
gave young Apoller a turn,
While as to Dia.vner !—but there, that u
jest wot you 're going to learn.
It wos dry and a little bit dazing, this cram,
and you won't think it's odd
If yours truly got doo3edly drowsy. In fact
I wos napped on the nod,
But the way I got woke wos a wunner.
Oh! Charlie, my precious did pal,
If you'd know wot's fair yum-yuiu, *cok on
to .1 gonuine celestial gal.
« Smack!" "Hillo !" sez I, starting sudden,
'• where ham I, and wot's this 'ere
game?"
Then a pair o' blue eyes looked in mine with
a lime-lighty sort of a flame,
As made me feel mo»ny immediate. "Great
Fompey," thinks I, "here's a
spree!
It'3 Dianner by all that is proper, olid as
for Enjimmyun—that's Me!"

'ARRY'S VISIT TO THE MOON.
For I see a young person in—well, I ain't
much up in classical togs,
But she called it a "chlamys," I think.
She'd a bow, and a couple of dogs,
"Rayther forward and sportive young party,"
thinks I, Sandown-Parky in style;
But pooty, and larky no doubt, so I tips her
a wink and a smile.
"All right, Miss Dianner," sez I. "You
'ave won 'em—the gloves—and no kid.
Wot size, Miss, and 'ow many buttons?"
But she never lowered a lid,
And the red on her cheeks warn't no blush
but a rcglar indignant flare-up,
Whilst the look from her proud pair of
lamps 'it as 'ard and as straight as a
Krupp.
Brought me sharp to my bearings, I tell yer.
"Young mortal," she sez, "it is plain
An Enjimmyun is not to be found in the
purlieus of Chancery Lane.
And that Primrose '111 isn't a Lalmos. The
things you call gloves I don't wear,
Only buskins. But don't you be rude, or
the fate of Actaeon you '11 share."
I wosn't quite fly to her patter, but "mortal"
might jest 'ave bin "cub,"
From the high-perl ite way she pernounced
it, and plainly Dianner meant
"snub."
Struck me moony, her manner, did Charlie,
she hypnertised me with her looks,
And the next thing I knowed I was padding
the 'oof in a region of spooks.
Spooks, is bogies and ghostesses, Charlie,
according to latter-day chat,
And the place where Dianner conveyed me
wos spooky, and spectral at that.
"Where are we, Miss, if I may arsk?" I sez,
orfully 'umbl for me.
Then she turns er two lamps on me spark-
ling. C" course we 're in Limbo,"
sez she.
Didn't quite like th. lay on it, Charlie,
for Limbo sounds precious like quod:
But she meant Lunar Limb~, dear boy sort o'
store-room, where everythink odd,
Out of date, foolish, faddy and sech like, is
kept like old curio stock.
(Ef yer want to know more about Limbo, read
Mr. PorE's Rape of the Lock.)
"So this 'ere is the Moon, Miss!"
sez I. "Where's the Man
there's sech talk on down-
stairs 1'
She looked at me 'orty. Thinks
I, "You 're a 'ot 'un to give
yourself hairs.
I may level you down a bit later:
The Man in the Moon, Miss,"
I adds.
Sez she, "We don't 'ave Men
up here; they are most of
them tyrants or cads!"
"Oh," sez I, "0:1 the Mona Caird lay, eh,
my lady?" Jest then, mate, I looks
And sees male-looking things by the dozen:
but then they turned out to be spooks.
There was Tolstoi the Rooshian romancer, a
grim-looking son of a gun,
Welting into young Cupid like, scissors, and
wallopping Hymen like fun.

Old Hymen looked 'orrified rayther; but as
for young Arrers-and-'Arts,
He turned up his nose at the old 'un, whilst
all the gay donas and tarts,
Not to mention the matronly mivvies, were
alter the boy with the bow,
Plainly looking on Tolstoi and Ibsen as
crackpots, and not in the know.
"Queer paper, my dear Miss Dianner,"
sez I, "wot do you think 1" Sez she,
"A mere Vision of Vanities, mortal, of no
speshal interest to me.
/ am not the keeper of Limbo, although it is
found in my sphere.
Everything that's absurd and unnatural
claims a clear right to come here.
"See, the latest Art-Hobbies are ambling
about with their 'eads in the air,
And their riders arc tilting like true tooth-
pick paladins. Smuice over theic
Makes a bee-line for Scratch in this corner,
whilst Muck and the Mawkish at odds,
Clash wildly, and Naturalism pink Senti-
ment painfully prods."
Then I twigged Penny Whistler's white
plume, and the haddypose Hoscar
upreared,
His big haiiy horryflame, CnARLlE, whilst
Phillistines looked on and jeered.
I see Nature, as Narstiness, ramping at wot
Nambvpamby dubbed Nice,
And Twoddle parading as Virtue, and
Silliness playing at Vice.
Here was pooty girls Primrosing madly,
and spiling their tempers a lump,
By telling absurd taradiddles for some big
political pump;

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS,
And there wos 'ard-mouthed middle-rgjd
'uns a shaking the Sochcrlist flag,
And a ramping like tiger-cats tipsy around a
rediklus red rag.

There wos patriots playing the clown, there
wos magistrates playing the fool;
There wos jugginses teaching the trombone
to kids at a bloomin' Board School.
"This is Free Hedgercation in Shindy," sez
I. "They 're as mad as March hares,
All these Limboites, dear Miss Diaxxer.
We do it much better downstairs!"
She smiled kinder scofflsh, I fancied, and
give 'er white shoulders a hunch.
Says she; " I've no comments to make.
It's along of my friend Mr. Punch
Whom the whole Solar System obeys, and
the Court of Olympus respects,
That I wait on you 'ere, Mister Arry. Pray
what would you like to see next?"
"Well," sez I, with a glance at he2 ^..aers,
"I've heard you 're a whale, Miss, at
Sport.
Do you 'know anythink ' wuth my notice?"
She gave me a look of a sort,
As I can't put in words, not exactly, a sort
o' cold scorch, dontcherknow.
That's a bit of a parryclocks p'raps; any-
how, it hurt wus than a blow.
But we went on the fly once agen—-can't say
'ow it wos managed, but soon
We 'ad passed to a rum-looking region—the
opposite side of the Moon,
Where no mortal afore had set foot, nor yet
eyes, Miss Diaxxer declared.
"Here's a Region of Sport!" sez the lady.
Good Gracechurch Street, mate, 'ow I
stared!
Seemed a sort of a blend-like of Hepsom,
and Goodwood, and Altcar, mixed up
With the old Epjiing 'Unt and new Hurling-
ham, thoughts of the Waterloo Cup,
Swell Polo and Pigeon-mntch tumbled about
in my mind, while the din
Was like Putney Reach piled on a Prize-
fight, with Kenuiugton Oval chucked in.
There wos tiff;, fair top new 'uns, mixed
hup with the welcher, the froth with
the scum;
The:e wos duchesses, proud as Dianner,
and she-things as sniffed of the slum;
There was "champions" thick as bluebottles,
and plungers as plenty as peas,
With stoney-brokes, pale as a poultice, and
"crocks," orful gone at the knees;
I see a whole howling mix-up of "mug"
booky, dng-owner and rough,
A-watching of snaky-shaped hounds pelting
'aid 'alter bits o' brown fluff,
I see—and the Sportsman within me began
for to bubble and burn,
And I yelled, " 0 my hazure-horbed Mistress,
can't you and me 'avc jest a turn?"
We did, and my "Purdey Extractor" made
play, though it ain't me to brag,
But somehow her arrers went straighter, and
'ers wos the heaviest bag.
"Let me 'ave a try, Miss," sez I, "with that
trifle from Lowthcr Arcade!"
I tried, and hit one of her dogs, as she didn't
think sport I'm afraid.
The 'ound didn't seem much to mind it;
immortal, I spose, like Miss D.;
Then we 'ad a slap alter the deer, and she '<]
very soon nailed two or three.
/ wos out of it, couldn't pot one, and it
needled me orful, dear boy,
To be licked by a gal, though a goddess, and
armed with a archery toy!
Her togs wos a little bit quisby—for moors
as ain't pitched in the Moon,
And there teom't no pic-nic, dear boy! I got
peckish and parched pooty soon.
She lapped from a brook, and her hoptics went
wide as a cop on the watch,
When I hinted around rayther square, /
should like a small drop of cold Scotch.
Well, well; I must cut this yarn short.
We'd a turn at Moon Sports like all
round,
Wish I 'd time to describe our Big
Boar Hunt—Diaxxer's pet pas-
time I found,
Can't say it was mine; bit too risky.
Pigsticking in Ingy may suit
White Shikkarriesor Prin-
ces,dearboy,butycrBoar
is a nasty big brute.
Too much tusk for my taste!
'Owsomever Dianner
6he speared him to-
rights,
And I dropped from the
tree I'd shinned up when
the boar had made tracks
for my tights.
"Bravo, Miss DIANNER!"
I sez. "You are smart,
for a gal, with that
spear.
But didn't yer fret jest a
mossel alarmed — for
yer 'Arry, iny dear ("
Put it hamorous like, with a wink, snugging
up to the lady, I did;
For she'd found a weak spot in my 'art,
this cold classical gal, and no kid.
I'd been 'aving a pull at my flask, up that
tree, and her pluck and blue eyes
Made me feel a bit spoony; in fact I was
mashed. But, O wot a surprise!
"Alarmed? about you, Sir! And why?"
sez Dianner, with eyes all aftasb,
I sez, "Don't yer remember Adonis, love,
Venus's boar-'unting mash]
Xo wonder the lady felt fainty like ; fear
for a sweetheart, yer 6ee.
And—well, if I'm not quite Adonis, you
found your Enjimmyun in Me!
"One more, only one, dear Diaxxer," I sez.
And 1 aimed for a kiss,
I made for her lips, a bee-line. But great
snakes, my dear boy, wot a miss!
Hit me over the 'ed with her boar-spear, a
spanker, she did, like a shot.
Don't you never spoon goddesses, Charlie;
you '11 find it a dashed sight too 'ot!
"Adonis!" she cried. "Kay, Actooon!
And his shall be also thy fate.
There is Punch looking on, he'll approve!"
And she jest set 'er dogs on me, straight!
"Way-oh ! Miss Diaxxer!" I yells. "No
offence! Don't be 'ard on a bloke!
Beg yer pardon, I'm sure!" Here a hound
nipped my calf like a vice, and—I woke.
Leastways, I persoom it wos waking, if
'tother was sleep and a dream,
But I feel a bit moon-struck, dear boy.
Spooks abound, and things ain't what
they seem.
Milter Punch sez, "it served me quite right."
Well, next time correspondence he'd
carry
With satterlites,
spesh'ly the Moon,
ho had better not
drop upon 'Arry.

PUNCH AMONG THE PLANETS.
"Poor fellow, I pity him," said Mr. Punch to Father Time, as
the pair passed away from the Lunar precincts together, bowing
courteously, and a little apologetically, to 'Arry's late hostess,
who called off her dogs, and affably responded to their parting
salutation. "Fact is," pursued the Sage, "my young friend
'Arry, though smart and fin de siecle, in his way, is a little of
'the earth, earthy ' and lacks both the adventurousness and the
tact of an Ixion."
"I presume,' said the Sjythe-hearer, "our inter-planetary pere-
grinations are now pretty nearly at an end—for this time ("
"We have yet one mare visit to pay," said .1/r. Punch.
■ At this moment, as the space-pervading trio fleeted forward, a
strange unusual effulgence grew to the eastward, and began to
bathe them in golden light Mira:ulously metamorphic was its
action upon the aerial travellers. Mr. Punch flung aside his hat
and his " Immensikoff," and appeared as the Apollo-like personage
he really i3. Toby's wings expanded, and his pace mended. As
for "Old. Father Time" himself, the combined influence of the
regenerating philtre in Faust, and the fire-bath in She, could not
more completely have transmogrified him. His face brightened
with youthfulness, his solitary forelock bushed out into a wavy and
hyacinthine hirsute crop, his ancient and magician-like garments
fell from him, his plumes expanded, until he looked more' like "the
herald Mercury " than old Edax Rerum.
Then they swung, as on airy trapfc*, or on wings of the thunder-
bird strong,
With the sound in their cars of the voice of the starry and sisterly
throng.
Did the orbs of splendiferous Sol give a wink as they ranged into
reach?
Was his genial mouth all alight with the flame of the friendliest
speech I
Hey, Presto! Great Scott! Transformation on Druriolaxus's
stage
Was never so sudden as this! Who ride3 there as the Sun-God!
The Sage!
The Great Hypnoti;er! Utopia's lord! He Who Must De
Obeyed!!'.
He whose Magical Spell is on Princes and Peoples, on Art and on
Trade.
Houp la! Transformation tremendous! The round of the Planets
we've travelled,
Some curious secrets unveiled, and some mysteries mighty unravelled.
We manaje things better on Earth! That's the formula! Sounds
it sardonic!
Was Punch just a morsel sarcastic, hu hosts just a trifle ironic?
At any rate, Punch here explains to the World how to manage
things better,
By purging Humanity's spirit, and snapping Hate's tyrannous fetter.
He'd Hypnotise Man into health, both of body and spirit, and out of
The follies, and vices, and greeds, and conceits. See the whole
Comus-rout of
Absurdities, Appetites, Antics, Antipathies, personal, national,
Driven before his bright Sun-Car! The Rule of the Rosily Rational
He would inaugurate, making Earth's atmosphere healthy as Thanet's,
That Father Time, is his aim; that's the Moral of Punch and the
Tlanets!
