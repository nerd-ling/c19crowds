CHAPTER I. 

THE INITIATION. — WI' 



To Emmeline it was nothing new to expect a 
straoge face. It was not that expectation, there- 
fore, which prevented her from sleeping, but an 
undefined sense of painful interest in the person 
who was. to appear. She lay awake the greater 
part of the night, waiting for seven o'clock of the 
morning ; no wonder, then, that when that hour 
arrived it found her asleep. Having 1)een warned • 
to do so, Maida entered Miss Evelyn's room with- 
out knocking at the door. Perceiving that her 
young mistress slept, she hesitated to advance; 
but the lovely countenance reposing before her 
attracted her to a nearer contemplation of the 
peaceful features whose transitory shudder (induced 
by suffering) but showed to more advantage the 
calm into which they speedily relapsed. 

Resolving that should scorn await her there, it 
should be repaid with scorn, severity with coldness, .

indignity with defiance, Maida had prepared to 
commence her life of public disgrace, and had 
entered the chamber fiill of proud and determined 
thoughts. 

When, therefore, her eye fell upon the bed, and 
beheld there a face so sweet that it appeared in- 
capable of scorn, so gentle that it could not assume 
severity, she felt as if she had done it grievous 
wrong by her previous supposition, while a keen 
pang of sorrow darted through her heart as she 
observed that death bad laid unmistakeable claim 
to the fair young creature lying before her. 
EmmeUne moved her lips, and Maida, thinking 
she was about to awake, turned quickly away •, but 
her own name, murmured softly and dreamily, 
reached her ear, and again she looked towards the 
bed. 

* Poor Maida — would God — poor — poor — 
Maida !'

as woxM anyi hdaselnaid who had dbne heat duty, 
and notiiing bejrond. Miss Evelyn hastily cloJBed 
her eyes, hV^pmg Maida would not know she had 
been awake ; but the movement was not so rapid 
as to escape Maida : though she did not turn 
towards Enuneline, she perceived it, and appre- 
ciated the delicate kindness. But proud and deter- 
mined as she had entered, she could not leave the 
room without expressing her altered mood in a 
voluntary offer of her service. She stopped at the 
door, and asked, in a voice so gentle that no one 
would suppose it was a murderess who spoke — 



' Can I do anything for you before I go down 
stairs T 



4 THE BROAD ARROW. 

Miss Evelyn wanted nothing, but bearing In 
Maida's voice a desire to help her, she said she 
should like to be raised a little higher, and have 
her pillows beaten up. The request was a proof of 
confidence that touched the prisoner to the quick ; 
it told her that whatever indignities might else- 
where be heaped upon her, she would have none to 
fear from the gentle being whose head, now resting 
on her shoulder, dreaded no contamination from 
convict garments. She was again preparing to 
leave the room, when Em'meline, unable to refrain, 
stretched her long thin hand to her, and ex- 
claimed — 

' Maida, this hand will, perhaps, ere long, be 
stiff in death ; take it now, as a pledge of proffered 
friendship. Yes ; do not start ; distinctions made 
in life are useless on a bed of sickness. I repeat, 
take it as a pledge of friendship, which I offer 




THE INITIATIQBr. — ^WFTHIK. 5 

perhaps you thought I used it on the impulse of 
feeling: but no; I have liyed in tibis country nearly 
all my life, and have found that one of the grand 
miseries of the convicts is having no friend to speak 
to^ no friend to confide in ; therefore, when I see 
one of my own sex newly arrived, I fed deeply for 
her, knowing what she will- have to go throu^ 
even in a fiunily where prisoners are kindly treated, 
and I long to become' her friend, so that when her 
heart is overwhelmed within, she may feel she has 
some one to whom to speak her grief; I muat be 
your friend, Maida, something tells me I must 



Emmeline raised herself on one side, and, look- 
ing earnestly at Maida, continued — 
^ Tell me, do you disbelieve me still ?* 
^No, Miss Evelyn; neither did I disbelieve 
you. If I started, it was in hatred of that word, 
which has been profaned until it has lost for me all 
its hallowed meaning : it has been sounded in my 
ears till I loathe it; it has been abused until I 
forget its proper signification ; and, when you used 
it, the word reached my mind not so much associated 
with your generous proposal, as with objects of vice, 
which I choose to call my inferiors. On ship- 
board, and on the "Anson," I was daily either 
charged vnthj cautioned againsty or punished fovy 
intimacy with creatures I shudder even to think of. 
Friendship it was called — but that relationship 



6 THE muOAD ARROW. 

cannot exist between fiends ! For all that I so 
loathed them, if I only spoke to, or was spoken 
to, by one of them, an officer would reprimand me 
for endeavouring to strike a friendship which could 
only be for injurious purposes or mutiny. If by 
chance two of us got together, either she was cau- 
tioned against making friends with a mate of such 
known bad character as Martha Grylls, or I was 
warned not to seek too femiliar a frimdship with 
her — pah !' 

And as if the subject was one too di^usting to 
dwell upon, Maida stopped. 

' That is past now ; let its remembrance make 
you value more — ' 

But Maida interrupted. 

* It is not past ! Last night, in this house, the 
same caution was repeated.' 

*For the last time, thoi^h. Mr. Evelyn will 
not mention those painfiil sui)iect3 again : nor will

which fllnigB^ed in her bosom. But ahe did hide 
it; and that so well that Emmeline heard no trace 
of it in the cahu vmce that aoawered — .« 

* ^ Should I need a confidratial adviser or ftiemi^ 
Ifiss Eydyn, I shall, with gratitode;^ avail myself 
of your kindness ; but I am averse to promises^ 
they have painful consideration with m^ foreing 
me against my inclination. Were I to give the 
promise^ I should fulfil it with as much reluctance 
as I should with uqwilUngness break it It is nok 
in my nalute to confide in any one.' 

Oh, say not so^ Maida Gwynnham! thou art 
womanlike to thin^ imnost soul ; but in the wreck 
wherewith adversity hath desolated thee, thy nature 
hath been soccmvulsed^ that thou canst not discover 
thyself amid ihe ruins. 

^As I said before, you will fiud every one in 
this house kind to you, and disposed to assist your 
views for the future; but when your thoughts 
revert to home, and the chair by the chimney 
corner, — ^when your heart is rent by misgiviDgs, or 
wounded by reproach, — you will want something 
more than that; it is that something I desire to 
be. I do not wish to draw a promise from you : 
what is your sentence V 

* Life/ 

* A lifer ! O, Maida ! then you have not even 
the small hope that buoys up other hearts; you 
need a better fi*iend than 1/ 



8 THE BROAD ARROW. 

* Amount of sentence is nothing to me ; from the 
absence of all endearing ties or pleasant memories, 
locality is a matter of indifference. I have no one 
in England to wish me back ; no one for whom I 
would wish to return ; a despised creature I was 
sent thence, and a despised creature I remain here ; 
ignominy is stamped upon me, and would be the 
same in any place. If I might fix on one spot 
beyond another, the one in which my heart would 
become the most hardened, and my mind the most 
foigetfid of the past, should be the object of my 
choice.' 

' Have you no parents ? — no relatives, Maida ?' 

' I do not know — 1 fear to know.' 

An expression of anguish here compressed 
Maida's features, and pain was visible in the 
shudder that caused her to clasp her hand upon 
her bosom. 

* Oh, my father ! Poor old man ! was that letter

' They are none of them lost to you yet' 
*Our Religious Instructor thought differently; 
he seemed to see hell-fire already burning within 
me; happily safe himself he cared not who else 
he consigned to the flames. I hated religion before 
I met with him, now I hate it tenfold, as an un- 
necessary addition to the miseries of a miserable 
existence. What an abhorred thing must religion 
be to Government, since it deems it a fitting £^gra- 
vation to prison discipline, and since such agents 
are chosen to administer it ! I never met with but

the knowledge I have of myself is sufficientl; 
frightful; spare me closer investigation for pity'

There was again a silence ; it was broken b; 
Maida, who with a slight sneer in her tone, said— 
' Supposing that I desired such assistance, couli 
your experience afford it me ? You cannot knoi 
to what a character you speak in me. You cai

who from long disuse has forgotten how to apply

* Lor, mem, don't she curtsey beautiftil !' Ad- 
miration was in every line of Lucy's face as she 
turned to Emmeline for co-appreciation of Maida's 
exit. * Lor, mem, you should have seen her 'mong

to frighten the wits out of the best of us,' lowering 
her voice.

always says she likes bearing of things, but if she 
don't choose, nobody can make her to ; not even 
Mrs. Bowden,' 

Mr. Evelyn's voice on the stairs sent Lucy skit- 
tering away in search of Maida, who to her 
delight stood in the dinit^-room enveloped in a 
cloud of dust sufficient to smother all dread of the 
master's anger. Order speedily followed Maida's

women is all afraid of her 'cept when they's drunk 
— ah ! ah ! ah ! it's such fun — do you like being 
drunk? this is the way;' and with a sleepy 
grimace, the child stumbled about the room. 

' Poor little boy ! If that is what you've been 
taught, no wonder we have become a byword.' 

* You don't laugh, stupid woman 1' then cheeky 
by the serious look with which Maida regarded 
him, he said, sheepishly — *A11 the others does 
laugh at it. You mustn't look like that at me. 
Lucy said you were such a beauty ; but you are an 
ugly old fright, and I hope you'll get into lots of 
trouble, and be sent to cage ; then we shan't have 
you back,' 

Lucy flew indignantly at the child. 

' Naughty boy ! I'll tell your aunts ;' but the 
little fellow was too sharp, he darted to the door, 
where, pointing his finger at Maida, he cried — 
* Crop-py ! crop-py !' and then ran ofi: 

Maida turned in silence to her work. The finger 
of childish scorn touched neither her temper nor 
mind, but it entered her very heart, and chilled 
her into a sense of utter desolation. She who had 
stood the taunts of vice, the sneers of virtue, — she 
who had received in unflinching disdain the un- 
merited rebukes of inflated vanity, and had borne 
uncomplainingly the sentence of the law, — now 
bowed her head in shamed sorrow over the re-

abroad, and though under the protection of one of 
her master's family, the men in the chain gang 
wink to her as she passes, recognising her relation- 
ship to them by the brown of the guilty sisterhood. 
We see it, and wonder she does not sink beneatii 
that ba^e which, maliciously cruel, proclaims her 
shame in the public streets ; but her power is 
greater than its malice, and though, unreconciled by 
habit, its cling to her is the cling of a serpent, it 
cannot cripple her dauntless tread, nor bow her 
erect form. 

She enters a shop, and it is known to all there 
for what she comes or will shortly come ; a youi^ 
man leans over the counter, and enumerates the 
articles which he knows the probationer will first 
require. He tries to conciliate her with — ' A stays,

above the usual miseries of convict life, has loss of 
caste^ subordination to her inferiors, association 
with coarse and uneducated minds, and daily, 
hourly degradation in a hundred points, which are 
neither degrading nor annoying to Bob and Lucy, 
whose moral caste alone is lowered by transporta- 
tion ; who, in submitting to overseers and officers, 
have no fine feelings to be wounded ; who, being 
bom to serve and labour with their hands, would 
as soon, if well treated, work in Australia as in

they ' did not come free to the colony ;' who, being 
born to take their meals in kitchens with number- 
less Sams and Johns, Betsies and Annea, have

tion than such as the recollection of bygone Sams

She then instances the case of one Quicke, who 
had been a physician. She repeats to Uncle Ev 
all she has heard Uncle Herbert tell of his suf- 
ferings on the peninsula, where he got punidied 
for not being able to do as much hard work as men 
who had been used to manual labour from their 
infancy ; where heartbroken wretchedness was 
visited as snllenness, and what small show of ttiMily 
pride he dared manifest was called refractorinese ; 
he outstayed all his contemporaries, because he 
couldn't be recommended as a servant in any par<

But Uncle Ev, having kissed his niece, left the 
room, and Bridget followed him, fancying Maida 
vould like to be a few moments with Eiiiraeline. 

Twining her arm around Miss Evelyn, so as - 
to relieve her of her own weight, Maida led her 
towards her arm-chair. In answer to a look from 
EmmeliDe while they were crossing the room, she 
stopped ia front of the window, one sash of which 
was thrown open, admitting the sweet November 
air, fraught with freshness, significant of coming 
flowers. No person but one of a refined mind 
would have understood the wish conveyed in the 
slight glance that arrested Maida. Some would 
have replied to it by hurrying the invalid to her 
seat ; others would only have noticed it as a 
natural and unconscious movement ; but Maida, as 
she met the upturned eye, comprehended its mean- 
ing, fmd, . snpport^ her dependent burden stiU 
more firmly, waited at the open window, that the 
refreshing breeze might fan the wasted cheek of 
the invahd, while her eye drank its fill of beauty 
from die surroundii^ prospect, from which the re- 
surrective touch of spring had evoked an enhancing 
lovdiness — spreading a gentle verdure adown the 
slopes, and blending with the dusky hues of the 
distant hills lines of vitality that added animation 
to the scene, without depriving it of one of its 
native grandeurs or solemn characteristics. 

From the little child, whose puzzled mental

questioniDg cannot find relief in words, to the 
hoary hermit who, having devoted his life to the 
contemplatioa of nature, turns dissatisfied from the 
result, feeling that the something he would UDdOT- 
stand is a mystery, the ' open sesame ' of whioh 
has been lost in the ruins of the fall — firom child to

plaining nothing, makes the longing still more 
ardent: it is ail the still small voice, whose low 
and scarce-breathed tone thrills through erery 
nerve and awakens every attention, but melts 
away ere it reaches the spirit's ear, or if there is 
one breath that can be syllabled into meaning, it is

A moment since, gazing out on the pleasant scenery, 
I was filled with dream-like anticipations of the 
fiitore, wondering at the fair beauty of a sin-stricken 
world, and by it trying to picture that land which 
is very far ofl^ where the King reigns in his beauty ; 
but you have now turned my thoughts into a dif- 
ferent channel.* 

Maida cast a scrutinising glance at her^ and said — 



32 THE BKOAD AKEOW. 

' In speaking of deserts, I imagine that by virtue 
of them heaven is as much yours as hell mine. It 
is hard to look into your face, and believe you 
sincere when you call yourself a sinner ; but I am 
Sony to have distressed you, Miss Evelyn.' 

* Distressed me ! You have inspired me with 
rapture and gratitude by bringing to remembrance 
the wonder of mercy that comes between our 
deserts and our fate. No, no, Maida, my thoughts 
of that land so very far off will not be the less 
pleasing because they remind me it is not mine by 
claim of desert, but by right of inheritance. In 
our sure and certain hope of possessing it, we are 
apt, when viewing it by the eye of faith, to foi^et 
the mighty love by which it has become ours — the 
costly price by which the right of inheritance was 
purchased for us — the mysteiy of adoption by 
which it is secured to us, who are by nature 
cliildren of wrath ; but of all this you remind i

the rebellious. When you love Him, you will be 
glad that heaven is a free gift;, so that all the praise, 
and honour, and glory which might otherwise be 
yours, may be given to Him, and Him alone' 

' I do not wish to love Christ If I loved Him, 
I should wish to be with Him, and that is im- 
possible. My doom is fixed, irretrievably fixed.' 

' Promise me, Maida, that you will only try to 
love Him, and I will promise you that you shall 
be where He is for ever.' 

' Is heavenly love anything like earthly love, 
Miss Evelyn ?' 

' As like as the type can be to the antitype.' 

' Then it is all pain and anguish ! I will have 
nothing to do with it,' cried Maida. 

She hastily left the room ; then fearii^ she had 
retreated too abruptly, she re-entered to inquire if

It seCTied boors, but it was only minutes, ere 
Emuieline opened her eyes, and smiled on Maida. 

^ Tes, it is a greal^ great pain ; but Christ's love^ 
is all enjoyment, and love to Him all peace.' 

*HaTe you known the pain, then ?' escaped from 
Maida, ere die could control hersel£ 

^ I have known the peace and enjoyment,* mur- 
mured Emmeline, and the blood shone brightly 
through her transparent skin. 

Bridget entered the room, and Maida retired. 

'That gentle creature should know no traitor 
love,' thoi^ht the latter, glancing farewell to Em- 
meline's frail figure, and yet that she had known 
it, she felt convinced, and the conviction awoke in 
the prisoner's heart a yearning tenderness towards 
Emmeline. 

Daring the month which initiated her into Mr. 
Evelyn's service, Maida perceived that she had foes 
as well as friends in the household. The nurse- 
maid had conceived a hatred for her from the 
very first, the cause of which hatred was twofold — 
jealousy and disappointment. In the simplicity of 
her heart, Lucy had confided to Rachel her hope 
that a match might come off between the hero of 
the stables and the heroine of the kitchen. This 
confided hope, together with Lucy's unbounded 
praise of her friend, inspired Rachel with jealousy, 
while the rigidity with which Maida enforced her 
master s rule, that nurse should not go into the 



36 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

kitchen after tea hour, disappointed ber of meeting 
Kobert, and supping in his company. In Janet's 
time, the chief rigidity had been in the constant 
watch kept for seizing opportunities of infringing 
this rule. The altered state of things Rachel set 
down to design on the part of Maida, who, she 
declared, had a purpose in view in thus shuttii^ 
her out. In prejudicing CharUe's mind, she found 
one means of venting her jealous spite. Under 
her tuition, the little fellow's aversion had increased 
into decided animosity. Taught to associate 
Maida 's name with murders and other horrors, he 
quite trembled if she happened to come into the 
nursery after dark. The story of a shocking 
murder, just perpetrated in Hobarton, served his 
nurse for an illustration of what would be his, or 
his in&nt sister's fate, if either offended that wicked 
woman ; and Charlie was made to learn the illus- 
tration by heart, until he firmly believed that

To the abject notions of most convicts she was a 
good mistress, for they reckoned by negatives after 
die primary considerations of appetite had been 
satisfied. A free servant, in recounting to a new- 
comer the advantages of her situation, mentions all 
that is therein done for her : * Mistress allows me 
thisj and gives me t/iat ; she lets me go there, &c., 
&c. But the convict hireling tells his fellows — not 
all that his mistress does for him, but all that she 
does not do. In trying to cheer his mate, he says, 
* This is a better place than you'll get again ; she 
dont get us into trouble; she don't send us for 



THE BROAD ARROW. 

ment ; slie dont do this ; she don't do 
that.' 

But Emmeline and Bridget felt that Maida 
would require Bomething heyond such animal kind- 
ness. In the desire of fevourably impressing her 
aunt, Bridget wrote several eulc^ums on Maida 
and Maida's dull, intermingling them with a few 
expressions of pity for her &te, and hope that she 
would be happy in Uncle Ev's family. Mrs. 
Evelyn wrote back her delight that the new woman 
did her work well, and hoped of all things that she 
kept the door-steps clean. ' As to pitying her, my 
dear,' she said, ' there is no need of that waste of 
ink and paper. These government people can't 
have much feeling, or they wouldn't be in their 
present position ; what little feeling they once had, 
you may depend is gone now. I have been sur- 
rounded with them all my life, and never met with 
any who cared for being prisoners. With regard

the system, sbe in habitual theory was as much 
a slave-holder as any ^ Down Southern ;' we say 
habitual, because the theory was not one of heart 
or thcught'-riLot one into which she had been 
drilled — but one she had imbibed: it was not a 
conviction,, but a contraction. She did not carry 
the theory into unmercifol practice, because she 
was ni[>t cruel-natured \ she would have been as 
kind to real slaves, as she was to the convicts— as 
kind to animals as to either. The casual observer 
might see little difference between her and Mr. 
Evelyn's treatment of the convicts, and might 
award that little in favour of Mrs. Evelyn. Both 
kept them up to &e mark drawn for penal servi- 
tude; but the one was actuated by a desire to 
benefit the prisoner — the other was either actuated 
by no feeling, or by the supposition that those she 
kept up to the mark neither had nor had any right 
to feeling. In the same way that she applied the 
whip to the horse, so she stimulated her bond 
servants to an approved pace. Both master and 
mistress exercised a tight control over their 
prisoners. But the latter did so in contracted 
accordance with the convict legal code, and with 
the convict traditional formula, which says, ^ These 
creatures will do nothing without a bit and bridle ;' 
while the former hoped that the restraining in- 
fluence would hold them back from evil, and 
make them strive more earnestly for freedom. 



40 THE BROAD ABBOW. 

Both were equally sorry to send them away for 
punishment — the one for fear the effect should work 
contrarily to the desired end, the other that ^e 
lost a good hard-working pair of convict hands ; 
the one felt a pang in using the prerogative the 
law placed in his hand — he cannot bear to punish 
his hrother man — the other was sorry because she 
disliked to punish animals whether convict or 
quadruped. The one from satiric taint, (with 
which his former existence as a barrister infected 
him,) could not abstain from exhibiting a few satires, 
in the form of improper nouns, even on the per- 
sons of those whose fate he deeply deplored. The 
other misapplied nouns in speaking of, or to them, 
because it was not much consequence what she 
called them ; one name was as good as another^ it 
did not make her less mistress or them less con- 
victs. Sister or hrother was the only name she 
hesitated to use, or deemed an nnproper noun ;

unconscipitt was Mrs. Evelyn of having contracted 
this mode of viewing the prisoners, that she was 
aware of no inconsistency in warning Charlie against 
abosbg or ill-treating them. She was as eamiest 
as her hosband in teaching him correct behaviottr 
towards them, but children are keen remarkers of 
their elders. Though Charlie conld not explain 
teiiA^rf, he soon perodved something in his motlier's 
feelings towards the proscribed race that ill accorded 
with her instructions to him. He intuitively under- 
stood tiiat papa rowed them only when they 
deserved ity and mamma because they were only 
prisonert. 

When mamma whipped him for kicking Lucy, 
and calling her nasty beast, he had an undefined 
notion that he was punished under rule No. 5 of 
the Society for Suppressing Cruelty to Animals. 

Mrs. Evelyn had not arrived half an hour before 
she expressed a wish to see the new woman. 

* My dear, I wonder she did not bring up the 
tray on purpose to let me see her.* 

* Perhaps, she would rather meet you first alone, 
aunt,' explained Bridget. 

* Oh, no, my dear, there's not the least occasion 
for that ; I don't object to speaking to her before 
you. Bing the bell.* 

Uncle Ev walked out of the room; Uncle 
Herbert had not yet entered. 

* Let the new woman come up, Lucy ; I can

talk to her a little while I take my cliop, it will 
save me time.' 

Maida entered. 

' Oh, yes, she's a nice height — perhaps I shall 
turn you into a housemaid — and your name is ?— ' 

' Maida Gywnnham.' 

' That will do very well ; I like to have pretty 
names about me, Maida sounds pretty ; the other 
name's rather glumpy. What are you for ?'

' Patience me ! my dear ; whatever was your 
uncle thinking of when he hired this woman ? One 
would think her good looks bewitched him; he 
forgets that we may get killed in cold blood." (To 
Maida) ' Does the master know what you are for ?' 

* He has never spoken to me on the subject.'

clever when they are very bad : but I .

* Well, you are here, and I suppose must stay ; 
but you must mind what you are about ; I shall 
watch your temper, and if I see anything in it I 
don't like, I shall send you back to * government, 
which is the proper place for such as you ; we don't 
like haying dangerous people about us any more 
than the English do. You'll be very foolish if you 
don't behave well, for this is an excellent situation, 
and the master and myself are very kind to our 
people. You'll have plenty of food — butter too, 
which you wouldn't get everywhere — it's eighteen- 
pence a pound out here, even in summer, and 
that's too much for convicts to eat — but we don't 
mind ; we expect our government men and women 
to work, therefore we feed them well. You 
find she does very well in the house, don't you, 
my dear ?' 

* Yes, aunt,' murmured Bridget 

* What were you at home ? You seem to be 
superior — a dressmaker, or something in that way, 
I suppose.' 

* I have made dresses, ma'am.' 

* Have you lived in service before ?' 
^No.' 

* Who did you murder? Your illegitimate 
child, I suppose ; that's generally the way.' 

Maida replied not ; a line of supreme contempt 
curled her lip. 

* I don't ask for curiosity ; but because I should

like to know on what particular point to be on my 
guard; for instance, I should feel especially 
awkward if you had murdered a former mis- 
tress.' 

' These are impertinent questions, and you have 
no right to put such to me ! I shall not answer 
you, my mistress though you be !' Maida moved 
towards the door. 

' There, now !' cried Mrs. Evelyn ; ' have I not 
need to fear ? If the creature can toss herself into 
a r^e just for a trifle, what would she not do 
for more than a trifle ? Charlie, run and tell 
her to come back ; I've no notion of letting h^ 
off.' 

The child ran to obey his mother, when she 
stopped him. 

' And yet, no ; perhaps she'll strike you. Really 
papa shouldn't put one's life in danger in this cool 
manner.'

He laid his hand on her shoulder; the touch 
thrilled throned her, and, as if by supernatural 
power, surrounded her with images of the past 
She dared not meet the penetrating gaae of those 
calm eyes. She bowed her head, and, as often is 
llie case when one emotion is suddenly checked by 
the rising of another more potent, she wept aloud. 
She cursed the tears as they fell, but had no power 
to stay diem; hide them was all she could do. 
Drooping so as to disengage herself from Mr. Her^ 
berth's hand, she rushed to the kitchen. 

To us who have fidlowed Maida irom prison to 
Tasmania, it may seem strange that Mr. Herbert 
had never mentioned her to his daughter, or that 
during the month of his absence no inadvertency 
had revealed to Enmieline Maida's previous know- 
ledge of her father ; nor to Maida, that the Mr. 
Evelyn of England and the Mr. Herbert of * The 
Lodge ' were one and the same person. So won- 
dered all the party concerned, when a mutual ex- 
planation took place. But when we remember 
that Mr. Evelyn was summoned by Bridget to his 
daughter just after he had assisted Mr. Gwynnham 
from the platform to bis house, and from bis house

had rested him to the chaise of an old servant, 
who arrived by the next train to meet and return 
with his master — when we recollect that by Em- 
meline's side it was likely he should forget all but 
the exertions necessary to bear her from England 
ere autumn mei^ed into winter — we cease to won- 
der that the family had not become acqu^nted 
with the name of Martha Grylls before Lucy re- 
commended the person who bore it to Uncle Ev's 
attention. And as for the second wonder, we must 
content ourselves with recollectii^ that we should 
never have wondered it at all had the discovery 
not 'taken place. Haida had often questioned 
whether her young mistress might not be related 
to the clergyman who had visited her in prison ; 
her quiet yet earnest manner of speaking often re- 
minded her of him, and she fancied she could trace 
a likeness : but the fear of having her question an- 

:d1v,

to family prayer. She considered the one Sunday 
service enforced by convict regulations quite 
enough religion for them ; but she knew it would 
be useless to contend the point, so merely vented 
her disapprobation by a few sniffs and a loud 
whisper to Bridget when they were seated for 
prayers, * My dear, don't you smell the stable ?' 
On which Bob, who was not supposed to hear, 
replied, giving one of his peculiar side-wise nods 
— *Very like, missis; I was in along with the 
hosses when the bell twined for prayers.' 

Maida drooped over her little Bible when, in 
slow, sonorous accents, Mr. Herbert read the 
fifty-third of Isaiah. As though it had spoken 
to her only yesterday, the well-remembered voice 
came back with its accustomed power ; each word 
carried her along with it: she did not wish to 
listen — she did not wish to follow each tone, as it 
varied to suit the subject, but she had no choice — 
listen and follow she must. 

Lucy informed her that she would hear Mr. 
Herbert, every Sunday, for he preached at Tench, 
where the servants were expected to attend ; and 
when Maida asked how she liked his sermons, Lucy 
said — 

^ Oh ! I am sure you'll like them ; they hurts 
our feelings so much ; he preaches so appleekable 
like to us.' 

By which Lucy meant that Mr. Herbert's 



48 



THE BEOAD AREOW. 



preacbing was what is generally called very touch' 
ing, drawing many a repentant sigh and tear from 
the eye of the outcasts. . 

* The sermon hnrt me uncommon to-day, Miss 
D'Urban,' was a popular saying with Lucy when 
she returned from the Penitentiary Church.

*And may not Mr.Walkden want you?' re- 
plied that gentleman, with a peculiarity of em- 
pha^s which Bridget could not but notice, though 
she did not marvel at it. 

* Oh, yes! if 'tisn't about frescoes; Fve been 
afraid of them ever since I first saw you.' 

' Then you remember when you first met me. 
Miss D'Urban ?' 

* I've reason to,' said Bridget, archly.

50 THE BROAB AEROW, 

* And so have I,' answered Mr. Walkden, in the 
same peculiar tone. 

Then neither knew what to say, and Mr. Walk- 
den arose and shut the door; on which Bridget 
said — 

' Oh ! do you like die door shut ? it is so warm.' 

Mr. Walkden went over to the window to see 
the state of the weather, and Bridget supposed he 
was very short-sighted, since he could not see the 
sky from where he sat It only took a half- 
moment to look out, but that half-moment seemed 
long to Bridget, who began to feel uncomfortable 
lest Uncle Ev had been playing her a trick; 
so she followed Mr. Walkden and asked — 

'Did you want me? Oh I I forgot; perhaps 
you are going to take me to see the Queen's 
Orphan School, I shall like that amazingly ;' and 
a gleam of pleasure lighted her countenance. 

' I will take you wherever you wish to go, Miss

said to her, in woids of plain language-

Those who know Bridget D*Urban only as the 
ligfafrhearted, merryHnng^ girl, wiU be astonisbed 
to hear how calm she became directly her thoos^ 
said those simple woids to her; with what 
womanly composure she listened to Mr, Walkden's 
proposal f and with what modest dignity she told 
him diat she had left England on purpose to nurse 
Jier cousin, and could not» therefbrei pledge herself 
to any one; nor could all that Mr. Walkden urged 
make her say more. 

^dget hofped Uncle Et knew nothing about it ; 
she bludied as she met him on the stairsi but he 
only pinched up her &ce, and kissed her, as he had 
done a hundred times before, so she fimcied her 
secret was safe. 

* Where's Walkden ?' he called after her, in a 
careless tone, when she had passed him. 

^ Gone,' she answered as carelessly ; and that 
little monosyllable told Uncle Ev the result of the 
interview. 

Mrs. Evelyn was very disappointed when she 
heard it ; for whilst her niece had been with Mr. 
Walkden, she had employed herself in planning a 
wedding-breakfast, and had just finished laying the 
last corner-dish on the ideal table, when Uncle Ev 



52 THE BROAD ARROW. 

told her that he guessed his friend's suit had been 
rejected. 

The morning's event had taken no one by sur- 
prise but Bridget herself. Mr. Walkden had fre- 
quented the house too often to leave the suppositicn 
on any one's mind that he came without puiYOse. 
Had Emmeline been a less^wndemned invalid, his 
great attentions to her might have created the sus- 
picion that she was the magnet ; bat as the case 
lay, it would have been an injustice to her, as well 
as to Mr. Walkden, to suppose that his intentions 
towards her were more than such as any kind 
friend of a family would show to a sick member. 
Bridget, therefore, was the only accountable reason 
for his almost daily visits. 

*Em, darling, I've got something to tell you in 
the evening; I can't tell you before, because I 
don't want you to see me whilst I'm talking,' said 
she to Emmeline.

rose that he has bought on purpose for her, and

when she takes it, and says, after thanking him for 
it without a single comprehending blusfa, " Ah ! 
it's a pity, because we have so many in the gaden " 
— it would be far better if explained to the young 
lady that he had purchased the rose with silver, 
and presented it with painiul hope — eh, Miss 
D'Urban ?' exclaimed Uncle Ev's sly voice over 
her shoulder. 

' You horrid Uncle Ev, do go along with you ; 
I don't want any one to be desperately in love with 
me unless I am with him, for I hate vexing any 
one. I was delighted at first to think 1 had a real 
offer, the same as I have often heard of; but now 
I'm sorry, and feel as if I ought to many bin* 
because he loves me so. I'm * — and Bridget burst 
into tears. 

To this moment she bad disguised deeply-pained 
feeling beneath a playftil manner ; but now, too 
severely tested, she gave way. 




ABOUT BRIDaET. 55 

The cousins had a long and serious conversation 
on the proposal made by Mr, Walkden, at the 
close of which Bridget felt more composed, under 
the conviction that, sorry as she was for the gentle- 
man, duty did not call her to engage herself to 
him for the sole purpose of what she termed un- 
vexiug him. 

The fervour of the benison wherewith Uncle 
Herbert blessed his niece that night made her very 
happy ; she felt that the only fact she had con- 
cealed of that day's event was guessed and silently 
appreciated by him : 

^ Yea, and she shall be blessed !' he ejaculated, 
as he watched her light steps retreating for the 
night.

CHAPTER III. 

THE POST-OFFICE. 

On tiie day in which Maida vraa sent out under 
Bridget's guardianship to exchange her first quar- 
ter's wages for articles of clothing, the latter called 
at the general post-office to inquire when the next 
vessel would sail for Ei^land. Outside the office 
hung a placard giving a loi^ list of prisoners for 
whom unclaimed letters lay within. Whilst wait- 
ing for her young mistress, Maida cast her eye 
partway through the list, when her attention was 
arrested by the name of Martha Grylls. She

object 

' What does the woman request of thee, James?* 
asked the master of the shop, who belonged to the 
Society of Friends, and whose benevolent character, 
education, and gentlemanlike deportment, made 
him : an^ honour to the excellent fraternity he 
headed. 

James infcnmed Mr. Washington. 

* Thou sayest truly that thou may est not swerve

from my rule ; but thou canst not forbid my doing 
so, canst tbou, James ?' 

And with a benignant smile be gave Haida one 
shilling and fourpence, saying — 

' It is a small service, but I am well pleased to 
do it for thee. I bope tby letter will bring thee 
good news of tby home.' 

Maida was leaving the shop, when she felt a 
gentle tap on her arm. Mr. Washington stood 
behind her ; he placed a little packet in her hand, 
at the same time whispering — 

* It did not occur to me that these stockings may 
be necessary to thee,' 

As though understanding Maida's look, he 
smiled, ' Receive it as a gift, or pay for it at thy 
convenience ; I do not bind thee either to thanks 
or payment. Fare-thee-well.' 

He bad retired before she could reply.

ah ! but he too has suffered, for he says, ^^ I have 
not known a moment's happmess since you left." 
I am glad to hear it for your sake, Norwell, for 
mine I would it were otherwise — what is this ?' 

She picked up a bank note for five pounds that 
fell firom the envelope. 

She gazed at it, and then with a gesture of 
disgust thrust it into the fire. At that instant 
Rachel entered the kitchen. She had perceived the 
action during the moment she lingered outside the 
door, and now seeing Maida hastily put a letter 
into her bosom, she guessed there must be a secret 
going on, and determined to make the most of 
what she had seen, in serving her malicious purpose. 
Assmning a very grieved countenance she imme- 
diately proceeded to inform her mistress that she 
sadly feared the woman Gwynnham was not as 
honest as folk believed her to be ; she recounted 
the story of the burning of the bank note, and then 
requested leave just to ask if it was likely that her 
going into the kitchen should frighten an honest 
body into burning honest money. 

Mrs. Evelyn thought it most unlikely, and 
Rachel said, to her poor way of thinking, it was more 
suspectuous still that Maida had bought neither 
cap, gown, nor bonnet, but had spent her money 
only in such things as would be useful to her any- 
where, which seemed exactly as though she expected 
trouble, for, of course nobody would buy finery if

they were sure of bemg sent to cage in a few days. 
Don't that look as if she'd done something she 
expected to be punished for ? 

But Mrs. Evelyn did not thinlc so ; she said 
Maida was so odd a creature, it was as difficult to 
know what she would not do as what she would do. 
•However,' she added, 'I'll have no such freaks 
played by ray convicts : they shall wear prison as 
long as I choose, but not a moment longer. I 
don't choose to see the dismal brown about me 
after the first quarter.' 

' Certainly not, ma'am ; they's most as bad to see 
as to wear, specially for the quality.' 

' Go down and tell the woman to come up and 
bring her purchases with her. It's all a part of the 
same impertinence.' 

' It's after tea, ma'am ; am I to go into the 
kitchen ?" asked Rachel, innocently demure. 

' How else can you call her ? — don't pretend.'

* Because / tell you to the contrary,' replied 
Mjftida, haughtily. 

Mrs. Evelyn gave a little quick, amused laugh. 

* Who is it from then ?' 

* From one of whom I'd rather not speak.' 



62 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

Another little laugh. 

' You really are a vmj odd ^oman, Maida, bat 
I must be satisfied when I wish to know anything 
about my prisoners.' 

'Well then you &hcJl know!' cried Maida^ 
bitterly, ' It is from the man who ruined me, 
body and soul. He sent me money which I flung 
in the fire since I could not fling it back to him.* 

' No ! did you really ? well you are a very odd 
creature ; why I would have kept it for you until 
you wanted another dress.* 

' I would wear no garment of its buying, except 
a shroud ; and yet, no I not even that ; death 
should not be so scandalised by me.' 

Mrs. Evelyn gave another little laugh, and said 
between her teeth, ' Dear, dear !' 

' Do you still wish to see the letter?' 

' Oh yes, certainly ; I have said so, and mean to 
be obeyed.' 




THE P06T-0FFICS. 63 

qaestkm, ' What will yoa do next?' alarmed Mrs. 
Evelyn, and suggested the pndence of leaving the 
matter tar her husband's inspection; she quickly 
dismissed Maida, with the promise that the Master 
dbonld look into die suspicious business of the 
bank note. The Master, however, never did. 

Open-mouthed, listened Hobert and Lucy to the 
tragedy of the bank note. The grandeur of the 
aet betrayed liie latter into an infinity of ' Lors !' 
while Bobert appeared almost choked by it: he 
ottered ' Crinky me ! liie woman's a shingle short, 
or somethin' like it, to go stuffin' the fire with such 
blessed trade, and I so near my ticket too. I say, 
yoa see'd it with your own eyes, Ratchel ?' 

*I didn't with anybody elses, anyhow,' replied 
she. 

* Lor !' murmured Lucy. 

Sobert was in close consultation with his greasy 
locks, which flopped and reflopped through and 
over his fingers. 

• You seed nothin' harder than paper go in ?' he 
at last asked. 

The words had scarcely dropped from his lips, 
ere all three wonderers started as if by simultaneous 
impulse, and falling on their knees before the grate, 
began grubbing in the ashes, as diggers in a gold 
creek. In which act Maida caught them when 
she descended fi*om the parlour. They simul- 
taneously arose. Kachel glided off to the nurser}\ 



64 THB BROAD AEEOW. 

Lucy stood in mute worshipment of the money- 
burner. Robert ^ain appealed to his locks, and 
advised by them, muttered — 

' I say Madda, 'twas a darned shabby trick to go 
and fume that there money which would 'most have 
sote a feller up when he'd got his ticket.' 

' I had too much respect for you, Sanders, to 
offer you such money, it would have brought a 
curse with it; had it been a hundred times as 
much I should have destroyed it.' 

' Lor would she !' admired Lucy. 

Bob flopped bis hair, and muttering, ' a shingle 
short or somethin' like it,* departed to mourn the 
five pounds in the company of his only comforters, 
the horses. 

Maida waited for an official inquiry into her 
conduct, and doubted not she should be severely 
punished ; but none was made that night, and not 
until the next evening was she summoned to her

give me one word of pardon.' 

* My poor girl, I think with you it were better 
he should in death leave a grief of which death 
only could release him.' 






68 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

' No, no — yes, yes — Oh ! which do I mean ?' 
she cried, 

' Yes, better,' repeated Mr. Herbert. 

'But then /gave him the grief, /gave him the 
death. Do not try to make my guilt appear less, it 
would not comfort me ; through all your kindness 
might urge I should still see the haunting image of 
my father murdered by me.' 

' Maida, I could not lessen the fact, if I dared to 
try ; God forbid that I should try. I would have 
you view every circumstance of your career in the 
unpalliated light of truth, and God, of His infinite 
mercy, grant that the same light which shows you 
your sin may show you your Saviour,' 

Had Maida reflected a moment, she might have 
known that Mr. Herbert was hot the one to ex- 
tenuate her crime in this respect. 

' What have you to tell me, sir ?' asked Maida, 
drearilj'.

contemplation of her. &ther, she would have been 
alarmed at the peculiar emi^iasis laid on the word 
exeitmgj in connexion with Norwell's letter: now 
raising her eyes heavily, she merely said, in the 
same dreary voice — 

• Go on, sir/ 

^ You will remember, then, that your letter was 
sent so as to reach your iather the day after your 
departure, in order to preclude the possibility of an 
interview, which we judged would be a trial too 
severe for his strength. I felt sure that too late or 
not| he would make an attempt to see you. When 
I found on inquiry that your going had been 
delayed for a day, t felt as certain that the attempt 
would be successful, for starting by the first train 
aSieT the receipt of your letter, I reckoned he 
would arrive at the station just as your company 
was setting off. Acting on the belief that he would 
come, I went to the station to lend any assistance 
which might be necessary, and to shield him from 
any publicity into which his parental feelings might 
hurry him. Thank God I went ! his train was a 
few moments late, therefore the one which was to 
convey your party was in readiness to start simul- 
taneously with the arrival of the other, consequently, 
when Mr. Gwynnham alighted, your train had just 
proceeded on its way.* 

Mr. Herbert then recounted the scene given in the 
eighth chapter of the first volume of this book, and 



To THE BROAD ARROW. 

Maida bowed lower and lower in her misery, until 
a few moans alone told tbat she was conscious of it. 

' Here, here is the pain !' she at last said, press- 
ing her hand upon her heart, and rocking herself 
to and iro. ' Here is the pain — large, cold, and 
heavy, too cold for tears.' 

She sat a few moments longer in dreary silence, 
then turning suddenly to Mr. Herbert, she asked — 

' Sir, why did you tell me all lius ; where was 
the cmel necessity ?' 

' It is right you should know it, Maida.' 

'Yes, to fill up the heaped measure of my 
wretchedness 1' she exclaimed with bitterness. 

■ ' And better that you should hear it from me 
than suddenly from the lips of a stranger some 
day,' continued Mr. Herbert, without noticing her 
interruption. 

* Ah yes, forgive me ! for^ve, Mr. Evelyn ! all 
s confiisiou within me. I know not what to s 




THE POST-OFFICE. 71 

Maida shook her head. 

'No, it could not be better; it could not be 
worse/ 

There was something in her voice and incoherent 
manner that touched Mr. Herbert's heart, and yet 
he felt thankful that she showed her misery ; he 
always entertained more hope of her when she 
bent beneath her fate, than when she stood boldly 
to bear it. 'Wait an instant, Maida, I shall 
return presently,' said Mr. Herbert, leaving the 
room. 

' Clara, I wish you'd give me a glass of port for 
that poor Maida: she is so overcome with what 
I have said to her, that I fear she may faint/ 

' Ah, I am glad you have been scolding her, she 
has behaved shamefully to me ; however, she shall 
have the wine, and yet, don't you fear it may give 
her a relish for it ? these creatures so readily regain 
their taste for drink.' 

' I do not fear/ replied Mr. Herbert, taking the 
glass from his sister-in-law. 

' Mind, I don't grudge it,' she called after him. 

Maida sipped the wine and then set the glass 
on the table, unconscious that she had done either 
the one or the other. 

' Should you like me to pray with you, Maida?' 

' If you like, sir, anything you please.' 

' A few moments then — ' 

And Mr. Herbert was not more ; he commended

her to Grod in a short earoest supplication ; after 
which he took her hand, and shaking it kindly, 
said — 

' Maida, remember I am not your judge, but 
your pastor and friend. I thank Grod for having 
placed you under my care ; speak to me or to my 
daughter freely of all you suffer in mind or body.' 

' Thank you, sir, and thank you for your kind 
attentions to my poor — poor — ' 

She could not get out the word father. 

' God reward you for it, when He punishes me 
for my aggravated crimes,' she stammered. 

* No thanks are due, Maida : would that I had 
been able to be of more service to him ! I wished 
to keep him at my lodging, but the faithfiil old 
servant who traced him from the station to my 
residence, said he had received express orders to 
fetch his master, who, on leaving home, appears to 
have arranged for some catastrophe ; old Roberts

reproachfully to himself. 

The unexpected mention of the old familiar 
servant overcanie the obduracy of Maida's grief; it 
assumed a gentler aspect, and when Mr. Herbert 
turned towards her she was weeping. He there- 
fore continued to talk in a low, soothing tone, to 
give her a longer opportunity to shed those tears he 
knew would cease directly they were noticed, but 
hk tender care was useless ; that instant Mrs. 
Evelyn entered and said, in her quick material 
voice, * Oh, my dear,* (she called everybody * my

dear,') ' I thought, whilst lecturing this woman, 
you might forget the time, 'tis past eleven ; ah, 
there you are, Gwynnham ! I am glad to see you 
ciying — I must send you to Mr. Herbert, when I 
want you lectured to some purpose, I see !' 

And she gave one of her little quick, short 
laughs, as if lecturing and being lectured were one 
of the most natural incidents of convict life, 

Maida was hastily quitting the room : her mistress 
called her back, and said in the same matter-of-fact 
voice — 

' Well now, I foi^ve you, so you need not cry 
any more ; only mind, next time, really, I must 
send you to the brickfields; good night, you can 
take some supper.' 

Then as the door closed, she turned to her 
brother-in-law, with another little laugh — 

' Whenever these creatures get a row with one 
person they are sure to have a turn all round : 




THE POST-OFFICE, 76 

at home it's much more convenient Hark ! that's 
baby crying, I must go ; good night, my dear.' 

And off went the comfortable, happy wife, 
mother, and mistress ; she tucked her babe back to 
the warm, snug bed into which she speedily followed, 
and in dream went through her routine of house 
duties. Once in her sleep, she broke out into one 
of her little laughs, and dreamily explained : 
* Oh, it's only M aida, she's so odd !' 
Off went the wretched daughter, prisoner, and 
servant, and after feverish tossings to and fro, she 
fell into a restless slumber from which, with a deep, 
deep sigh, a dream of home awoke her, and she 
heart-brokenly exclaimed, *My father, oh, my 
father 1'

CHAPTER IV. 



Not more brilliant the conceivings of the youth 
who, aspiring to the honours of majority, beholds 
for the first time the decisive 'Esquire' in enchant- 
ing relief upon a letter addressed to himself, than 
were the anticipations of Robert Sanders when he 
awoke one moniir^ and found himself a ticket-of- 
leave. For some time he had vented his impa- 
tience for the glorious day in sundry contortions of 
his pen on numberless bits of paper. Though the 




A T. L. 77 

^ What else is there to write ? A feller likes to 
see what's befere 'en/ 

And Robert's eye, falling on the array of T. L.'s 
scattered on the table, saw agreat deal more before 
him: in those letters than we should if we looked 
until doomsday, unless — ^but never mind. A little 
nettled at Lucy's want of discernment, Bobert set 
in to p^orm a second edition, which he perused in 
silent enjoyment, until she began to suspect diat the 
scrawling and reading was some necessary process 
preparatory to the mysteries of T. Lism, and her 
respect for it accordingly increased. In a subdued 
voice she inquired — ^ Do 'e want 'em read over 
again. Bob?* 

Bobert only gave a sidewise shake of his locks, 
which almost annihilated Lucy with its expressive- 
ness; it said most plainly, *0h, go along — ^you 
ain't worthy;' and more than ever she believed 
the process one sacred to T. Lism. 

But Bobert had made other preparations. For 
more than twelve months his wages had disappeared 
without any visible reason in the form of wearing 
apparel. His mistress often inveighed against his 
shabby dress; but, willing as he was for most 
things, he evinced no readiness to spend his 
money ; though, in answer to Mrs. Evelyn's scold- 
ings, his * Very good, ma'am,' * All right, ma'am,' 
were as full of willingness as ever. Once, when 
she declared she would not have him wear that 



78 THE BROAD ARROW. 

greasy hat any longer, he so far ventured on 
T. Lism, as to reply — 'Very like the master 
would fetch an old hat for the present.' 

Where all his money had gone was a question 
that disturbed Mr. Evelyn ; he felt uneasy lest it 
had been appropriated to an evil purpose. Robert's 
anxiety, on the contrary, was only to conceal, or 
rather to parry an answer to the question until his 
time arrived. He was creating a grand surprise for 
the whole family, and had, from quarter to quarter, 
been investing his wages in apparatus for working 
out this surprise, which was eventually to redound 
in a burst of admiration on himself Now he 
added a gaudy waistcoat to the secret, then a pair 
of second-hand Wellingtons, which, by the help of 
new soles, had been made to creek an incredible 
amount of importance. A startling blue cravat 
was next added to his treasures, and, lastly, be 
purchased a pot of 'genuine bear's grease' for the 




A T. L. 79 

best he could before the small looking-glass in his 
room. 

He was not disappointed ; the sensation created 
in the kitchen realised his expectations. With 
slow, deliberate creaks he approached the door, 
then, entering, he gave a short, familiar nod. 
^ Good morning, gals.' 

Lucy stood captivated, and Robert quietly re- 
ceived her admiration as the homage due to T. 
Lisra, personified in himself; he applied his dazzling 
pocket handkerchief with becoming dignity. Maida's 
astonishment particularly gratified him; he saw 
no difference between it and Lucy's adoration ; he 
doubted whether Madda could be a shingle short 
since she displayed such excellent taste, * admiring 
of him in that fashion/ But the parlour was to be 
the grand scene of triumph. When the prayer 
bell rung, instead of being the first to obey the 
summons and to carry in the wooden bench for the 
servants, Robert lingered and lingered. 

' Bob — quick — prayers,* called Lucy over the 
banisters. She was awe-struck by the answer. 

' Can't come for a minute, Looey.' 

All the family was seated and Mr. Herbert 

waiting to commence, when creaky creaky creak 

came Robert. Maida could scarcely repress a 

smile. Lucy and Rachel exchanged glances of 
captivation. 

' It's the ticket !' whispered the former. 



80 THE BROAD AHROW. 

Mrs. Evelyn looked a thousand interrogatoiy, 
*My dears? from her husband to Bridget, from 
Bridget to the servants, and at last, no one explain- 
ing the approaching creak, she exclaimed, ' Why it 
must be a thief I' 

Sublime and slow, Bobert entered, and gave a 
sidewise nod to the whole room, shaking from his 
head an overwhelming effect of bergamot and from 
his waistcoat a strong perfume of boy's love ; then as 
if he had done for ever with wooden benches, he 
drew over a chair and stretching his legs across 
one corner of it, bent forward over his Bible in a 
free-and-easy posture. Prayers over, he sent a 
significant wink to Lucy — 

' Now you shall see what a ticket-of-leave can 
do' — then creaking up to his master, he said — 

' Please, sir, I am sorry for to leave you, but I'd 
be glad if you'd find some one else to look afrer the 




A T. L. 81 

you being now eligible for your ticket; but I 
expect you to give me a reason for this abrupt 
notice/ 

Robert conferred more seriously with his locks, 
and not being able to elicit anything better, gave 
answer in a somewhat crest-fallen voice, *My 
ticket, sir/ and it conveyed a more cogent reason 
for leaving than any other he could have assigned ; 
it seemed at once to satisfy his master, who re- 
plied quickly and kindly — 

'Ah — yes — yes — then you may go this day 
month/ 

Mr, Evelyn knew it would be impossible to try 
to argue him out of his desire to avail himself of 
this the only method of exhibiting his partially re- 
gained liberty ; he knew that not one prisoner in a 
hundred could withstand the pleasant temptation 
of choosing a situation for himself when his ticket 
gave him leave to do so ; and he felt sure that to be 
that one man in a hundred, it needed more sense 
than Robert possessed. 

On his way to the Comptroller's oflSce, Robert 
bought a yard or two of ribbon ; on 'his return he 
cut it into two parts, and threw the one half to I-ucy 
and the other to Maida, — ' There, gals, is a bit of 
ribbin for you/ 

He then threw himself back into a chair as though 
it were the easiest thing in the world to get tickets 
of leave and buy ribbon. 

VOL. II. G 



82 THE BROAD ARROW. 

* Bless my 'art I forgot Ratchel; I spose the 
gal 11 be wantin' somethio/ he suddenly said. 

Lucy had taken her ribbon and carefully folded 
it back in the paper; Maida's portion lay un- 
touched. 

' You can give her this if you please, Sanders. I 
can thank you for your kindness all the same.' 

' Ko, no, you keeps it, Madda, I want to see 'e 
in it ; a feller likes somethin' to show what's 'ap- 
pened.' 

* Shall I give her mine ?' asked Lucy, fearful he 
m^ht say yes. 

' No, no, don't know for that — I'd as soon see 
you in it as her. You and Madda wear 'em, they'll 
last while I'm Aere.' 

' Have you gave notice ?' cried Lucy, with a 
little shrill screech of amazement 

' Told 'e I should ; what's a feller's ticket for ?' 

'Lor!' Lucy looked to see how Maida bore 




A T. L. 83 

Madda, do that cove what sends you tin write 
often r 

Maida bent over her saucepan and asked, in the 
quietest possible voice, * What cove, Sanders ?' 

* 'Im that send that five pound that you fumed.' 

* He will never send me any more money, 
Sanders.' 

But Robert seemed incredulous, and leaving the 
kitchen he went straight to his master. 

* Please, sir, Td like a recommend if you'd get 
'em for me.' 

Mr. Evelyn knew well enough what for^ but he 
chose to ask, *Why, Sanders, are you ill?' 

Robert shook his locks sidewise with a knowing 
shake and muttered, * darned ill that I be.' 

*Oh, a recommendation to the Comptroller,' 
exclaimed Mr. Evelyn, giving a sly smile at 
Bridget. 

Mrs. Evelyn laid down her work and looked 
pleased ; anything to do with marriage interested 
her. 

' I'm thinking, I'd like a comfortable gal — 
Madda now down stairs, she's a bootiful woman — 
or Looey I shouldn't mind, but Madda maybe's the 
best — she's got friends as sends her a lift.' 

Mr. Herbert, who sat on the sofa by Emmeline, 
suggested that Robert should consult his master in 
private, but Uncle Ev enjoyed the joke too much 
to monopolise it, and Bob seemed by no means 



84 THE BROAD ARROW. 

discomfited by the bright eyes tbat watched 
hi in. 

'Well, Sanders, I have no objection to recom- 
mend you for marriage as far as your steady beha- 
viour goes, but Government will require more than 
that, or rather / shall require more before I can 
conscientiously sign your recommendation. What 
are your prospects — how could you maintain a wife ?' 

' A keb, I'm tbinkin', sir. Madda maybe 11 get 
a lift from her cove again.' 

Mr. Evelyn shook his head. 

' Or I'm willin' for anythin'.' 

' Remember, Sanders, a ticket is more easily lost 
than gained.' 

' All right, sir, that's just it ; I'm thinking a 
comfortable gal may keep a feller's wits about him. 
M adda now down stairs, I couldn't find nothin' bet- 
ter — she's a sharp hand— maybe you'll speak to 
her for me.' 




A T. L. 85 

^ I tell you what I do recommend, Sanders, and 
that is, that you quietly work on here or elsewhere 
for a time — a prisoner is in more difficulty after 
his ticket than before. You have earned it well 
and honourably : I should indeed be grieved if you 
lost it, which you surely will if you hurry into 
temptation.' 

^ All right, sir, I b'aint in no hurry so long a^ I 
gets the gal to wait for me ; this is a. quiet place, 
and she don't see many chaps, but — ' what else he 
might have been going to say, he dismissed with 
several shakes of his head. 

* Which girl do you really want, Robert ?' asked 
his mistress. 

'Well, ma'am, I've sote my mind on Madda, 
but I an't partial. I wouldn't say no to Looey, 
she's a dapper little maid, but Madda would help a 
feller out of trouble best.' 

* What does Maida herself say ?' asked Mr. 
Evelyn, with a grave glance at Bridget. 

*0h, I haven't said nothin' to her. If the 
master's agreeable to it, taint likely she'll object. 
I gived her a smart ribbin and she took to it 
famous.' 

* I advise you to hear what she says before you 
think any more of it. I have my doubts on the 
subject' (another smile at Bridget). 

*Gals is always agreeable to marryin'; maybe 
you'd tell Madda you'll recommend us when we Ve

kept company a bit — she won't go against your 
wishes.' 

* I'm afraid she will in this instance,' said Mr. 
Evelyn, drily. 

' O darned ! I an't partial, so loi^ as it's a likely 
gal — there's Looey, if Madda won't.' 

' Or Rachel ?' added Mrs. Evelyn, lai^hing. 

'I don't know as to Ratchel,' replied Bob, 
thoughtfiUIy. 

' Well, Robert, you must speak to Maida you> 
self. I would much rather not, — but I advise you 
to try Lucy first.' 

' Very good, sir !' and Robert left the room. 

'It is well to have two strings to one's bow, 
Bridget,' said Uncle Ev. 

' Oh, uncle, what a curious way of getting mar- 
ried !' 

* It is the orthodox way ; but I assure you. Miss 
Bridget, Sanders has exhibited unwonted patience

evening, three parts of Robert's T. Lism had dis- 
appeared; there was hardly any discoverable in 
his voice when after prayers he said, * If your 
honour won't take it amiss, I'd like to leave to- 
morrow.' 

Bob had now some other reason than his ticket 
for wishing to leave, 

* How now, Sanders ! What has happened 
since the morning ?' 

* Why, it's darned awkward to bide with a gal 
what wont say nothin' to you. I've spoken to her, 
and she won't' 

* That is, Maida won't, I suppose, Robert ?* 
*Es, sure; she was very perlite tho'. I ain't 

said nothin' to Looey. I'll let it bide over, maybe 
when I'm gone Madda '11 think better of it, and 
your honour could tell her it's the proper thing for 
her to do.' 

* You are not going ^ Sanders ! You must wait 
your month. Maida will not give it a second 
thought ; she will not annoy you.' 

*Dear me, what an odd creature!' said Mrs. 
Evelyn. 

* I'll go .without my wages — I'm willin' for to 
lose 'em,' urged Bob, in a tone in which T. Lism 
was again audible. 

* Sanders !' cried Mr. Evelyn. 

T. Lism vanished instantaneously. 

Mr. Evelyn continued in a kinder voice, * I

have your good at heart:, Sanders, in keeping you ; 
if you are determiaed to leave this place, you can 
quit ill a month, in the mean time 1 vill see what 
can be done for you ; many a poor fellow, with 
intentions as honest as yours at present are, has 
purposely fallen back into trouble, just to obtain 
from Government that livelihood which he 
could not procure elsewhere. And as for your 
marrying, I will recommend you with pleasure 
when I can conscientiously do 80. I won't have 
you say anything more to Maida, mind that ; either 
Lucy or Rachel will suit you.' 

This satisfied Bobert ^Restless to turn his 
ticket to some advant^e, he was just in that state 
to be pleased rather than otherwise with an em- 
bai^o that made decision less di£Scult Mr. Evelyn 
had foreseen this, and under cover of authority did 
a real kindness to the poor fellow, who had only 
been waiting for such an aid. The ticket-of-Ieave

care that I shan't neither. Thank'e, sir, Looey 
then, if you please/ 

And flopping his locks Bob withdrew to lay his 
ticket at Lucy's feet. 

Lucy received his offer with unfeigned surprise ; 
she had never dreamt of him for herself — the 
thought would have been profanation. 

* Lor, Bob, I thought 'twas Maida !' 

* So 'twas ; but what's a feller to do when he 
can't get the gal he wants ?' 

It was so proper that no one should be chosen 
whilst Maida was in the way, that Lucy did not 
feel at all slighted by the question, and without 
any meant depreciation of Robert's offer, she gave 
the pat reply — 

* Qtet the one he doesn't want, I suppose.' 

The little maiden scarcely knew which most to 
wonder at — Maida's refusal of Sanders, or her own 
good fortune. In her simple mind were mixed 
feelings of fear and pleasure — fear, that Maida 
resigned him on purpose for her — pleasure, that 
she, Lucy Grenlow, was actually the bride elect of 
Robert Sanders, T. L. 

Her fear would not let her rest until she had 
poured it into Maida's ear. 

* Lor, Maida, I didn't go for to make him love 
me, 'twas all out of his own head. I'm afeard it's 
sore work to you to let him go for my sake. I'll 
give him up to you at any moment. Ain't he 



90 TEB BROAD ARROW. 

handsome, thoi^h, with his fine hair so long and 
smart ?' 

And she heaved a tiny sigh, as though she 
should find it sore work to let him go, even for 
Maida. But Maida quieted her alarm by saying, 
that loving Sanders was so novel an idea to her, it 
would take her all her life to get accustomed to it ; 
therefore, in the meanwhile, she thought Lucy 
could not do better than make the poor man happy. 
She then kissed her plump, shiny cheek, and 
added — 

' I am very glad to hand you over to some one 
who will take care of you. I do believe Sanders 
tries to do well, and means to do better.' 

Lucy, mistakii^ Maida, replied, ' No, he hasn't 
done nothing so very had, either.' 

Then, understanding from her friend's grieved 
countenance that she had said wrongly, she apolo- 
gised, ' I means that by side of other prisoners he 




A T. L. 91 

* Lor, Maida, fancy me Mrs. Sanders !' 

And, late as it was, she flitted off to communi- 
cate the pleasant conceit to Bachel, who sat in the 
nursery, glum, solitary, and by far too disconsolate 
to think of going to bed. The news imparted by 
the unconscious Lucy by no means softened her 
glumness, but the former attributed to extreme 
weariness the gruff ill temper of the retort — 

*Ck)ming disturbing of a body at this time — 
most ten o'clock; what odds who he marries? 
Precious gaby that he is ! I only wonder how he 
ever got out of Tench ; and as to his ticket, that 
he makes such foolgame of, it's nothing but a 
chance that any fool may have. I wish you'd shut 
the door after you.' 

*How dreadfully sleepy she must be !* thought 
Lucy; but sleep was not in Bachel's eyes, for 
jealousy was in her heart In the morning Lucy 
was more sure than ever that tiredness had caused 
her ill-humour, for now congratulations flowed, 
honey-like, from her lips. She had been rocked 
to rest by perturbations of jealousy, and had arisen 
pacified by the determination to supplant Lucy in 
Sanders' affections, or rather, intentions^ for she 
felt sure that whatever it might turn out afterwards, 
at present .the match was one of convenience, affec- 
tion having small or no vote in the matter as far 
as Robert was concerned, And she was correct. 
He wanted a wife, whether a particular Lucy or an 



92 THE BROAD ARROW. 

unparticular Rachel or Anne, was of no conse- 
quence. The particular Lucy known as Grenlow 
was only selected because she had come more in 
his way than another girl, and because he had 
noticed that she was sharp in her movements, and 
'dapper with her sewin,' which accomplishmenls 
Robert highly prized, but then he would equally 
have prized them in any other Laicy. 

Rachel's cunning perceived all this, and notwith- 
standing her hatred of needlework, she determined 
to become a ' dapper sewer,' and with her needle's 
point to both vanquish Lucy and fasten Robert. 
He had a whim for white aprons. He had at first 
been made to wear them for his mistress's pleasure, 
during his kitchen probation; since then, he had 
adopted them for his own special gratification, and 
had, therefore, to purchase them for himself. The 
two he bad now in wear had become very thin and 
shabby ; he regretted one day to Rachel that he

* I never. Bob ! What's a nurse that can't sew ?' 
And she fell to laughing at his innocence of a 
nursemaid's requirements. From this time she 
never entered the kitchen without work of some 
sort in her hand. If she only came down for an 
instant just to see how long before Miss Baby's

her plans and Lucy's destruction. 

Lucy skipped about the house full of brisk 
* mems,' *sirs,' and curtseys. Though no one had 
spoken to her of Robert, she took it for granted 
that every pereon possessed and rejoiced in her 
secret But by degrees the brisk bobs and bright 
cheeks disappeared. No one could account for 
her altered looks. Her * mems ' degenerated into 
slow * ma'ams, ' her curtseys became drudgeries,

mand.

in the mopes. I can't bear to have her about me,' 
said Mrs. Evelyn, when Lucy's wits had wandered 
fiirther than ever. 

' I think she's out of health, aunt, she has been 
so listless and pale lately,' replied Emmeline. 

' Yes, she has been looking very tallowy ; no 
doubt she's been making too free with dripping 
and suet pudding. You noticed that large piece 
of pudding that went down yesterday ? I quite 
expected to see half of it ag£un ; well, when I 
went to the pantry this morning 'twas all gone- 
No complexion can bear that! Ill go and mix 
Lucy a dose of gregory.' 

Uncle Ev seemed delighted ; he turned to Brid- 
get 'Are you aware. Miss D'Urban, that the 
G-r^forian Chant is a great favourite in this house ?

say music cures the madness ensuing from a taran-

bable it would fail altogether. Both master and 
mistress questioned her, but she could assign no 
reason for her flagging energies, save that she felt 
'low-spirited like at Robert's keeping on not 
going ; she'd much rather for him to go.' Maida 
alone guessed the cause, and with redoubled vigi- 
lance guarded the kitchen from perfidious intrusion. 
She had seen nothing yet to give her a fair oppor- 
tunity of taxing Bachel with her design on Sanders, 
but she watched with the determination to avail 
herself of the first that should present itself. 
Sanders was so open, and Bachel so cunning, that 
she might have waited until Lucy had pined into 
skin and bone, had not accident betrayed the 
secret of her malady by discovering , Bachel's 
treachery. 

Had Bachel come before her in any other cha- 
racter than that of rival in her lover's affections, 
Lucy Grenlow had been the last to use the secret 
for her overthrow. 

Where is the woman, how kind soever her 
nature, that does not desire to rid herself of one of 
whom she is jealous ? — that does not long to tear 
away an image that comes between her and the 
object of her love ? 

Who will blame the dejected Lucy for expe- 
riencing a strange sensation of pleasure when she 
found herself under the painful necessity of in- 
forming her mistress that things were not going

aright in the nursery? But having proceeded thus 
far, Lucy heartily wished she had never com- 
menced the complaint ; the first thrill of delight 
over, she blushed ardent compunction, and glanced 
at the door, fain to bolt from the keen eye of the 
master, and the complaisant interrogatory expres- 
sion of her mistress. However, to withdraw the 
charge was impossible, therefore, plucking up all 
her courage, before Mr. Evelyn could utter a 
second solemn ' Well ?' she darted out — 

' Please mem, sir, I think sheVe been cuttii:^ of 
sheets to make aprons for Robert.' 

'Well?' 

' Please sir, that's enough.' 

' And too much ! Well ?' 

Lucy was forced to tell all she knew about it. 

It then appeared that Kachel had cut up and 
appropriated to Sanders' use two sheets which 
had been some time missing. A small half-burnt

conyinced by the man^s reasoning nor by the facts 
of the case ; she gave it as her opinion that the 
knowledge of it^s having been stolen property had 
most likely enhanced its value ; to most prisoners 
it would; why not, then, to Robert Sandeirs? 
Knowing that if his mistr^BS chose to act on her 
opinion, no power could save his ticket, th@ poor 
fellow stood forlornly before his accusers, a perfect 
picture of prison lowliness; he pleaded willing- 
ness — he pleaded his love for the horses— he 
pleaded everything but his innocence— ^Aa^ as a 
convict he knew would be pleaded in vain if not 
believed by his employers* 

Kachel's guilty appearance and examination, 
however, diverted Mrs. Evelyn from Robert, and 
with a sharp reprimand Mr. Evelyn dismissed him 
to bis stable. 

Of the nursemaid's guilt there could be no doubt, 
though there was abundant denial. She vowed 
she had cut up garments of her own to make the 
aprons ; but search being made in her boxes, 
remnants of the sheets were found, and her false- 
hood proved. A constable was sent for, and 
Rachel commanded to hold herself in readiness to 
be taken away by him. She no sooner reached 
her room, than she hastily shut the door and hit 
herself violent blows on her nose, until the blood 
flowed; she caught the blood in a handkerchief, 
and then pulled the bell with all her might. Lucy

98 THE BROAT) ARROW, 

ran to answer the bell, when she perceived Rachel 
sitting at the foot of the bed, covered with blood, 
which seemed to be oozing from the haodkeFchief 
at her mouth ; she screamed — * She's killed ! 
she's killed !' 

Rachel beckoned to her, and said faintly, * Go 
and tell 'em I've broked a blood-veBsel.* 

Lucy was running off. Rachel beckoned her 
back, and whispered more faintly — 

* Beg — 'em — to forgive — me — and let — ^me — 
stay on — till I'm — a — bit — better — ' 

The alarm was ^ven. ]U!rs. Evelyn hurried up 
to see what could be don^ foi^etting stolen tdieets, 
. and everything but the oppcHtunity of displaying 
her skill in quackery. Mr. Evelyn followed, and 
also Lucy, who ran forward like a little d(^ which 
hurries back to the scene of danger when it has 
given the necessary alarm. 

' What is it ? What is it ?' cried Mrs. Evelyn, 




A r. L. 99 

Badiel saw that simulation was useless, and her 
ikintness flowed forth in a stream of oaths that 
were more sickening to bear than the blood to 
behold. 

' Now rmnd^ I shall appear against you and 
baye you severely punished/ said her master, when 
the constable arrived. 

* Yei3, they were two beautiflil sheets,' paren- 
thesised Mrs. Evelyn. 

* Not so much for the theft as for your vile 
reason in committing it ; the one is unpardonable, 
;Ae other I could have forgiven,' continued Mr. 
Evelyn. 

It never entered Lucy's head to harbour resent- 
ment against her lover; had she at first felt anger, 
the danger she had been in of losing him appeased 
efvery feeling of an uncomfortable kind ; she even 
talked of her foe as * poor Rachel,' and hoped she 
wouldn't be punished ' very bad ;' after all 'twas 
natural like she should take to Robert, he was so 
handsome. 

* She'll lose her 'air any how,' said Robert, 
smoothing down his own to reassure himself that 
his locks, lately so imperilled, were in safe keeping 
on his head. Lucy even vouchsafed a few tears 
when she learnt from Bridget that Rachel had 
eighteen monthly part of which time was to be 
solitary. 

Bright, blushing, and fiill-blowD, re-appeared the 



100 THE BROAD ARROTT. 

roses on her cheeks ; smiles once more peeped out 
irom her dimples ; and mems and sirs, brisk to 
her heart's contenting, again dropped from her lips. 
More jauntily than ever set the little cap on her 
iiead, when, peace restored to the servants' 
quarters, she again basked in the ondivided light 
of Robert's countenance. 

Mr. Evelyn had not been forgetful of his pro- 
mise to see what could be done to enable Robert 
to set up for himself. He had now been nearly 
five months in possession of his ticket, and haTJog 
given no further hint of his desire to leave the 
Lodge, Mr. Evelyn gladly permitted him to stay. 
Hearing that old Hawkins, Maida's first friend in 
Hobarton, had inet with an accident which incapa- 
citated him for his calling, Mr. Evelyn went to 
Jiim and found him thankftil to let out his cab to 
Robert. Mr. Evelyn became responsible for the 
first quarter's payment, but told Robert that be 




A T. L. 101 

with such success that after an interview of an 
hour he stalked into the kitchen and with a mys- 
terious flop of his hair, requested Lucy to go up 
to the master; during her absence he acquainted 
Maida (whom he now regarded as a dowager to 
whom love secrets might with impunity be trusted) 
that it was all settled; the recommendation was to be 
procured, signed, and presented ; and that, accord- 
ing to his view of the case, * there'd be fine doin's, 
for when ike master said Tes to it, Miss Bridget 
jumped up and clapped her hands, and young ladies 
don't go clapping of their hands for nothin', do they 
Maida now ?' 

Maida heartily hoped there would be fine doings, 
and she promised to try her best to further any 
plans for celebrating the wedding, 
fife* Now that's what I call 'ansome, Madda ! and 
you have been disappointed too ! I tell 'e what, 
whenever you likes to stop down to our house you 
shall find what a feller can't get everywhere — that's 
a welcome — and hearty too.' 

The recommendation was duly signed, and the 
banns of Robert Sanders, T. L., and Lucy Gren- 
low, passholder, were duly published in the church 
of St. David's. One bright Tuesday morning a 
little procession issued from the Lodge, Macquarie 
Street, and entered the parish church ; passing up 
the aisle it surrounded the altar, within which stood 
the Reverend Herbert Evelyn, who, having ac- 



102 THE BROAD ARROW. 

knowledged the presence of the party by a kindly 
smile, commenced the marriage service. In his 
own rich voice he read the solemn charges ordained 
by the church, and then, no impediment being 
declared in answer to the searching g^nce fixed 
particnlarly on the bridegroom, he proceeded to 
' ask the man if he were willing to take the woman 
in holy matrimony. 

The question seemed to be worded to the man's 
taste, for he nodded a sidewise nod of approval, 
replying — 

' Es sure I will.' 

The Prayer-book's answer did not half express 
his willingness. 

When Mr. Herbert put the same question to 
the bride, she dropped a brisk curtsey ; the small 
soft ' I wUl ' popped out only just far enough to 
reach the ear of him for whom it was intended. 

Mr. Herbert then looked round and asked— 




A T. L, 103 

She then drew back into her place, and her large 
deep eye rested sadly on the floor. 

* Those whom God hath joined let no man put 
asunder/ exclaimed Mr. Herbert ; then turning to 
the company and the few strangers who had wan- 
dered into the building, he said — 

' Forasmuch as Robert Sanders and Lucy Gren- 
low have consented together in holy wedlock, &c. 
I pronounce that they be man and wife together/ 

The ceremony over, no one appeared to know 
what next to do ; there was no spontaneous hum 
of congratulation ; there were no fond parents — no 
tearful sisters — no gratified brothers to exchange 
affectionate wishes. The bride stood half crying, 
half smiling, working her little fat hand back into 
the white silk glove. The bridegroom uneasily 
flopped his long hair through his fingers. All 
were feeling uncomfortable, when on the con- 
strained silence broke a voice' full of benevolence 
and sympathy — 

* God bless you, my child !' 

Ere Lucy could believe from whom the bene- 
diction came, the clergyman, * all in his robes and 
all !' as she afterwards wonderingly Recounted, took 
both her hands in his and shook them with a 
warmth that could only have emanated from a 
father's heart; this was enough — the constraint 
vanished — a pleasant confusion of voices ensued — 
during which, forgetful of all convict proprieties, 



104 THE BBOAD ARROW. 

Bridget D'Urbaa t^rew her arm round Loeiy^ 
waist and gave her a loud, cheer&l kiss ; and theii 
presenting her hand to Sanders, she said — - 

' I wish you happiness in your dear little wifi><' 
Charlie's hugs were profuse, and baby, who had

goii% on, fitretehed out her head to yaa in tiie 
oelebration, and then pushed Maida's &ce totftarda

When the wedding party returned to the Lo%e, 
Mr. Evelyn himself opened the gate, and begged to 
Gongratulate Mrs. Robert Sanders. Suppo»flg 
that refreshment might not be unacceptable a^ei 
80 much excitement, he announced that a table< 
had been spread for the guests in the back parlour. 
Poor Lucy was overwhelmed with her unexpected 
honours ; she burst into a flood, of genuine biidal 
tears. Throwing herself on a garden bench she ioA 
her face in her handkerchief, and sobbed aloud.

now.' 

* Well, Lucy — Oh, I suppose I must say Mrs. 
Sanders now — and yet, no ; Lucy Sanders will do

husband, 

^ I'm just congratulating the girl, my dear ; 111 
come presently,* rejdied his wife; but with her 
eongratulations; finished also his reason for calling 
her away. 

Emmeline's sweet pale face smiled its loving 
welcome to the happy pair, when at twelve o'clock 
they went together, by special invitation, to her 
room to bid farewell, and to receive a gift she had 
prepared for them. 

* You must come and see me sometimes, Lucy,' 
she said. A faint * mem,' and a quick bob was 
the only reply. 

* Maybe, you'll fancy a drive in my keb once 
in a while — darned if I sharn't be proud to take 
you — darned if I wouldn't crawl down head fore- 
most to fetch 'e,' at last delivered Sanders, who 
having been in close conference with his locks, 
could find nothing else wherewith to ease his burden 
of thanks. 



106 THE BROAD ARROW. 

Mr. Evelyn had engaged a room in a respectable 
cottf^ in Melville Street 

Thither the wedded couple bent their steps, 
accompanied by Bridget and the children; on 
reaching the house they mounted the stairs, and as 
they approached the door of their room, it opened, 
and Mr. Herbert stood before them ; he raised his 
hand and blessed them. 

He then led them to a small, round oaken table 
on which lay a lai^e handsome Bible: this he 
placed in Sanders' hand, sayii^ — 

' There, Robert, is something for you to b^in 
life with. Commence with it, and when all things 
end, it will be your stay and comfort.'

CHAPTER V. 

THE OOITFIJOT. 

The confufflon consequent on Bachers sudclen dis- 
charge^ was partly rectified by placing Lucy in the 
nunery, and by giving Maida the double duty of 
housemaid and cook. Any change involving novelty 
and «^1y was pleasin J to the Utde housemail 
who entered on her post bs l&cum tenens with the 
utmost good-wilL Maida^ long accustomed to fold 
away her feelings beneath an impenetrable depth 
of surface, exhibited neither displeasure nor satisfac- 
tion at the additional work allotted her for the next 
month. Her mistress's promise of ten shillings 
extra for the over-work, put no unusual spring into 
her movements, nor did the extra duties abate her 
energy. When she had served her dinner, she as 
quietly changed her cap and apron to go into the 
dining-room, as though to wait table were the 
express purpose of her existence. So ably and 
quietly did she accomplish her twofold service, that 
Mrs. Evelyn began to think she might well continue 
in it. 



108 THE BHOAD ARROW. 

' Really, my dear,' she said to her husband, ' I 
think Maida could go on as at present, and save us 
the bother of another government woman; she 
doesn't appear to feel the work too much, nor to 
mind doing it,* 

' Bijt I both mind and feel it for her, Clara,' 
replied Mr. Evelyn. 

* Ah \ but she is a tall, strong, woman, my dear. 
I think if I allowed her a glass of beer once a day, 
she'd manage to keep up nicely.' 

'But Mr. Evelyn decidedly objected to Maida's 
continuing longer than possible in her present 
position. Maida had acted as housemaid, parlour- 
maid, and cook, for about a fortnight, when one 
morning her mistress bustled into the kitchen and 
announced visitors to an early dinner. By way of 
thoroughly enlisting her servant's very necessary 
sympathies, she entered into a familiar gossip, 
telling Maida that the friends she expected ^ 




THE COXFLiCT. 109 

incidents. In olden days a family secret was con- 
sidered safe when the person from whom it had to 
be preserved, or in whose keeping it was, wandered 
to foreign shores ; the death of the party concerned 
could not render its position more secure. But 
noWj all you who have secrets to preserve from 
friends distant on Australian shores, or a family 
misfortune to hide from happily unconscious and 
absent relatives, be advised — discover your secret, 
unfold your misfortune, for if you do not others 
will ; you must haste to give the information, or 
you will not be the first to break it to those who 
justly expect to share your joys and sorrows. In 
these days of telegraph and steam, of gold-seekers 
and gold-finders, there is no spot in the earth 
except your own breast that can give safe cover to 
yo)ir secret. Everyone has a brother or a sister, 
a cousin or a friend, or an old servant in the 
colonies; anyone of whom may circulate your news 
with additions of his own, making those angry 
whom you might have made pleased, sowing dis- 
cord when you might have planted peace. 

The company arrives ; the dinner is punctually 
served ; when, prompt in clean white apron and 
spotless cap, Maida attends behind her mistress's 
chair. A heated colour in her cheeks is the only 
token suggestive of her previous employment. But 
who cares to avail himself of the suggestion ? who 
wants to prove a fact concerning her ? A servant

behind her mistress's chair, what is there in that 
to need explanation P She is supposed to be th^re, 
and, under the supposition, demands are made on 
her by the pronunciation of certain unprotected 
substantives : bread — water— castors. Her actual 
bodily presence is not ascertained, until one of the 
guests just happens to look at her in taking the 
mustard — then, struck by her beauty, he looks and 
looks again. 

At an English dinner-table there would be 
unpoliteness in drawing attention to the serrants in 
waiting ; but here where most domestic sympaliiies 
settle around one point, and that point is O. F. S. O., 
there is no breach of etiquette in doing so; a guest 
as naturally askg questions about a servant whose 
superior manners or efficient waiting attract his 
notice, as he compliments his entertainer on a 
thrivrng rose-bush, or his child's imprared healths 

Notwithstanding bis only having just arrived

Significant gesticulations passed between them. 

* No particular news iix)m home, then, Sanford T 
asked Mr. Herbert, in order to divert attention 
which he perceived was annoying to Maida. 

* N — no— all very flat ; Punch can hardly strike 
a spark of fim out of the whole nation.' 

^ Talking of marriages, and old school days, 
Clara, do you remember a pretty little girl called 
Doveton, whom we great girls used to pet,' recon- 
tinued the lady who had been calling over school 
reminiscences with Mrs. Evelyn, when Mr. Sand*- 
ford's remark arrested her. 

* Perfectly ; you don't mean to say she is 
married ?' 

* Yes, she isj and very well married too.' 

* What, little Mary Doveton !' cried Mrs. 
Evelyn. 

Maida listened eagerly. 

* She is a very charming woman, I assure 
you.' 

* I don't doubt it ; but it is difficult to imagine 
her a woman — a slight, fragile fairy as she is, to my 
recollection.' 

* She has lost neither fairyhood nor simplicity : 
in womanhood she is as fairy-like as ever, and just 
as simple.' 

* Who is the happy man, I wonder ? Do I know 
him ?' 

* A Captain Norwell ; such a handsome man

they make a most bewitching couple, and are all 
the rage.' 

' Norwell ! Norwell !' repeated Mr. Herbert, ' the 
name seems familiar, but I cannot recall the man, 
I should like to, for I well remember little Mary 
Doveton, though I have not seen her since Clara 
was at Mrs. Compton's school.' 

' When you used to bring me notes from my 
friends in Hoharton, little thinking you were 
obliging your ftituve sister-in-law, Mr. Herbert!' 
added Mrs. Evelyn, laughing. 

' Norwell ! Norwell !' exclaimed another heart 
in that room as tumultuous feelings draped the 
colour from her face, and unsteadied her whole 
frame. 

' Well, I hope he will make her a good husband.' 

' There is no fear of that, he is a fine, noble 
fellow, his wife literally worships him,' answered 
Mr. Saudford. Mrs. Evelyn had for some seconds 




THE COXFUCT. 113 

* What ails the woman ?' tapped Mrs. Evelyn, 
as Maida staggered beneath the weight of a tray 
not over heavy. The rest of the dinner was a 
series of vexed taps and nods on the part of Mrs. 
Evelyn, and mistakes on the yart of Maida. Her 
manner was perfectly calm and collected, therefore 
the more unaccountable to her mistress were the 
strange inadvertencies of her actions. 

Maida hasted to be solitary. No doubt existed 
in her mind that the Captain Norwell with whom 
her fate so cruelly blended had been married to 
Mary Doveton. 

She longed for night, which alone could bring 
her an uninterrupted review of all that she had 
heard, or afford her an opportunity for calm decision 
in the difficulty before her. 

Night came. With a throbbing heart, as though 
she were going to an interview of which she dreaded 
the result, Maida sat herself down to a severe 
scrutiny of her own feelings, arraigning before her 
judgment each motive whose promptings she 
doubted. She remained for some time in delibera- 
tion, then looking about as if in search, she remem- 
bered she had neither pen, ink, nor paper, and all 
three were necessary to her purpose. What could 
she do ? she wished not to wait till the morrow, 
lest opportunity should fail her. There was no 
book from which she could tear the fly-leaf She 
thought of Emmeline — but she must not be dis-

turbed ; she then remembered that Mr. Herbert 
was often in his study to a very late hour. Slipping 
off her shoes, she crept down stairs; the action 
reminded her of that fatal morning, wh^ seeking 
to shield her babe fivm the stem gra^ of justice, 
she crept away to give it loving burial. 

The remembrance served to strengtiien her in 
her determination. 

A streak of light issuing irom Mr. Herbert's 
study, told her that she could get her wants 
supplied ; she knocked, and he opened the door. 

' Yon, Maida !' 

' Yes, sir. Will you give me a few sheets of 
paper, and a pen and ink ?' 

' It is late for such a request.' 

' I have no time by day.' 

' Leave it till to-morrow, and I will try to pro- 
cure leisure for you.' 

' No, thank you ; I require that concentration

do SO with much uneasiness. As Maida Gwynn- 
ham I trust you — but — ' 

* As a convict you are bound to doubt me, and 
correctly so, sir. I as much honour you for the 
one feeling as I thank you for the other ; but, Mr. 
Herbert, you cannot know Maida Gwynnham as 
she knows herself, or you would trust her as little 
in hersdf B& in her convict state. However, your 
trust shall not be misplaced, though I will do my 
best to displace your doubt J 

As Maida met the calm, reflective countenance 
before her, how sure she felt that in Mr. Herbert 
lay both ability and will to assist her. She longed 
to open her troubled and conflicting mind to his 
advice. She never so yearned for friendly counsel 
as in this predicament, when she perceived that a 
false move might ruin the gentle being she wished 
to serve, or an indiscreet word have the opposite 
effect to that which she desired. She could bear 
to herself all that only touched herself; but now 
that one, whom she reverenced in her purity, had 
come unconsciously into her secret, she longed to 
hear from other lips a corroboration of the opinion 
she had formed, and an approval of the course she 
was resolved to adopt; but neither friend nor 
counsellor dared she seek. Alone, alone, must she 
pass this fierce ordeal ; alone, unsympathised with, 
and unadvised, she must tear from her heart her 
last, though unacknowledged, hope in life. Placing 



116 THE BROAD ARROW. 

the materials for writing on a wooden box, which 
served her instead of a table, she knelt before it 
and commenced a letter to Norwell ? but she could 
not satisfy herself. Fastidious over his feelings as 
over her own, she destroyed sheet after sheet when 
she had partly written it. She wished to deal 
faithfully — to warn, threaten, promise him ; but 
she would not reproach him. After many efforts 
she produced the following letter : — 



* To Captain Norwell. 
'SrR, 

' I WAS standing behind my mistress's chair 
to-day, when I learnt from the conversation at the 
dinner-table that you had married Miss Doveton. 
Circumstances unknown to you have made me 
acquainted with that lady, and awakened in my 
breast a deep interest in her welfare — an interest 




THE CONFLICT. 117 

' My sole object in writing is to point out to you 
the moral diflference created by your marriage in 
our respective positions. 

* From what I was obliged to hear at the dinner- 
table, I deem it probable you may become informed 
of my having heard of your marriage, and I fear 
you m^y in consequence write to me to avert the 
effects of anger you may suppose me to feel, and 
in so doing run risk of exposing truths to your wife 
which would put an end to the enviable ignorance 
so necessary to her happiness. To anticipate your 
fears, and prevent their consequences, I engage by 
this letter to remain silent, as I have hitherto 
been; but to this engagement I attach. Captain 
Norwell, these solemn conditions (and I have 
the means of observing their performance by 
you), first, that you shall be kind ancj faithful 
to your wife ; second, that you write no more to 
me. 

* Do not mistake my meaning, nor misinterpret 
leniency of expression into feebleness of purpose. 
I wish you clearly to understand that, if you again 
risk discovery by committing to paper things in- 
tended only for me, or if you fail to be kind and 
faithful to your wife, I shall no longer consider

employ for promoting the happiness of one who

gratification I experience in bearing that part of 
my punishment which is your due. This being 
the last time you will hear from me, I will satisfy 
your inquiries before concluding, hoping that, at 
least as to a part, my replies will free you from 
embarrassment in the moral fulfilment of your 
marriage vow. ^ 

'You inquire, first, whether I love you still? 
My answer is, No I This answer is not extorted 
from me by the knowledge of to-day. My love 
for you has been loi^ since forbidden by the judg- 
ment of ray conscience, forced into maturity by 
sorrow and reflection. I sifled with painM rigour 
the jealous emotion I felt on hearing of your mar- 
ri^e ; and I discovered, with joyfiil truth, that it 
was due to surprise alone. Becollection returned, 
and the emotion was gone, leaving no trace of dis- 
appointment. You next ask whether I am com- 
fortable. I do not suppose you know the bitter 




THE CONFLICT. 119 

I have received from you during my transported 
life, 

*And remain, Sir, 

* Yours faithfully, 

* Maida Gwynnham.' 

The letter finished, the rigid discipline where- 
neith she had controlled her heart into obedience 
to her reason was laid aside. With a trembling 
grasp she seized the letter, and with an anxious 
eye she perused it aloud. She wondered how her 
hand had brought itself to pen the cold, stem 
characters before her. When she came to the 
question, *Do you love me still?* her voice 
quavered, her long lash fell and concealed the 
expression of agony that lay beneath. She could 
not form the round, cold No upon lips so unsteady ; 
it died away in an unspoken murmur. She was 
thankful that, secured beyond chance of escape, it 
would reach Norwell in a form betraying neither 
her regret nor her agitation. She was thankful it 
was not to be entrusted to her, but to be delivered 
in a letter. He will look on the answer, and see 
only in it the prompt and simple No. He will 
know nothing of the pained power that has been 
put forth to pen that one short word : he will note 
only firmness in the deep mark that underlines 
it into emphasis, and will say, Ah, that is like 
Maida! He has not witnessed the effort with 



120 THE BROAD ARROW. 

which the undecided heart was made to draw that 
iinal renunciation to a claim that hy right of justice 
was its own, so suspects not that that one short 
word is the token of victory after a severe con- 
flict. 

She was thankful, too, that the writing to him 
had not been practicable at the moment she heard 
the tidings ; her impulsive nature might then have 
hurried her into reproach, despicable to her calmer 
mood ; or might have impelled her to a display of 
those sufferings of which she scorned to complain. 

Having read and re-read the letter many times, 
and being at last convinced that it contained no 
infliction from which it would be prudent to spare 
Norwell, or no expression that could create a mis- 
giving in his mind, or mislead him as t» her inten- 
tion or the state of her feelings towards him, she 
folded it, and enclosing three letters lately received 
from him, she melted together the wax broken 




THE COXPUCT. 121 

slackened step, she retarned to the house, not 
caring by whom she might be met, or whom she 
might encounter. 

When the family assembled for prayers, Mr. 
Herbert knew, by the languidness of her appear- 
ance, that she had passed a night of unrest. He 
regarded her with a peculiar interest, for he, too, 
had endured hours of suspense and watch, and all 
on her behalf. Of this, however, she was as little 
aware as that her haggard and yet determined 
countenance had seriously alarmed him when she 
presented herself at his door, and preferred her 
strange request She was in ignorance also of the 
source from which, perhaps, she had derived 
strength and power to pen that letter to Norwell. 
She knew not that while she was pining for some 
one on whose judgment and counsel she might 
rely, even then that holy man, whose friendship 
she would not cultivate, whose advice she could 
not seek, was kneeling for her at the footstool of 
Infinite Love, and imploring that, though led into 
temptation, she might be delivered from evil. 

She knew not that from behind his shutter he 
had watched her go out, nor that he had followed 
her in the agonised belief that she had gone to her 
self-destruction; nor that the only rest he had 
taken for the night was from the time of her return 
from the post to the present hour. Believing as 
he did that Maida was the prey of some great 



122 THE BROAD ARROW. 

mystery, and that the indifference she exhibited 
was only a mask assumed to hide the writhings of 
a spirit, every one of whose fine and complex 
powers of suffering were daily taxed to torment ; 
and perceiving that, coexistent with this spirit, 
there warred within her a principle of freedom 
that detested the slavery she endured bo uncom- 
plainingly, Mr. Herbert continually dreaded to 
hear that she had sought the last resource of over- 
burdened and unsanctified suffering, and exchanged 
the fetters of life for the illusive liberty of death. 

When, therefore, so pale and ghost-like, Maida 
stood before him at that strange weird hour and 
asked for writing materials, he granted her desire, 
feeling it would he useless to deny it, and hoping 
that bis concession might touch her into confidence. 
But when he saw her depart, calm and intrepid as 
she had come, his uneasiness increased into alarm. 
Copnectiiig. as he did, her demand for papers and

her, and in watching her movements. Having 
committed his fears and suspicions to Him who 
alone can order the unruly wills of His creatures, 
Mr. Herbert retired to his room, and placing open 
the door, he commenced his anxious vigil, listening 
to every night sound, as tliough it were fraught 
with important results. Several times he went to 
Maida's apartment, and listened without until some 
noise within satisfied him that she was there. 

When the twilight glimmered through his shutter 
he prepared to take the rest so needed by mind 
and body. Wrapping about him his morning 
gown, he threw himself on his couch. He had 
scarcely done sp when he distinctly heard a door 
unbolt, and a stealthy footstep on the stair. Then 
he heard the creaking latch of the drawing-room 
window. He sprang to his window, and in another 
moment saw Maida hurrying down the garden. 
By the same exit he followed her warily and at a 
distance, until he perceived that her errand, though 
mysterious, was harmless. With a thankful heart 
he retraced his steps, and cast off the burden of 
solicitude which had made the night one of weari- 
ness and distress.

CHAPTER VI. 



AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 



' Neifher have ye btought ogaia that which woe driven away, 
neither have je eoi^ht that which was lost : but with force and cmel^ 
have ye ruled them.' 

No ■sooner had the garden gate closed on Robert 
and Lucy, than Mr. Evelyn instructed Maida to 
unlock the waiting-room and conduct thence to 
their several destinations the servants who had 
arrived to take the place of the wedded pair. 
There were one man and two women. John 
Gro(^e she was to take to an outhouse which Mr. 
Evelyn had improved into a room for the use of all 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 125 

started to her feet, and became so agitated that 
when Maida entered she stood before her as one 
palsy stricken. 

Tammy Matters and Googe were old hands ; 
they at once recognised in Maida a fellow-servant ; 
but the expiree, mistaking her for her mistress, 
bowed, lowly, before her, to the amusement of the 
others. 

* Grab hold of honor whilst you can get it, mate ; 
she won't be long a missusing you,' said Googe to 
Maida. 

In leaving the room Tammy punctiliously ob- 
served the right of precedence. With a circular 
jerk of her elbow she edged Diprose back and 
herself forward : it was not to be thought of, that a 
new expiree should walk before her, who was 
almost due for her ticket. Casting a smile of con- 
tempt at the government brown, she smoothed down 
her own clothes with a smirk of approbation, glanc- 
ing self-satisfied at the finery which apparelled her 
into a figure surpassingly grotesque. Every pos- 
sible texture of material had been pressed into her 
bodily service. Her black bonnet had evidently 
been an apron ; the silk, drawn tightly over a piece 
of shapeless pasteboard, revealed this secret by 
exhibiting alternate rows of tiny holes and greasy 
marks where the folds had lain. A whole nosegay 
of soiled, davvered flowers of every sort hung 
loosely from one side of the bonnet, and flapped up 



126 THE BROAD ARROW. 

and down with a constancy that reminded one of 
perpetual motion. Her gown of bright-coloured 
muslin barely reached her ancles ; it coxild not 
have been lei^hened but at the expense of one of 
the five flounces adorning the skirt — an expense 
that neither Tammy's love of finery nor hatred of 
needlework could sanction. A relic of the ' Anson,' 
in the form of the prisoners' blue checked necker- 
chief, pinned shawl fashion on her neck, completed 
her attire. The convict petticoat, thoi^h looped 
up to suit the peculiarity of the muslin, was visible 
beneath the dress. 

As Taminy professed to excellence in cookery, 
and to just the contrary in the house department, 
Mrs. Evelyn decided that she and Maida should 
exchange situations. The latter therefore became 
housemaid, and was consequently brought into 
rnore frequent contact with Miss Evelyn, for whom 
she had long entertained a deep but unacknow- 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 127 

irradiated the inner life of the invalid, Maida would 
listen and linger, longing to hear more ; then, when 
she could linger no more, she would gather all she 
had heard into her mind and bear it away ; and 
often during the day, which to her was ever of toil 
and trial, she would dwell upon the words of peace 
and love, and bless the hps that had spoken them 
to her. 

With what special interest watched the great 
Adversary of Souls the spiritual fluctuations of this 
tempted woman ! How perseveringly did he try 
to hoLl her back from all that might benefit her ! 
How cunningly devised were the hindrances he 
placed in her way ! When, despite his endeavours, 
a grain of the precious seed of truth found access to 
her mind, how subtle in its common-placeness was 
the means adopted to defraud her of it, or to 
destroy its fructifying power ! A sharp and unde- 
served rebuke from her mistress, a degrading 
familiarity from one of her fellow-servants, a 
threat, a provocation, were contrivances by which 
all Emmeline's example and Mr. Herbert's teach- 
ing were rendered useless. And yet, we know 
not why we should specify this as peculiar of 
Maidas career. A similar strife between the 
powers of light and darkness is everywhere being 
carried on. Whether in the person of the aged 
believer or in the young wavering disciple, whether 
in the bold confessed outlaw or in the timid youth 



128 THE BROAD ARROW. 

hesitating over his first crime, Satan is awake the 
wide world over, everywhere arrogant over what 
he holds, and rampant for that which is beyond his 
reach. Imitating God, he despises not the day of 
small things. But with Maida, and with others in 
like condemnation, the strife is more apparent, the 
vacillations more striking, there not being the 
restraints and decorums of free life to hide them. 

One afternoon, when Maida had occupied the 
situation of housemaid for three months, Mr. 
Evelyn determined to try the experiment of send- 
ing her out alone (hitherto he had adhered to his 
regulation, and only let her go out under the 
guardianship of one of the family). Bridget's bad 
headache afforded him an excuse for the experi- 
ment. Summoning Maida, and assuming that 
severity of manner which he reserved for state 
occasions, he told her that he was about to test the 
sincerity of her intentions, and try if she would be 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 129 

perform a few errands in the city. When she was 
ready to go, Mr Evelyn himself conducted her to 
the gate, and, shutting it upon her, said — 

*It is now three o'clock, I shall expect you 
home before five — ^now, mind !' 

* I wonder how she feels, going out alone for the 
first time,' exclaimed Bridget, as her uncle returned 
to the drawing-room. * How she must hate me, as 
the poor unfortunate always made to follow her 
about ; I'm sure I hate it for her.' 

* She doesn't care that for it :' and Uncle Ev 
fiUipped, to demonstrate the that. *She is the 
queerest creature that ever came into my possession. 
I shall be right glad if Herbert does anything for her 
in the converting line, so as to bring down a little 
of her pride. Poor soul ! I pity her to my heart. 
By-the-by, Miss Bridget, you doubt that I have 
a hearty do you not?' 

As five o'clock drew near, a perceptible, though 
unallowed anxiety pervaded the whole family. 
Emmeline and Bridget both tried to divert Mr. 
Evelyn's attention from the waning moments, but 
without knowing that their efibrt was perceived by 
each other. Each hoped she was succeeding to 
admiration, for Uncle Ev, standing with his hands 
tucked behind his coat, appeared to answer, or at 
any rate to acknowledge, by rapid hemSy all that 
they told him of Charlie's precocities or baby's 
tricks ; but as the clock struck five, the locality of 

VOL. II. K 



130 THE BROAD ARROW. 

his previous thoughts was at once determined ; he 
pulled the bell with a loud click, and then, walking 
out of the room, called over the stairs — 

' Gwynnhain home ?' 

The fatal ' No, sir,' came back, and sent a cold 
shiver throi^h Emmeline, who, turning silently 
towards her uncle, saw by his countenance, that 
wrath was determined against Maida. 

Bridget had already left the room, and, forget- 
ting her headathe, was putting on her bonnet to 
go in search of the fugitive. But Uncle Ev, who 
also seemed to be going out, met her on the stairs, 
and she knew, by the tone of the voice that bade 
her return, that resistance or inquiry would be use- 
less. She looked at him ; there could be no harm 
in that, yet it seemed quite the wrong thing to 
do. 

'Go in to your cousin; there's no knowing when 
I shall be back,' frowned Uncle Ev : and he 




AlSr OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 131 

wandered over the field, whose dreary aspect had 
naught to break its dull monotony save the ridges, 
which heaved its surface at careless intervals, 
giving it more the appearance of land prepared for 
the sower, than of that already sown for the human 
harvest, of which the poet so touchingly writes : 
but it needed the symmetry of the husbandman's 
labour to make even outward resemblance to that 
rude picture complete. The inner picture, ah ! 
who would dare compare ; the contrast strikes too 
vividly. The husbandman ploughs his acres, and 
his heart goes with his work ; each furrow receives 
his hope, his prayer, as well as his goodly grain. 
The grave is prepared with curses: the human 
seed is sown prayerlessly, tearlessly, for we do not 
call the formal, grudged service mumbled over the 
prison dead, a prayer — and tears, who expects 
them at a convict funeral ? The eyes to shed them 
are across the ocean. The seed is sown, the earth 
is shovelled over it, and who cares to ask or think 
in what appearing shall it arise ? 

Maida leaned quietly for a few moments. The 
slow movement of her head from one part of the 
field to the other denoted rather a general survey 
of it as one object of sadness, than a search for a 
particular spot over which to feel a particular 
sorrow. She suddenly started, and, standing 
erectly, gazed, intent, towards the furthest extremity 
of the field. Until this instant three men, partially 



132 THE BROAD ARROW. 

hidden by the increased height of fence, had 
escaped her notice. With a quick cry of im- 
,patience she sprang over the barrier and confronted 
two low-foreheaded, brutal-visaged prisoners, who 
were wantonly abusing their trust by kicking about 
and otherwise ill-treating two coffins that had been 
left them to inter. As Maida now stood before 
them, one of the coffins was lying edgewise, having 
rolled off from two graves of unequal size on 
which it had been tossed ; the other, almost raised 
to an upright posture, was supported by a heap of 
rubbish. 

The younger man was a simple-looking fellow : 
he had been an obedient tool in the hands of the 
other two, who appeared to delight in the matter- 
of-fact manner in which the youth received and 
carried out their orders, whilst they spread it over 
the dead bodies. The burial service of course had 
been performed ; but that invested the corpses 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 133 

buried ; cannot you let their mangled bodies rest in 
peace?'* 

* Round away, then, my pretty one! round 
away on us ! Who may you be ? Remember we 
are alone together,' replied the elder man, in a 
voice of impudent raillery. 

*We are alone, but I am safe. The wretch 
that could insult the dead, would fear to touch the 
living.' 

She fixed her eye steadily upon him, and as she 
read the brutal characters delineated in his face, 
she fancied one by one appeared features she had 
scanned before, but where, or under what circum- 
stances, she could not recall. 

'Is it so, my darling? Then how comes Bob 
Pra^ out here ? Giles Waddy there can tell to 
that — can't ye, Gi ? He'll warrant ye I've touched 
the living 'fore now, and that with no chicken-heft, 
I'll promise ye ; a chinker gied by Bob Pragg an't 
a gift of every day.' 

With an involuntary shudder and look of ill- 
disguised disgust, Maida, deeming it useless to 
interfere with two such men, and yet longing to see 
the coffins beyond reach of further insult, dropped 
her voice to a scarcely audible whisper — 

* It ig a common supposition among the prisoners that after death 
their bodies are handed to the doctors for the public good, and that,, 
when the doctors have finished with them, the mangled remains are 
carelessly thrown into a coffin, without any regard to decency— and 
carried away to the burying. 



134 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

' They are prisoners.' 

' They was, but I reckon they free enough now. 
Foi^ery and lifting,' he continued, as if that had 
been their names. 

' And j/ou are prisoners ?' said Maida. 

' In the Queen's service ! Government livery, 
blue and gold — no mistake. Can you sport a fig 
of baccy ?' 

Bob touched his cap, mock reverentially, and 
winked to Gi. 

' Who may your graceship be ?' 

Another touch of the cap, and wink to the 
youngest man, who had never withdrawn his gaze 
from Maida. 

' / — am — a — prisoner,' said Maida, speaking 
slowly and distinctly. 

The trio started in unfeigned astonishiuent. 

' My eyes !' at last ejaculated the youngest. 

' I wouldn't scarce believed it, if I'd seen the 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 135 

* We are all prisoners, then,' proceeded Maida. 
* Should we not, therefore, show more feeling 
towards each Dther ? Fancy : to be so treated by 
their brothers in trouble, and that when they are 
unable to resist I' 

Her eye again began to gather fire, and her 
speech animation. It was not in her wholly to 
control the indignation struggling in her breast. 

^ They have had a life of degradation and misery 
— surely in death, when the oppressor can no 
longer reach them, their own comrades should let 
them rest in peace !' 

* Oh, they took't it easy — 'tisn't all takes on as 
very like you did. Most on us couldn't be worse 
off than we was m England. Most on us only 
turned rogue when we couldn't turn a bellyful from 
honest work. To them what don't care for the 
name on it, it's better to be here with full bellies 
and hard work than 't 'ome with empty maws and 
idle jaws — that is when a feller can keep blind eye 
of the goverment coves — they'm mighty partial 
where they pleases !' 

*Then you'll bury them at once?' interposed 
Maida, but Giles had not finished. 

* Tho' I says it myself, I'd never have been out 
here, if I'd got work at home. I was as willing to 
live by fair means as any man going ; but honest 

thoughts won't fill a poor fool's belly, and, 

me! if it'll stop his children's bawl. When I 



136 THE BROAD ARROW. 

frisked a crib the fast time, I'd no thought o' doing 
it again ^ but then I found a wideawake Bort of 
feeling come out of the job — a feeling that seemed 
to put fresh life in me ; so I went on till I'd no 
notion of toiling a week for what I could get in a 
night, and joined company with a cracksman, and 
got la^ed after a while — and now I'm your 
humble servant.' 

The thoughtful tone into which he had lapsed 
during this retrospection vanished during the last 
five words, and he appeared, by a sudden and 
remarkable transition of countenance, again to be- 
come Giles Waddy, the ruffian. Maida attempted 
to speak, hut Giles again stopped her, on which 
Bob Pra^ commented — 

'Gi's on his pet fiddle-string now — scrape, 
scrape he'll go, till you wish hearty you'd never 
meddled with sober folks in their occupation — 
there, scrape — scrape, he goes again.' 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 137 

wise 'eds — any day I'd rather be one of the drove 
than the driver.' 

* Anyhow, we'll all roll into hell together ! but 
don't you talk pious there — you'd no call to turn 
rogue — you know you turned because you admired 
the trade.' 

A loud gruff laugh sounded through the ground. 
Maida stamped impatiently, but speak with 
authority again she dared not — not on her own 
account, but for the sake of the dead. Any burst 
of anger would be visited on those who lay helpless 
at her feet, for, with the young man's assistance, 
she had laid the coffins in a proper position. 

* Now, then, do let us bury them !' she said. 

* Us \ Heft away, then ; but no harm in being 
merry over the confounded job. Leave alone 
there' (to the young man) — *no use to try it; the 
hole's too small for two on 'em.' 

' It shan't be for want of trying, then,' and Giles 
kicked the topmost off, and jumping on the under 
one, endeavoured to squeeze it down a few inches 
by stamping his full weight on it ; then, with an 
awful curse, he called on the young man to help 
drag it out from the hole. 

Maida could witness it no longer in silence — 

* I'll report you, and shall glory in the punish- 
ment you get. Give me the spade !' 

Before Giles could resist, she had snatched 
the implement from him, and in the strength of 



138 THE BROAD ARROW. 

excitement had struck it deep into the tough 
mould. 

Giles raised his arm to strike her, but a loud 
guffaw, and a meaning wink from Bob, arrested the 
blow. 

' Gi, you'll be a fool if you quarT with her for 
doing your work. Let her have a heft at it whilst 
we take a spell over yonder.' 

Another wink in the direction of a distant part 
of the ground, made Gi, though somewhat sullenly, 
let fall his arm, and follow Bob to the spot. The 
young man was about to join them, but Bob 
nutted him back with — 

' Go on courtin' the ladies with them great gog- 
lers of yourn, Sam I I should think your lantern- 
jaws had well stuck fast by the gapin' they've had. 
But she's an old hand for the gents, and maybe 
you'll do in want of a sprucer sweetheart,' 

' Ha, ha, ha 1' from Giles, and— 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 13 & 

mighty good temper that day, or she'd have had a 
dance on the tight rope ! Be blostered ! if she 
wouldn't have cut a few capers worth seeing of.' 

In the flush that dyed Maida's cheek and temple 
as the spade drew heavily back, Sam saw only the 
natural effect of unusual effort — we, who know 
more of Maida, discern pain in its fervour, and 
mighty mental conflict in that involuntary closing 
of the lid, as the inward fire shone lustrous crimson 
through the transparent skin. A few more des- 
perate onslaughts, and resting, as any wearied 
delver might rest, one foot on the bottom of the 
spade and one hand on the top, Maida turned 
and took her first look at Sam. His eyes were 
riveted on her so fully that he was obliged to give 
a number of small twinkles before he could unfix 
them. It was now for Maida to gaze at him, which 
she did, in silence, for many seconds, and then, 
* Poor lad !' burst from her lips. 

* Sam, how old are you ?' 

But Sam did not answer ; he seemed too busy 
replying to mental queries of his own. 

Whatever the replies were, they finally converged 
into a focus in the form of a question, which, though 
couched in lowly phrase, appeared to give him 
infinite satisfaction. 

*Let's take a heft on't. Like you'm sweatin*, 
miss ?' 

*No, Sam, you are tired ; let us talk a little.' 



140 THE BROAD ARROW. 

' With me, ma'am !' 

Wonder added to their former admiration, the 
glassy blue gobies again took posseBsion of Maida's 
fece. 

' Yes — why not with me ?' 

' Be you a prisoner, sure, ma'am ?' 

The ' ma'am ' came so naively and so aptly from 
his lips, that Maida accepted it from the poor lad 
as a tribute of respect irom which she had long 
been estrai^d. 

' I am your fellow-prisoner.' 

' A sight o' difference 'tween us tho' 1' 

And Sam, as if referring only to personal dis- 
parity, deliberately viewed Maida and then himself 
from head to foot 

' You've got a whole back of fine clothes.' 

'Ah, but there is this beneatbi them!' bitterly 
said she, again showing the convict brown. 

' And I cau't keep out of yellows 




AX OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 141 

immoveable goggles remained firm to their 
watch. 

A. faint and sad smile found its way to her lips, 
in spite of the aching load that dragged downwards 
all desire to smile. 

*No, Sam, I'm sick in a way that you cannot 
understand. You don't seem very suited to those 
clothes ; tell me how you came by them.' 

The youth lolled his ample tongue in his mouth 
in <}uiet satisfaction that he had permission to talk 
— a comfort he seldom enjoyed in the crowded 
desolation of the Tench, where older and rougher 
voices — ^when any voice was allowed — asserted the 
pre-eminence both in pitch and in period ; while 
younger ones, fearful the blame of the uproar would 
fall on them, found refuge from the strife of tongues 
either in self-enforced silence or sullen moodiness. 

*Must I tell how I got lagged, or how I gets 
into trouble ?' 

* Tell me all you like ; it does me good to hear 
of other persons' troubles. Tell me about mother, 
and father, and all.' 

The prospect of an uninterrupted recital glisten- 
ing before him, reflected a thin glaze of pleasure 
on his sickly face, and put a moment's life into 
the glassy opacity of his eye. 

^ I never had no father, as I know on ; and 
mother — the naybors all took shy on her, cos she'd 
got me ; and when I came nigh to 'em they shoved 



142 THE BROAD ARROW. 

me ofi^ and said, I'd no b'isness to be bom ; I 
wasn't nothin' to nobody ; and mother fretted, and 
said, I was everythin' to her, because she hadn't 
got nothin* else.' 

Here another loll of his tongue, followed by a 
thick swallow, stopped Sam for an instant; and 
when Maida glanced towards him, the goggles had 
not removed, but their earnestness seemed subdued 
by a mist that had overspread them. 

' The naybors said she was taJting to bad ways, 
but she told me she wasn't ; she used to tell me 
everythin', tho' I didn't know much what it meant 
then — but now sims to me I was a jackass for not 
knowing. Well, missus, one afternoon she'd sat 
crying — sims I see her now ! and I was nation bad 
hungered. " Mother," says I, " shan't us get nothin'

word that ^e'd ever gave me — sims I hear her 
now ! Her says, " Mother me to-morrow, you

and bawled, — " I believe you 1 it's good for nothin' 
else ; but it doesn't do for starving wretches — it 
takes too long a-comin'." I was gettin' most afraid 
of her ; thinks I, the devil's got hold on her. Well, 
missus, then she went out, and brought me back 
some rare grub, so that I got a rale bellyful ; she 
looked on at me all the while. When I'd done, 
she took her bonnet, and said to me, — " You won't 
want nothin more to-day, Samuel. If I'm not 
back by dark, go to bed ; and if I an't back to 
mornin', and the folks coms to ask for me, tell 'em 
I'm gone out to look for justice ; perhaps I'll have 
to go t'other side of the water to find 'en." And, 
great jackass, I never know'd what she was up to ; 
so I never see'd her again — and then the naybors 
said she had drownded herself.' 

The mist condensed into large drops, which 
passing over his high cheek-bone, and through the 
hollow beneath, fell to the earth — the only tear 
that had moistened that loveless grave, yawning 
for the lonely dead. 

' And you, poor Sam ?' 

' I was sent to the house, and I ran away ; and 
then they got hold on me, and said, I*d do famous 
for 'em if I'd be a pluckey chap, and never round 
on 'em ; so they took't me for winders, cos I was 
slim as a black-worm — and warn't I glad to go with 
'em ! — ^jist suited me, for I baint bright in my head. 
Winders is asy work, when they baint stiflp uus.' 



144 THE BBOAD ARROTT. 

' Who brought you up, Sam ?' 

' Them cracksmen — they was very good by me ; 
I never got flayed for aught but bluodering ; and 
I was a sight happier then than I be now.' 

Again could Maida scarce refrain a smile at his 
simplicity. He told his tale so utterly unvarnished 
by sentiment, or smothered by compunction, that 
it was evident the words right and wrong had no 
place in his moral dictionary. 

* But, Sam, don't you think you are better off, 
even as a convict, than you were, living with those 
wicked men, and doing their wicked work for 
them?' 

' My eyes! — no.' 

And Sam stared, as if the stare should say' — 
' You arn't half the one I took you for.' 

Maida looked intently on him, to discern the 
source of this reply : — 

' What 1 not be on the road to honesty, instead 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 145 

very wicked of you to do what those men bade 
you, and to lead so bad a life V 

* I hadn't no other — 'sides I was brought up to 
it fiist.' 

*But why — why did you run away from the 
poor-house, Sam ? that was your first wrong step/ 

' I didn't like it/ 

This reply was given in so decided a manner 
that Sam evidently considered it as much without 
appeal to others as it had been to himself; he 
therefore goggled double power (suspicion gaining 
on admiration) when Maida expressed disapproba- 
tion. The poor fellow seemed anxious to please 
his new-found friend. What could he say ? He 
longed to hear his voice, and yet he would rather 
lose that pleasure than vex her and involve him- 
self. The convict fear and mistrust, although dis- 
played in the widened gape and gaze, instead of 
the piercing glance and evasive response of intelli- 
gence, were as strong in him as in brighter 
specimens. 

* Dun no that I'd do it again, missus. Parson 
Evelyn talks about it fine — he found me in cells 
one day, and he talked till most I cried ; and then 
says he, — " My boy, if you'd got your time over 
again, do you think you'd run away from the 
workhouse, now I've explained why it was fool- 
ish of you to do so ?" " Drat me if I would !" 
says I ; " sims I were a big jackass for rinnin' —

but I weren't up to it then ; but boys is boys, sir, 
and nothin' else." 

' Then the parson — sims I see him now — rose 
up, and laid his two 6ngers on my shoulder ; and 
sims he smiled — for his voice weren't like *twas 
'fore. Says he, — " Why, what be now, Sam ? 
You an't no more than a boy." " Sir I baint I ?" 
said I, "sims I feels mighty old. A sight o' 
things comes by every day, though nothin' don't 
sim to happen out of 'em ; so I feels like a 
man." 

'Then he sat down again, and says — "What 
d'ye mean, Sam ? Tell me all about it." But 
though I was full of it, I couldn't speak it out — so 
I only gaped at 'en. So then says he — " Ah, 
I know all about it, Sam ; so you needn't set your 
brain a thinking — more things happen than ought 
to happen to such a youngster." This yer weren't 
aid to me, for he gozzled it out of bis throat like ;

me up to the triangle, — I owes you a tickler, 
and now I'll pay'e." 

* Parson bolted out when I told un this, and I 
set up a howl after un ; thought I, won't I catch it 
if the parson rounds on me ! But he came back 
quiet as a fool ; says he, only talking half loud — 
" Sam, my boy, you'll get into worse trouble, if 
you make this row." Then he sheered again, and 
I bawled after un—" Sir ! Sir!! Sir!!!" And he 
comes again, and says — "Well" "You got it 
out of me, sir ; don't-'e go and tell 'em. I could 
not bear another thrashin'. Oh ! don't-'e — don't-'e, 
parson," says I to un. Then he spoke so solemn, 
he made a feller shake : — " Sam, I am God's 
minister. I tell no one but Him of anythin' that 
my people tells me. You may always speak out 
to me, my boy ; but mind, I'll have no bad words, 
nor lies. I can always find out the truth." I 
pulled bob to 'un ; but, for all I wanted, I couldn't 
say — " Thank your grace." Then he comes in 
right again, and took't his seat as if he had never 
left it, and says — *' Sam, why were you so fooiish 
as to pick up the pipe, to*vex the overseer ?" ' 

' Were those his very words, Sam ? try to 
remember,' interrupted Maida. 

* Yes, they were ; I 'membered them 'tickler.' 
Maida well knew that Mr. Herbert used no 

word idly. Repeating those two words, 'foolish^' 
^veXj — she felt sure that they were meant as 



148 THE BROAD ARROW. 

more ^applicable to &e case than stronger expres- 
sions. 

' D'ye like it, miss ? sims tellin' it out's done 
me good,' asked Sam, heaving a sigh of satisfac- 
tion. Maida felt there was not much to like in it, 
as she beheld the poor, lean, lank, miserable youth 
before her ; but she was loth to break the slight 
web of comfort that had unexpectedly wafted across 
his path ; so she replied — * I like to hear about 
Mr. Evelyn, Sam.' 

* Don't 'e like all about mother and me ?' 

' We all like to tell our troubles, and I like you 
to tell yours ; what more did Mr. Evelyn say to 
you?' 

' A lot ; but T don't mind much. He said, if 
I'd get out of trouble, and try to be a good boy, 
then by-and-by he'd get a chap he knows oa to 
hire me out' 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 149 

Maida, and she had hardly thought it, before Sam 
continued — 

* Bob Pragg told me that 'ere ; I ain't clever 
enough, he's a sharp un ; he knows a sight, and he 
baint bad to me when I does what he wants ; but, 
my eyes, when I don't ! Parson warned me of he ; 
but the parson nor nobody else don't know what a 
poor feller what isn't clever, and don'^ know what 
nothin' means, has got to bear from them sharp 
uns ; be 'fraid of they, missus ?' 

He turned his head towards the spot from 
which, preceded by a loud, coarse laugh, the two 
men were issuing. 

* I am not afraid of any one.' 

* My eyes I could 'e fight 'em T 

* Women don't fight, Sam.' 

But Sam gave a little negative-like shake of the 
head, as much as to say, * Don't they, that's all !' 

* They's comin', missus ! and us an't buried 'em.' 

* I am not going to dig any more, Sam. I shall 
make those men finish.' 

How the goggles expanded ! adoration more 
than admiration holding them firm to Maida's face. 
He was too rapt even to ejaculate his favourite 
note, so extra expressive as it would just then have 
been. 

* So, my pretty one ! I thought your flourishes 
wouldn't last us t'other side of the ground. I 
guess you've been making best of your time. Eh, 



150 THE BROAD ARROW. 

Sam ? No blushii^, madam ; an't going to pry 
into lover's secrets ; tho' I swear taint fair that son 
of an ape should have all to enself ; what d'ye 
say, Gi ?' 

A nu(^ from Gi broi^ht Bob to the remem- 
brance of a waning afternoon, and the probability 
of interruption to the plan he had laid durii^ his 
absence. When the two were sufficiently remote, 
by a whisper into Gi's ear. Bob dispelled the sulki- 
ness that had lingered in his slouching movements 
across the field. A sharp whew-w ! was Gi's only 
answer to the whisper. A consultation ensued for 
the nest ten minutes, and then for ten minutes 
more the two squatted on the grass, and chewing 
certain blades of it, gloated over their plan, and 
drank imaginary bumpers to its success ; for what- 
ever else these brethren disagreed in, they both 
cordially united in hatred of Bradley, the convict 
constable, who should now have been superintend- 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 151 

that he was not with the men at their work ?' And 
this very question Bob and Gi determined should 
be asked by the Superintendent of the Barracks, 
in order to incur the answer, * Drinking a dram at 
the " Bird in Hand" over yonder ;' an answer which 
would sound unwelcomely to the Superintendent 
and Comptroller, as they could not in conscience 
hear it, and let Bradley keep his belt and pistol : 
and then how grateful to the warm, brotherly feel- 
ings of Bob and Giles would it be, to hail him to 
their gang, and to share with him their parti- 
coloured clothes ! 

They gladly agreed to forego the fig, and taste 
of the tankard promised by Bradley as a reward of 
good faith ; for they hoped to chew a more deli- 
cious morsel, and quaff a more refined dram by 
following their own counsel than in keeping 
Bradley's. 

* Why man, you don't seem satisfied,' cried Bob, 
in the course of the consultation. 

* Don't see why we can't peach ourselves with- 
out getting the woman to report ; maybe she'll get 
us into trouble along with that infernal dog.' 

' And wouldn't it be wo'th a spell at the wheel, 
or a dance in the dark, to get him plucked of his 
jackdaw feathers ! I tell ye I'd bear a flogging 
without a wince to get him down; and you 

be—' 

* No bullying of me now, Pragg ; I baint he — so

keep your jolly thumpers to yourself, or try 'em 
on your own skull till you can on Bradley's.' 

' Hold your humbug and listen to me ; I've laid 
plans before now, and if they don't turn out ad- 
meerable, I'm not Bob Pragg.' 

' I've heard you once, and I baint no fool.' 

"But Bob, ever oracular, must j^in show forth 
hB wisdom, and glut his vengeance with a concoc- 
tion of malice. In Spite of Gi's protest, he would 
repeat hia scheme as follows : — 

' She'm quieter now, and don't seem likely to 
report — that won't suit us ; nor Bradley — she must 
report — and then 'twill out that constable Bradley 
don't look after his birds; in fact 'twill be dear 
that he prefers a " bird in the hand" to three in the 
bush, for this ground an't much more than buah 
appearantly.' 

' Ha ! ha ! ha I that's in 'em — ^you'll be comtable 
next, Bob.' 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 153 

* That's the go, Gi I like to see ye game. How 
to get her ? Trust me for that ! I've seen her ^fyte 

now ; me if I don't raise the deuce in her. 

Never heard Bob Pram's music ? I'll play devil's 
tattoo on them precious boxes there till I make her 
fly mad to the Governor ; then sharp's the word, 
Mr. Bradley ! Now let's oflF. When I begias you'll 
know — there's no mistaking Bob Fragg, always 
except when he means you shall mistake him ; then 
there's all so much no not mistaking him/ 

^ But what shall we do with that gaping block- 
head yonder ?' 

* He an't wo'th a thought ; he must come in for 
it long with us, 'twill do'n good— polish en a bit 
When Government condescends to notice such 
blackguard paupers, and place 'em longside of 
gents, why gents can't do less than condescend too, 
and train 'em up in the way they should go— 
shouldy meaning in the way they are fossed to go ; 
seeing when they'm once in there's no gettin' out 
till their hedication's finished.' 

* And then I s'pose they'm pretty fit for some- 
where^ 

* Kight, man ; the place where gents go — the 
proper place for used up O.P.S.O.'s, and we'm all 
thai^ from Comptroller downwards.' 

The loud ha! ha! ha! which chorussed this 
speech, was the sound that brought Sam's treat to 
an end. 



154 THE BROAD AEROW. 

Gi's admonitory nudge warned Bob to action. 
Stooping to one of the coffins, he turned it on its 
side, and swearing a fearful oath, exclaimed — 

* Now I'll stand no more nonsense 1 if they won't 
get into the hole, I'll throw a spade of earth over 
'em and leave 'em; and the devil may come and 
carry 'em off if he likes ; now heave away, Sam.' 

Sam raised it at the opposite side ; when Bob, 
feigning mistake, let go his side, and down came 
the cofEn, and tumbled over a grave. 

* 'Twasn't me, missus !' almost blubbered Sam, 
as he, with the two others, noticed the pale passion 
that worked in every feature of Maida's face. 

' Catch here. Bob,' cried Giles, approaching ; 
' catch here.' 

And as if playing football, he gave the coffin a 
tremendous kick ; before he could give a second he 
was lying prostrate, and that by a woman's hand. 
By a dexterous movement, Maida had collared and 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 155 

of a fight. * At him — she'm yours ; you must fight 
for her/ 

Encouraged^ bewildered, and hurried on by ex- 
citement, Sam did * at ' Giles. Wielding the spade 
with a force as unnatural to himself as unexpected 
to Giles, he struck the wretched man so heavily, 
that only his weight in falling disengaged the spade 
fix)m the grip of the riven skull into which the iron 
had pierced. 

Three heavy groans gurgled from the lips of the 
dying man, and then a strange solemn stillness 
spread over the field, chilling the horror-stricken 
group into a breathless silence. 

Neither Bob nor Sam moved, until a shivering 
sensation in the latter increased to an almost 
audible quaking of his whole lank fi:ame. 

'B-o-b?' at last he quaked out in sepulchral 
tone. 

Bob looked, but did not speak. 

'Who — did — it, B-o-b?' the large glassy eyes 
were riveted on the corpse. 

The question aroused Bob to a sense of self- 
safety. 

^ Who ? You^ and no mistake ! But I'll stand 
by ye, Sam, cos you've never done me no harm ; 
but mind, you don't say a word about me, and I'll 
do for you in no time.' 

* Don't want nothin',' came mechanically from 
Sam, who had either not heard or not apprehended. 



156 THE BROAD ARROW. 

He had sunk on his thighs, and now sat crouched 
up, restdng his chin in his hands, and gazing on 
Giles as if he had neither power nor will to with- 
draw his eyes from the corpse. 

* Sam, boy, rouse yerself I We must be doii^ 
something 'fore Bradley comes along ; keep a good 
face on it, and let us be the first to make the row. 
Up, boy ! up ! the woman 11 wake, and Bradley 
'11 be along presently ; lend a sharp heft or two^ 
and get them plagues buried, then we'll carry 
Giles to Tench ; leave the rest to me ; silence is 
all I wants out of you.' 

This was all, the first shock over, that Pra^ 
made of the death of his comrade. How the 
death' might aflect him was the only remaining 
point that engt^ed his mind. 

Accustomed to fear Pragg, Sam tried to stand, 
but the violent trembling of his limbs made him 
sink again. 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 157 

• 

^ Confound the blockhead, he's no true blood in 
him for all he gied such a mortal chinker/ 

By dint of digging, drawing, pounding, and 
shoving, he managed to get the coffins interred ; 
but it was a difficult task. He had barely stamped 
the earth upon them when Bradley jumped over 
the fence, bringing the promised bribe of tobacco 
and ale. 

A revenge beyond even Bob's malice awaited 
the official, as, flown with insolence and wine, he 
swaggered across the field. 

Brutal triumph gleaming from his hard features, 
Pragg watched the effect of the scene on Bradley. 
The hour was his ; he was master of the field. 
Quietly taking the bottle irom the latter, he drained 
it, and flung it in the air, crying— 

* To your health and ticket, old fellow ! Did 
you ever hear of a canary ?' 

* I've heard of a laughing jackass, and sees one 
now,' snarled the constable, perceiving that there 
was something amiss. Glancing around, he quickly 
discovered that something, and how the case lay. 
Accustomed to mark tokens of guilt and degrees 
of crime in different characters, he at once acquitted 
Pragg, and discerned the murderer in the miserable 
figure crouching before him. 

Had his own situation been less precarious, he 
would have proceeded, with ferocious glee, to hale 
his victim to judgment ; but all dream of official

consequence vanished beneath the threatening 
darkness" of Pram's malignant leer. One glance 
hastily cast from under his heavy brow sufficed to 
warn Bradley that wrath was determined against 
him. How to avert it was his troubled thought 
Maida was the only unsolved portion of the dread- 
fiil charade. What part had she acted in it ? How 
came she lying there ? Had the fight been on her 
account ? Could she be of any service in making 
terms with his enemy ? were questions that hurried 
throi^h Bradley's mind as, without moving his 
head, he surveyed the strange group. 

' It must be now or never,' thought he ; ' in a 
quarter of an hour the Tench bell will summon 
the men.' 

Assuming what mastery he could over his quail- 
ing voice, he asked Bob — 

' Who's the woman ? what had she to do with 
Speak out, don't be feared.* 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 159 

The same twinkle, and Bradley inly writhed. 

* Don't doubt you, Pragg ; but excuse me as a 
constable if I ask that youngster a question just by 
way of crobation/ 

* Hoa ! here, you scoundrel,' (shaking him roughly 
by the shoulder) ; * hoa, and tell us, did the 
woman faint ?' 

* T-e-s,' said Sam, in the same low, mechanical 
tone. 

*Tell you what. Bob,' cried Bradley ; * there's 
no use in shamming. I see exactly how 'tis; 
there's. no mistake that he's fixed and you are free ; 
but that won't let us off — we are all in for it — me 
as well as you, so I'll be honest with you, man ; 
give your hand here to a bai^ain^ and with my 
word to it you're safe.' 

Bradley thrust his hand to Bob, but Bob de- 
liberately thrust his into his pockets, giving, at the 
same time, a side-catch of his mouth and eye, 
which the constable interpreted — * Don't you wish 
you may get it ?' 

' I like that amazin' ! How d'ye make out I'm 
in for it ? You are in a jolly mess of it ; but 
'xcept I gets into trouble for what others does, 
Bob Pragg stands as clear as any man. Can I 
help the dogs from fightin' it out ?' 

' Don't doubt you, Pragg ; but them govern- 
ment coves is such a set, one never knows 

when one's safe ; white easy turns to black with

them. _ Don't you reckon on clearness, but take 
my advice, as one who knows a thing or two about 
them twisters.' 

' What's the dodge ? — out with it.' 

Bob had no intention to relent -, but the longer 
he could dally with his prey, the better for his 
spite, and the more certain downfall to his enemy, 
from the disclosures he might afford by way of 
bribing silence. 

' Strike hands, then.' 

'That an't Bob Pragg; be hears first, hands 
after.' 

Bradley looked on every side, and dien pointed 
to Sam. 

'He?' 

* Safe as a log ; no wits to peach — no brain for 
lies.' 

Bradley nodded ; and drawing close to Pragg, 
whispered—

bolting and running won t show guiU —'twill only 
be one natturl effect of the outrage. The story '11 
be somew'at like this :— 

* " Constable's too busy with the rascal to notice 
you— opportunity offers — you bolt, as any one of us 
would if we got such a chance — constable, of course, 
'U be in a decent fluster about it, and eager after 
you, 6i^ all in the wrong scent till you're safe as a 
wombat in his hole." Trust me ! I've been after 
bolters Yore now, and knows a few tricks of the 
trade!' 

Bradley attempted a laugh, but he failed. As 
earnestly as he dared he watched from under his 
heavy brow the working of his proposal ; but Bob's 
hard lineaments showed no working in any way 
save that the hard mouth rounded for a whistle, 
and the hard brow contracted a care-nought 
wrinkle. 

Bradley again stretched his hand. 

^ There's no time to lose — now or never.' 

* It shan't be now, but don't know that it shan't 
be never. When Bob Pragg bolts, he don't ask 
leave,' and he planted his hands on his thighs. 
^ I've got an account to settle before I can go : my 
compliments to the Comptroller, and tell em so 
from me, Mr. Bradley.' 

* Then go and be !' roared Bradley, shaking 

his fist at Bob ; ^ and if you don't hang for your 
insolence it shan't be my fault.' 

VOL. II. M 



162 THE BROAD ARROW. 

' You'll be too snug to get a peep at me, any- 
how,' sneered Bob, who, looking forward to sure 
present vengeance, stored up Bradley's threat for 
future payment. Bob was a tutored ruffian ; he 
could control himself when self-control subserved 
his purposes. 

Takii^ handcuff from his pocket, the constable 
clasped them on Sam, and shaking him till he 
was sufficiently aroused to stand, bade him, with a 
kick on his spine, walk on, whilst he and Bob 
carried Giles to the barracks. At that moment 
the bell rang, and from every part of the town, 
road and building parties were seen returnii^ to 
their quarters. Bradley, his burden, and Tictim 
were quickly surrounded, when, rengning his 
charge to a brother constable and overseer, the 
former said he must go and report to head-quarters. 
But report never reached head-quarters throi^h 
him ; for, turning swiftly back, he caught what 




an; old acquaintance. 163 

tume carried him to some distaace without risk of 
detection. 

Night fell ere Maida came to herself. For 
many minutes she lay in a dreamy state, wondering 
why the moon shone so unobstructedly upon her. 
She could rarely see more than its light on the 
two-paned window in her garret ceiling. The 
centaurs, too, large and bright, looked on her. 
What could it mean ? She almost feared to move, 
lest the pleasant dream should break. 

Comfort insensibly distilled from the long, clear, 
unbroken rays that stretched towards her. She 
raised her hands and passed them over her eyes, 
and then letting them drop, they fell — not on her 
warm bed, but on the cold damp grass. The spell 
was broken. With a shiver she started and re-' 
membered all ; but the brutal badinage was hushed 
into a calm that seemed supernatural. She felt 
stiff and dizzy — so dizzy, that as she looked around, 
the graves seemed to advance, and recede, and 
rise, and iall. The ridges of uneven mounds 
became more uneven, as, beneath the trembling 
light, they appeared to heave, as if about to dis- 
charge their dead. 

Having satisfied herself that she was alone, that 
no more ruflSanly insult could arouse her anger or 
disturb the scene, she went to the new-made grave, 
and sat by it. She was already later than convict 
rule permitted ; she had no pass, should it be

demanded, therefore she could incur no further 
penalty by remaining a little longer to think over 
the strai^e encounter of the afternoon. 

She thought of Pragg; she ielt he was her 
enemy, but for that she cared not It was only 
fitting that the man who bad wrung her from her 
baby should be appointed to work her further woe ; 
it was only to be expected that he should haunt 
her to this remote comer of the world. 

Her baby ! to what a stream of memories did 
those words give rise. Her home in Essex — her 
indulgent, ill-requited, and maybe broken-hearted 
father — Norwell — her life of shanae and misery — ■ 
her crime (the thin smile involuntarily moved her 
lips) — its punisbo^ent. Then fiercely beating 
against the dreary reach of fiiture that stayed its 
onward flow, the stream ebbed, lingering now at 
one point that awakened tender feeling; then 
bounding, scornful, from another, until it again 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 165 

had kindled, not for herself or against the two 
depraved wretches, but on behalf of the unresisting 
dead. The determination to report had been fixed 
in her mind the instant before she fell by Waddy's 
hand ; but when, on recovering consciousness, she 
perceived, by the graves, that the offence had been 
atoned for, she annulled her determination on 
Sam's account, fearing he would get equal punish* 
ment with the other two naen if she made a repprt 
of their misconduct. It did not occur to her to 
wonder at her having been left so unceremoniously 
on the ground, for she knew too well that selfish- 
ness had induced the men to leave her. To the 
watchhouse only could they have taken her ; and 
judging her by theuLselves, she concluded they had 
thought she would surely round upon them in 
return for the puni&hment dealt to herself by way 
of costs for government lodging, and had therefore 
determined to let her lie. 

Neither did she wonder why the constable (who, 
she was sure, had hurried in to conduct his charge 
to the Tench, after having neglected them all the 
afternoon) had not paid her due oflScial attention. 
The same fear that had made the others so un- 
gallant, had also influenced him not only to a similar 
act of ungallantry, but to one of exemplary self* 
denial, in resigning his claim to her as a case illus- 
trative of his constabulary vigilance. But the 
blow that was now smarting on her temple, did that

ui^e no vengeful step in Maida, unaware, as she 
was, that it had been already avenged by a swift 
and eternal retribution ? 

No : as her finger withdrew from the discolour- 
ii^ mark, and as the slight start caused by the 
unexpected pain subsided, a firm closing of the lip, 
with a steadier planting of her foot upon the earth, 
was the only sign that the blow had smitten below 
the surface, and driven the iron yet deeper into ber 
soul. The lip was firm to uncomplaining, whilst 
her mind set the indignity to the accumulated 
items that make prison life one protracted sufier- 
ing unthought of, and maybe unintended, when 
the sentence of transportation is passed. 

The foot struck upon the earth, not in the im- 
patience of the steed that cannot brook restraint, 
and longs to rush to freedom ; but to steady itself 
to accomplish the destiny that it scorned with hitter 
scorn, even while preparing to fulfil the cruel de-

Her ponderings were dispelled by two shadows 
that gained upon her. 

She quickened her pace. Still the shadows ad- 
vanced until they overtook and passed on before 
her, leaving by her side two men in the constable's 
garb. 

She heard them whisper — *No; it's a lady. 
I*m sure of it. Dressed shabby, because she's out 
this time. We can't speak to her, Tom.' 

* Oh, I've seen prettier birds than that Ladies 
wouldn't be out, shabby or not shabby, at this time. 
I say, got a pass, missus ?' 

This was said in an undertone for his own 
amusement. Prisoner or not, Tom thought it fun 
to see the lady increase her speed. 

* Don't fool now, Tom. Remember how Bates 
took the magistrate Joyce into custody.' 

* Let's follow her a bit. If we could get a sight 
of the brown, then we should be sure.' 

So the men followed her. Tom got impatient, 
being a newly-made oflScial, and eager for cap- 
ture. 

* Excuse me, ma'am, but must do my duty. 
Are you out on leave ? It looks suspicious when 
ladies are out alone this time o' day.' 

*Got a pass?' asked the more initiated con- 
stable, on the principle — ^justice is no respecter of 
persons. 

Maida thought it better not to notice, but let 



168 THE BROAD ARROW. 

them draw what conclusion they might ^m her 
silence. 

'Stop!' cried the initiated. Banning forward, 
he laid his hand on her shoulder. 'Come eloag 
with us. You can't give no account of. yourself; 
you're government for all your fine bobbery.' 

* You need not hold me ; I am willing to go 
with you.' 

' Don't seem in liquor, Tom.' 

'Been %hting, though. Moat got a black 
eye.' 

Both men were now satisfied as to Maida's char 
racter, and doubted not they were assisting Govern- 
ment in the suppression of convict vice in taking 
Maida in .charge. 

Their belief in the character of their prisoner 
strengthened, and their desire to fiirther the views 
of (jovemment weakened, as they approached a 
public-house, which, like nearly all the one hua-

women to Brickfield, and they generally sport a 
swig at the " Eagle-Hawk." * 

Mistaking the expression on her &ce, the initiated 
thought Maida suspected the sincerity of his offer ; 
so taking her arm, and attempting to draw her 
towards the door of the house, he exclaimed— 
* Come, my lassie ; I pledge you in a dram. We 
are no better than each other, when once we get 
in here — / forget our beltSf and you forget your 
pass.' 

* She's up to a thing or two; she doubts you 
yet,' said Tom. 

^I doubt nothing that comes from a convict 
constable,' replied Maida, wresting her arm from a 
grasp more hateful than the official one. ^ I doubt 
no breach of trust from men who would never be 
in office could free men vile enoi^h be found to do 
their masters' bidding.' 

* She an't government !' cried Tom, in a fright 
lest he had betrayed himself in his hurry to exer- 
cise his power. 

^ I am government,' said Maida ; ' and I am out 
without a pass ; and I command you to take me to 
the Watch-house.' 

' She's drunk, Tom ; I'll swear to that. We'll 

get a glass, then me if I don't give her her 

wish, and something more too, to-morrow : make 
a note of what she said against government, whilst 
I touch up the chap here.' 



170 THE BROAD ARROW. 

The initiated went round the corner, and, tap- 
ping at a little back window, whistled a signal. 

The back door opened. He went in, and having 
stayed a few momeDts, returned with two glasses 
of liquor. Giving one to Tom, he offered the other 
to Maida, with — 

* Now, come ; you can't say nay to that, or you 
an't government. Off with it, and about your 
business. You know you look deuced handsome 
humbugging us. We an't the men to hand over a 
handsome woman when shell make herself agree- 
able a bit.' 

Maida took the glass and flung it and its con- 
tents into the road. The smash drew an exclama- 
tion from the men ; and the exclamation reached 
the ears of a gentleman who was crossing at the top 
of the street. The gentleman stopped and gazed 
earnestly towards the spot whence the noise pro- 
ceeded ; and then hastening forward, came in sight 




AX OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 171 

Agitation was visible in Mr. Herbert's coun- 
tenance as by the clear moonlight Maida dis- 
tinguished each feature; but his voice was calm 
and masterly. 

* Maida, where have you been ? We have 
been seeking you since five o'clock, when we first 
learned that you had not returned firom Trinity 
Parsonage. Poor Emmeline is very anxious, and 
your master disappointed/ 

A seardhing glance accompanied these words. 
The smell of spirit was strong, and the swelling on 
her forehead indicative of a brawl. 

But though these suspicious tokens puzzled Mr. 
Herbert, they did not mislead him. There was 
that peculiar curl about Maida's lip, of which he 
had learned the meaning since his more intimate 
acquaintance with her. 

He felt thankful that his brother had taken the 
opposite direction in search of her, for his feelings, 
already irritated at the notion that he had been 
deceived by one in whom he had confided much 
against his will, were in no mood to bear the con- 
test for which, by the cool defiance of her voice, 
Maida seemed prepared. 

* Where I have been I cannot tell you, sir ; but 
now I am going to the Watch-house. I have 
desired these men to do their duty ; as they refiise, 
I go to surrender myself to government.' 

* She's drunk, sir.' 



172 THE BROAD ARROW. 

. ' And you would make her more so. I relieve 
you of your charge.' 

' Please your reverence, I must take her on, for 
she's out without a pass,' interposed Tom. 

* Leave her,' said Mr, Herbert, sternly, ' and 
go learn what your duty is before you attempt to 
perform it. What means that broken glass lying 
t^ere, and that bottle thrust into yonder window ?* 

'You won't be hard upon us a cold night 
like this, sir ? 'Tis often cold here, sir.' 

* Ward, I'm ashamed of you \ if you forget 
your duty I cannot mine. I must report you; 
this is not the first time you have been guilty of 
betraying your trust in that shameless manner.' 

' Please sir, wouldn't you like to hear our charge 
against the woman ?' persisted Tom. 

'Cro!' repeated Mr, Herbert, waving his hand 
ind^antly. 

* You had better hear it, sir,' said Maida.

on the noble being before her, who had done more 
than his public duty in going to seek her, and who 
would only be doing his public duty were he to 
arraign her for infringement of convict discipline. 

She felt that this noble being regarded her not 
as a prisoner who had absconded, and must be 
found for the mere purpose of receiving due punish- 
ment, but as a fellow creature who was in danger, 
and therefore to be rescued. He had sought her, 
not vindictively, but sorrowfully; he was now 
anxious to hear her story, not that he might form 
a case for the police court, but to ascertain what 
had befellen herself. G-enerally she would prefa* 
that the negative in each of the foregoing supposi- 
tions should be the case — her haughty spirit would 
choose rather the chastisement than the pardon, 
the anger than the sympathy of most persons ; not 
so with Mr. Herbert, though her impulsive temper 
often made her grieve him, and though the deep- 
seated sense of injury which burnt within, making 
her careless of results and scornful of pity, often 
caused her to reject his proffered sympathy, and 
turn coldly from his ministerial exhortations, yet 
she revered his earnestness, and her soul paid 
secret tribute of admiration to the unflagging zeal 
that remained stedfast and self-possessed in spite 
of opposition. 

She sometimes found the thought, * What will 
Mr. Herbert say to this?' exerting a restraining 



174 THE BROAD ARROW. 

influence on her actions: she would imperiously 
shake the tho(m;ht from her with the inquiry, ' Can 
my state be bettered or made worse by any one*s 
opinion of me ?' but to her infinite annoyance, the 
thought would come creeping back, when to fortify 
herself against it by turning more coldly from his 
kindness, and by increasing her rigidity of de- 
meanour, was her only resource to again rid herself 
of it. 

The time had not come for the bowing of 
Maida's soul before the cross borne so meekly, 
yet upraised so fearlessly in her sight. Courage, 
O man of God! think not with the Religions In- 
structor of the transport that there is no hidden 
meaning in tliat compressed lip and haughty exte- 
rior — think not that within that icy surface all is

Maida longed to tell him all in order to ease the dis- 
quietude apparent through the gentleToiee and calmly 
searching gaze — but poor Sai% ah^ he was friendless I 

The lean, pale visage^ and the fixed, staring eye 
of the miserable lad came before her. She felt 
she wa» the more capable of enduring punishment, 
« worse than punishment, Mr. Herbert's and Em- 
sieline's patient disappointment, than Sam of 
bearing an additional weight of sentence, stripes, 
and sorrow. 

* Can you trust m^, sir ?' 

^I can and dOj Maida, but I hope this trust is 
not to be instead of an explanation of that blow 
disfiguring your brow ; you will not keep my poor 
child in suspense ?' 

*Miss Evelyn would not wish to get a poor, 
wretched, friendless creature into trouble.' 

*You are not friendless, Maida, if you are 
wretched.' 

^I do not speak of myself, sir; I could not tell 
you what has occurred without getting a poor lad 
into trouble. You should know, sir, that chastise- 
ments are administered both hastily and indiscrimi- 
nately on convicts: though the poor fellow had 
nothing to do with either my absence or this blow, 
he would doubtless be dealt with as a party in the 
ofience which I should be obliged to report, were 
I to account for my absence. Can you trust me 
with my secret, sir ?' 



176 THE BROAD ARROW. 

' I repeat I trast you, Maida, and half gladly ; 
to have a struggle between duty aud inclination is 
a disturbance to a minister, and your confidence 
might produce that efFectin me ; but my brother — 
your master^ bow will he permit your silence? 
He is strict where he considers convict disdpline 
has been wilfully infringed.' 

* He may send me before a magistrate, but be

' Maida, I must be plain with you' (Mr. Herbert's 
voice trembled), ' I fear my brother vnll do that 
He is determined to take extreme measures, for he 
thinks you have deceived him ; and how is he to 
know to the contrary if you persist in making a 
mystery of your conduct ? You were sent out at

o'clock at night'

debasement and degradation, what delicacy should 
be found in her ? — Would government allow it to 
remain in her ? — ^Would it be fitting, I ask ?' 

*Most unfitting! therefore, as a debased, de- 
graded convict, I command you not to speak thus 
of so kind a master, who bears with whims that 
others would punish as sins, and who never 
punishes but where punishment is deserved.' 

The stem quiet of his voice struck into Maida's 
every nerve — she felt the justice of the rebuke — 
she wished she had not provoked it — she wished 
she could forbear to provoke it further, but she 
was aroused, passion quivered in her breast and 
formed itself into speech almost against her will. 

' Then I am ready to bear my deserved punish- 
ment. Let him send me to court, there my silence 
shall be as unbroken as before my master ; for not 
in opposition to any particular person, but because 
I choose it, I shut myself to inquiry.' 

* Then I must leave you, Maida ; I cannot 
become a party to your wilfulness. You must go 
to the punishment I begin to think you deserve, 
and on which I am sure Mr. Evelyn will insist, if 
you appear before him in your present state.' 

* I shall rejoice to go to court and receive the 
infliction that will follow. I shall glory in the 
punishment as another means of concentrating to 
one supreme evil the mass of degradation that has 
accumulated in me. I yearn for the completion

that shall leave me no possibility of further infamy 
— when there shall be no more convictioDS to sdfle 
— no sharp compunctions to blunt — no more 
hopes to disappoint — no feelings to wound — no 
heart to suffer — ^no soul to save ; when I am aU 
this, then shall I be what convict law has sought 
to make me ! then, having borne all, braved all, and 
become all, its demands will be satisfied, and it will 
bid me go in peace to that place where peace never 
comes.' 

Mr. Herbert shuddered. He remembered that 
she had worked herself to a similar frenzy on the 
occasion of his first visit to her in prison, and 
dreaded a similar result ; but looking earnestly at 
her, he perceived that the pallor of her cheek was 
the blanching of fierce excitement, and not of ap- 
proachii^ exhaustion. 

He closed his eyes, and breathed an unuttered 
prayer to God that strengtli and wisdom might be 




AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 179 

'■■= * You are impulsive, Maida ; reconsider your 
words/ he said at last, as though he had only just 
heard her. 

What magic is in those words! She starts — 
istands still — and earnestly scrutinises the speaker of 
ibem; memory work, iy, her he«. bL fWi- 
ously, and recollection snatches her away and 
dizzily sets her down in a little upper chamber, and 
a voice tibat she has watched for, and wept for, 
and prayed for, arises dreamily from an unseen 
somewhere, and repeats — 

* Maida, you are impulsive/ 

And as though answering the voice with die self* 
same speech of the days of that diamber, she 
murmurs — 

* Forgive me/ 

She clasps her hands, her breast heaves tumul- 
tuously. 

* Maida, you are faint/ Mr. Herbert offers to 
support her ; but with one hand she waves refusal 
of assistance, with the other hides her face, while 
her head shakes drearily as if in last farewell to a 
departing friend ; then, with a sudden reclasping of 
her hands, with a wild up-throwing of her eyes as 
though she heard the door of fate snap on that 
friend's retreating form, bursts from her lips a 
bitter cry — 

^ Would God I had never loved him I' 

The cry did not mysticise Mr. Herbert ; neither 



180 THE BROAD AKKOW, 

did he mistake its import, or misappropriate its 
application. The secret of female prieoD life was 
in his possession, and he rarely failed to read its 
sad characters in the many tales of miserj' confided 
to hie ministerial care. 

* Would God that you did not love him stUlt 
Foi^et him, Maida, he is unworthy of you.' 

Ere this fervent admonition had passed from the 
cl^^man's heart to Maida's ear, the truant flight 
was over ; her feet no longer trod the painfid though 
airj' realms of dream, but the roi^h uncompro- 
mising earth of a very nether world ; she was no 
longer the Maida of that desolate upper chamber, 
battling in scornful solitude a lot that treachery had 
cast ; she was Maida, the transported felon, expiat- 
ing by a scorned servitude another's guilt, and a 
crime of which she was wholly innocent. 

Forget him! She remembered that she had 
undertaken to suffer for him ; endurance was hers

terror at one moment, while the next it nerved her 
to heroism so martyr-like as to inspire admiration. 

In confirmation of her avowal, she advanced 
many paces as if desbing to hasten forward. 

Wheu they reached the Lodge, Mr. Herbert held 
the knodcer as a last delay before ushering her into 
his brother's presence; he threw an inquiring 
glance, she received it with a quiet smile. 

* You need not fear, sir ; I can meet my master 
now.' 

*But can you meet the trouble which may 
ensue; or have you determined to avert it by 
satisfying your master ?' 

^ There will be no trouble, sir ; my master's dis- 
pleasure will be all I shall have to bear.' 

She laid a peculiar emphasis on the word ally an 
emphasis which Mr. Herbert understood. He 
knew that while meaner souls would slink away 
congratulating themselves that they had escaped so 
easily, * master's anger ' their only punishment — 
her proud spirit would suffer more in bending itself 
to conciliate that anger, than in encountering the 
active strife of bodily penance ; and he believed 
that had not her will been stronger than her pride, 
and her purpose mightier than both, she would have 
chosen rather to take on herself the consequences 
of a continued resistance, than submit to her 
master's interrogations, which she knew would be 
at once austere and cutting. 



182 THE BROAD ABEOW. 

* Is your master, home ?' adced Mr. Herbert, 
eagerly, as Tammy opened the door. 

' No, sir, he came home once with a constable' 
and then went straight out again and 's been out' 
ever since.' 

' Then, make haste to bed, Maida ; I will explain" 
to Mr. Evelyn to-night ; since we have arrived first 
he will not expect to see you, and you are faint and 
fatigued.' 

* I am neither, thank you, sir ; I will see the 
master to-night.' 

' No— I wish you to go to bed ; I take all 
responsibility on myself.' 

Maida retreated, but with no intentdoa of retinng 
to rest 

' "Won't you catch it ! The master's rampng 
like a great mad bull ; he'd bellow if his rage would 
let him,' was Maida's salutation from Tammy, as she 
entered the kitchen.

cove, tip his reverence a wink, and he'll stop pro- 
ceedings with a tickle of his brother's ear that'll 
make him start ginger; the old chap's had his 
blinkers on, or he'd have shied long ago at what we

Pamous opportunity I shut up there in the cells. 
No prying to stop their lovemaking ; won't he read 
the lost sheep parable aloud and holy, and then 
expound it soft and tender to suit the case ?' 

A loud knock at the fore-door stopped the coarse 
merriment which succeeded this impudent sally. 

The women started, Googe sheered off, and 
Maida seated herself to await in silence the event 
of that knock. 

Mr. Herbert issued from his study to meet his 
brother. 

* She is home, George.' 

^ Did she come^ or did you bring her ?' 

* I brought her.' 

* I wish you hadn't then ! I'm tired of the pranks 
of that woman; punished she must be, and I'd 
rather she had got it from others than from me. I 
detest appearing against the poor wretches. I 
must send her though, she's riding it a trifle too 
high, and wants a little reminder.'

' When you have talked to her I do uot thhik 
you will find it necessary ; she is quite humbled

ness should go before, and not follow after. A pretdy 
chase she's, led me; I've been rouud- Newtown,

*I sent her to bed.' 

* Bother it, Herbert ! I wish you'd leave me 
to manage ray own people; if the night passes 
smoothly over her, she'll think she's going to be 
let off; so if she's in bed she must just turn out*

* Perfectly, sir.'

Biie with a disrespect I will no longer bear ; for my 
Abearance harms you without benefiting me. You 
have deceived me, Maida, and I now mean to show 
you how I deal with those who abuse my leniency, 
and with what power convict law invests the master 
and controls the servant I wad unwilling to exert 
that power ; you have defied it, and now you shall 
feel it ; though still unwilling, I consider it my duty 
to exert it' 
:Not a muscle of Maida's face moved. 

* Two hours ago I should not have been unwilling, 
for I was irritated at your abuse of my confidence. 
Had you then come back, I should have handed you 
over to Government without hesitation, and without 
compunction. I am glad you did not, for my own as 
well as for your sake.' Still not a muscle moved. 

* What have you to say for yourself? how do 
you account for this freak ? speak, Gwynnham — 
speak — ' 

* I have nothing to say, sir.' 

* No nonsense, and no lies, Maida. Convicts 
don't run risks for nothing. I won't be made a 
fool of. If you can't give an explanation to me, 
you shall to the police magistrate.' 

The large eye that had till now been fixed 



186 THE BROAD ARROW. 

calmly oa his face, sent a hasty glance to Mr. Ha*- 
bert, and then dropped to the floor. 

Mr. Herbert lounged on the sofa, hiding, in a 
careless posture, the anxiety he felt for the issue of 
die conference. From between the lingers that 
were pressed to his forehead, he was intently 
watching the stru^le. He dreaded punishment 
for Maida. It might undo all that he hoped was 
working in her. It might ruin her, body and soul. 
He perceived that his brother inclined to clemency, 
now his first rush of anger and vexation had sub- 
sided ; but if Maida should become impetuous, 
how might not her impulse hurry her to provoke 
her own destruction! Witii what thankfulness, 
therefore, did he see the lai^ eye again raise itself 
calmly, and hear her say, in a submissive voice-^ 

'Will you spare me, sir, and hear from Mr. 
Herbert all I dare tell by way of accounting for 

J strange behaviour ?'

for herself, without involvmg a poor creature, who 
is not guilty; 

*Lucy, I suppose, who abetted her attempt to 
escape. I must forbid her the house.' 

'.No, sir, Lucy had no part in it' 
{ Maida was really alarmed, and spoke quickly 
and warmly — 

* What Mr. Herbert says is true, sir. If needs 
be, rU bear any punishment, but cannot bring 
trouble on a poor friendless lad.' 

* Your punishment will involve no one,' said 
Mr. Evelyn, drily. 

* Then I am willing to receive it, sir.' 

*No humbug, young woman! You are not 
more willing than I.' 

* As a favour to me, George, if even you do not 
forbear to punish her, will you forbear to quesiim 
her?' 

'Supposing I oblige Mr. Herbert, Maida, by 
ceasing to inquire how you occupied yourself 
during your absence, you have still the absence 
itself to be charged with. Are you aware of the 
heavy punishment incurred by an absconder ?' 

' The punishment is great, but I had no intention 
of absconding.' 

' A fair excuse, since your intention of not being 
found is frustrated ! How will such pleasantry 
influence the magistrate? Out here we do not 
punish for intentions so much as for acts. Your 



188 THE BROAD ARROW. 

intention might have been laudable, but since your 
act did not agree with it, we must g^ve you a hint 
to let it do so for the future.' 

'Your hint will be more eaaly ^ven than 
understood, sir.' 

' Go to bed now ; you shall bear more to-mor- 
row. I wish no uproar to-night' 

' There will be no uproar to-night, sir, beyond 
that which, I hear, has been already.' 

*Go ! do not add insolence to your obstinacy.' 

It was a fortunate dismissal. On both sides the 
elements were gathering for an outbreak. 

* Strange, strange mortal [ ' exclaitned Mr. 
Evelyn, as the door closed upon her. ' There's no 
working her into a bona fide convict, try what you 
will. The deuce has bold of her, unless something 
much better ha£. She is either a masterpiece of 
conscienceless deceit — or — ' 

' She is a mystery, Geoi^e, tliat neither you nor

implore you not to send her away to the Depot. 
Em will quite fret to lose her, and the poor woman 
herself could never obtain so good a situation. As 
you say, endless miseries would ensue.* 

*0h, Wilson would reserve her. I'd let him 
into the secret. Em shan't lose her; and as to the 
woman herself, I only wish to — ' 

Mr. Herbert shook his head, and Mr. Evelyn 
asked — 

* Well, what would you do ? I own I'm puzzled 
by her. During all the ten years I tried my hand 
at reforming prisoners, I never had such a difficult 
bai^ain ! Cases handed over to me as desperate have 
become manageable, if not reformed. I abhor the 
government system of heaping punishment on pun- 
ishment, and sentence on sentence, and have always 
resisted it as a hardening, debasing process; but 
a little well-timed severity, or judicious correction, 
I found beneficial in showing my convicts what they 
had to gain by reminding them what they had lost.' 

* I quite agree with you, both as to the brutal- 
ising eflPect of incessant coercion, and the impossi- 
bility of wholly foregoing stringent measures in 
convict treatment ; but I doubt, George, whether 
in Maida's case of to-night judicial severity would 
be well timed, or correction judicious.' 

* Your grounds of doubt ?' 

'Another doubt — namely, that severity is 
merited, or correction deserved.' 



190 IBB BROAD ARROW. 

' Humph ! Theu you believe that her attempt 
to escape was not premeditated, but only induced 
by sudden temptation ?' 

' I believe that no attempt to escape has been 
made.' 

'Does she deny the attempt? If so, I'm 
inclined to believe her. Somehow I cannot think

merely begs that her conduct may be punished or 
passed over, without a confession.' 

' Yes, but she begs after the fashion of the high- 
wayman — " Give, or I'll take !" ' 

' Her spirit has not been trained by gentle influ- 
ences. If I mistake not, it has been tortured into 
unnatural developments, and being of a temper too 
lofty to sink in mean submission, and too courageous 
to be trampled upon, it has sprung from its tor- 
mentors, and now defies with haughty scorn the

* True, Herbert, true. Maida shall have the 
benefit of our doubt I had her good alone in 
view in desiring to chastise her, and that I only 
nieant to do by a good frightening. On my 
honour, though, I think we should try to prepare 
her for the exigencies of convict life. She does 
well with you and me, but any day she may change 
owners; then what would become of the poor 
thing? Who would brook her haughty manner 
and imperious replies ? So soon as one sentence 
expired, she would get new trouble for insolence 
and refractoriness/ 

* But if we patiently and prayerfully continue 
our work of forbearance with her, may not she 
gradually acquire the power of self-restraint, so 
necessary to her as a prisoner ?'

But Mr. Herbert had left the room. 

* Herbert,' called his brother, following him into 
his study, ' Maida is not in bed, I hear. I shall 
just have her down, and give her a caution, and so 
let the absconding mystery drop. She must have 
a touch or two on the subject of her supercilious 
speeches. 'Twon't do to let her off scot free.' 

* Will you reprove the speeches of one that is 
desperate — which are as wind ?' said Mr. Herbert, 
pointing to the twenty-sixth verse of the sixth 
chapter of Job. 

* Bother it ! you've always Scripture ready to

the room.

CHAPTER VII. 

H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 

' Here time so heaTy dragged "with strife 
On wheels of grief move slow. 
Bearing the wretched on through life 
Up paths of hmnan woe.* 

Dear nol Mrs. Evelyn cannot think of allowing 
Maida to be invalided in her house, the mere 
mention of so ridiculous an impossibility calls forth 
a whole breathfiil of little, short laughs. 

* Fever, too ! dear, dear ! how very amusing 
George can be when he likes, or rather, when the 
girls put him up to such nonsense I Really, though, 
illness is too serious a matter to make fun of — it 
might come upon one of us at any time — Geoi^e 
should know better/ 

And that George does know better Mrs. Evelyn 
soon discovers in looking at his forehead. His 
face is grave as grave can be, on perceiving which 
she puts the question to him as a man of sober 
sense. Is it reasonable or does Government expect 
holders to be bothered with sick convicts when 
there is an hospital expressly for their reception ? 

VOL. II. 



194 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

This she will do if Mr. Evelyn likes — she will 
lend the blankets in which Maida has already slept 
(no others, on any account !) to wrap her from the 
air during the removal from the house ; but even 
this she can only do on condition that he will 
feith^Uy promise to deliver them to a laundress on 
his way back, to have the infection washed out of 
them. She is sure that this is all that can be 
expected from her; why, even English masters 
and mistresses send away their servants when they 
are ill. Mr. Evelyn sug^sts that the poorest 
servant in England has her friends to go to, but 
the convict in sickness is desolate and friendless. 
To go back to Government is the only resource of 
the unfortunate sufferer, and he considers that the 
objection to this resource is one entitled to respect 
and not to censure. 

However, Mr. Evelyn does not insist that 
Maida shall stay: he thinks it is only right his

painful and disagreeable, she must have Maida 
taken away — and that at once. 

Bridget thinks her aunt's reasons go exactly by 
contraries; to lier^ the very painfiilness and dis- 
agreeableness of the disorder are reasons why 
Maida should not be sent among strangers. How- 
ever, she holds her peace, having learnt by expe- 
rience that Mrs. Evelyn's view of convicts will 
never be altered by means short of a new pair of 
mental eyes. 

So Sanders' cab is fetched, and when it stops at 
the Lodge, and he is informed who is his passen- 
ger, and whither bound, he declares, * Lucy '11 be 
darned sorry for to hear of it — most as sorry as I be.' 

Followed by many kind wishes, the cab drives 
slowly down Macquarie Street, Sanders hardly 
daring to touch the reins, for fear * the horse should 
jerk Madda, seeing he wasn't brought up to carry- 
ing of people to the hospital.' Turning into 
Liverpool Street, the handsome frontage of the 
hospital appears in sight, and relieves Sanders of 
a load of anxiety, which has oppressed his counte- 
nance as well as his heart ; so much so, that had 
he been mounted on a hearse, he could not have 
looked more dolefully apprehensive of misbehaviour 
on the part of his horse. 

The porter issues from the tall iron gates. 
'AH right!' says Sanders, preparing to drive 
past the man. 



196 THE BROAD ARROW. 

* But all is not right,' chooses to think the 
porter ; he is not going to he so easily haulked of 
gratifying his curiosity, which, under name of 
official inspection, he always pampers, to the 
annoyance of visitors. 

Popping his head into the window, he quickly 
pops it back again, a nod from Mr. Evelyn has 
settled the difficulty. Without venturing a word 
he touches bis hat, unlocks the gate, and admits 
Sanders, who has dismounted in order to lead the 
vehicle through the garden. The huilding before 
which he stops is the Female Hospital, the entry 
door of which stands open, displaying a broad 
staircase. From some invisible comer the matron 
comes forward, and is quickly surrounded by a bevy 
of brown-gowned, white-capped women, who have 
issued from equally invisible sources. 

Orders are given to take Maida Gwynnham 




H, M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 197 

Maida makes the effort, and her master raises 
heir gently and bears her steadily to No. 4, then 
whispering words that bring a faint smile of recog- 
nition to her lips, he bids her farewell ; but ere he 
quits the ward he looks about him, and asks? 
' Who is nurse here ?' 

A grizzly-haired, middle-aged female curtseys 
* I am; 

Her disappointment is extreme when Mr. Evelyn 
merely says — 

* Then remember that patient is my servant' 

'The poor dear creature shall be well minded, 
sir/ she answers, stowing away her disappointment 
where she hopes it will not be observed. 

Mr. Evelyn knows there is no necessity to re- 
commend Maida to the matron's special care, the 
kindness of that worthy woman being well known 
in the colony, and ever warmly attested by all who, 
in the misfortune of illness, have had the good 
fortune to find themselves under Mrs. Cott's pro- 
tection. 

The house surgeon visited Maida shortly after 
Mr. Evelyn's departure. He questioned her, and 
made notes of her answers, then, giving the Nurse 
sundry directions, he left the ward. In the course 
of the afternoon a mysterious personage entered, 
and marching straight to Maida's bed, stuck into 
the wall above her head, a ticket about three 
inches square, then conning it through in mys- 



198 THE BROAD AEBOW. 

terious silence, and nodding a mysterious nod, he 
marched straight out again, turning neither to the 
r^ht hand nor to the left. 

As soon as he was gone the Nurse stepped over 
to read the ticket, and havii^ read it, she gave a 
dissatisfied grunt. 

From that moment, or rather from the com- 
bined moments of the fixing of the ticket and the 
grunting of the grunt, Maida became a part of the 
establishment. Several of the convalescent patients 
tottered across the room to elicit what small sub- 
ject matter of gossip the square white card might 
affi>rd them ; then gathering round the fire, they 
b^an to discuss the probabilities -of the new 
comer's career, in a suppressed humdrum voice, 
which far more irritated her nerves than a reason- 
able amount of sound would have annoyed her 
head. 

It is known to all how unexplained trifles worry

asked, and * What can mine be about ?' Her 
thoughts perplexed her and her pains tortured her^ 
until, being imable to bear both perplexity and 
torture, she tried to raise ^herself to find out what 
Government could possibly have to say about her 
in connection with the hospital, but the attempt 
failed, and with a scream she sank on her pillow. 

* Nurse, do tell me what's on the ticket,' she 
murmured, when in answer to the scream the 
nurse approached, and as though anodyne issued 
from her finger's ends, gave several small pats to 
the bedclothes, smoothing away wrinkles that only 
existed in her own brain, 

'TtWewlkLtr 

Maida repeated her wish. 

* Trumpery !' and the Nurse turned away. 
Maida groaned. The square white cards seemed 

to enter into her as a part of her sufierings ; her 
head ached in trying to explain the mystery ; the 
cards grew larger and shrunk smaller as her be- 
wildered senses watched those which were exactly 
opposite ; and then, for a moment wandering alto- 
gether, she connected them with the ticket-of-leave 
of which she had heard so much, and stretching her 
hand to receive it, a sharp pain restored her to con- 
sciousness, when with feverish impatience her mind 
again set in to work out the problem of the card. 

* Nurse, I shan't sleep to-night if you don't tell 
me what it is/ she at last said. 



200 THB BBOAD ABROW. 

* Curse the ticket ! you won't a-get any aleep 
otherwise, don't'e flatter yerself.' 

* I say, you might all so well tell her, Nurse ; 
it's mortal bad to he mazing over anything when a 
body's sick,' interposed a patient. 

' Bad or good, I won't have her told ! she shall 
learn that I'm missus here as much as somebody 
else was coming out in the " Kose of Britain." ' 

And the nurse clenched her fist, but whether at 
Maida or at an unpleasant recollection of her own, 
is a (juestion open to dispute. 

From the submissive air with which the pleader 
dropped her cause and hersdf into a chair, it was 
evident that tlie nurse was correct, and that who- 
ever was mistress elsewhere, she was mistress there 
— in ward No. 4, of Her Majesty's hospital 

Twilight dimmed the room and all within it 
into indistinctness, but with painM clearness the 
cards still loomed on Maida's distorted vision.

official survey of her family, as she called the 
patients. 

The Nurse went round with her, showering 
expressions of pity as she went — ^pity which she 
hastily scoured off the patients' minds the instant 
Mrs. Cott was out of hearing. Stopping in turn at 
Maida, she raised her hands. 

* Lor 'a mercy I this new, poor creature, suffers 
dreadful — and so demented too — she keeps on 
about her ticket.' 

*Ah! poor thing/ And kind-hearted Mrs. 
Cott bent down and consoled her, thinking it most 
natural that a prisoner should be anxious for her 
ticket-of-leave. 

* Don't you fret now; this all goes in your 
sentence; you are not losing time; so cheer up, 
there's a good girl. You'll soon be better.' 

' Do tell me what it means ?' 

*Poor soul! I'll tell you all about it to- 
morrow,' replied the matron, passing to the next 
number. 

Maida closed her eyes, with an audible groan. 
All about her were equally cruel. 

When Mrs. Cott and Nurse were at the farthest 
end of the ward, the woman who had before 
pleaded leaned out of her stretcher — which 
happened to be next to Maida's — and whispered — 

* Don't you fret ; the ticket's nothing ; it's only 
to say who you are.' 



202 THE BROAD ARROW. 

The Nurse stepped outside with Mrs. Cott, and 
the woman whom we shall call Baker, hastily 
snatched the card from its frame and showed it to 
Maida. 

* Here, quick ; this is all ; I'll read it to you — 
"Maida Gywnnham^ alias Martha Grylls, pass- 
holder 24 ; * Rose of Britain ;' Protestant*' ' 

asthatalir 

*Yes, except a Lattem word, which means 
what's the matter with you ; that's all on my word. 
Nothing about your ticket, you see; you won't 
have that till you're half done.' 

* I don't care about my ticket,' groaned Maida^ 
almost fretfully. * Are you sure my crimes are 
not written there ?' 

* Bless me, no ! more like your doctor s stuflF 
would be down. What's your crimes to do with 
what you'll have here ?' 

Maida's mind again wandered in a confusion of 
past, present, and fiiture. In a dreamy tone she 
whispered— 

* Norwell isn't mentioned, is he ?' 

' Nor — ^what ? No ; nothing's there I tell you. 
That Lattern word I'll spell it out for you to- 
morrow; but I know it don't mean more than 
what I say ; it's the doctor's way of writing your 
sickness — rheumatics — I take it to be. She's 
coming ; quick, down !' 

But the caution was needless, Maida being 



H, M, GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON, 203 

already as prostrate as pain and fever could lay 
her. Baker had barely time to slip the card back 
into its groove, ere, Argus-eyed and suspicious. 
Nurse walked in, pulling at a large excrescence 
which disfigured her nether lip; searching mean- 
while from stretcher to stretcher for traces of the 
treason that she doubted not had discovered itself 
during her momentary absence ; until, resting on 
No. 10, her eye seemed unwilling to search be- 
yond. She stood still, and lapsed into a profound 
contemplation — alternately darting emphatic ma- 
lignity at the new patient, and tugging energetically 
at the superfluous flesh, which always suffered 
more or less in proportion to the amount of 
suggestive aid required to mark out her plans. 

But for the unsightly excrescence, Maida would 
probably have recognised in the nurse of ward 
No 4, of Her Majesty's general hospital, her 
former enemy, the ex-lunatic of the transport. 
The alteration in her dress, too, may have served 
to obscure her identity. The shock of grizzled 
hair no longer stood erect from her head, but lay 
in heavy masses on her gaunt cheek-bones, which 
seemed to protrude for the express purpose of 
supporting the burden imposed upon them. A 
convict in the midst of convicts, she alone was 
exempt from the prison badge. Grizzled and 
gaunt, therefore, as she was, she became the 
cynosure of the sick world within the dreary

precinct over which she ruled. If her moTements 
were not worshipped, they were watched by two 
distinct classes incarcerated within those walls : 
the admiring, or prisoners who had never yet been 
out of government, and the f^grieved, or prisoners 
who, in accepting the advantages of the house, had 
been obliged to resume the abominated sei^ — - 
an obligation which deterred many of the better 
disposed from availing themselves of medical 
treatment, as afforded in Her Majesty's hospital, 
until the latest moment, when, perhaps, the 
symptoms of their malady had seriously developed, 
or had progressed above the power of professional 
skill. A cap of white net, with generous border, 
and a print gown, was the dress that at once 
distinguished Norse from her bond-sisters, and in- 
vested her with a superiority beyond the imagin- 
ii^s of a ' free ' mind. The eyes that noted the 
changes of her cap from blue to pink, fcom pink

Visiting-days, that generafly bring pleasant 
variety to the tenants of an hospital, here were 
rarely guilty of such kindness. Visiting-Thursday 
came : the utmost hope it raised was that a mate 
might look in, or an unusually indulgent mistress, 
#ho had expressed a wish to have her servant 
reserved for her, might drop in to know how much 
longer she would have to wait. Visiting-Thursday 
passed : the only disappointment it left was that 
such a mate or such a mistress had not forthcome. 
Had the mate appeared, ten chances to one that 
she had been too drunk to speak, or that her visit 
bad been delivered in haste, it being only one of 
necessity, the fag end of an outing which she had 
extorted from the master under pretext of a visit 
*to poor so and so, a lying sick down there.' 
Here looks in vain the pining mother — no daughter, 
with tearful affection, appears to soothe her dying 
pillow. Never comes the sister to blend words of 
love and comfort to her sister drooping on a bed of 
pain and death. Weary is the little child of 
watching for the kind, tender smile that erewhile 
made it forget its sorrow. It watches and wastes, 
but never more draws nigh the step it strives to 
hear ; it wastes and wastes, and soon it is missed 
from its little stretcher. 

Here, in solitude, frets the old man. He knows 
he is wished dead by the nurse, who throws her 
services at him as you would throw a bone to

appease a troublesome d(^. He dotes, and calls 
upon his dai^hter, but she answers not; he re- 
proaches her, but his reproaches do not move her; 
all he gets for them is a loud, sharp rap from the 
nurse's hard, dried lips ; so he sinks into puling 
silence ; and when the last breadi sets him free, 
the only announcement is to Government, who 
gladly numbers one less to the living stock within 
its pale, and to the chaplain of the house, who, 
unless he be a Mr. Herbert Evelyn, grumbles that 
the old man did not apprise him of his intention to 
die, that he (the chaplain) might have arranged 
for his burial at a more convenient hour. 

As we prepress, we shall discover that Nurse is 
wrapped about with attractions more potent than 
the net and print, whose changes have so great an 
interest for captive eyes. Grim as is her smile, 
we shall find that it has a peculiar value ; while 
her frown, independent of that which is natural to

storm may burst, or where the shock will be most 
keenly felt, but all know that none can escape; 
the flood of vengeance sweeps along, scathmg ally 
destroying some. 

The rod of office becomes a snake within her 
Iiand — ^a snake whose malice all must feel, whose 
subtilty all must dread, and whose fascination 
none can withstand. 

When Nurse stood, as we have seen her, con- 
templating the new victim that had come beneath 
her snake, how writhed that reptile within her 
grasp, eager at once to dart upon its prey ! Its 
instinctive craft alone kept it back. How gloated 
its malignant eye on the prospect of malice lying 
with Maida on the bed ! 

But Maida was unconscious of its gloating eye. 
During the fortnight of pain which succeeded her 
admission, when sufficiently herself to connect 
cause and effect, she attributed the extreme dis- 
comfort she experienced wholly to her illness, 
which she knew to be one of the most distressing 
disorders. She suspected not the cruelty which, 
by every device, was heightening the tortures of 
acute rheumatism. When she implored to have 
her bed smoothed under her, because every crease 
gave her pain, Nurse hastened to her help ; but 
Maida knew not that her haste was the result of 
malice, glad of another opportunity to vent its 
spleen. And when, in the fretfulness of fever, she 



208 THE BBOAD ABBOV. 

still complained that she was not more conifortable, 
Nurse told her that the cause was in her own poor 
racked limbs, and not ia the bed ; and Maida 
believed her, not perceiving, diov^ sharply 
feeling, the reason in a large, thick leather, dried 
into uneven folds, which had been slipped in 
between the under sheet and blanket, for ' the 
fiendish purpose of turning her discomfort into 
positive suffering. 

When the lever abated, and the pains gradually 
subsided, Maida began to look about her. Lying 
weak and silent, she made quiet observation of all 
that took place around. Then was it that she 
first beheld Kurse with an interest, in which some 
past, though unremembered incident, bore a part 
She felt sure the grizzled hair, the dusky brow, 
anduneven eyes, were not strange to her; but the 
excrescence puzzled her. She had never known 
any one witii a lip like that How could she 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 209 

you tell me where?' she asked one day, after a 
long endeavour to reconcile the excrescence with 
the face. 

* The devil may care ! All I know is, weVe 
met once too often. Where I shall meet you again, 
I'm pretty sure of,' replied the Nurse, getting 
uneasy under the perpetual watch of Maida's eye, 
fearing what it might discover if its vigilance were 
not checked. The women only knew her as Anne 
Watts — her colonial alias — ^and could not, therefore, 
assist in the search for her identity with the vague 
some one of Maida's recollection. But Lucy 
Sanders, who came to see her friend on a visiting- 
Thursday, at once cleared up the doubt by ex- 
claiming, the instant she saw the Nurse, *Lor! 
Maida, if that isn't she that most killed me coming 
out.' 

A quick glance of recognition took place, and 
Maida wondered how she had failed to recall the 
ex-lunatic in the barbarous features now grinning 
before her. 

* I shouldn't wonder now, if that there ugly lip 
isn't a judgment straight from Almighty God,' 
whispered Lucy, when she had taken in as much 
of the grin as she desired. 

From this moment the animosity publicly 
revived, and warfare commenced. The women 
shrank into timid neutrality at the first resistance 
offered by Maida to some usurpation of the Nurse- 

VOL. II. p 



210 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

They were amazed at the temerity of their com- 
rade in defying the grizzly bear in her own den. 
But power was on the side of the oppressor; there- 
fore the friendless creatures were also obliged to 
side with her. Many did so from choice, being 
as corrupt as she : others, in the depth of their 
heart, ranged themselves under the standard of 
liberty, upheld with unassuming d^ity by Maida 
Gwynnham. 

The first time Maida was permitted to leave her 
bed, she became an object of general attraction. 
Prison clothes dared to rival the free habiliments 
that had hitherto borne off all regard ; and yet 
Maida felt friendless and desolate. She experienced 
that worst form of desolation — spiritual loneliness. 
She was surrounded by human beings ; sisters in 
flesh and blood were very kind in inquiring how 
she felt afrer her exertion, but she was lonely 
amidst them, for not one heart in all those twenty 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 211 

whose tearing cough and laboured breathing had 
elicited her tender pity. The lustrous eyes were 
evidently trying to convey a message to her, and 
when Maida sent back a smile in answer to their 
silent appeal, they closed, as if satisfied with the 
present result of the interview, and No. 1 leant 
back on the pillows which propped her. The 
card above her head, in the one brief word 
'phthisis,' told the story of her suffering; and 
what that story is, they best may know who have 
marked the slow fading of their dear one beneath 
consumption's sure decay. It was the doctor's 
name for her disease, but Maida, from her distant 
seat, could not read it; therefore, she asked a 
neighbour what was the matter with No. 1, and 
received the laconic answer, * Frettin.' 

A word as short as that on the card ; but how 
descriptive in its brevity ! how much it told of 
heart suffering and pain — of hopeless longing and 
craving affection — they best may know who have 
heard the sighing of the prisoner, and watched the 
slow breaking of an anguished heart. 

Seeing Maida's compassionate look, her infor- 
mant continued — 'No. 4, Crazy Sal, there, is 
another frettin' case : in one way or another, most 
of them that's brought in here is Fretters, unless 
they's scheming.' 

Maida had often been disturbed by Crazy Sal's 
wild cry, which was so like the bray of a donkey, 



212 THE BROAD AREOW. 

that, during her delirium, nothing could persuade 
her that one of those animals was not in the room ; 
but being in a line with her also, she had oever 
fully seen the poor creature, who now presented at 
once a pitiable and unsightly object. From tiie 
absence of hair, which had been closely shorn, 
every part of the broad, distended face was exposed 
to view; the thick fiilled night-cap only half 
covered her head, and completed the deformity, by 
showing to what extent it bad enlarged. As 
Maida turned towards her, Sally, with a horrible 
distortion of countenance, raised her upper lip over 
her large teeth and sent forth a series of brays. 
Maida shuddered, and asked if that cry was caased 
by pain. Her neighbour said she believed ' it was 
not; it was a noise somehow she had taken te 
make whenever Nurse went near her — pei4u^ 
because she wanted something *'out" of her, ot 
srhaps because dressing of the wounds hurted her 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 213 

from her eye ; she quivered ih her seat, longing to 
rush over to the suffering imbecile, in whose cry she 
alone of all the hearers heard a tone beseeching 
help. She attempted to stand, but weakness re- 
sisted the effort, and she could only listen in sor- 
rowing silence. The large lustrous eyes perceived 
the attempt, and again manceuvred to arrest her 
notice, and when they succeeded, they turned 
slowly and significantly toward Crazy Sal, and 
then the thin white hands of No. 1 clasped 
each other in a prayerful attitude, while the large 
eyes looked supplicatingly upward. Maida was 
perplexed, and happening at the moment of her 
perplexity to speak to a convalescent, ^No. 1 
thought she was seeking an explanation of her 
signs, and, forgetting everything but her own 
terror, she called out as loud as her low voice 
would allow — * Oh ! don't — don't — I shall get — ' 
She stopped short, and Nurse turned fiercely on 
her, * I know what you shall get, if you don't cease 
your bawl.' She moved her two forefingers so as 
to describe a square, and then nodding a savage 
nod, which seemed to mean, *Yes that^' she turned 
again to Sally. 

Wilcox, as we shall henceforth designate 'No. 1, 
trembled ; her long thin fingers worked nervously 
into each other, but without a word she laid 
her head sidewise on her pillow, where the tears 
coursed over the two bright spots which had darted 



214 THE BROAD ARROW. 

to her cheeks, when her exclamation was hushed 
by the sharp voice of her tormentor. 

How wildly did Maida watch those tears as one 
by one they fell and were absorbed by the pillow 
until it became quite wet 1 Wilcox then spread 
her pocket handkerchief to make a dry place for 
her hollow cheek, and still lying as sidewise as was 
possible in her upright position, she drew out a 
little book and commenced to read. 

' Put away that book, trying of your eyes — you 
ought to be getting asleep. I hate such hypocrisy ; 
if you'd been the saint you makewise to be, you'd 
never have been out here — fine Sunday scholar ! 
does credit to your teachers.' 

' I don't feel inclined to sleep,' answered Wil- 
cox, mildly. 

' You shan't read for all that, making your head 
ache for me to cure. Put away your humbugging 

nn-book; I hate the sight of en.' 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 215 

The thin white hand held out the well-worn 
hymn-book, and before Nurse could forbid, a con- 
valescent passed it to Maida, who took it, and, turn- 
ing to her companions, said — 

* I'll read it aloud if you all like. 
One and all gave an eager * Yes^ 

* Which hymn were you reading, Wilcox ? I'll 
go on with it.' 

*My mark is at the one, I think it is 189,' she 
replied, trying to prevent herself from meeting the 
Nurse's eye ; but the fascination of the snake was 
at work. The eyes must meet — . The trembling 
victim crept, unresisting, into the hands of the 
tyrant, who with a villanous leer again delineated 
the blister; and what flesh remained on the in- 
valid's wasted frame seemed to creep in terror as 
she hastily said — 

'Maida, you are very kind, but perhaps I'd 
better try to sleep.' 

*The reading won't disturb you, my dear,' 
chimed in the Nurse ; ' it's a different thing being 
read to and reading one'self ; go on, Maida.' 

How ghastly the grimace she pulled at Wilcox, 
as, having given this permission, she left the ward 
to vent her rage on some miserable being doomed 
by the privacy of her situation to bear unknown 
cruelties from this official monster ! 

Maida found Hymn 189, and read the last 
verse — 



216 THE BROAD ARROW. 

' JeeuB can moke a dying bed 
Feel Boft as downy pillows are, 
While on HU breast I lean my head 
And breathe my life out sweetly there.' 

' Do those words comfort you, Wilcox ?' asked 
Maida. 

'They are my only comfort,' sadly replied the 
former. 

Unbidden, Maida read them again. 

'A poor sinner like me has nothii^ else to 
cling to.' 

' Than what, Wileox ?' 

' Oh ! than Jesus !' she replied, clasping her 
hands emphatically. 

' Jasus I' repeated Crazy Sal ; and having once 
pronounced that precious name, which seemed to 
come back to the imbecile like one long forgotten, 
no one could stop her. She repeated it louder, 
louder, and louder — until she quite screamed it — 
' Jasus Ja-sus !' 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 217 

Maida was soon able to get up a little every day. 
The first time she could walk across the room she 
went over and sat by Wilcox, for the gaze of whose 
lustrous eyes she now regularly looked directly she 
stepped out of bed. A secret understanding had 
sprung up between these two captive sisters. 
Maida longed for the moment when she should 
hear from Wilcox's lips the message that her eyes 
had long since delivered. But not more than 
Wilcox longed for the opportunity of speaking to 
one whom she could not but believe God's kind 
providence had sent to relieve her of the remedi- 
able portion of her sufferings. She felt sure that 
she should find in No. 10 a friend who would 
make the la^t few days of her life as easy as they 
might be made, by protecting her firan the cruel- 
ties of the Nurse ; and she prayed God that her 
days might close before Maida's discharge again 
left her friendless, to what she was sure would be 
the redoubled malice of her enemy. She had 
been a silent observer of all that had taken place, 
and had determined, when Maida's convalescence 
permitted, to appeal to her on behalf of Crazy Sal 
and herself. She was certain the -kind and fear- 
less voice which had so often spoken cheering 
words to an unknown individual in the stillness of 
the night was one that would assert the right of a 
helpless idiot and dying fellow-creature. 

How fervent was the grasp with which she 



218 THE BROAD ARROW. 

caught hold of Maida's hand before she had come 
quite close to her stretcher! How grateful be- 
came the lustrous eye as, fatigued with her journey 
across the ward, Maida dropped into her seat — the 
edge of No. 1 's bed ! 

'Are you only twenty-two, Wilcox?' asked the 
latter in surprise, as she read the card over her head. 

* Barely that. Sickness has made me look old ; 
sorrow, older.' 

Maida pressed the hand lying within hers. 

' But I deserve it ail !' she added, slowly ; ' aU, 
all — yes — and a great deal more.' 

This was something new to Maida, so accus- 
tomed to hear convicts rail i^ainst their punish- 
ment, and term their crime die aror for which 
they were sent out 

' You speak after my own heart, Wilcox. I like 
to hear of just punishment — its justice is so gene- 
rally disclaimed.' 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 219 

and, as if ashamed of the mere remembrance of it, 
Wilcox covered her face with her hands. 

* This is a gloomy subject for you.' 

*And yet I feel happy in the assurance of 
pardon,' was spoken at the same time, so neither 
heard the other. 

* What did you say about pardon ? have you 
your conditional pardon ?' asked Maida. 

* I am not even due for my ticket ; I shall never 
need it — perhaps before this month is out I shall 
be where there is neither bond nor free ; where 
the convict will not be discerned from his master.' 

* I hope you will,' said Maida, gently. 
Wilcox gave a sweet smile, and then continuing 

her former train of thought, she said — 

* Yes ; my pardon^ I have my pardon ; but it is 
C^iconditional — signed with my Saviour's blood, 
and sealed with the. seal of heaven.' 

* Wilcox,' (Maida bent tenderly over her, ) *Ido 
not wish to mar your peace, or make you doubt ; 
but I should like to know how you are assured of 
forgiveness ? how do you know it ?' 

The question seemed to make her thoughtful : 
she did not reply for a minute ; then, the lustre 
shone out more brightly from her eye. She looked 
upwards with an expression of rapture, and 
exclaimed — 

'My Saviour died! ask me no more; that is 
enough for such sinners as me! one drop of His 



220 THE BROAD ARROW. 

precious blood would have done *, but he gave alL 
How can I help being forgiven ? Oh, Maida 1 how 
could I help it ?' 

This simple faith at once surprised and pleased 
Maida, who lotted to ask more ; but feared to dim 
the faith, which was now the all of that dying girl. 

Thoi^h herself unable to enter into the mystery 
of that hidden joy which the world can. neither give 
nor take away, she was convmced of its reality, 
and her generous spirit rejoiced in the happiness of 
one who had found that pearl of price — peace and 
joy in believing, as yet unfound by herself. 

The Kurse's entrance and grim stare of disappro- 
bation enforced a momentary silence, for which 
Maida was not sorry. She wanted to think over 
what she heard. When they were again free to 
speak, Wilcox turned to Maida, and gently sqiiera- 
ing her hand, whispered — 

' Dear Maida ! how 1 do love you ! my mistress 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 221 

tell you a secret — perhaps you will be able to assist 
me. I should like to obtain that pardon of which 
you feel so sure — no one knows how I long for it ! 
how can I get it T 

* Jesus will give it you : He gave me mine.' 

* But how can I be sure that He will ?' 

* Get it first and be sure of it afterwards.' 
Maida shook her head. 

'Jesus has pledged himself to give it. Oh, 
think of His suffering and death, and then you 
will be sure they could only be for a very great 
purpose ; and then think of His love and pity, and 
you will be drawn to Him.' 

' Ah, I believe all that — but only for others ; I 
cannot for myself.' 

* 1 am not able to explain. I can only tell from 
my own experience how precious Jesus is to the 
sinner ; the saint loves Him, worships Him, and 
praises Him ; but oh ! it's the poor sinner that 
clings to Him. Dear Maida, don't look sad, Jesus 
will give you your pardon, freely, gladly — no one 
ever wished for it in vain — you mitst have it. I 
cannot bear to think of your going away from 
Jesus.' 

' I am always going away from Him. Once I did 
so willingly — now because I can't help it. Perhaps, 
as you have been ill so long you don't know what 
a prisoner has to contend with.' 

' Yes, I do ; I was hired out eleven months, and 



222 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

though my mistress was as kind as could be, there 
was much to bear ; but I told Jesus of it all, aud 
that made me happy till I came here.' 

* If it will not pain you, I should like to hear 
your story — it may teach me something.' 

' Fain me, dear Maida ! there will be so mudi 
to tell of my precious Saviour's love and mercy, 
that it will be a great pleasure to tell you — 
thoi^h — 

Her voice feitered. 

* Ah ! I know ; there are dreary blanks in our 
lives that no one can fill up — blanks that no earthly 
pleasure can fill,' said Maida. 

'Jesus can,' murmured Wilcox, wiping the 
tears fi-om her face. 

' You'm converted, b'ain't you ?' sneered the 
Nurse, who had drawn sufficiently near to hear the 
last words. 

' I hope so !' meekly answered Wilcox. 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 223 

* I have only one way of dealing with my foes,' 
said Maida, calmly ; * as for your debt^ I'm willing 
to forgive it 1' 

' Fine ! that's like the imperance of the woman ; 
I tell you what, you had your day when we 
couldn't help ourselves — now I mean to have mine 
when you can't help yourself, for you'm a mere 
bantling yet.' 

But as far as personal injury was concerned 
Nurse knew better than to vent her spite on 
Maida ; all she could do in that way had been in- 
flicted when she lay helpless in bed. 

'You had better go, Maida, I shall only get 
worse ofl* by your staying,' said Wilcox. 

' How ? what do you mean ? dare she ill-treat 
you ; let me know it, and I'll — ' 

' Ah, nothing ; we are none of us in the same 
temper always.' 

Maida was not to be deceived : she asked no 
further question, but determined to watch. She 
had long been disposed to the opinion that so 
much fear must have some other cause than the 
mere offensive manner of the Nurse. 

She arose to go, and then sitting down again, 
said — 

' I thought you had something to tell me, or 
something you wanted me to do, Wilcox. I have 
always so interpreted your earnest lookings at me.' 

' So I had ; but I forget everything when I can 



224 THE BROAD ARROW. 

get any one to speak of my Saviour with me ; and 
really, when I think of His love, and of mi/ sins, 
I feel ashamed of caring for my sufferings ; but 
when they come they are so very bad to bear, that 
I grieve to say I forget Him and all He bore.' 

' If they are the sufferings 6rom your disease, 
you do well to receive them patiently ; but I fear 
they are not wholly that — tell me.' 

* I'll tell you what I did want you to do — to keep 
an eye on poor Crazy Sal — she made me so mise- 
rable, but it's no use now she's removed. I'm sure 
there's something wrong there, the poor, harmless 
thing would never scrtiech so for nought ; and then 
if you could see Nurse's face as / have when she 
stoops over her pretending to be kind ! Oh I it is 
dreadful to think of. Poor Sal wasn't so when first 
she came; she could then talk a little, but now she 
doesn't speak only two words, the name of her 
home, and that name she caught from the hymn. I 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 225 

* Oh ! no ; it seems she pined away her reason. 
She was never very famous, so they who knew her 
at home said. • When first she was put on board 
with a set of women she looked like one struck ; 
when the ship sailed she stayed upon deck watching 
the land, and then when it got out of sight she fell 
down and fainted right away; after that she did 
nothing but cry all the way out. The matron and 
doctor pitied her at first, but every one got tired of 
her crying, and some one put it into the doctor's 
head that she was scheming, and one woman 
declared she'd seen her swallow soap pills to 
make herself ill, so the poor soul had to take an 
emetic, the doctor said that was always his cure for 
schemers ; but she wasn't scheming, 'twasn't in her. 
On board the *^ Anson " they could do nothing with 
her, and one day a dreadfiil attack took her all 
at once, and she's never been better since. Her 
sufferings here have been more than the doctors 
know of!' 

' Then they shall be so no longer ! If I can get 
at her no other way I'll rise in the night and creep 
in on my hands and knees,' said Maida. 

"Wilcox shook her head. 

* But you haven't answered me about yourself.' 

* I have not more than I can hear and less than 
I deserve^ thank you, Maida. Some things might 
be better, but I thank God that they are not worse 
— they might be like poor Sal's.' 

VOL. II. Q 



226 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

'Wilcox, do answer,' said Maida? *I am not 
strong yet, and the thought of what you may have 
suffered and may still suffer, makes me quite ill, 
and you know,' she added, half smilingly, 'Nuree 
will make out I want some more of that nauseoira 
stuff if I look flushed, or tired. Do tell me in what 
way she has it in her power to annoy you.' 

Had Wilcox been in a smiling mood the word 
annoy would have drawn a smile from her, but as 
she was fer too anxious to think of anything but 
Kurse, she raised herself and looked around : no one 
was nigh, the convalescents were grouped around 
the fire ; the bed next her was empty, and the op- 
pressor had gone into the next ward. 

Lowering her voice, she replied — ' She has ways 
that you would never dream of, and such natural 
t^ngs that if the doctor or Mrs. Cott find them out 
they only think it's all right. One thii^ thoi^h, 
isn't so, but that has never been found out. When 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 227 

* Wretch !' stamped Maida, * where is she T 
But Wilcox's imploring face stopped her. 

* And pray what have you done to merit all this 
at her hand?' asked Maida in a haughty tone, 
forgetfiil in her anger to distinguish between the 
offenders and the offended. 

* When first I came I resisted some of her wicked 
ways. She offered to bum. the blister that was or- 
dered for me if I'd give her my glass of wine, but of 
course I wouldn't ; 'twas then she began, and ever 
since it's been dreadful.' 

* I suppose she knew me too well to attempt such 
tricks, but I have suspected some foul play of the 
sort with some of the patients/ 

* Oh, she carries on a regular trade ; half the 
•physic is thrown out ; those who are not fond of 
drink gladly exchange their wine or beer for leave 
to throw away their medicine or escape a blister ; 
those that don't yield she pays out by telling the 
doctor that they require something or other that 
they dislike. Oh, Maida, I feel very down some- 
times when I think that I ought to do my best to 
stop these things. Satan puts it into my mind that 
I can't love my Saviour because I don't — but — ' 

* God knows what would ensue, and does not ex- 
pect it of you, I should think. Is there not a text 
that says, " He knoweth our frames ?" ' interrupted 
Maida. 

* Ah, yes, thank you for remembering it. Now 
do go and mind — mind not to speak of what I have 



228 THE BROAD ARROW. 

told you; I've made up my mind to bear it — it 
can't be for long.' 

' And it shan't either !' Maida answered, indig- 
nantly ; ' however, you may trust me,' her voice and 
countenance changed, ' and mj/ pardon ' you'll re- 
member that?' 

Wilcox smiled ; then very fatigued Maida tot- 
tered back to her chair just as the rattle of panikins 
announced tea. 

One morning shortly after her vieit to Wilcox, 
as Maida lay waiting for her summons to get up, 
which was now always given at ten o'clock, she 
fancied she heard a stifled sob proceed from No. 1, 
over whom Nurse was leaning to dress her blis- 
ter ; she sat up and listened — another muffled sob. 
Without a word she slid out of her strehdier 
and crossed the ward ; she stood behind Nurse and 
saw Wilcox lying (so as she could only look at the 
ceiling) with a banilkercbief stuffed in her mouth. 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 229 

drawn out of her mouth and Nurse felt herself 
dragged backward. 

* Coward ! Wretch ! Tyrant ! you shall leave 
this place/ 

The Nurse was bewildered for a moment, and 
then bristling up, she asked — 

* And pray what's all this about ? Go back to 
your place, you bad woman ! Fine for a rheumatic 
patient to be out without socks or shoes !* 

* Finish dressing that poor creature's blister; 
then you shall know what it is about. How will 
you get off that salt you've rubbed into her?' 
haughtily demanded Maida. 

' Salt ? you barbarous hussy ! don't 'e, for love's 
sake, talk in one breath of salt^ and that poor 
mortal's sore flesh — it's enough to make one's heart 
leap out' 

* How will you get it off?' sternly demanded 
Maida ; at the same time raising Wilcox on her 

pillow. 

'What the deuce does she mean?' wondered 
Nurse, looking from one to the other of the women, 
who, in the different stages of dressed, partly 
dressed, and not dressed at all, had gathered round 
the disputants. 

* Very like she mistook the flour for salt,' sug- 
gested one. 

* To be sure ! fool I was for not guessing that !' 
Then turning to Maida — 



230 THE BROAD ARROW. 

' If 'twera't that that thought was enough to riz 
your bile, I'd make you beg pardon for your inso- 
leuce ; but I'll look it over — only mind your own 
business for the future. People that meddles is 
always in die wrong. Salt! Me — I can't get 
over it !' 

' Was it salt or flour, Wilcox ?' asked Maida, 
imperturbedly. 

'I only felt something cold falling. The sore 
always smarts, so I can't tell.' 

' Here, woman, if you an't satisfied, look for 
yourself — what's this ?' 

Without doubt it was flour that Nurse displayed 
in her hand ; she passed it round for t^e inspection 
of the crowd, who not only touched it, but tasted 
it. The verdict was unanimously given for Nurse. 

* Then I beg your pardon, Nurse. I withdraw 
my accusation, but certainly my eyes never more 
deceived me,' said Maida. 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 231 

* Bless US ! what's the woman after ? What 
handkerchief d'ye mean ?' 

* I put it in my mouth, Maida,' muttered Wil- 
cox, faint with terror. 

' Did you, poor darling ?' replied Maida. 

* No patience with such cant ! Fine pity yours 
is, keeping of a dying creature, 'most naked, in 
the cold ! Here, my dear, let me finish you ; you 
are starved, an't you ?' 

Wilcox shuddered when operations recommenced, 
but this time without cause ; for almost tenderly 
did Nurse complete her task, for some reason or 
other substituting a piece of fine carded cotton for 
the sperm-plaister. Though nonplussed, Maida 
was by no means convinced, and she determined to 
say something to the doctors which should make 
them ask to see the sore. 

When they appeared, to her delight, Dr. Lamb 
was among them. He was a general favourite 
with the women. If any favour had to be sought, 
it was always reserved for Dr. Lamb's day. 

She seated herself by Wilcox, so as to create less 
surprise by the remark she had prepared. 

Number 1 was soon surrounded by four of the 
fraternity, and four pupils. 

* How d'ye feel, my woman ?' asked Dr. Lamb, 
kindly. 

* I had a very bad night, sir.' 

* 'Count for it in any way ?' 



232 THE BROAD ARROW. 

' She'd a blister last n^ht, sir,' chimed in ^urse, 
■who, most cat-like, watched Maida. 

' This blistering seems everlasting work,* mut' 
tered Dr. Lamb to Mr. Ferris, the house-doctor ; 
' I doubt whether one night's rest isn't worth a 
hundred of 'em.' 

Mr. F. only clicked his tongue against his 
teeth. 

' Why, Maida, my friend, you look as if you 
were longing for a touch up,' said Dr. Lamb. 

' Touch up ' was a &vourite expression with Dr. 
Lamb, in connection with blisters ; therefore Maida 
understood it, and rejoicing at this unexpected 
opportunity, so much better than her own plan, she 
answered — 

' Oh, m», sir I I saw poor Wilcox's dreadfiil 
chest this morning. The sight is enough to last 
my life. Oh, so shocking !' 

' Let's see my woman. I don't want to punish 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 233 

* I think I could tell you, sir,* said Maida, now 
sure that salt had been used. 

* Why, sir,' hurried in Nurse, * the flesh looked 
so sore and bumpy, I thought it couldn't bear much 
fretting, so I clapped on a bit of cotton to soothe it 
a bit. It looked so bad (dida't it, Maida ?), that 
they thought I'd been a putting salt on it.' 

* And you didy woman !' ejaculated Maida. 
Dr. Lamb turned quickly to her, with — 

* Here, I say, you mustn't rub up people like 
thcU. I've never found Nurse in the wrong yet.' 

* Thank you, sir,' dropped Nurse. * What 
should I want to put salt in a body for ?' 

* A breast of bacon, perhaps ?' laughed Dr. 
Lamb. * What does Wilcox herself say : have you 
been pickled this morning ?' 

Wilcox attempted a smile — how miserable an one! 

* I don't know, sir,' she feebly articulated. 
Maida clenched her teeth impatiently, with a 

slushing sound. 

* " Let dogs delight to bark and bite," etcetera,' 
said Dr. Lamb, passing on, and creating a laugh, 
which, in his good humour, he meant should be 
fun, for he always tried to amuse his patients with 
some drollery. He knew not the bitterness that 
fell from Nurse's lips in the form of that laugh. 

Maida, baffled in one point, would not without 
another struggle resign her protegee into the 
hand of the enemy. 



234 THB BEOJJ> ARROW. 

When Mrs. Cott entered the ward to hear the 
medical opinion of her ' family,' before Nurse or any 
one had time to put in a word, ^e stepped for- 
ward. 

' Mtb. Cott, I have a favour to ask.' 

' "Well, my dear." 

* I am pronounced convalescent ; and as I 
beUeve the convalescents are expected to take 
diai^, of a bed-patient, will you give me Wilcox ?' 

'What does she say to it?' said Mrs. Cott, 
approaching the stretcher, and taking No. I's 
thin hand. 

* Oh, ma'am I' was all she could reply : she had 
^dured enough ; that one drop of joy overcame 
her ; she wept aloud. 

* So she shall, then,' said Mrs. Cott, soothingly. 
' Nurse, Maida Gwynnham '11 take Wilcox ; she 

must therefore change stretchers. You'll be 
Na 2 now, Maida. You'll be relieved of all your 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 235 

Testament, Prayer-book, and hymns wene always 
within reach. 

The first time Maida arranged her bed, she 
found a new flannel petticoat tucked away behind 
the mattress. Inquiring why it was there, Wilcox 
explained that she had brought it on purpose to be 
buried in ; but as Nurse was always covetous, she 
had hidden it out of her sight. 

*I'd have given it her, Maida, only it's so 
dreadful to think of being buried with no decent 
covering; but I'll gladly give it you-r-yon may 
take it at once, or when I'm gone.' 

^ I will see it put on yoUy dear,' said Maid^i as 
calmly as though only talking of dressing her ^e 
next morning. 

* And you will close my eyes ? Oh, I hope 
you'll be near when I die, or else you won't be let 
to do for me.' 

* Maida,' she said, after a moment's pause, 
* you'll think me very childish, but something 
troubles me. Do you think it's true that they cut 
up prisoners, and throw them any way into their 
coflSns ?' 

* Yes ; cut up as small as mincemeat,' called out 
Nurse, who was passing at that instant ; but Maida 
quickly answered — 

* I know strange things are reported, but / do 
not believe one of them. In order to certify to 
Government that the patients really die of the

complaint stated 'm the books^* the bodies are 
always examined after death, but that is all.' 

' I hope so. A man who had been employed in 
Tench, told me that once when he was carrying a 
coffin he heard the bones all ratthng about as if 
they'd been loose in a box,' 

' Wilcox, do you think when your soul is happy 
with Jesus, you will care what, is done to your 
poor worn-out body ?' 

' Oh, no ! foolish me ! Oh, blessed Lord Jesus '. 
forgive my folly ; only let my soul go to Thee, and 
my body may be tiirown anywhere : the meanest 
comer is too good for me.' 

Next visiting Thursday the ward was thrown 
into pleasant surprise by the entrance of a lady 
who asked for one Eliza Wilcox. 

She could scarce believe that the skeleton called 
No. 1 was her former servant. 

' My mistress !' exclaimed Wilcox. 




H.M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 237 

* I am, ma'am,' replied Maida. 

* No, ma'am, / am,' said the Nurse, guessing the 
drift of the inquiry ; ' / do for this ward/ 

' You are Wilcox's nurse, at any rate ?' asked 
the lady, looking at Maida ; * well, then, this is 
for you ,•' she held out a half-crown. 

Maida took it 

* I will buy her some tamarinds with it, ma'am.' 
^ You vile, sneaking jade, cheating me out of my 

perkisites in that way. May the money rot in 
your hand ! I'd like to see the tamarinds ycm '11 
buy with it,' exclaimed the enraged official, when 
the lady had gone. 

'Maida, don't,' whispered Wilcox; * 'twill do 
me more harm than good.' 

' Very well, then, I won't,' replied Maida, aloud ; 
' but / don't want the money ; and if I give it to 
Nurse, she'll spend it in drink ; so it shall go to 
any poor soul who finds it.' With that she mounted 
the top of a stretcher, and raising her arm, flung 
the coin through the open window ; and at the 
same moment the Nurse flouted out of the ward. 

'She's gone to spit her rage on Sal,' whispered 
the women to each other. 

' God help her, poor soul !' ejaculated one. 

' Maida, shall I tell you ?' said Wilcox, softly, 
as her friend took her place again by her. 

' Yes, dear, what you please.' 

' Our Master would not have done that — He 



238 THE BBOAS ABSOW. 

would have soothed the anger even of an 
enemy.' 

' How do you know that ?' 

* Because it says He was meek and lowly, and 
did not strive.' 

Maida became liioughtful, and then replied — 
' You are right, / am wrong ; I will go at once, 

and beg her pardon ; I should have given her the 

money : my temper always hurries me into folly. 

But, Wilcox, you mustn't say our Master — I do 

not profess to follow Him.' 

' Then why don't you? you don't know how it 

would help you, to profess it outright.' 

* In what ? I'm afraid you sadly mistake me.' 

' No, I don't. I know you tcant to be one 
thing, and your temper makes you be something 
quite different. Maida, Maida, have I ofibided 
you?' 

Maida shook her head ; and then leaning towards 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTON. 239 

' It's poor Sal !' 

* Jasus ! — oh, Jasus !' 
Maida started. 

*Go, Maida, go, she is getting rubbed in the 
straw.' 

^ Oh ! oh ! oh ! Jasus ! Ja-sus !' 

A fierce nod was Maida's only answer. 

* There, you senseless beast ; the soonejr you're 
rotted away the better!' reached Maida's ear as 
she stepped into the closet. * There,' and all 
covered as it was with wounds from long lying. 
Nurse rubbed the body of the imbeci.e in the fresh 
straw beneath it, just as you would rub a rolling- 
pin into dough. 

* Jasus ! Jasus !' cried Crazy Sal. 

* Leave her !' passion and feeling would let Maida 
say no more. 

* Leave her !' the words were scarcely articu- 
late for rage. 

* I tell you what now, Mrs. Martha Grylls, if you 
come meddling with me, I'll find a means to make 

you wish you'd never darkened my path, you ! 

You've sought the job, so you shall have it ; come 
and see how you like it : sweet, refireshing, nice ! 
b'aint it ?' 

* I meant to take it, and I mean to be Sally's 
attendant for the fiiture ; if you say one word 
against it, you shall be turned out of your situa- 
tion.' 



240 THE BROAD ARROW. 

Fury grianed in the woman's features, but she 
feared to obey its dictates ; another complaint from 
Maida might be followed by worse consequences 
than was the former. AVith a daring oath she left 
the closet, slamming the door after her with such 
violence as to make the whole suite of wards shake. 
When Maida approached Sally, the imbecile 
shrunk in terror, and cast at her a timid side 
glance such as a dog, accustomed to ill-treatment, 
will shrinkiugly cast towards some doubtful person 
who attempts to pat him. 

' Never mind, poor Sally, I will not hurt you.' 

She wiped the tears from the swollen face, and 
then, loathsome as it was in its cadaverous white- 
ness, she stooped kindly over it and kissed the 
scaly forehead. 

' Jasus ?' whispered Sally, almost in Maida's ear. 

'Yes, Jesus, He loves you.' 

' I/Oves me,' repeated the imbecile ; then yield-

who fatigued with the late exertion had sunk back 
completely exhausted, looking more ghastly than 
ever. 

Maida explained her case. 

* She's faint ! what a strange colour she has 
become; give her a sup of water, quickly,' said 
Mr. H. 

Before it could touch her mouth the lip went up, 
and then, protracted to an unusual length, came 
the bray, discordant and soul-piercing. 

The Nurse, knowing that Mr. Herbert was 
there, ran in to tell him that the noise was nothing 
to be afraid of; Sally was a poor, harmless crea- 
ture. 

' Jasus, Jasus !' screeched the girl when she saw 
the Nm-se. 

* Go out, woman ! your presence troubles her,' 
beckoned Maida. 

Without signifying his intention, Mr. Herbert 
knelt by the stretcher, and looking reverently up- 
ward, said, slowly and distinctly — 

' O Lord, thou Son of David, have mercy on 
her for she is grievously tormented.' 

He remained in silent prayer a few moments, 
and then perceiving the swollen eyes of the imbecile 
fixed on him, he arose and stood by her. 

* Does she not speak ?' 

* Only two words, the name of her home and 
that word you heard her call out.' 

VOL. II R 



242 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

'That name, that is above every name! the 
name of Jesus, is one — ' 

'Jasus! Jasus!' cried Sally, catching up his 
words. 

' Ay, He will hear you, poor stricken one ! He 
despiseth not the cry of the destitute,' sympa- 
thisingly replied Mr. Herbert 

' Jasus ! Jasus !' she once more repeated, and 
then appeared to faint ; but* it was the feint of 
death. She opened her eyes and gave one look 
towards Mr. Herbert and Maida, then closed them 
for ever upon her sufferings. 

And who will say that when the Saviour of the 
world shall come, bringing His redeemed ones 
with Him, poor Crazy Sal shall not be seen among 
the lowly who have crept into heaven by power of 
that name which is the only one whereby we can 
be saved? 

Maida wished to stay and lay out the body, but

that passed favourably, there was every hope the 
genial climate of Port Arthur might benefit 
her. 

* Am I not then to jreturn to the Lodge, sir ?' 

* Oh yes, Mr. Evelyn has left word that you are 
to be taken there when you receive your discharge. 
I thought,' he continued, smiling, * that you would 
be disappointed to find my daughter absent, she 
longs for you very much.' 

* Miss Evelyn is very good, I shall be sorry to 
miss her, sir,' was all Maida said, but she felt much 
more, and had a secret misgiving that she should 
not see her young mistress again. 

' If we can get permission we mean to send for 
you to come after us ; you must not be too sanguine, 
though.' 

'I am sanguine of nothing, sir. I am to be 
discharged in a fortnight ; before then, perhaps, the 
master will make me acquainted with his wishes, 
which I shall be ready to obey.' 

' A fortnight,' thought Wilcox, ' shall I be gone 
by that time ?' and she examined her thin hands 
to see how much thinner they must become ere she 
could reckon on her release — they had only a skin 
over them ; as far as their emaciation could bfd 
him. Death might come as soon as he pleased ; 
disease could extort nothing more from her save a 
few sighs, a few more laboured breaths, a few more 
days of distress. Maida understood the action, and 



244 THE BEOAD ARROW 

forgetting her own vexation, in beholding the 
anxious glance of her friend, said — 

' Wilcox, ask Mr. Evelyn.' 

' Sir, we are troubled with a question ; we cannot 
decide it.' 

Mr. Herbert looked kindly towards her, and then 
to Maida, who asked somewhat hastily — ' Would 
it be wrong to pray that she may die before I go T. 

' It were better Tiot ; trust to that Friend who 
loveth at all times. He will become more precious 
with the absence of your earthly friend, Wilcox.' 

' It is not that, sir ; were my absence all, Wilcox 
would have nothing to dread from my dischai^e ; 
but there are things which your kind heart never, 
never dreams of, and which only a prisoner can 
know; these things make my presence very ne- 
cessary to her, poor dear !' 

' I dream of them more thaii you suppose, Maida, 
and my inability to prevent them is a sorrow only

appoint the rocks for a refuge to the timid coney, 
will not desert you in your hour of trouble/ 

* But He has^ sir,' interrupted Maida. 
*Hush, Maida, you kuow not what you say,' 

quickly said Mr. Herbert. * Think a moment. 
Has there been no good brought out of the per- 
mitted evil of Wilcox's sufferings T 

He turned his eye as though he would read her 
inliest thought. A smile played on the lips of the 
dying girl ; she exclaimed, ' Oh, sir I I will leave 
myself to Him. He will be with me when I pass 
through the waters ; He will be more to me than 
mother, or father, or sisters could have been, had 
I been dying in my home. Sir, I forget I am a 
convict when I think of these things. Maida can 
go, for Jesus will be with me ; but never^ never can 
I forget her love and kindness. Oh, sir ! when I 
am no more, do be her friend.' She caught Mr. 
Evelyn's hand, and, gazing earnestly, repeated — 
' Do^ sir ; will you promise me ?' 

Mr. Herbert gave the promise, and turned to 
ratify it to Maida, but she had left the ward. 

* Farewell, Wilcox. I go to my own poor child, 
who is very ill, though not so far prostrated as you. 
Give me a message for her.' 

' Make her promise to love Maida,' she promptly 
replied. 

' Is that all ?' said Mr. Herbert, smiling through 
his sadness. 



246 THE BROAD AEROW. 

' If I may make so free, sir, tell her — but it will 
pain you perhaps.' 

'No, my child, I have long since resigned her.' 

' Then tell her, sir, not to dread death. He is 
gentle as a lamb to those who are not his ene- 
mies. Maida is to have my Bible and hymn book ; 
but will you give dear Miss Evelyn this, little Prayer 
book, and say that if she reads the last verse of the 
twenty-seventh Psalm, she will find a text that has 
often kept up the faith of a poor sinking soul — tell 
her the Lord's leisure is the best.' 

She gave the little volume to Mr. Herbert ; he 
pressed her hand, but spoke not a word in taking 
the parting gift. 

From this moment the bitterness had passed. 
There were yet eight days to Maida's discharge ; 
she strove to be cheerfiil, and her companion was 
so in reality ; one Sunday more were they to 
spend tc^ether. That Sunday was to be a special 




H. M. GENERAL HOSPITAL, HOBARTOX. 247 

* Nurses at the beds, and all convicts at the 
benches,' said the doctor. With a malicious grin 
the nurse of Number Four took her place by Wil- 
cox, and pointed Maida to a seat at the opposite 
end of the ward. To dispute were useless. In 
silence Maida obeyed, and she had only just taken 
her seat, when his lordship's solemn voice com- 
menced the service. But the service was nothing 
to her; she sat eagerly watching Wilcox. The 
sermon commenced ; but not the touching 
parable of the Prodigal Son could divert her 
thoughts from No. 1. She saw the invalid put 
out her parched tongue and try to moisten her 
lips ; she beckoned to the nurse to give her some- 
thing to drink ; but Nurse was too intent on the 
sermon to receive the signal. So Maida arose, 
and, despite his lordship's piercing eyes, which 
followed every step she took, walked to No. 1, 
and put a teaspoonful of liquid to her dry lips. 
She was about to return, when, casting a second 
look, she saw Wilcox raise her arms, give one 
smile — bright with anticipation — one breath, soft 
as the flutter of a tiny bird, and the soul of the con- 
vict was free. Hastily, ere Nurse should perceive 
the event, dropped Maida by the couch ; tenderly 
and reverently she bowed her head an instant, then, 
stretching forth her hand, she fulfilled her friend's 
last wish, and closed the eyes, which still looked 
upward, hopefully, longingly ! 



248 THE BROAD AEROW. 

'Thank God!' she murmured, rising from her 
kneea. The Nurse turned round, and Maida 
pointed to the lifeless clay with an expression that 
wotiid be triumphant through all the solemnity of 
the moment. She sat herself by the corpse, and 
strove to listen to the earnest appeal the bishop 
was making to the prod%als arranged in sombre 
brown before him ; but the attempt was vain ; her 
thoughts wandered over that brief chapter of her 
life in which the dying girl had formed so striking 
a part. 'Yes,' she mentally exclaimed, 'Mr, Her- 
bert is correct, good has worked out of the evil of 
this poor creature's suffering ; it has taught me that 
which I craved to leani, that a convict can be saved 
— to doubt it were treason to the King of kings.' 

This had long been a question in Maida's mind. 
She had listened eagerly, though unavowedly, to 
Mr. Herbert's and Emmeline's teaching; but she 
feared they who had never fallen could not rightly 




H. M. GENERAL HOSt>ITAL, HOBARTON. 249 

She was aroused from her meditation by a pause 
in the sermon ; it was over. Raising his hands, the 
bi^op turned slowly round, at. the same time say- 
ing, with peculiar distinctness, * The peace of God; 
which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts 
and minds in the knowledge and love of God.' By 
thife time he stood with hi^ tands toward Maida, 
then he proceeded — * And the blessing of God 
Almighty, tte Father, the Son, arid the Holy 
Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with you 
always.' 

It seemed that the bishop had read her thoughts. 
Maida sunk upon her knees to receive the benedic- 
tioii; clasping her hands, she uttered a loud, fer- 
vent ^^'Atfhm^ as 'the last word fell. Aiid the 

.. , ■ _ • r ■ ' 

recdiedtion of the im^ideht which had once before 
brought that text to her mind, came with a comfort- 
ing power, and' she felt there was nieither irreverence 
nor- superstition in connecting it with the present 
ocoa&ion. 

But :the time had not yet come. The tranquit 
lity she experienced vanished with the bishop. The 
door had scarcely closed upon his lords'hip, ere the 
Nurse rush^ over and thrust her arm into the 
stretcher where Wilcox lay. Thence she drew out 
the tovtSted treasure with so sudden a jerk that the 
head of the corpse bounced back with a heavy fall. 
Exhibiting the petticoat to the view of the women, 
she shouted — ' This is mine !' 



250 THE BROAD ARROW. 

Maida, gently as she could, laid hold of the 
flannel, and said, ' I do not wish to quarrel, but I 
must have this. I promised she should be buried 
in it.' 

' if she shall ; if you can get it, you shall 

have it : not else.' 

Maida continued to hold on with a firm but 
gentle grasp. 

' Matron's a-coming, better let her have it^' 
joined all the women. 

' What'U 'e give me then, quick.' 

' Nothing,' said Maida, quietly folding the gar- 
ment. 

Once in the dead-house, the corpse was beyond 
her care ; so Maida could never ascertain whether 
the flannel formed its shroud. She feared not ; for 
Mrs. Cott told her it belonged to the Queen. Now 
she cared not bow soon her discharge might be.

was without a man-servant* Googe had been ap- 
prehended as chief party in an extensive coining 
fraud that for some time had baffled the police, and 
cheated the tradesmen out of their legal money. 

Mrs. Cott told Maida that she believed her 
master was waiting to put her in the place of a 
man ; on which Maida said, that as far as guarding 
the house went, she should not at all mind the 
chaise. Thursday arrived. Maida received her 
discharge, and bade good-bye to the patients. 
When it was Nurse's turn, she offered her hand, but 
that worthy refused it, saying, * she had only one 
hope, and that was, that she should still be in the 
hospital when Maida came in to die ; wouldn't she 
make a frightful corpse of her, that's all! she'd 
stretch her eyes wide open instead of closing them 
like a Christian.' 

* I'll forgive you if you do,' said Maida, forcing 
a smile ; * I am afraid you would close them in 
self-defence afler a while. I should look so 
frightful.' 

Ere descending the stairs she peeped into the 
closet where Crazy Sal had lain ; it was still empty. 
She pitied the next object who should be there 
exposed to the unchecked malice of the wretched 
being chosen as nurse for the ward and its depend- 
encies. 

Does the reader wish to ask any question ere 
Maida's departure shuts the hospital to his inquiry?

CHAPTER VIII. 

PORT ARTHUR — 0. P. 8. 0. — THE KANGAROO. 

His Excellency the Lieutenant-governor, having 
duly and formally signified his approval of the 
admission of the Reverend Herbert Evelyn and 
family into the sacred regions of Port Arthur, 
and the Comptroller-general having promised to 
apprise the Superintendent of the settlement of 
their visit, in order that the waggons might be in 
waiting for them on their arrival, one bright 
morning in the month of February, Emmeline, 
accompanied by her father and cousin, took her 
place on board the * Kangaroo,' the Government 
steam-boat plying between Hobarton and the 
Peninsula; and shortly after, a second cab set 
down Mrs. Evelyn and her children on the jetty, 
when Charlie speedily found his way to his uncle, 
and became vociferously jubilant at the prospect 
of a trip down the river, as the water route to 
Tasman's Peninsula is denominated. The free 
passengers were ready to start. A young lieuten- 
ant just bearing away his still more youthful bride 



254 THE BROAD ARROW. 

to the ungainly solitude of Eagle Hawk Neck, 
was fast increasing his impatience with the increas- 
ing moments ; when tramp-a-tramp, chink-a-chink 
along the road, and chained two together a gang 
of second-sentence men drew near. Ere they 
could reach the wharf a band of armed soldiers 
drew up on each side of the jetty, and at word of 
command, as the gang approached, they pointed 
their muskets, forming a guarded pathway for the 
convicts, who two by two passed throi^h it and 
hobbled on board the steamer, where crowded 
together they had to stand out the passage. 
Quickly followed a band of probationers, boimd 
for the Cascades — and then the soldiers divided — 
part marching into the boat after the men, the 
others returning to Hobart. It was now half-past 
seven ; the captain mounted the paddle-wheel, 
gave the signal, and in another moment the 
' Kangaroo ' was off, pattering on her way, most

other dwell admiringly on the landscape ; she must 
look all, feel all, pity all, or admire all, or else 
shut her eyes altogether. 

' Can we never escape from them ?' she whis- 
pered to Emmeline, as winding round the wharf 
moved slowly onwards the alternate tramp and 
clank. There was a time when Bridget would 
have turned from the spectacle which the deck 
presented as one not so pleasant to behold as that 
which lay before her in the distant hills ; but now 
in vain opened to view magnificent scenes from the 
coasts of Frederick Henry Bay ; in vain upreared 
the Iron Pot, its grotesque dimensions, it awaked 
in her no curiosity ; nor did the surf which boiled 
around its base attract her attention. The grand 
tumult of Storm Bay, the quiet farm of Slopen 
Island, were nothing to her so long as chains 
dragged down the hands and oppressed the feet of 
those with whom she was forced into contact. 

The day was fair and cloudless. The breeze 
tempered the heat into a bearable degree ; so that 
when the glare of the sun was excluded by an 
awning, it was luxurious to sit yielding to the 
gentle sway of the vessel, and watching the ever- 
changing, yet ever-lovely pictures which one by 
one disclosed themselves from unexpected nooks 
and windings of the river. 

Mr. Herbert, Emmeline, and Bridget^ unable to 
join in the hilarity of the free-passengers, abstracted

themselves from the general party and occupied 
the sofii on the lee-side of the sky-light, where 
their seclusion was only occasionally disturbed by 
the onslaughts of Charlie, desperate with scraps of 
news, or colonial legends inflicted on him by the 
mate. 

Irrespective of anxiety for his daughter's comfort, 
Mr. Herbert was little inclined to talk. 

He had discovered among the second-sentencera 
several of his flock, who only the Sunday before 
had listened to his admonition from the Peni- 
tentiary pulpit His spirit yejimed for them ; he 
was aware what they would have to go through in 
the fierce retributive process of which he knew 
Port Arthur to be the furnace. Hard they were 
sent down — but harder they would return ; perhaps 
again to be sent down — again to be returned 
hardened and only fit for Norfolk Island, where 
the process would be carried on to greater ptrfec- 




PORT ARTHUR. — O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 257 

The savagely sullen brow and heavy eye of 
Bradley, the constable, were unmistakeable for all 
that his hair was closely cropped, and his head 
covered by the leathern cap of the convict. 

By some strange caprice or thoughtlessness, he 
had been chained to Bob Pragg, who, notwith 
standing the discomfort of his situation, secretly 
gloried in being the means of annoying his enemy 
by sticking as close into him as possible. Every 
now and then with a sudden shove, Bradley would 
push him to the extent of the chain, when back 
would stick Bob with the tenacity of a bull-dog. 
Mr. Herbert perceived this, and kept his eye 
fixed on the pair, hoping to stop a proceeding 
which he feared, though almost laughably trifling 
in itself, might end in a court of justice. The 
heavier gathering of Bradley's bushy brow in- 
creased his fears. But Pragg was out of the 
parson's parish — nothing was to be gained by 
hearkening to him — nothing was to be saved by not 
frisking his foe ; so averting his head he continued 
to irritate Bradley. Mr. Herbert then asked an 
overseer to unchain the two and bind them to some 
other prisoner ; but the overseer refused, suppos- 
ing *they were only sparring it a bit; maybe in 
fun, for it takes the deuce to get their tricks out of 
them — or more like in spite which nobody expects 
to kick out of them.' 

Mr. Herbert asked if any known spite existed

between the men — and learnt that they were swom 
foes, perpetually bent on worrying each other. 

'The last oflFence between 'em,' said the oflScer, 
'had something to do with that burial-gTOund 
murder, for which Sam Tonkins is to be hanged. 
When Bradley was caught, he vowed vengeance 
on Fragg, and made out a case against him ; but 
the evidence wasn't very clear, so the bench let 
hira off with three months at Port Arthur. You 
see, sir, till the men have had a taste of down 
there, they don't know how to value Tench 



* It is a dangerous precedent to give a man a 
taste of poison to make him appreciate simple 
medicine,' replied Mr, Herbert, despairing of mak- 
ing an impression on the overseer, who was a 
devoted disciple of the stringencies of the penal 
code. 

Bridget was very glad that her cousin required 




PORT ARTHUR.— O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 259 

Jocose and hearty the Captain came round to pay 
his devoirs to the parson's daughter and niece, and 
Bridget, long in wait for his approach, came for- 
ward blushing for an attack on the humane prin- 
ciple of the well-proportioned sailor. 

* Your servant, miss ;' he bowed, laying his hand 
upon his heart. 

* Oh ! Captain Jolly, can't you let loose those 
poor creatures?' bustled out from Bridget's lips 
ere she could acknowledge his gallantry. 

*Well — don't see how; they might fly over- 
board, and that would be awkward, seeing ^iley are 
paid for. Go down in the cabin if they annoy you, 
miss.' 

* They don't annoy me — they make me sad.' 

* Well, I never viewed it in that light, Miss 
D 'Urban; it seems to me rather comfortable to 
hear them piping away like six o'clock; if they 
don't pipe us to supper they remind us of it, and 
that's next best. On my honour, I don't know what 
we poor sea-dogs would do without our poultry.' 

* Oh, Captain ! I meant the prisoners.' 

* Bless my heart alive, miss! let them loose? 
We should be in Davy's locker, sure as fate, 
before we'd spun much farther, and iheyd be on 
their way to California. Did you never hear how 
they overhauled the Bishop's frigate? and — ha! 
ha ! — bless my heart alive, miss, as my name's 
Jolly, ''twould be jolly to strike the darbies off that 



260 THE BEOAD ARROW. 

precious lot : we might all so well leap overboard 
at once.' 

* Horrid creatures ! Whatever is it, Captain T 
inquired Mrs. Evelyn, who, baby in arms, just 
crossed the deck in time to hear the last words. 

* Nothing, madam, only miss proposes we shall 
change places with the gang ; and, on my honour, 
I've no inclination that way.' 

Seeing that madam looked rather mystified, he 
explained : * Miss is begging of me to cut away 
their cables, and I tell her they'd overhaul us 
before we could cry " Mercy !" ' 

' Really, Bridget, my dear, you do make your- 
self very silly ; you mustn't listen to her. Captain 
Jolly : she has the most romantic notions about the 
convicts. I do believe she'd set them all free if 
she could : yes, and I believe you would, too, 
Herbert,' added Mrs. Evelyn, as she observed s 




PORT ARTHUR. — O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 261 

solation, despair, or defiance sat on all the sunburnt, 
blistered faces. 

Mr. Herbert noted his niece's silent comment on 
her aunt's observation, and involuntarily following 
her example, his eye also wandered through the 
human indices for some reference to the imputed 
happiness; but none was visible in the dreary 
blank of countenance, or in the darkly-written page 
of crime, whose physiognomy was fiill of meaning ; 
but of what sort ? 

* Well now, parson, supposing you had Govern- 
ment permission to uncage a few of those precious 
birds, which of all those now before you would you 
let out ? Yonder are two likely lads — those there 
— ^that keep spurring it like game-cocks.' 

* I should be cautious in giving liberty to any 
man who had once entered a penal settlement. I 
consider all who have once been to Port Arthur, or 
other places of second punishment, most dangerous 
characters; but I should be glad to arrest the 
progress of half who are on their way there.' 

* Well, I don't know anything about that : I'm 
paid to take 'em backwards and forwards — the 
deuce / care how many or how few get aboard, so 
long as my pay don't shift to suit the rise and fall 
of 'em.' 

Captain took a turn to and from the paddle- 
wheel, and then coming to Mr. Herbert, asked — 
*But I say, parson, if we locked our penal 



262 THE BROAD AREOW. 

settlements, what could we do with our second- 
sentencers if we'd no place to send them to ? a hang 
they'd care for the Judge and all the Bench; 
they'd point their fingers at us, and off again to 
their tricks. Without our Port Arthurs we should 
have a constant repetition of that jolly farce of 
Louisa Ferres.' 

*I would not do away with our penal settle- 
ments, Mr. Jolly, until some well-digested plan 
were formed for the better lodgment of our men ; 
but I would have the settlements conducted under 
a different system. It is not wise to trust the best 
men with unlimited power; the heart's vanity 
cannot stand it Abstracted from the inspection of 
the public as these settlements are, there cannot be 
too much care in the selection of fitting instruments 
to work the system. Where there are several 
hundreds of men all at the mercy of one free man, 
what is to be expected if that free man be one of

present a fair account of matters progressing to the 

satisfaction of ^ the Superintendent ! There 

is no ^dissatisfaction or maltreatment of the convicts 
to blot the seemly foolscap. The Comptroller 
reads, approves, and applauds the judicious officer, 
who so skilfully manages to keep down five hundred 
rebels in subjection, at once uririrhsome to them- 
selves and beneficial to the colony in general.' 

* But then the Comptroller goes down to see for 
himself.' 

* Truly ! The authorities visit the settlement 
and examine the police reports, which are all 
entered by a paid and, most likely, convict clerk, 
who, if the latter, must obey the orders of his 
superior unquestioningly and willingly, or be turned 
into the chain-gang ; or, if a free man, can only 
deviate from the injunctions of his master at peril 
of a nod of dismissal, procured for him from the 
official head by a single word whispered by the 
Superintendent. The reports, duly examined and 
commented upon, display praiseworthy vigilance ; 
for entries of all punishments inflicted have been 
conscientiously made. The Comptroller reads 
that one man has been chastised for misconduct, 
another for insolence ; but whether such mis- 
conduct or insolence was provoked out of them, 
or was a wilful fault, does not appear in the 
entry.'

trust your neighbour,' 

* Well really, Captain, we mitat be suspicious in 
self-defeace ; with ri^ues on all sides, what should 
we do if we placed confidence in our people ?' said 
Mrs. Evelyn, for once agreeing with her brother-in- 
law. 

' I speak of free, madam ; Mr. Evelyn looks 
foul-eyed on all.' 

* Do not misunderstand me, Mr. Jolly ; I make 
no personal reference ; the present Superintendent 
may be an excellent commandant.' 

' You only refer to them as a lot : well, they 
are a rum lot; but for all that, what fault can you 
find with Port Arthur ?' 

'No: I'm sure it's a delightfiil place, all so 
clean and nice, really it's like a fresh-scrubbed 
room. If it was a dirty place I couldn't take the 
children there if you'd pay me for it, my dear,'

traveller is bewitched ; he sees through a false 
medium, and notes accordingly. Not knowing that 
one of the strictest penal rules is that the convicts 
shall touch their caps to their superiors, he 
observes the simultaneous movement to the Super- 
intendent, and mentions it as a gratifying proof of 
the men's affection, or, at any rate, of their esteem 
for their governor. And I do not blame him; 
the rod is hidden from his sight ; how should he 
discover it? All is fair; why should he not 
rejoice in it ?' 

* Well, parson, so long as I'm not meddled with 
I'm as willing as any man alive to have a change, 
but as to what you want, we may stick in the mud 
till kingdom come if we wait for it; the deuce 
knows when your well-digested plan vnll be formed, 
and I also guess his satanic majesty '11 try to put 
it off as long as he can. Government has been 
playing battledore and shuttlecock with their sys- 
tems for many a long year, and, for all I see, been 
making duck and drake and young ones with their 
money, excepting my salary.' 

^ I agree with you there, Mr. Jolly. I do not 
believe the well-digested plan will ever be formed, 
for while we have sin to battle with, the strife must 
continue. Colonel Arthur's words, "What God 
hath made crooked, man cannot make straight," 
appear to me the correct solution of the convict 
puzzle; however, let us go on availing ourselves

of such improvements as experience shall suggest. 
Having seen that there is danger in giving to one 
man unbounded authority over his fellow-creatures, 
let us circumscribe his power by placing others to 
share it with him. Having seen that transportation, 
as Tioiff carried on, is a punishment of revenge and 
not of reform, let us use our individual efforts to 
practically convince the prisoners, that in banish- 
ing them from their native land. Government has 
their best interest at heart, that England sends her 
unhappy sons from her, not as outcasts so much as 
penitents.' 

* Now, parson, tell us, would yow he Superin- 
tendent if you could T

might commence with every good intention, but 
unrestricted power would soon make a despot of 



A loud flop on the other side of the deck pre- 




PORT ARTHUR. — O.P.S,0. — THE KANGAROO. 267 

* Only scheming, sir, take my word for it, pity's 
lost on them ; why should one faint more than 
another ?' 

* That livid countenance does not look much 
like scheming, sir. I insist on your unchaining 
him, and giving him the assistance he requires.' 
Sulkily went the overseer to work, muttering, 
' We shall have the whole gang a fainting if this 
is what they get for it.' 

Bradley, who was close by, and had marked the 
whole proceeding, made a note of these words, and 
his heavy brow lowered, portentously, as he stowed 
them away in his imbruted mind. 

It was not long after that a second heavy flop 
was heard, and looking to the spot, Mr. Herbert 
saw that Bradley had fallen and Pra^ lay sprawl- 
ing on the top of him. 

* I s'pose we must undo them too,' grumbled 
the overseer, * mustn't be partial.' 

* No^ just extricate Pragg from Bradley ; but I 
would not have the chains removed from either,' 
said Mr. Herbert, who had heard the grumble, 
though it was not meant for him. 

But just out of spite the overseer would release 
them : he had barely done so, than, with the roar of 
an imcaged lion, upstarted Bradley, knocked him 
down, caught up a handcuff and struck Pragg a 
blow that felled him to the deck, and made the 
blood flow from his head. Bradley then flung 



268 THE BROAD ARROW. 

himself on his hands and knees and lapped up the 
blood. 

' I swore to hell I'd never rest till I'd spit your 
own blackguard blood in your fiice ; now, here it 
is!' 

All this took place in a moment, ere any one 
could stop the ruffian or overcome the first shock 
of surprise. All free hands now rushed forward, 
the enraged overseer among them. Bradley sur- 
rounded by his bond brethren, whose fettered limbs 
prevented their laying hold of him, kept his oppo- 
nents at bay by hurling at them such missiles as he 
could seize hold of. 

'Grace to the man that catches him,' shouted 
the Captain. 

' Conditional pardon to him/ out shouted the 
Overseer. 

' Death to him,' growled Bradley. 

And the men who had tried to raise their arms 




PORT ARTHUR. — O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 269 

splashed the waters into the air as the body cleft 
them asunder and lost itself beneath them. 

All was commotion, but none dared venture 
after him. Up rose the body at a short distance — 
again to sink — the waters, gui^ling, closed upon it, 
and the ripples spread as calmly onward as though 
no immortal soul had perished beneath them. 
Who dares that soul to follow in its dreary pro- 
gress — downward — downward, ever downward — 
for the pit is bottomless, and the doom eternal. 
The voice of inspiration hath pronounced it so — 
downward, ever downward — who may stay the 
doomed spirits ? — falling — ^falling — falling ! They 
gnaw their tongue and look upward, but all too 
late comes the upward glance, for the eye of love 
beholds it not ; the cry is bitter, and the torment 
cruel, but relief comes not ; the ear of mercy is 
deaf. God forgetteth to be gracious for the day of 
grace hath passed. 

Mrs. Evelyn declared she could not proceed, 
but, with the children, would be put out at the 
next settlement. Mr. Herbert was not averse to 
this, for Emmeline, though uncomplaining, suffered 
from the frightful shock that had shaken the stoutest 
set of nerves on board ; he was anxious to get- her 
ease from the excitement which it was impossible 
to escape whilst in the scene of the catastrophe. 
Though his feeling was only one of deep and 
awed solemnity, commingled with sorrow, and

though he did not participate in his sister-in-law's 
tear of being murdered in cold blood it' he remained 
on board, he considered it desirable to afford his 
child a respite from a fatigue, for the endurance of 
which, the appalling occairrence had wholly un- 
fitted her ; therefore, when the steamer stopped at 
Impression Bay, he i^eed to disembark and go 
with Mrs. Evelyn to the house of a friend, the 
Religious Instructor of the settlement^ and there 
remain the week which must elapse ere they 
could proceed by the ' Kangaroo,' on their journey 
to Port Arthur. 

Expected or unexpected friends are always wel- 
come on penal statious. Isolated from the rest of 
the world, the officers are glad of any interruption 
to the monotonous routine of their stationary life. 
The inundation of the EveljTis was therefore an 
event productive of much enjoyment, both to the

take a peep at the densely-wooded country around, 
or to look out on the bay as it appeared from 
land. 

The gardens delighted her. Summer's bright 
flowers lay with a languid, luxurious ease, that 
imparted, or would have imparted, to her a dreamy 
sense of pleasure had she been any other than 
Bridget D' Urban. But there was no dreaminess 
in her pleasures: they were real, they were 
earnest. When her uncle preferred to stay with 
her cousin, she would snatch up the baby, summon 
Charlie, and be off to the gardens for a frolic amid 
the roses. One day a thunderstorm overtook them 
there : baby had not yet learned to fear thunder ; 
but as peal clashed on peal, Charlie clung tightly 
into Bridget to hide himself, and to wish *that 
God's many drums didn't play so dreflRil loud.' 
Hurrying back with her young charge, the heavy 
rain obliged Miss D'Urban to stop under the roof 
of a deserted constable's hut. She had not been 
here long before she and Charlie were terrified by 
a howl that seemed to come from within a wall 
near, and yet was despairing enough to have issued 
from the infernal regions. It was repeated again 
and again. The drenching rain was more en- 
durable than it, so off ran Bridget, carrying baby 
under her arm. An overseer's wife seeing her 
panting on, opened her door, and be^ed her to 
come in. Nothing loath, she entered. When 



272 THE BROAD ARROW. 

Charlie promptly declared to tbe woman that they 
had heard ' all sorts of dreflul wild beasts over 
there.' Thinking he only meant the thunder, she 
took him upon her lap and told him, though they 
had devils and wild cats in the island, they had 
not any lions or tigers, so he need not fear. But 
when Miss D'Urban told her that, wild beast or 
not, they had been alarmed by the most doleful 
wail that ever mortal heard, the wife began to 
wonder whence the noise could have proceeded, 
and wondered on until her eldest boy burst into a 
laugh. 

' Oh 1 'twas nothing, mother ; 'twas only from 
the Cranky Yard.' 

Bridget asked what undesirable yard that might 
be, and was informed it was a portion of the station 
appropriated to the insane, and the cries thence 
were often heartrending. 

"It's nothing but the Cranky Yard," is what

o£^ that be might die unfettered, as any one of us 
would naturally wish ; but his keeper wouldn't free 
him ; so he breathed out his soul, lying on his face, 
with his hands chained behind him. God have 
mercy on his poor dear soul !' 
Bridget stamped with indignation* 

* There's no help for it, miss ; we mustn't speak 
out our minds on these things, only just to each 
other ; then each of us pretends not to believe them 
— hut^' she shook her head. 

*Why are these cruelties permitted?' at last 
asked Bridget. 

*They are not permitted. I doubt whether 
they ever reaches the Superintendent's ear in a 
way that shows cruelty. 'Twas the officer of the 
yard that was to blame for that poor dear creature.' 

A tear glistened in her eye ; wiping it oflF with 
the corner of her apron, she said — 

* Faith, miss, I call everything dear that's 
suffering. I tell my husband sometimes that my 
very bread chokes in my throat that goes down 
with such money. There's only two ways of 
getting on out here, and them are — to make one's 
heart hard as quick as possible, or to get out of 
Government work altogether. My husband's been 
through nearly all the stations, hoping what was in 
one wouldnt be in another; he's tried this last, 
thinking as 'twas invalid there couldn't be anything 
against one's feelings here ; but now — ah, there ! —

it's no use talking and I shouldn't say so much to 
you only it's known the colony over that Parson 
Evelyn's family is all the convicts' friend ; and 
I've heard say that if the convicts rose they'd be 
as safe as Goshen in the midst of it, and Squire 
Evelyn, too, for all he holds on for discipline. 
Ah, miss ! the men knows who's who.' 

In her delight at hearing her uncles so prised, 
Bridget nearly foi^ot the Cranky Yard ; but 
Charlie came running in to say, not only that 
the rain bad ceased, but that the beasts were 
making their noises again : ' Come and hear 'em 
then.' 

'There, miss, you'd hardly believe, though I 
hears them every day I'm not a bit better pleased 
with it; I can't bear to know there's suffering 
going on ; and 'tisn't only because they are my own 
flesh and blood ; I was just the same time back, 
when I was young, when tlie Aborgenes was

subject, and thanking her hostess, she made hasty 
way to the Eeligious Instructor's quarters. Uncle 
Herbert and Emmeline were alone, the Instructor 
having gone to his duties, and his wife being 
elbow-deep in culinary hospitalities. Bridget, 
therefore, still irate with her subject, bustled at 
once into the inquiry — 

* Uncle, what has become of all the Aborigines ? 
I haven't seen one of them ever since I have been 
here.' 

* They are confined in Oyster Cove, and sup- 
ported by Government; the all consists of but 
twenty-three; poor things! it is sad to behold 
them. They bequeath us a legacy for which we 
shall have to answer when God makes inquisition 
for blood. " Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man 
shall his blood be shed," is a denunciation as true 
of nations as of individuals ; and to them who 
mark these things, retribution is clearly discernible 
in national records. Thoughtful readers of Tas- 
manian history must tremble to think how and 
where the retributive stroke shall fall on England 
or her dependencies. When they read of barbari- 
ties disgraceful to a Christian people ; of murdered 
women ; of tortured children, they can only turn 
and pray the anticipating prayer — " Lord, in judg- 
ment remember mercy, and visit not these sins on 
the head of innocence." ' 

But the Wednesday again came round, and with 



276 THE BROAD ARROW. 

it duly appeared the steamer, puffing its goods 
into the bay, there to exdhange them after the 
fashion of Aladdin's lamp-merchant A few weak, 
miserable-looking men were delivered to au ovct- 
seer, aud Mr. Herbert's party embarked in thrar 
stead. 

Captain Jolly hailed Bridget as an old acquaint- 
ance, and vowed himself her humble servant so 
long as she required no more chains struck off from 
his men. She informed him that last week's 
catastrophe had by no means lessened her inclina- 
tion in that way. 

' Bless your heart alive, miss ; talk of irons ! 
you should go a-hoard the "Lady Franklin" 
when she's on for Norfolk Island: you'd have 
double chains, cross chains, deck chains — '^hains 
enough to last out the term of your natural life, as 
the law has it ; though what or where the otfier 
life is. the deuce knows, for I'r

longer at Cascades,* in order to deliver some pro- 
bationers to the Superintendent, and to take in a 
few second-sentencers for Port Arthur. Then 
steaming roimd Expectation Point, and passing 
Woody Island, it soon brought its journey to an 
end in Norfolk Bay. Here fresh disappointment 
awaited Bridget, who, having watched the debarka- 
tion and marching off of the chain-gang, looked for 
some approaching vehicle that promised the safe 
conveyance guaranteed by the Comptroller-General. 
She had heard so much of the waggons which were 
to be in sure waiting at Norfolk Bay, that in 
looking far ahead for the teamed bullocks, which 
she expected to see toiling up the hill, she failed to 
note nearer preparations. 

* Come, my dear, come,' at last said her aunt ; 
^rnake haste and look here before your uncle 
returns ; he mustn't see it. Take this and put it 
on the seat of the waggon behind you ; and when 
you get in, just point to it and nod to the men, and 
then you'll be all right and safe. I wouldn't 
venture in without, or those fellows would of course 
upset us.' 

She opened a little basket, and gave Bridget a 
half-pound of tea and some tobacco. 

* Why mustn't Uncle Herbert see it ? He'd be 
delighted to give the poor fellows a few comforts.' 

* This Cascades must not be confounded with the female house of 
correction, Hobarton. 



278 THE BROAD ABROW. 

' Nonsense, ray dear ; as a Government officer 
he couldn't allow us to break the rules, which are 
strict against rewarding the convicts, especially 
with tobacco ; but I wouldn't go without giving it 
to please any one ; they make nothing of upeetting 
a person they dislike. Why, my dear, they 
pitched the Comptroller over, and he trundled 
down the hill for ever so far.' 

' Now then, we are ready,' said Mr. Herbert, 
stepping back to the jetty. 

Bridget's wonder increased, for she saw no aga 
of readiness save in a number of low carts that 
looked like li^^e-trucks with very loi^ handles, 
and seats for more delicate parcels. Her wonder 
abounded when she saw Mr. Herbert lift Emmeline 
into the foremost cart. Thus, then, had her rustic 
wagons dwindled into a conveyance rough to 
dangeronsness ; how she trembled as she remarked 
the small rickety iron wheels ! Mr. Herbert then 




PORT ARTHUR. — O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 279 

* Is the sick lady easy before we start, sir ?' asked 
a convict of Mr: Herbert, who with no slight 
anxiety was watching proceedings. 

* Quite, thank you,' smiled Emmeline. 

* Where are the horses ?' said Bridget. 

A queer grin passed from Up to lip as each 
prisoner spat into his hand and pressed a firm 
downward hold on the shafts of the vehicle. But 
one man turned on Bridget a face so full of shame 
and misery that she felt ready to cry for having 
asked the question. There was something in this 
man's appearance wholly different from the others ; 
a, low melancholy settled in his not unpleasing 
countenance, while his bearing was that of superior 
birth. A smart whack on his shoulders from the 
overseer's thong made him withdraw his eyes from 
Bridget, and sent a flash of indignation to his 
sunken cheeks ; his fingers snapped audibly in the 
palm of his hands in their longing to repay the 
insult; but he must bear it in silence — nay, even 
with respect — for he is a convict and the other a 
free man. 

* To your place with your impudence, staring at 
the lady,' cried the overseer. 

The man again laid hold of the shaft ; a bar was 
placed across it, and preparations were complete. 

* He is not equal to the exertion,' whispered 
Mr. Herbert to the officer. 

' Must ^^^ equal to it, then, sir; he knows where

Another touch of the human horses, and off 
they trotted; now down, theii up as Uie inequa- 
lities of the very unequal road required. Five 
miles of ground had thus to be run over; wawn 
work beneath the heat of summer ! The velocity 
with which the wagons rushed over the dedivitieB 
by its reaction partly impelled them up the soi- 
ceeding eminence; but for this assistance their 
progress must have been alike wearisome to die 
passengers, and exhausting to the runners. Now 
a nervous excitement supported the spirits of the 
former and a fierce excitement the energy and 
strength of the latter, while toiling, tearing on by 
the wooden rails, they guided the trucks over tlie 
tramroad, and that without stopping for nearly 
three miles, when the halfway station allowed tiie

oominand as it bandied about from officer to officer. 
The eighteen pair of hands could scarcely relax 
their clutch of the heaving sides to wipe off the 
perspiration streaming from under the leathern cap» 
and over the blistered faces of the runners. 

* Old hands take places — ^relays forward, new 
hands back,' shouted the overseer. 

Six convicts retired and six others joined the 
twelve old hands. The man who had attracted 
Bridget's attention remained. 

* You back, you haven't done steaming yet,' 
motioned the driver ; * back I say, you Forbes.' 

Forbes refrised by a gloomy shake of the head, 
and then laid hold of the shaft. 

* Back !' repeated the overseer, raising his arm, 
* youll burst by the way, and that's what you're 
after I expect, making wise to be a martyr.' 

* There are other means,' muttered Forbes, re- 
signing his hold; and receiving a grin from his 
comrades, he turned morosely away, and Mr. 
Herbert followed him. 

* Forbes! I am very grieved to meet you 
here.' 

* I am sorry for nothing that helps to kill me.' 

* For what are you here ?' 

* I declined obedience to a brother convict ap- 
pointed constable over our set. Constable Bradley 
it was ; but, sir, don't question me — my teeth are set 
on it allj and I am determined to bear on till — ' 



282 THE BROAD AEROW. 

He pushed from Mr. Herbert ere the latter had 
time to reply. The overseer commented. 

* Sour as a crabstick — you'll get nothing but 
.vin^ar out of he — he hasn't spoke a dozen words 
to any one since he's been down here, and he 
won't look a body in the face. I tell you, sir, I'd 
rather have a gang of these here men thaii I'd 
have one such as him.' 

' Undoubtedly,' replied Mr. Herbert, quietly, 
but in a tone that silenced him. 

' I should like to see how he'd bear it I' burst 
from Bridget's overboiling indignation, as the 
driver moved off. ' If that isn't giving double 
punishment to gentlemen I don't know what double 
punishment is.' 

' Hush !' whispered Emmeline. 

' Well, why should be have more just because he's 
a gentleman — it is a great enormous shame, it is.' 

' I don't suppose these things which make the 




PORT ARTHUR. — O.P.8.0. — THE KANGAROO. 283 

* Then it ought not to be,' tapped Bridget ; 
^ they ought not to go on tearing out one man's 
heart while they only cut a limb off another — 
maiming this man but killing that one — such cruel, 
unequal treatment.' 

* Ah! it's a theme full of doubt and difficulty,' 
thought Mr. Herbert half aloud, and his eye un- 
consciously wandered to Forbes who with folded 
arms, drooping head, and a despairing fixedness of 
countenance, leaned against a bark hut, yielding 
one leg to a convict constable who was preparing 
to clasp the cross irons upon it, now that freedom 
of Umb was no longer required for the tram. The 
chains being fast set upon his legs he was ordered 
forward to a carrying gang. 

* What's the delay, my men ?' asked Mr. Her- 
bert, turning with a sigh from Forbes. 

* Naught, sir, only there's a tug a-coming there 
that'll take the wind out of us ; hold on, ladies, or 
you'll be flunked right overboard when we shies off 
the top.' 

' But there's most a mile to get to it,' growled a 
second. 

A steep ascent lay before them. Mr. Herbert 
planted his arm round Emmeline and drew her 
to himself; the overseer jumped up behind 
Bridget. 

' G'on here !' and, with a desperate shove from 
the hinder men and a corresponding pull of the 



284 THE BBOAD AKEOW. 

foremost, the waggons were again in motioti, the 
snorting, puffing of the runners serving the wooden 
railway for the noise of an engine. The ascent 
was gained : the hill on the other side drew forth 
a universal shudder as the order, ' Steady ! — jump 
up ! — and away,' was given. There was a swift, 
simultaneous movement of the hind men. With- 
out stopping, they sprang on th6 hacks of the 
vehicles — where, tucking themselvea up, Ihey 
depended, drE^-like, from the bar to which they 
(dung ; then with a shout from each overseer aw«y 
dashed the loaded cars down over the fri^tftl 
steep. As the danger increased with the accelerat- 
ing motion, the runners one by one jumped on the 
sides of the cars, till all were perched up ; and the 
wagons had nothing save these human drags to 
stay their headlong progress — then, heedless of all 
impediments, on dashed the rumbling train, now

Mr. H^^iert, as Elmmdine leant upon his shoulder.

The dark oodine of die ponderous buildings 
loomed into si^it. For all doit it was summer, 
diere was not one in die boat who would not have 
i&ed to be warmer. Mrs. £Telyn shivered outrighti 
and ezdaimed to any one who diose to listen — 

^ My dear, I feel quite unccHnfortaUe, just as if 
I were going into prison ; really eTerydui^ to do 
widi convicts is so unfiirtunate.' 

Tlie party landed. Save in its own vicinity, 
tiiere was not a sound to be heard. Mrs. Evelyn 
shivered, still less at ease; the silent as well as 
solUary system seemed to pervade die place, which 
in the uncertain light of stars and glimmering 
windows, appeared litde more dian a village of 
unusually large substantial houses. It was difficult 
to know in what part were stowed away the five 
hundred prisoners existing under the darkest phase 
of transported life.* 

Mrs. Evelyn's shivers increased, 

' My dears, I wish you'd all speak louder ; 

* Except Norfolk lalancL 




286 THE BROAD ARROW. 

tbere's not the least occasion for whispering so — 
really it's quite doleful, as though 'twas against the 
law to hear one's voice.' 

* Conies natural down here, ma'am ; astonishing 
how a feller gets to croon that's been here a while,' 
answered one of the boat's crew. 

In spite of Uiis unpromising assertion, a brisk, 
cheerful voice came pleasantly through the hum- 
drum. 

' Here at last ! we had all given you up for to- 
night. Where is brother Evelyn ?' 

And the spare, elastic figure of an ecclBsiastic 
bustled up to Mr. Herbert, and shook both his 
bands at once. 

' Ah, Father Evermore ! is it you ? your pre- 
sence both alarms and pleases me.* 

'All right, my good fiiend, all right at the 
parsonage; I am only here instead of Harelick — 
he has been called to Norfolk Bay. 




PORT ARTHUR. — O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 287 

* I need not ask which is our sick charge ; bless 
you, my child 1 No, no ; I am stronger than I 
look. Your weight will not crush me if I may 
share with your father the pleasure of leading you 
up the settlement,' insisted Father Evermore, 
kmdly drawing one of Emmeline's arms into his. 

She was, however, too tired to advance a step ; 
she fell together with the attenapt. In an instant 
two of the boat's crew crossed their arms into the 
lady's cradle, and bending before her, said, ' If the 
master would be pleased to allow them, they'd 
shift her so easy as not to shake a breath out of 
her.' 

Mr. Herbert thankfully accepted their oflFer, and 
when his daughter put one arm over each neck, 
their satisfaction seemed complete. They lifted 
her carefully, and trotting oflF, they only rested 
once ; on which one of them took the opportunity 
to turn his head and rub his cuff across his eyes. 

* Are you tired, my friend ?' inquired Mr. 
Herbert. 

The man shook his head, and again rubbed his 
eye; then seeing that Mr. Herbert looked pained, 
he muttered — 

' I left a daughter at home, just like this yer, 
dying away ; I expect she's gone 'fore now, with- 
out a last look of her poor father. Ah, sir ! these be 
the bitters such as yaii don't know the taste of.' 

The tears, now licensed, flowed apace ; but he

would not leave go to wipe them off— he shook 
them from his face, and said he was trying to feel 
'twas ' his own maid he was heaving of.' After try- 
ing thus for some time, forgetting everything save 
that he was a father, he turned to Emmeline — 

' Be asy, my dear ? grah on neat as you plase, bo 
long as you'm asy." 

' A second senteucer has feelings, you see, Miss 
Dtlrban,' whispered Father Evermore, as again 
the soiled yellow cuff sought the ferret eyes of the 
prisoner. 

'Throi:^h the avenue or up the gates, your 
reverence ?' inquired the younger man. 

The priest advised the latter to avoid at once 
the ehill of the heavy foliage, and the strong smell 
of the blue gum then exhaling to perfection its 
catty perfume in the still, moist air. 

' How beautiful !' cried Bridget, when, having 
passed through the iron gates, all prison feelini

mentary. I don't know anjrthing of this church ; 
but I should be sorry to mix blood with my 
thoughts of my country,* said Mrs. Evelyn. 

' It is nevertheless a very necessary diluent, dear 
madam, though in great measure I speak alle- 
gorically. Where real life-blood has been wanting, 
the groaning of the prisoner, which we call heart- 
bloody has copiously flowed from every part of the 
colony.' Spreading his hands courteously to attest 
the fact, he added, * But the foundation of yon 
church was literally the scene of murder ; and the 
Port Arthur legend is, that the victim's blood still 
gurgles in the trenches, and causes your bishop to 
delay the consecration of the building.' 

* Ay, and that isn't all, neither ; the leads up 
there could tell something if they'd tongues; 
they'd tell how many dollars was pinched out of 
'em by Jenkins a-sitting up there a-moulding of 
money,' joined in the younger convict, unable to 
repress an active interest in the settlement tradi- 
tions. 

But tales traditionary were speedily forgotten in 
one more cheering to weary pilgrims — one that 
was English in its utterance and colonial in its 
warmth : a tide of little Harelicks rushed down the 
grove, shouting a gleesome welcome; and then, 
smiling and matronly, the chaplain's wife ran over 
the steps to conduct her friends to the parsonage, 
of which, together with the clerical Protestant

duties of the settlement, Mr. Herbert had under- 
taken to relieve her husband for three months. 

'I'm half glad you're too late for dinner, for not 
my means nor Opal's invention could have pro- 
duced a more substantial meal than that you see 
before you, for even which you must thank the 
soldiers : just at the last moment, when I was 
despairing of anything but navy beef for your 
reception-feast, they brought in two fine trum- 
peters.' 

But the lai^e kind smile of their hostess was a 
reception-feast in itself, as, presiding over the tea- 
table, she dealt out the fish, which, fair, firesh, and 
solid, had not lefl; the bay many hours before those 
who now preyed on its dainty flakes. 

'Short commons down here in hot weather. 
Miss D'Urban,' explained Father Evermore, on 
seeing Bridget exploring with some curiosity what 
)t'art'd a log of boiled wood, but w'bich, on closer

can always borrow fish, eggs, or fowl; then the 
store-beef is a never-failing resource.' 

'But it's so nasty, mamma; the storekeeper 
told me the last piece was older than papa,' ven- 
tured to suggest the boy Harelick. 

Mrs. Evelyn began to frown on the culinary 
probabilities ; but Mrs. Harelick assured her that 
alarm was needless; the borrowing system prac- 
tised by the oflScers subserved all necessary pur- 
poses, and rendered the absence of shops of less 
consequence. She showed that A., who keeps a 
cow, lends B. a pound of butter, and in return 
borrows a dozen eggs. C. borrows a bottle of rum, 
and lends in return a wallibi, which her husband 
has snared; while the soldiers are too happy to 
exchange the fish they spend half their time in 
catching for any trifle the cupboards of their neigh- 
bours may afford. Bridget thought it would be 
much better fun to buy and sell in this primitive 
way than with money ; on which her aunt said, 
really her niece was so childish in her notions that 
no one could suppose she was a young woman of 
twenty ; but Father Evermore gave Bridget to 
understand by a kind smile that in such matters he 
approved of childishness even in young women ; 
and to fiirther signify his approval, he told her he 
hoped she would consider his quarters at her ser- 
vice whenever she required a nosegay or dish of 
fruit. When he left the room, Mrs. Evelyn ex- 



292 THE BROAD ARROW. 

pressed wonder and displeasure that Mr. Herbert 
should allow Bri(^et to talk so fireely to a Komau 
Catholic, and that he should permit l^mself to be 
called brother by one. 

' When you know Evermore as well as I do, 
Clara, you will deem it a privilege to be called 
sister by him ; he is of the true Church of Christ, 
and that is all I care to inquire. An humble, 
earnest, hardworking member — still toiling on 
when others would rest — he only seeks to be ap- 
proved of his heavenly Father, to whose kingdom 
he will find admittance before many who vaunt 
themselves on names.' 

' But he is a Roman Catholic, my dear,' per- 
sisted Clara, with an unconvinced air. 

' And my dear iriend is a Protestant ; yet, 
through our blessed Lord, I hope to meet him in 
heaven,' Ksped the priest, folding his ^ed hands

tried expression so characteristic of the convict 
chaplain, though in a slighter degree than that on 
Mr. Herbert's fece. 

* They'll worry me out altogether soon, Evelyn,' 
he said, after a brief comparison of grievances with 
his clerical brother. * I wrote a resignation yester- 
day, but my wife made me destroy it ; she 
wouldn't let me show them how they had annoyed 
me ; she thinks we can watch how matters go during 
the time you are here, and then act when the Way 
is clear.' 

* They must worry me quite out, or I shall not 
leave the department,' replied Mr. Herbert 

* Oh ! you needn't fear, you are a visitor down 
here, and will find everything to your liking.' 

* The redemption of the soul is precious, and it 
ceaseth for ever,' murmured Mr. Herbert, following 
out to himself his train of thought. 

* Yes ; would we could think more of those poor 
fellows and less of ourselves ! I always tell my 
wife, that humbly and weakly as I preach it, I 
know they have the gospel whilst I am here, 
and therefore, not knowing who may come after 
me, we ought to bear on to the last moment : if 
you^ now, Evelyn, would take my place, I'd leave 
to-morrow.' 

Mr. Herbert shook his head — he had his own 
flock to care for. He encouraged his brother to 
endure in all patience the trial? of his ministerial

course. It might be distressing to have the rod of 
lay office so domiaeeringly shaken over them by 
uneducated, and, too often, irrel^ous men ; but 
their eyes should be toward the Chief Bishop, who, 
wielding the pastoral staff, would guide them into 
righteousness and peace. ' To strive to hear that 
Bishop's voice,' he said, 'and then to follow it, 
should be the ainl of our lives. It is good to hear 
it, better to follow it.' 

' Ah ! so we say every evening, don't we, Julia? 
but the next morning, when I find some tresh petty 
annoyance prepared — yes, prepared — for me, I lose 
course, and feel it's hard to set to work against 
wind and tide, and without knowing, too, how I 
have offended. The last time the Comptroller was 
down, he was as cool as could he ; what for, I've 
never yet discovered. Well, when he had gone, 
something he had said to the Superintendent was 
conveyed to me as an order from himself. Being 




50RT ARTHUR. — O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 295 

At mention of the apples, in spite of his former 
vexation, good-natured Mr. Harelick burst into a 
hearty laugh. 

* Yes, indeed ; these things are so ridiculous that 
persons who haven't daily to encounter them would 
think them too foolish to repeat.' 

* Foolish or not, these things are only bearable 
as they are borne for the love of Christ. It re- 
quires great grace to bear small trials ; natural 
heroism goes far in enabling us to support heavy 
troubles,' replied Mr. Herbert, gently but firmly. 

'Why, Evelyn, surely up in town, within ear- 
shot of the Comptroller, you have not to face any 
of these annoyances ?' 

An expressive smile was the only answer. 

^ Oh ! you needn't fear my wife, she's safe, and 
awake to these matters, aren't you, Julia ?' 

A lai^e, benignant smile at once rewarded his 
opinion of her, and brightened the dark subject 
which lowered over the trio. 

Mr. Herbert said he had not thought of Mrs. 
Harelick as an obstacle to free speech; he con- 
sidered that the more such grievances were talked 
of the more they withered up the heart's best 
feelings. He found them difficult enough to battle 
against in reality, without making imaginary attacks 
upon the enemy's camp. 

No one who looked at his countenance would 
have thought that these things made any deep im- 



296 THE BEOAD AEEOW. 

preesion upon him, mucli less that he felt them so 
acutely ; his friends were thereft>re taken by sur- 
prise to hear him say — 

* My experience is, that it is far more difficult to 
receive meekly one such indignity from lay under 
authority than to make a great sacrifice for our 
Lord ; it is easy to be a hero, an officer of the 
cross, but how arduous to become a common 
soldier ! Setting these trials of ray position to the 
account of that love which beareth all things, I am 
able, through grace, to take them quietly — would 
God I could say joyfully ! otherwise I could not 
take them at all.' 

'Stop, Evelyn, I only partly agree with you 
there ; one may go on submitting until one licks 
the dust, trampled on by men who by r^ht of 
office are only our equals — by right of educatitHi 
and birth often our in^riors. I would not quarrel, 
but I would object ; and if that were useless,- 1

arm over his chair, and leaning his head back on it 
he continued — 

* But, oh ! my friends, it is a dying, dying, dying 
world. The department worries me with some 
ungentlemanlike treatment, and I feel inclined to 
resent its conduct by tendering my resignation, 
since appeal is of no service. Then I go into the 
hospital, and find some poor dying creature eagerly 
watching for me : • he grasps my hand and prays 
me, for the love of God, to warn his fellow-smners 
not to neglect their immortal salvation, as he has 
done ; I go to another ward, expecting to see one 
whom last night I besought to fly from the wrath 
to come, but the screen is drawn around his bed, 
death is there, fixing his eternal state. I go to 
the condemned cells, and death is there — death, 
moral and spiritual. I return to my home, and 
there is my own child dying; and then all my 
resentment turns upon myself for having encouraged 
impatient feelings. Let us look upon eternity, and 
we must forget all, save that we are surrounded by 
dying men, ourselves in the same predicament.' 

The earnest voice ceased, and closing his eyes, 
Mr. Herbert sat for many minutes in silence ; then 
arousing himself with a long, yet scarcely audible 
sigh, he added : ^ I am puzzled to know what to 
think of those men, who throw every possible 
hindrance in the way of God's servants, instead of 
helping them in a labour so wearing to mind and

body ; it must be that having only to deal with the 
bodies of their bond brethren, they know nothing of 
the obstinate, life-wearing soul-strife we have to 
wage day after day, year after year. Death, which 
relieves them of their responsibility, makes ours 
the more terrible and laborious. What say you, 
Mrs. Harelick, must we set down their opposition 
to the sin of ignorance ?* 

' But that neither makes it easier to bear nor 
exonerates Government for permitting such a state 
of things,' answered her husband. 

' I quite exonerate Government, Harelick ; I 
do not lay at its door one of the annoyances 
which fret the convict chaplain from heartfelt 
attention to his duties. Where I deem Govern- 
ment is culpable, is in not better protecting its 
clerical servants from abuse, since their being 
under secular rule is unavoidable.' 

' Perhaps it's the sin of ignorance there too.' 




PORT ARTHUR.— O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 299 

some set, are the convict chaplains," were Turbot's 
very words of us, Evelyn.' 

Another quiet smile was again the only answer. 
Wishing to avoid further exposition of * stationary * 
grievances, Mr. Herbert asked, * How is it down 
here between master and men ?' 

* Oh ! the same as ever, and the same as it ever 
must be whilst—' 

* Now, Tom, do take care what you say,' said 
his wife. 

* There^ you see she wants to pay you ofl^ 
Evelyn, because you would not trust her just 
now.' 

* Now, Tom, don't, I only want to put you on 
your guard. You never know what ears there 
may be about. That was why you stopped, wasn't 
it, Mr. Evelyn, and not because of me ?' 

* That which I have to say I would not stop for 
any ears. I would say it the same if called before 
Government to-morrow.' 

' Do let us hear what you have to say then, for 
I'm sure if you up in Hobart have cause to 
speak, we down here may fairly have more cause.' 

^ In finishing your former speech for you, I 
believe I comprehend all I have to say, and that is, 
that no improvement in convict difficulties and evils 
can be expected till a different class of men is 
chosen to work the system, nor while so much 
irresponsible power is vested in one man.' 



300 THE BROAD ARROW. 

* Why you ve been foraging in my paddock I 
Those were almost my words this morning, 
weren*t they, Julia ?' 

* Would that I had been there trespassing, th^ 
there had not been two wibaesses to the evil ; but, 
unfortunately, my mind has gathered its senti- 
ments from an original field of observation, widely 
extended and darkly diversified, and has long ago 
arrived at the conclusion, that half the systems 
which have been tried and found wanting, have been 
60, not so much from deficiency in themselves, as 
from some defect existent in their coadjutors, in 
other phrase from an erroneous choice of hands) 
the heads of the system have generally been well 
chosen.' 

* Take off the head, then, and there is nothing 
but rottenness below,' laughed Mr. Harelick. 

* Oh, Tom !' his wife was thoroughly alarmed ; 
hastening across the room she bolted the door. 

But Tom would not be quiet, it was so great a 
treat to have some one to talk to. 

* I think, though, the heart of the system isnot 
so much amiss ; it means well, and if it could ac- 
complish its intentions our convicts would do fa- 
mously.' 

Mr. Herbert shook his head gravely and said : 
* The remembrance that more than one hundred 
and nineteen thousand of our fellow-creatures have 
been subject to the experiments and failures of 



PORT ARTHUR* — O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 301 

systems in these colonies affords no matter for 
light words. To me, the remembrance is a foun- 
tain, whence my eyes draw tears^ and my soul 
prayer and humbleness before God.' 

* Too true, indeed. The delight of at last hear* 
ing my own thoughts echoed by others more deeply 
based, makes me appear light when lightness is far 
from my heart. We agree so well, Evelyn, that I 
feel I have a right to speak to you of the grievous 
subversion of power as practised in many of these 
stations. Ah ! it's a responsibility from which, 
good Lord, deliver me.' 

Poor Mrs. Harelick sat distractedly in her chair, 
alternately looking from window to door, from door 
to chimney, for the ears she dreaded. Because a 
government house, she fancied it must be full of 
not only ears but eyes, and her search for them 
continued, till, with a desperate gesture, she im- 
plored Tom to be quiet ; however, he would go on. 

* Yes, with few exceptions, it has always ap- 
peared to mef that the hands of the system, from 
^rst to last, from first-class officer to convict con- 
stable, are ill appointed. Now there's Turbot, 
except severity of temper, what fitness is there in 
him to recompiend him for the important position 
he holds ?' 

' Severity of temper, perhaps,' repeated Mr. 
Herbert, with the least touch of Uncle Ev curling 
in his lip. 

* One would hope that where the good of so 



302 THE BROAD ABROW. 

many hundred souls was at stake, not even a 
third-class officer would be elected without an 
almost solemn scrutiny of the man ; but how can 
appointments, resulting more from favour than 
from conviction, be otherwise than erring ?' 

' Dear, dear, when we know the power that such 
men, so chosen, have of making their prisoner sub- 
jects wretched to desperation what non-importance 
falls on the little show of power wherewith they 
seek to intimidate us !' and Mr, Herbert arose to 
put an end to the distasteful question. 

' Not if we view the show of power as part of 
the plan on which they have fattened into vanity ! 
They have exercised uncontrolled authority so 
long over one class of their brethren that their 
minds pall, and they desire to stimulate their 
depraved appetites with a taste of the free.' 

' Tom ! Tom ! do mind what you say,' once 
more despairingly urged bis wife. A loud ratthng 




PORT ARTHUR. — O.P.S.O. — THE KANGAROO. 303 

* Talking of bed, my dear, how unnecessary of 
the department to give us such very disfigured 
bedding, just as though Government feared we 
should make away with their blankets. I really 
shall feel like a convict sleeping between those 
Broad Arrows, and great ugly B.O.'s too all over 
the things in that manner,' said Mrs. Evelyn. 

* Alas, madam, all is B.O. down here ! no one 
has a right to himself, nothing is its own. You'll 
see the O. P. S. O. written on every man's brow ; 
even where the Broad Arrow is not visible on his 
back. The serpent himself, as well as his trail, is 
perceptible in this natural paradise.' 

* No need, at any rate, to have him in the house, 
coiled up in such great black B.O.'s on my little 
Charlie's blankets; the poor child was quite 
frightened to get into his cot. He said — " Mamma, 
does B.O. spell bogie ?" and feeling rather cross, 
I answered, '* Yes, of course, my dear," when he set 
up such a roar that I have been ever since trying 
to quiet him ; even now he is sobbing in his sleep.' 

' I congratulate you, ma'am ; he is a fortunate 
child to retain his horror of a bogie in sight of 
which he has lived all his life. My best wish for 
master Charles is, that B.O. may always spell bogie 
to him. I fear it has long ceased to convey that 
meaning to my children,' replied Mr. Harelick, 
tracing out a large B with his finger on the table. 



THE BROAD ARROW, 



CHAPTER IX. 

POET ARTHUR. — THE SETTLEMENT. 

It was many days ere Enraieline could leave her 
room. Her little modicum of strength had been so 
drawn upon by the journey tiiat it required every 
tender appliance with perfect rest to restore her to 
her former position ; and long, very long, to give 
her a semblance of improved health. But when 
the semblance did appear, it was so true to 
nature that even the father was deceived by It, and 
a faint shadow of a just possible joy cast on bis 
heart a sensation long forbidden ; and resting with 
grateful delight under this shght shadow &om

haad that was beckoning her step by step from 
this nether world; * Nevertheless, not my will 
but Thine be done.' 

Devoting himself to her, he was thankful when 
comparative strength and freedom from pain 
enabled her to enjoy the passing sweets of a softly 
passing summer, which, balmy and restorative, 
swept over the sunny region of Port Arthur, pre- 
serving it an Eden of fertility and luxuriant beauty ; 
while other less favoured parts of the island drooped 
and withered prematurely into the dusky tintings 
of Autumn, 

To spare Emmeline the fatigue of a rather steep 
flight of stairs, Mrs. Harelick had devoted to her 
special service a large froot parlour on the ground- 
floor. It opened on the Station, and had by no 
means the pleasant landscape which enlivened the 
upper apartments. The lovely Bay, and the Isle 
of the Dead, were not to be seen ; but some gardens 
intervening, beguiled the more immediate sight from 
the prison apparatus, unescapingly conspicuous on 
a prolonged survey from the bow-window. 

A low verandah, covered with multiflora rose, 
extending the length and sides of the house, 
shielded the lower rooms from the scorching sun, 
and gave the parsonage (otherwise bare and 
unfinished looking) a rural, picturesque appearance. 

The first few days succeeding their arrival, there

was no tempting Bridget from her cousin. Not 
all the enchantery of the government gardens to 
which the young Harelicks invited her, could 
entice her from 'dear old Em.' Let them brii^ 
her the rare flowers which in rich, if not in wild 
exuberaoce wasted their sweetness on the garden 
air; until Em could go with her, she should not 
go in search of them for all the pink acacias and 
ixias in the world; not she! In vain smiled 
Father Evermore's courteous face, not even respect 
to his silver locks should draw her to see more 
than she could see from the window; and that was 
neither much nor pleasant, unless she sat very 
sidewise to get a peep at the church and avenue 
descending from it. For after she had watched 
the children playing in the verandah, there was 
nothing but the settlement before her. We all know 
that distant life attracts the eye more than nearer 




PORT ARTHUR. — THE SETTLEMENT. 307 

to their day's duty. Mr. Harelick was one con- 
cerned, and ere the loud, quick bell ceased, 
Bridget heard the fore-door slam, and a step run 
down the grove. She was not concerned, but for 
all that she could not return to her disturbed sleep ; 
besides, she wanted to know what could be going 
on at that early hour. Twilight mists had long dis- 
persed, leaving pendant over all a faint splendour 
that gave promise of a speedy outburst of dazzling 
glory. Her heart leaped within her, as gently 
pushing aside the shutter, she glimpsed the break- 
ing sun; she felt as if something ought to happen 
on so bright a day ; and glad thoughts fluttered 
within her, impatient to take rosy flight from their 
narrow bounds. How beautiful everything must 
look in this summer weather — last night in the 
darkness it was fair enough, she said to herself; 
and opening the shutter a little more, she peeped 
out. There hung the silent splendour; but over 
what ? — a plain peopled with living misery — a 
surge of human sufiFering heaved the settlement 
into a life so slow, so heavy, that all the brightness 
of the day could not stimulate it into more than 
lethargic movement — still slow and cold and heavy, 
it moved in one unbroken mass ; the sun might 
shine or it might lower for all that dead vitality 
seemed to care. But slow movements neither suit 
prison stations nor penal servitude. What sun or 
cheerful weather cannot do, must be done by other

means. Once more a bell rung. Then louder, 
sharper, and quicker than it, several voices of com- 
mand were given. The mass of pied yellow 
separated into sections, and to the 'G'ups' and 
' G'ons ' of constables and overseers divei^ed to the 
four outlets of Port Arthur. The boat's crew passed 
to the water's ec^e ; the wood-fellers to Opossum 
Bay ; the road gang towards Safety Cove ; the 
settlement servants to their several masters, and 
one party harnessed to carts was driven up the 
main road, through the grove and by the parson- 
age, when Bridget still peeping out, recognised 
Forbes in the last of the men. He could not go 
so quickly as the others ; he was therefore assisted 
on his way by alternate braises and shoves — these 
from his fellow-prisoners when pushed against them 
by the cart — those from the cart when repelled by 
its onward movement. 




PORT ARTHUR. — THE SETTLEMENT. 309 

convicts, all miserable ! I feel as if I had no right 
to be happy. It shows we are wicked, or we 
couldn't enjoy ourselves. Angels couldn't if they 
lived here ; that's why they don't, I suppose.' 

A sudden stop to the up and down clanking of 
the chains and rumbling of the carts, together with 
a sort of scuflSing sound, brought Bridget once 
more to the window. 

The party had drawn up just above her; she 
saw Forbes drop his hands, and lean resolutely 
j)ack on the cart. 

* I can't go on — I'm not used to it.* 

* Go on, you schemer 1' shouted the over- 
seer. 

* I can't — I shall drop if I move another step.' 

* Go on there and leave him to follow.' 

Bob Pragg was Ae leader: he attempted to 
move, but the two men behind him, resisting his 
^fiFort, pulled him back. They would not run 
down a fellow creature and a comrade for all that 
he had been a gentleman ; one of them turned and 
said, * Sir, we shall pull him down and we can t 
do that.' 

Forbes tried once more to get on : he gave a few 
short steps and again dropped, whispering to his 
fellows, * I would if I could — don't mind me, 
go on.' 

But not a man, save Pragg, would stir, and his 
attempt was futile against a dozen drawbacks. 



310 THE BBOAD ARROW. 

Again Forbes made a desperate effort ; his hands 
fell, his knees tottered, and then he sank to the 
ground between the shafts of the cart 

' 'T would serve the rascal right if I drove 

you over him,' growled the overseer, 

Pra^ seemed to think it would ; but a low curse 
escaped the teeth of the other men. 

Forbes was unharnessed and made to stand 
while Fra^, loosened from the party, was sent for 
a constable to take off the unfortunate man. 

Mr. Herbert, who had also been aroused by the 
prison bell, having heard the scu£9e, came out to 
inquire the cause, and just at that moment Mr. 
Harelick issued from the avenue on his return 
from morning prayers. 

' This man should not have been sent out this 
morning, he had work enough yesterday to fat^e 
a stronger frame,' said Mr. Herbert 

' It's his own fault — he's scheming ; of course 




PORT ARTHUR. — THE SETTLEMENT. 311 

clergymen ; but the glance was so furtive in its 
haste that both hoped he would fix them anywhere 
save on them. 

* Is this true, Forbes ?' said Mr. Herbert. 

' True, sir, true ? do you know it's against the 
laws down here to question an officer before his 
men.' 

* I beg your pardon, I should not think of ques- 
tioning you. I spoke to the prisoner, Forbes,' 
said Mr. Herbert, politely inclining his head, and 
then in the same quiet voice, * Is this true, 
Forbes ?' 

* Sir, it's against our rules.* 

' I follow no rules but those of humanity, Mr. 
overseer. Is it true, Forbes ?' 

* I could not take my rations, sir. I've asked 
to go into the hospital, but they say I am ma- 
lingering, and refuse to admit me.' 

* The cell shall be your only hospital ; take him 
off; these are my notes, give them at the office,' 
bellowed the overseer. The constable bore him 
ofl^ and he was arraigned at the bar of penal justice 
for insolence, refractoriness, and attempt at mu- 
tiny; his punishment was accordingly heavy. 
Those who had refused to stir on his account were 
likewise punished as mutineers — Pragg exulted; 
his praiseworthy support of the overseer met with 
its reward in the credit-book. 

But much had to be done that day. The family

of Harelicks would leave to-morrow, when Mr. 
Herbert must enter on the external and Mrs. 
EvelyQ on tbe internal duties of the parson^e, 
before then, both must be duly inaugurated to 
their respective posts. The latter were more novel 
to Mrs. Evelyn than were the former t» her bro- 
ther-in-law. Morning prayers at five, cells, 
prison, h(Hpital, school, and evening prayer, formed 
his daily routine, weekly diversified by the Sunday 
services in the church, a ride to Ef^le Hawk 
Keck for a service with the soldiers, and to 
Norfolk Bay for the same purpose. Mrs. Evelyn 
went round with her fi-iend to learn the various 
modes of domestic existence in the unfeminine 
district of Port; Arthur, where the total absence of 
female servants made the position of the lady of 
the house one of real work. The two eldest girl 
Harelicks had been the Uttle housemaids; one 
going her regular round with pail, broom, and

frequent occurrence than the withdrawing of 
company from the dining-parlour, Mr. Harelick's 
predecessor had turaed the said room into a 
victualling depot, where now Mrs. Evelyn's eye 
rejoiced over every imaginable supply, necessary 
to life if not to luxury, and that in a degree of 
abundance which made her think smally of her 
own pride at home. Mrs. Harelick said she was 
fortunate in leaving her friend a treasure in the 
form of a cook, by the name of Opal — a China- 
man prisoner, whose present sin was that of ab- 
sconding, whose former crime had been a pas- 
sionate . attempt to murder his master. He was a 
professed cook, and prior to his second conviction 
had received thirty shillings a week at the best 
confectioner's in Hobarton. 

* You have only to give him the materials,' said 
Mrs. Harelick, * and without further orders dinner 
after dinner will come up without your knowing 
how. It is wonderful to see the nice dishes he 
makes out of the roughest materials, and not a 
scrap wasted. Let us go into the kitchen to him.' 

^ Opal, here is your new lady.' 

* All light den — Opal welly glad — hope she 
nice lady, no scold, no give poor chaingang 
trouble.' 

Mrs. Evelyn proceeded to open the cupboard, 
when emitting a noise as if he had been driving 
pigs out of a potato yard, Opal hurried over, shut 



314 THE BEOAD AEROW. 

the door upon the shelves, and put the key io his 
pocket. Mrs. Evelyn looked both offended and 
surprised, hut Mrs. Harelick only laughed. 

' You musn't pry iuto his mysterieg ! he won't 
do anything if you do ; in there he has innu- 
inerahle little plates full of what would only seem 
useless scraps to you ; but wait and see. He'd as 
soon throw a scrubbing-brush at you as look if you 
meddled with his dishes; not out of disrespect, 
thoi^h, or anger, but because he thinks that is the 
shortest way of showing his disapprobation.' 

This did not please Mrs. Evelyn ; she thought a 
made dish by no means compensated for a scrub- 
bing-brush at her head. But Mrs, Harelick pa- 
cified her, saying there was no fear, Opal was 
the gentlest creature so long as his cupboard was 
safe from intrusion. He never grumbled at his 
work whether it was a washing of the clothes with 
lime or a digsins iu the vegetable garden. A

with such unmistakable tokens of good will that 
she forebore to express her feelings, determining 
that her child might after all fare worse in a 
maiden's arms. 

The out-houses were visited in the evening, 
when the live stock— comprising three cows, three 
goats, one horse, some fowls, a cat, kitten, and 
three large d(^s — ^were bodily delivered to Mrs. 
Evelyn. The goats' milk was dedicated to nursery 
use, the cows' to house consumption, butter, and 
barter. The parsonage being considered the second 
dairy in the station the officers were too glad to 
borrow its delicious contents on any article they 
could produce ; but Mrs. Harelick said she always 
reserved some of the butter for the soldiers, who 
in return gave her the choice of their finest fish. 
The cows and goats were daily taken out to forage 
near Safety Cove. Opal had merely to leave 
them at the government dairy at seven a.m., when 
the former joining the cowherd's drove and the 
latter the goatherd's were led out to pasture, and 
no more was seen of either until the evening, when 
the low of the one and the bleat of the other at the 
back gate announced milking hour and tea time. 
A stranger dropping into Port Arthur and coming 
suddenly on the picturesque herdsman reclining 
under the shade of some flowering tree, dreauiiug 
away the long hours of the day surrounded by hb 
seventy goats, may fancy he has alighted w §ume

Elysian eanctuary of the shepherds which has 
escaped the general ruin of the fall, or at any rate 
the destructive march of civilisation. But ques- 
tioning the happy dreamer his own dream dissipates 
before the everlasting O.F.8.0. of the herdsman's 
talk and the Broad Arrow of his back. He finds 
that the man's thoughts dwell indeed on love and 
home, but not of a sweetheart whom the shades of 
evening will restore to him, but of one for ever 
sundered by rolling miles of ocean and insuT> 
moimtable depths of degradation. His Fhillis 
never owns him more, and as for his home, he has 
a government lodging down there in the station; 
but hell may all so well be home as that. His 
home ? ah ! where is it ? the place thereof knows

this be true, why does Government trust you with 
so much unguarded Kberty? when your home

afternoon to a solving of the goatherd's problem. 
After a ten miles' ride he reaches the Eagle Hawk 
Neck, and finds it is neither falsely named nor a 
luring bait to the chain-weary captives of Port 
Arthur. He returns from the fiercely-guarded bar 
of sand, which, stretching to the main land, forms 
the only possible outlet from the Peninsula ; he 
returns no longer wondering why the lonely con- 
vict does not escape, but more fearfully wondering 
that ever is found one so reckless of life, so utterly 
despising death, as to venture into the certain de- 
tection, if not destruction, awaiting him at the 
Neck, where, if he elude the military watch, or, 
more dread and vigilant, the ferocious dogs chained 
across the Isthmus, he has still to fling himself on 
the mercy of the pitiless surf, and dodge the 
hungry shark. And yet he is told that many 
desperate men have thus attempted escape, and of 
them one or two have emerged from the jaws 
of death, and, landing on the other side, have 
become byewords in the annals of crime and 
infamy. 

When the station-gates closed on her friends, 
Mrs. Evelyn entered at once on her own plans and 
alterations : all traces of the recent out-turn soon 
disappeared before her mistressly touches. Opal 
was given fairly to understand, that his cupboards 
would be subject to inspection, and that no scrub- 
bing-brushes were to be thrown at the children. 



318 THE BROAD ARROW, 

Danby, the nurseman, was cautioned against kiss- 
ing, or permitting kisses from the little girl (still 
the baby of the Evelyn family) ; then supreme and 
happy, Mrs. Evelyn moved glibly about, satisfied 
even with the B. O.'s peeping from every comer, 
for they served to remind her that she enjoyed the 
large house rent free. 

The station-gates had scarcely closed upon his 
fiiends, ere Mr. Herbert locked himself into the 
study and there passed the morning in earnest 
prayer for his penal flock, that a blessing m^ht 
attend his labours among them. He then sdlied 
forth to hold his first service in the new cells 
chapel. Returning thence to the parsonage, he 
went to his daughter's room, and seating himself 
by her, she soon discovered that some perplexity 
worked in his mind; he promptly answered her 
look of inquiry by saying — 

' It has always been a surprise to me, that o

Emmeline's table, he turned over the leaves and 
read the titles of the different services. 

^ Here we have anticipated every position of 
fallen man, save that which is so painfully brought 
before us in these penal states.' 

* It cannot be that our church rejects this unfor- 
tunate class ?' said Emmeline. 

* God forbid, my child ! not while she professes 
to be the messenger of Him who came to seek and 
to save tliat which was lost, nor while she re-echoes 
that blessed voice, " Come unto me, all ye that are 
weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." 
But it appears that she has forgotten, there must 
ever be a portion of her family excluded by sin 
from the family altar, and therefore requiring a 
separate ministration.' 

He remained silent and in deep thought, then 
shaking his head as if to negatize some mental 
suggestion, he exclaimed — 

^ I cannot see a clear way before me. In my 
own church where the free unite in equal propor- 
tions with the bond, and parts inapplicable to the 
latter may be supposed to be addressed to the 
former, I do not so much perceive the necessity 
for a special service ; but here the necessity must 
be obvious to all, and where I have oflSciated this 
afternoon, where the congregation is composed of 
outcasts from the worst outcasts^ the necessity for a 
special service becomes paramount. It is a diffi- 



320 THE BROAD ARROW. 

culty that increases on my conscience, and will 
eventually lead me to renounce the public cell 
service, unless the authorities permit me to compile 
from our Litui^ a form for the use of those pri- 
. soners and captives so touchingly prayed for in the 
Litany ; and a very beautiful form could be ex- 
tracted with but little trouble.' 

' Beautiftil, indeed,' said Emmeline, a br^t 
recollective glance kindling in her eye. Then fold- 
ing her hands and shutting her eyes, in a low voice 
she repeated that exquisite prayer in the Litany, 
commencing, ' We humbly beseech thee, O Father, 
mercifully to look upon our inBrmities,' &c. 

' Yes, that, with the confession and a few other 
prayers, would be well chosen to express the feel- 
ings of those who have visibly and outwardly strayed 
from the right way. God knows, when we come 
to speak of that spiritual way marked out by the 
Saviour's blood, we have all need to look to oui^

appeal to the bishop without giving an offence which 
I am unwilling to give---for a house divided against

mitting to his lordship a compilation from the 
church Prayer-book for my prison use, but have 
hitherto refrained, hoping the necessity of such a

has not however done so here^ whatever improve- 
ments may elsewhere have taken place. You are 
weary, dear. It is naughty of me to come troub- 
ling you, is it not T 

* Very ; and more naughty of me to wish to know 
what harasses my father's mind.' 

* If I tell you what troubles me now, will you 
promise to assist me out of it ?' 

Emmeline smiled ready acquiescence. 

* Bridget informs me you are thinking of going 
to church on Sunday T 

* Oh ! that is unkind. I had made a nice little 
plan for creeping into the pew unseen by any one ; 
that is treachery, Bridgy.' 

* Only to you^ though, and in a right cause. 
I'm not going to let you kill yourself for all the 
churches in Tasmania. 

* It is only just outside the verandah,' pleaded 
Emmeline ; but she quickly yielded on seeing her 
father's anxiety, and Bridget undertook to be all

attention in order to bring back a correct edition 
of her uncle's sermcHi, which he had told them, 
was to be from the text^ * By the fear of the 
Lord men depart from evil/ 

On the Smiday morning the bells chimed out 
cheerily as though they called a free population to 
a sabbath rest, but the holy day afforded no respite, 
though it varied the weekly routine. 

Very sorrowful was Mr. Herbert's fece as gasdng 
around the church he perceived how the insignia of 
crime and force darkened the sanctuary of God 
into another form of prison. Here, at his right 
hand, stood the armed guard of soldiers, pointing 
their muskets in solemn mockery of the peace that 
he should declare. The peace of God, he had to 
preach. What peace ? silently sneered the mus- 
ket's mouth. Bridget had not yet dared to look 
up, she feared what she should see. But when her 
uncle commenced the service, * I will arise and go 
to my father,' there was so sudden, so tremen- 
dous a rush of chains, that she had no choice to 
refrain from looking. She hastily turned and 
beheld some hundreds of her fellow-creatures ar- 
rayed in the vast amphitheatre before her. There 
stood the hardened ruflSan ; there stood the heart- 
broken penitent ; there stood the gray-haired cri- 
minal side by side with the mere youth ; there 
stood every degree of guilt mingled into one dingy 
mass of yellow. Her heart sickened at the sight, 



PORT ARTHUR.— THE SETTLEMENT. 323 

yet she could not withdraw her eyes from the 
closely-cropped sea of heads, until, with one simul- 
taneous movement, down they all dived to the 
confession. Again they all uprose. The hum of 
the responses blended with the occasional clank of 
fetters, or every now and then wq3 wholly drowned 
in the combined rattle of the many hundred irons. 
Bridget no longer wondered that Mr. Herbert felt 
the impropriety of the service, it was a pain to 
hear it even. 

' Holy ! holy ! holy ! Lord God of Sabaoth,' 
devoutly exclaimed Mr. Herbert. 

* Heaven and earth are foil of the majesty of 
Thy glory,' replied the several hundred voices 
under dread of punishment, and several hundred 
chains prolonged the response in one dull vibration, 
which conveyed but a faint idea of the majestic 
glory spoken of. 

' That it may please Thee to bless and keep the 
magistrates, giving them grace to execute justice 
and maintain truth,' prayed Mr. Herbert. 

* We BESEECH thee to hear us, good Lord,' 
one-voiced responded the men, glancing, with pe- 
culiar earnestness toward the magistrates' seat, as 
though grace would fall acceptably in the direction 
of that large green pew. The service concluded. 
While Mr. Herbert changed his robes, the hymn 
was given out and commenced. It was adapted to 
an Hallelujah chorus. Just as he appeared in the 



324 THE BROAD ARROW. 

pulpit, the first verse finished, and the leader of tlte 
choir began the chorus ; then from those hundred 
convict lips burst forth that lofty strain wherewith 
angelic hosts sound their great Creator's |H'iuse — 
louder — still louder — and yet more loud at each 
new breath arose the Hallelujah, but louder than 
the loudest chorus outpealed a deafening clangour of 
chains, as in their enei^ to outvie each other, the 
men threw back their heads and shook their ironed 
limbs. Outswelled the heavy clangour, and a feat^ 
ful mockery of the enraptured song smote upward, 
lingering in the roof like the rolling bass of distant 
thunder. They were about to begin the second 
verse, when Mr. Herbert raised his hands, saying, 
* Let us pray.' The chains clattered down and 
once more arose. Mr. Herbert waited till the last 
rattle had died away. Then instead of the text 
Bridget expected, came a deep, rich voice, as de-

strife, and he had gone through his work for the 
week. Monday morning brought the same list of 
duty, the same cheerless ground to be trodden, 
the same tale to be told, the same difficulties to 
battle, the same discouragements to bear up against, 
but through these all there was the same God in 
heaven, saying, * I am thy strength and thy shield ;' 
the same Jesus whispering, * Lo, I am with you 
alway;' the same Holy Ghost the Comforter, 
invisibly refreshing the streams of grace ; the same 
bright crown o'erhanging, * Be thou faithfiil unto 
death;' and — alas! that he must drop from the 
mount of glory, (but so it is ever in this fickle 
world) — the same immortal souls living in death 
imd dying in life, sinking, sinking, sinking. So, 
how should not the cloud oppress his brow, for all 
that his own eternal prospect is clear as the morn- 
ing without clouds ? 

The family, too, had few interruptions to its 
quiet monotony— churning and ironing-days were 
the grandest changes ; these, however, occurred so 
regularly that they were hardly to be recognised 
as changes. The disappearance — or, rather, the 
non-return — of Danby, the nurseman, from the 
muster-ground caused a little excitement, and after- 
wards a great deal of extra work, for it was found 
that his absence was involuntary, being occasioned 
by an award of three days' solitary, amount due for 
five minutes' lateness at the muster. In like man-

ner Opal disappeared for a week, one of his cows 
haying chosen to break through penal rule and 
run home through the government garden instead 
of through the appointed road: she, of course, 
would not have understood cells, so the Chinaman 
became her substitute — both were B.O^ bodily dis- 
tinction was unnecessary. 

These excitements involved creature-suflFering,

therefore they were not agreeable to the parsonage 
family. Once a reported shipwreck really did 
bring some earnest blood into the pale face of the 
settlement; all was hurry and bustle when the 
screeches of the unfortunate crew were pronounced 
to be audible to every one, except the individual 
speaking. All the available males of the station 
turned out for Safety Cove, the scene of the catas- 
trophe, and the boat's crew was sent off to assist 
the foundering wretches. Meanwhile, the vessel, 
quietly rounding Cape Pillar, was wholly innocent 
of the imputed wreck : the cries of her crew could 
only be traced to a set of station urchins, who were 
concluding a spree among the ruins of Point Puer, 
by exhibiting their voices in the form of echoes amid 
the deserted buildings. And they who had ridden 
out to the cove one mass of benevolent feeling re- 
turned singly to the station, dropping in at slow 
intervals with feelings no longer benevolent, but 
such as it may be supposed possessed the fox which 
was invited to supper and sent supperless away.

' What mak^B you so sad, papa ?* said Emine- 
liae, as, leaning cki his ann, she valked up and 
down the verandah ; 'are you wanting to get bai^ 
to your people at home V 

' No, my child ; any part of my Master's vine- 
yard is the same to me. A heaviness has fallen 
upon my spirit, wherefore I cannot tell.' 

His eye unconsciously rested on the Isle of the 
Dead. Passing his hand quickly across his fece, 
he appeared to dash away a distressing thought ; 
his daughter, too, looked on the isle, and fancyii^ 
her father only cleared his sight to obtain a better 
view of it, she said — 

' It is a lovely spot,' and drew him gently on. 

A few days after that, Mr. Herbert received a 
letter from his brother, and without assiguii^ a 
reason to any one hut Emmeliae, he signified his 
intention to start overland for Hobarton. Mrs. 
Evelyn declared it was a shame to leave unpro-

tbat on his return he would either find them mur^ 
dered, or stuck up by the absconders. Neverthe- 
less, Mr. Herbert arrived in town, and thence back 
to the peninsula without any notable occurrence 
having taken place, except we mention that Opal, 
out of pure love to Emmeline, had managed to 
spin one pound of gravy-beef into such a multipli- 
city of sausages, that every person connected their 
number with the loss of the kitten ; but no con- 
fession could be extorted from him ; he merely 
giggled with a cunning leer, and said he * didn't 
tink nothing too fine for dat nice laddie wid de 
vely light face, what smiles so sweet on dis poor 
chaingang' — his mode of pronouncing prisoner. 
He made no secret of his attachment Much to 
Bridget's delight and Mrs. Evelyn's annoyance he 
would frequently say — ' Opal luff dat plitty light 
laddie vely much.' His mistress would correct 
him with — ' Love isn't a proper word for you, 
Opal;' on which, with troubled countenance, he 
would confess his ignorance of correct language, 
and apologize by explaining that what he felt was 
^ great, big, large, therej laying his hand upon his 
heart to show where. Nor was his love all idle 
vaunt. Emmeline owed much of her enjoyment at 
Port Arthur to this her Chinese worshipper. One 
day when she was fatigued with a short stroll in 
the government gardens, Opal chanced to enter 



330 THE BROAD ARROW. 

the room. He surveyed her in silence for some 
time, then giving one of his peculiar grunts he 
started oS to the lumber-house — shortly returning 
to the verandah with four small wheels and the 
spring of a child's carriage. Presenting these to 
Mr. Herbert, be asked leave to make his lady 
a coach. Mr. Herbert assented, willing to gratify 
tiie poor youth. In the course of a week he pro- 
duced a most primitive little vehicle, which was no 
less than a packing-case laid on the wheels ; but 
simple as it was, this original conveyance became a 
valuable accession to Emmeline's comfort, for with 
the help of shawls and cushions she made it an 
able means of moving from place to place among 
the beauties of the country. Never shone Opal's 
ample gums and tiny teeth more brilliantly than 
when he was appointed to the honour of drawing 
his ladye-love. He had a few set phrases by 
which he inquired into her state of ease : beyond

his, he contentedly classed her with Bridget as a 
claimant on his young mistress's affection. 

In fact, Maida was a myth to him ; he kept at a 
respectful distance from her, and would persist in 
calling her ma'am, giving it as his private opinion 
that ^she was a bigger ma'am than the other 
ma'am,' which other was Mrs. Evelyn. 



THE BROAD ARROW. 



CHAPTER X. 

A DAY DREAM AND NIOHT VISION. 

Meanwhile Mr. Evelyn remained in Hobartw. 
The family had been gone just three weeks 
when Maida, havii^ received her discharge from 
H. M. G. Hospital, was sent to the Lod^ under a 
constable's care. Stephens, the new servant, 
opened the door and refused to admit her ; he said 
' he didn't know nothing about a government 
woman called Maida Gwynnham, and he wasn't 
going for to let any one in while the master was 
out. If she'd like to wait till four o'clock to s 




A DAY DREAM AND NIGHT VISION. 333 

that she might be let by the morning, and then 
Mr. Evelyn would kick up one of his rows which 
everybody felt from his Excellency downwards. 
But Stephens said ^ 'twas past hiring hours, and 
very like if the master was really minded to have 
the woman Gwynnham, he'd step over to the 
Brickfields and hire her out before she could be let 
to any one else/ 

So Maida was turned adrift in the Hiring Depdt, 
and once more made to put on the prison clothes 
that she had only that afternoon exchanged for her 
own. In an instant she was surrounded by her 
old shipmates, of whom about twenty were congre- 
gated in the yard. Their bloated, hardened faces 
told her how much they had improved by transpor- 
tation and association with crime. One extoDed a 
spree she had enjoyed with the constable on her 
way to the Brickfields, another shamelessly declared 
that she had been in ' Cage ' for two children, and 
she expected very soon to go in for a third, only 
she hoped to be hired out till it was quite time. 
Disgusted and fatigued, Maida asked if she might 
retire to rest, and, on plea of her having just come 
from the hospital, permission was granted. But 
there was no rest in the ward from either the filth 
or strife of tongues — the torrent of contamination 
flowed freely — the better disposed were obliged to 
hear what the vicious chose to relate. In the 
morning Maida was put to some labour, and then 



334 THE BROAD ARROW. 

with the other vomen was turned into the yard. 
She retired as far as possible from her companions, 
and sat down on a stone to feel more vividly than 
ever the utter d^^adation of her lot ; yet more 
calmly than ever to shut her feelings within her 
hreast Drooping thus, she was aroused by a 
sudden cry of pleasure, 

' Why, Maida ! you here ?' and Lucy ran over 
to her. Sanders was with her, he approached, 
equally pleased to see hie old mate. 

' Well, Madda, 'taint trouble I hope that brings 
you here ? us is come to look out a woman 1' 

There was no small inflation of vanity in his 
voice and person as he made this declaration, 
same time making his locks to pass throi^h his 
fingers. 

Lucy explained. 

' So long as one of us is T. L. you know, we can 
have a servant — Lor, Maida, think of me having

thought 'twould * do first rate — ^but darned if he 
could propose it.' 

* Oh, Bob, / couldn't ! you'll do it beautiftil, 
you says everything so clever and nice, besides 
you are Ticket and I'm not.' 

So flown with T. Lism, strode Robert Sanders 
over to Maida; Lucy following timidly and on 
tiptoe, for fear she should disturb her husband's 
grand intention. 

* I say, Madda, we've talked at it, and if you've 
a will to it, we'll hire you out and give 'e just what 
the master did. Us'U get on fine together, darned 
if we won't!' 

Whilst this was being perpetrated, Lucy peeped 
shyly from between her hands, but directly it had 
gone forth beyond hope of recall, she bent eagerly 
forward, and every bright feature said, * Will you, 
Maida? Will you?' 

Maida waited a moment, and then smiling kindly 
replied, ' Do you ask, or command me, Sanders ? 
I believe I dare not refuse if you choose to hire 
me.' 

Bob seemed enchanted ; his T. L. was glorified 
beyond his fondest ambition ; he stroked his hair 
in quiet enjoyment, and nodding sidewise answered, 
* Well, believe I could, but I won't foss you — 
don't like foss, it's darned hard to bear ; if you 
don't like it, us won't ask up to the tepot,' as he 
called the dep6t.

* Then, thanking you for your very kind oflfer, I 
think I had better decline ; but as for going with 
you, I would as soon hei/our servant as any body's.' 

Another stroke of approval, but Lucy exclaimed, 
her bright face clouding with shocked disappoint- 
ment — 

' O, Mmda I not our servant, I never thought of 
that ; I meant you to come along and be one of 
us ; we both love you, don't we, Bob ?' 

Bob only shook his locks, and uttered his ex- 
pletive, • Darned T 

A carriage drove into the yard, and the friendly 
talk was suspended, for an officer called for Maida 
Gwynnhara. 

A lady leaned from the carri^e and surveyed 
her from head to foot — 

' Are you a needlewoman ?' 

' I can use my needle, ma'am, but I am en- 

iged. I believe my late master will be here for n

hastening up the path. He raised his hat to the 
lady, 

* I beg your pardon but this woman is my ser- 
vant, I have come to fetch her out/ 

* Not if I choose to take her, sir ; she says the same 
thing, but it is entirely contrary to convict rule.' 

* I'm afraid, sir, the lady is right,' whispered the 
matron, * the more so as Gwynnham came in with- 
out even the pretence of belonging to any one else.' 

* I have paid for her at the hospital for two 
months, in order to secure her to my family,' re- 
plied Mr. Evelyn. 

* No matter, sir,' bowed the lady, * she came in 
here to be hired by the first comer.' 

* I cannot contend with a lady ; if, therefore, I 
renounce my right to her, will you concede her to 
me ?' asked Mr. Evelyn courteously. 

* It's enough to spoil the creature !' ejaculated 
the grandee, falling back in her seat. 

She was selfish, and thought a servant worthy 
of so great a fuss must be worthy of her ; she pon- 
dered a moment, and then inquired in a super- 
ciliously playiul tone — 

* Well, sir, who is to have the woman ?' 

* It is for you to decide ; I would not disappoint 
a lady.' 

There was more anxiety in his manner than he 
cared should appear ; this was not lost either upon 
Maida or her would be mistress.

* Well then, since the gentleman declines yoOy' 
jump upon the box, you Gwynnham,' said the Wy 
with a forced laugh ; ^ and I suppose I nrast go 
into the hiring-room and signify my wiAes.' 

She stepped from the carriage; Mr. Evelyn 
assisted her to the office-door, and then firmly but 
politely said — 

* Understand, if yoa please, that / have not 
declined the woman, but that you have taken hen 
from me.' 

A haughty bow was the only answer. 

' And I must beg, if you do not find her what you 
wish, that you will favour me by letting me know 
before you dispose of her,' continued Mr. Evelyn. 

' Any one is welcome to a convict that leaves my 
house ! sure to be mere refuse if / send them 
off,' 

She vanished within the depot, and Mr. Evelyn 
returned to Maida, who was now seated on the box. 

^ Maida, my woman, I'm sorry for this ; you've 
slipped through my fingers.' 

* Do not distress yourself, sir ; I thank you for 
your interference, though it has been unsuccessful.' 

The lady now appeared, and Mr. Evelyn hastily 
whispered, ' Remember you are mine, if you leave 
your present mistress.' 

The carriage drove on — a last and sinister bow 
the only further acknowledgment of Mr. Evelyn's 
presence. 




A DAT DEEAM AND NIGHT VISION. 339 

* Bother it ; what'U Herbert and Emmeline 
say I' muttered Mr. Evelyn, as he rode from the 
Brickfields. 

Maida was borne away to one of the many 
elegant villas surrounding New Town. 

A footman opened the door, and Mrs. Patterley 
consigned her new servant to his care, saying— 

^ Take this woman, and after she has cleansed 
herself, send her up to my dressing-room.* 

Shortly after Maida went to her mistress, who 
abruptly commenced, * You'll soon find out what 
your work is.* 

^ I understood I was engaged to be needle- 
woman.' 

* I want sewing done ; but that is only when 
you've nothing else to do — ^you are to be parlour- 
maid ; in fact, you are to be anything I choose — I 
never allow any airs.' 

Maida was retreating. 

* Stop, woman ; don't be so impatient, I've some- 
thing to say to you — are you paying attention? 
Well, then — I've a son down stairs — mind I 
see no improper conduct towards him, or you'll go 
off to Cascades. I've sent away ever so many 
Government women on his account, they're such a 
vile set ; it's quite a nuisance to have them about — 
go— that's a//, only mind what you're about. You 
don't bear a very good character in that way 
already.' 



340 THE BROAD ASEOW. 

Maida hUrried out, for indignation burned hot 
within her. 

It was some days after this that her young 
master came into the dining-room when she was 
laying the cloth; he whistled about the parlour 
for a minute or two, and then standing at the 
other end of the table, said — 

* I say, where did you get those splendid eyes 
of yours ?' 

Maida answered not 

' I only want you to look at me — you're so hand- 
some.' 

He went towards her, she laid down her tray 
and walked to the door ; but it being nearer to 
him than to her, Mr. Patterley sprang over and 
placed his back against it, then tapping her on the 
cheek, he said — 

' Now, give me a look, or you shan't pass.' 

Maida did look ; he did not wish for a second. 




A DAT DEEAM AND NIGHT VISION, 341 

And Maida struck him a real, good hard blow, 
sufficient to arouse both rage and redness. 

* You contemptible wretch ! I'll have* you 
punished*' 

As he uttered these words, his mother sailed 
into the room. 

*The old story I Eeally these Government 
women are the pests of one's life. Edward, surely 
you must give them encouragement' 

'Of course I do, mother; what man resists 
the—' 

*What have you done to your face?' inter- 
rupted Mrs. Patterley. 

* I struck him, ma'am ; and I shall again if he 
comes near me.' 

A loud ring at the bell was the only answer. 

* Fetch a constable ! this woman's going — ' 

* To the Brickfields, ma'am ?' bowed the foot- 
man. 

' No, to the police station.' 

Maida was locked in a room until the con- 
stable's arrival, and then duly given into charge — 
she was marched off to the Court. 

* But, I say, mother ; it will be awkward for me 
to appear against her : I must acknowledge that I 
teased her before she struck me.' 

' Oh, never mind, my dear, you needn't appear ; 
I'll go for you.' 

So on the morrow Maida was brought up, and 



s 



342 THE BROAD ARROW. 

Mrs. Patterley appeared against her, accusing her 
of insolence and improper conduct ; on the strength 
of which complaint she was sentenced to a month's 
imprisonment, with cells. 

^ I have nothing to say against the charge, except 
that it is all a lie — nor against my punishment, 
except that it is unjust !' exclaimed Maida, when the 
magistrate advised her to avoid trouble for the 
future. 

In reply to which speech, the magistrate thought 
it would take quite another month to cool the 
prisoner properly down; and, therefore, amidst 
the laughter of the Court, he sentenced her to a 
second month with hard labour. 

Mrs. Patterley was then driven back to her 
luxurious home, and Maida was conveyed in the 
prison-van to the Cascades, there to be lowered 
by skillet, wasted by severe labour, and worried 
by every species of indignity; but not all this 
until she had first been subdued by a protracted 
confinement in the dark cells. 

She had been in the establishment about seven 
weeks, when, for some distasteful answer to one of 
the petty officers, she was ordered three days' 
solitary ; she was just at the end of the second day 
when the door suddenly unlocked, and Mr. Herbert 
stood before her — he could not at first see her. 

* Maida, are you there ?' he asked : his voice 
was low and tremulous. Maida did not reply. 



A DAY DREAM AND NIGHT VISION. 343 

* Why don't you come forward, there ?* said the 
officer, who accompanied Mr. Herbert ; * the light, 
will shine in presently, sir, then you will see her ; 
she's the most troublesome case we've got.' 

Maida came forward, trying to look uncon- 
cerned ; but the light caused her to close her eyes. 

* Can I be left with her ?' inquired Mr. Herbert. 

* Well, sir, I suppose as you are a clergyman, I 
must not object,' and the woman withdrew. 

By this Maida had retreated to the end of her 
cell, and as she crouched up in a comer, her eyes 
looked like two large brilliants set in darkness. 

Mr. Herbert entered, and having closed the door, 
he said — 

* Shut your eyes a minute, for I am going to 
strike a light.' He drew a little case from his 
pocket, ignited a match, and then lighted a wax- 
taper. * Now then, it will not pain you ; look up, 
and tell me how you came here.' 

* Pray, sir, tell me first, how you became aware 
of my being here.' 

* Your master wrote me word, and I also saw it 
m the '' Courier." ' 

* And what brought you up from the Peninsula, 
sir ? no bad tidings, I trust ?' 

* Very bad, Maida ; even your being here !' 
She laid down her head, and groaned. 

* For me, sir ! all that way for me I' 

* For you, Maida ; and I mean to wait in town

untfl I can either take yoa to Port Ardbor, or see 
yoa under Mr. Evelyn's aaeJ 

* Oh, sir ; don't, I pray yoa ! I can bear any- 
thing bat kindness ; diat Iveaks what litde heart I 
haTe left to me.' 

^ My poor Maida, none of as belieye yoa gail^ 
of the immorality assigned. We think, periiaps^ 
yoa were hasty, and even violent.' 

^ I was both ; but both were deserved, sir — I 
am weak and ill, and cannot bear yonr kindness — 
I am shaken in mind and body. If yoa talk so to 
me, I shall weep.' 

Her voice became unsteady, and Mr. Herbert 
remained silent. 

* All last night, sir, I was with my poor father, 
and that has unnerved me ; as you speak words of 
kindness, I fancy I hear him. Oh, sir ! you wilt 
think me a coward, when I tell you that I dread 
such another night, because I dread again to meet 
my father/ She covered her face with her hands, 
and then broke out in her old wild way — 

' Hell is kinder than this, for hell has light ! 
there was a time when I did not care for the cells ; 
but now — ^I do not know how it is, I cannot endure 
them. Sir, do you think my reason is going ?' 

' Far from it, Maida ; I think it is returning. 
You are, perhaps, accepting God s terms, offered 
in the first of Isaiah— and so Satan is doing all he 
can to terrify you.' 



A DAY DREAM AND NIGHT VISION. 345 

*SiiV I do not wish to put anything off on 
Satan, all I suffer is from my own wicked spirit and 
guilty conscience/ 

Mr. Herbert smiled. 

* Never mind what it is from^ Maida ; sit down 
and let me tell you about Emmeline and the baby 
— ^they both send their love to you/ 

He talked to her some time, and then read the 
Twenty-third Fsalm. 

^ That is a strange passage to read to me, sir !' 

* Why so, Maida ? it is a sweet collection of 
thoughts, if nothing else, and I see no objection 
to your thinking them over.* 

The overseer entered and announced closing 
hours, whereupon Mr. Herbert arose and whispered 
to Maida, that she should not remain another night 
in the cells, he would appeal against further soli- 
tary confinement. He accordingly requested to 
see the Superintendent, and to him stated his 
belief that it would be injurious to keep Maida 
longer in the cells. 

The Superintendent said she had but one day to 
accomplish ; of this one day, however, Mr. Herbert 
would not hear ; the prisoner's nerves being already 
irritated and disordered, he insisted on the necessity 
of releasing her, and was at last successful in ob- 
taining a remission of her sentence. Having as- 
certained at what day and at what hour she would 
be free, he directed that she should be promised to

no one, but be sent straight to the depot where he 
or Mr. Evelyn would appear at the given hour to 
hire her out. 

Six days from that period the brown van was 
again in waiting at the gates of Cascades, and 
amongst many other women, Maida was conducted 
to it: the door was then locked, the key given to 
the constables in charge, and the dreary van drove 
off to the Brickfields. The women had scarcely 
been delivered to the Superintendent, ere Maida 
saw Mr. Herbert descend firom a cab and enter 
the hiring office. In another minute she was 
called forward, and in five more was on her way 
to the Lodge. 

* Now, Maida, you are to have rest until your 
strength has returned ; for this reason, I am going 
to leave you in Hobart At Port Arthur you might 
be pressed into the general service ; at home, there 
being only your master, you will not be required to 
worL' 

Mr. Herbert tried to smile cheerfiilly, but Maida 
appeared listless and reserved. He continued — 

* Necessity has partly decided me, for, except 
in an open boat, I do not know how I should get 
you down ; the steamer is still laid up. Are you 
tired, Maida ? you look so.* 

* Do I, sir ?* and she sat upright 

Mr. Herbert laid his fingers on her wrist 

* I must doctor you, you know my prescription ?

Miss Bridget calls it the everlasting quinine and 
wine.' 

* I have been plentifully dosed, thank you, sir. 
Government is generous with its medicines when 
there is any chance of losing a convict* 

* Here we are at the Lodge, well forget the pre- 
scription for the present, Tou will only find 
Diprose within. Tammy has been sent away/ 

Mr. Herbert went to his brother, who lounged in 
the breakfast-room. 

* Is she come?* 

* Yes, but in a weak, low state, poor tiling ! I 
can hardly venture a word to her.* 

' By which you mean / am not to venture any. 
Ah I I'm up to you, Herbert ; well, I*m not going 
to worry her, she*s had enough, and too much 
already.* 

Maida entered to learn her master's wishes. Mr. 
Evelyn arose, and Mr. Herbert left the room ; his 
brother was always kinder to her when he was not 
present. 

* Well, Maida, here you are at last ! I think I 
may say I'm glad to see you back, but not in that 
doleful plight : look up, my woman, what ails you ?' 

* What ails me, sir ? Should you wish infor- 
mation on that point I would advise a visit to the 
Cascades.* 

* Well, don't let's rub up old grievances, all I 
can say is that I am sorry to my heart for you, I 



348 THE BROAD ARROW. 

only wish I could lay hold of diat young scamp, 
Fatterley, and I'd teach him something, darned 
if I wouldn't, as Sanders says/ 

But Maida was not inclined to laugh. Baising 
her eyes to her master, she said — 

* I thank you, sir ; by-and-by I hope to appre- 
ciate your kindness, now I feel cross and bewil- 
dered ; to escape from observation is all I want — I 
shall only get into trouble again if I remain in my 
present state of mind.' 

* Well, keep clear of me if you like, for I'm not 
in an over good temper either ; I never ani whilst 
there are pale faces about me, so go and get up 
your looks before you have anythiug to say to me.' 

' As to the rest which Mr. Herbert promised 
me, sir ?' 

' The devil he did ! why I've been waiting here 
this long time to be rid of some of my cares — the 
garden, for instance ; there are all Miss D'Urban's 
flowers requiring attention: I wanted you to be 
after them ; and there's Diprose up stairs, up to 
all manner of mischief. However, if Mr. Herbert 
promised you rest^ go and take it, as much as you 
like of it. I don't think you'll ever get fat on it, 
though.' 

Maida was obliged to smile in spite of herself, 
her master had never been so queer before. 

' I was about to remark, sir, that I neither wish 
for rest nor need it.' 



■^ 



A DAY DREAM AND NIGHT VISION. 349 

* Oh, humbug, yes, you do ; you don't suppose I 
don't know what convicts want.' Dropping his 
voice to his natural tone — ' I tell you what it is, 
Maida, if it will not be a comfort to you to hear, 
it is a relief to me to let you know, that I think 
your punishment a disgrace to every one concerned. 
Yes ! that's from ine^ late a police magistrate. Go 
and make what use you please of it.' 

' I shall, then, make two uses of it, sir, the one 
to convict myself, and the other to force me to 
seek your forgiveness.' 

Mr. Evelyn put up his eyebrows : his funning fit 
was over, and he now viewed the case in sober 
sense as it stood before him in painful reality. 

Maida did not understand the raised eye- 
brows to mean * Go on,' so her master nodded 
' Well ?' 

* Your kindness, sir, convicts me of deep in- 
gratitude ; you can never blame me on that point 
so much as I blame myself. Believe me, sir, I 
am not so by nature. I am proud, wicked, and 
resentfiil, but not ungrateful. I have been goaded 
into rebellion and perversity, until—' 

* There now, that'll do, you need not tell me 
you are proud, that I've found out long ago ; and 
as to your being wicked, you can grant that if you 
like, but as to your being resentful or ungrateful, 
it's not a true bill, or, by George ' — 

But Mr. Evelyn stopped with an ahem ; he was 



350 THE BROAD ARROW. 

on the punishment ground f^^n, and therefore 
checked himself. 

Mr. Herbert restarted for Port Arthur on the 
following day, and Maida was left to a season of 
genial quiet, for none in the house were disposed to 
interfere much with her. Her master purposely 
avoided her as much as possible ; and her fellow- 
servants had received secret commands not to seek 
her assistance. The man, Stephens, was an odd 
beii^, and would have had but little to say to her 
if he had not been laid under ban. 

He seemed in so perpetual a flurry and exate- 
ment that he had incurred the sobriquet of Fussy. 

From morning to night he was never still ; it 
would be flurry, flurry, to the^ last moment, when 
he would prepare for bed by dressing himself tat 
the morning. Then resting one leg on the floor 
and tucking the other under the bed-clothes, be 
would ensconce himself in discomfort, ready to 




A DAT DREAM AND NIGHT VISION 351 

Snort, * Precious,' snort, his only answer. 

' I say that there Sam Tonkins was hung up 
to-day.' 

Snort, * Precious,' snort. Fussy's sole appre- 
ciation of the fact 

He had also a favourite notion that the fac- 
simile of everything pertaining to luxury or com- 
fort had once been possessed by himself or his wife. 
When the lady governess of the island called, he 
would duly announce her, then banging the door, 
he would mutter, * Shawl just like my wife's.' 
Having the master's travelling cloak to brush, he 
would set at it with * Precious, not a bit better 
than the cloak I had at ^home, just the feller, 
b'lieve it's the same.' He had, too, a favourite 
dislike, and that was of the cicadse, whose never- 
flagging whir r r r seemed almost to distract poor 
Fussy. He anathematised them more than twenty 
times a day. 

* Why, what is it. Fussy ?* asked some one, ob- 
serving his uneasiness. 

Snort, * Precious,' snort, * to think I've come out 
all this way to hear nothing but them critics a 
whizzing their nonsense all day long; precious 
tongues they've got to keep on that way !' 

No persuasion could make him call them crickets. 
' No, no, he'd heard tell of critics at home, and 
knew well enough that they was famous for their 
keeping on when everybody else had done talking.'

3^2 THE BROAD ARROW. 

It was the master's peculiar delight to listen to his 
crusade against the ^tritics/ Had he been a more 
educated man, Mr. Evelyn would have suspected 
him to be a disappointed authcnr, but the poor feDow 
was, happily, innocent of letters. 

Diprose, too, had no inclination to molest Maida ; 
she was absorbed in her own sorrows. Thou^ a 
convict she was still a mother, and possessed the 
yearnings of a mother s heart Day and night she 
fretted over her four children, dead or alive. She 
had buried two : one little child of five had been 
left in Scotland ; the other, an infant, was in the 
Queen's Orphan School. When first she went to 
see her little son, she was doubly hurt ; in the first 
place, because no one in the school seemed to 
know her baby from all the others. 

* What ! not know my little Abel !' she ex- 
claimed, bursting into tears. 

* Get along with your Abels, who be he more 
than anybody else's Abel?' was the comfortable 
rejoinder. 

And secondly, because little Abel himself did 
not recognise her. 

* Come to his own mammy, then !' she said, 
maternally, and straightway the child stretched 
his arms to a mother not his own. 

She confided her story to Maida, whose ever- 
ready sympathy invited the outpouring of the 
deserted mother's heart.

« 

She told her she had never known sorrowor a 
dishonest penny until the winter of 18 — ^ when 
everything was scarce, and work still more so; 
sickness fell on her children, and her husband emi- 
grated to America to build a nest in which he could 
home his family. She never heard of hina again, 
and was left to struggle with three children and a 
fourth expected. Two sickened, and in one day 
she laid them both ill one grave ; she said the 
neighbours came from far to see the bairns, they 
looked so heavenly in their coffins. After the 
first flow of pity had subsided, she was a^ain left 
to poverty and misery; one night, when a half- 
crown would have saved her from immediate ruin, 
a bad man came roimd and tempted her with 
illegal money, which she passed, was detected, 
apprehended, and transported. This was her 
simple tale, and its truthfulness none^ could doubt 
who looked at her woe-begone face and heard her 
constant sigh. She fretted on and on, until her 
master thought the hospital would be the best 
place for her. 

As another case of * Frettin,' she was therefore 
admitted to that establishment, and never left it 
more until she was carried thence to the prisoners' 
grave-yard, when her little Abel was cast on the 
world a despised child of a despised race. 

A month passed, and still there was no chance 
of remitting Maida to Port Arthur. The * Kan-

garoo's ' ailments were obstiDate, and required still 
furtlier professional treatment. 

The family had now been four montiis on the 
Peninsula. The winter had set in, it being the 
latter end of June, and in a week or two would be 
too far advanced to allow the possibility of sending 
Maida. One day when she had nearly ^ven up 
all hope of being summoned. Father Evermore 
trotted up the lawn and left a note for Mr. Evelyn, 
requesting that an answer might be left at the 
Vicar General's before the next evening. 

The note contained a message from Mr. Herbert, 
saying that Father Evermore having occasion to 
go to town, had consented to bring back Maida if 
she were not afraid to venture in an open boat. 
Mr. Herbert added that there would be no other 
opportunity, the ' Kangaroo ' having been tried and 
found unequal to the trip, and another steamer 
could not be ready until the

for Fussy, thought far too preciously of his brains 
to risk having them dislodged by venturing outside 
the door after dark ; he considered that once in 
his life was quite sufficient to have a pistol held at 
his head. Now Maida quieted him by saying that 
she should see all right for two nights more^ and 
then, perhaps, the Master would either undertake 
it or let Diprose. It was her last night. Being 
engaged in preparations for her departure, Maida 
forgot the gates imtil ten o'clock, when she has- 
tened down the lawn to close them for the night. 
The moon shone so gloriously that in spite of the 
keen wind she walked up and down the grove path, 
and was soon in one" of her dreams of the past. 
Turning towards the thickest part of the grove, 
where a hedge of tea-shrub joined the trees into a 
continuous chain, she saw the hedge divide and a 
scarecrow figure approach her.. It was that of 
a man whose famished look and tattered garments 
proclaimed him to be a wayfarer of no common 
order. 

* Martha Grylls,' said the gaunt figure. 
She started. 

The voice was so hollow and the eyes glared so 
spectre-like upon her, that for an instant she 
doubted it to be more than a phantasy, but it re- 
peated, in yet more sepulchral tones — 

* Are you Martha Grylls V 

^ I am : what do you want of me ?' 



356 THE BEOAD AREOW. 

' To save me I there's no one else I knows of 
that will.' 

' Who are you ?' Maida felt a cold terror creep- 
ing over her ; she imputed it to the bleak wind, 
and shrugged herself together, repeating, * Who 
are you ?' 

' Bob Pra^. I'm out, and there's a free pardon 
offered on my head and money to the bargain.' 

' Pragg !' 

' Yes ! I knows no one but ^ou that'll save me.' 

' Me, Pragg ! what do you know, then, of me 
that makes you say so ?' 

* That you ain't the one to send off a poor dying 
wretch like me, to make gold of my blood.' 

There was a dead silence, during which the 
chattering of- Pragg's teeth, and Maida's hard, 
quick breathing, were the only audible sounds that 
interchanged with the wailing of the wind. A 
loud 6tful gust swept down the grove and by its 




A DAY DREAM AND NIGHT VISION. 357 

He put forth a long clawlike hand, and it pounced 
on Maida's, grasping it, cold and deathly. 

* Can you feed an enemy, Martha Grylls ? I'm 
starving ! I 'scaped from the Neck, and I've wan- 
dered in the Bush till I'm most eaten up alive 
with the rot, and I'm most dead of hunger ; I ate 
a dead guana five days agone, and nothing but a 
sup of water's gone down since — I say, woman, 
can you feed an enemy ?' 

His claws almost pierced her skin as he shook 
her, repeating, * Can you ? woman, can you ?* 

* I mn, Bob, but only by giving you money. 
I've no food of my own, nor could I get any with- 
out betraying you.' 

* Money I' he laughed a wild shrill laugh. 
* Money I will that feed a starving belly ? curse 
your money and give me bread I' He lowered his 
voice and glaring at her, muttered — 

* Bread for the love of God I you, the woman 
I've injured and would have injured more if I 
could, give me food — give me food !' 

Maida clasped her hands in agony. 
Pragg drew closer to her and hissed into her 
ear, ' A fine plea, ain't it ? but I swear before — ' 
Maida laid her arm upon him. 

* Bob, don't swear before any one, for God is up 
there listening to you.' 

' It is just before He that I'm going to swear, 
for it's the only true word of my life that I'm

now Speaking, and that is, I know that it's just the 
plea to go down with you. Ah, I know you, 
Martha Grylls, better nor you think ! Ah, I know 
all about it' 

His teeth chattered beyond control ; he could 
only mumble incoherent words that Maida could 
not understand, but her alarm was aroused. She 
shivered with fright as she said, ' Tell me what 
you mean ; for pity's sake, Bob, tell me.' 

' Give me food first, food, I say, fixjd, and then 
111 tell you that if I'm taken, I'll proclaim your 
hinnocence from the gallows — ah! that I will, 
or blast my living soul. Oh, Martha, Martha!' 
the tears rolled down his hollow cheek, ' Oh 
Martha, when Bob Pragg's brought to tears the 
devil's out of 'en. I never thought to see the 
day when I'd blubber before a woman and she 
you. I always swore I'd die game. But ah ! 
there's no game in dying, no not whilst there's HelV-

to her bedroom and was returning with her basket 
when Mr. Evelyn came out of the room. 

* You, Maida! where are you going with that 
basket ?' fine preparation for your journey ! 

' I'm going down stairs, sir.' 

* Well, well, I'll wait till you come up. Why, 
how's this, Jags isn't brought in yet ? mind, if the 
rangers come I shall declare you are in league 
with them.' 

Maida rejoiced to hear him speak so, because it 
showed that he was in a good humour, so she 
laughingly replied — 

* Very well sir, I'll plead guilty ; but if you'll 
trust the house to me, I'll ward off the rangers, 
my pistols are always loaded.' 

* Well then, good night, I'll leave it to you, 
only don't come creeping up when you have done, 
but give a good, brave step that I may know you 
are safe.' 

Therewith her master hummed himself up 
stairs; she heard his door lock, his shoes fling 
ofl^ and then she knew he was safe. Having 
brought in Jags, the terrier, and let him loose in 
the hall, she barred all the front doors of the house 
and let herself out into the lawn by the back door, 
and locking it after her, she put the key in her 
pocket. The two sunken eyes were glaring out 
for her from the thicket. She sat down by Bob 
and opened her stores; the long, bony palm

snatched up the first eatable she drew forth. He 
bolted a few mouthsful and then threw it down, 
shaking his head. 

' I'm eick, woman — I can't eat now it's before me.' 

' Try Bob, let me feed you.' 

Bob shook his head, and a flood of teare extin- 
guished the glare of his eyes. 

' Oh, I say, woman ; can you forgive a dying 
wretch ? can you ? can you ?' 

He laid down his head between his knees and 
moaned. 

' Can you ? can you ? This ain't Bob PragR 
is it ? Oh I can you ? can you ?' 

'Bob, don't torment yourself; I ccm, and do — 
and pray God to foi^ive you too.' 

' Do you ? then, pray on, quick — ^for hell's a 
gaping wide and I'm most gone down. There! 
what d'ye think of that ? I pulled it off" a txee

advertisement was visible. Then came a descrip- 
tion of Pragg, with the above reward oflFered for his 
apprehension. 

As Maida read out 'Round and Ruddy/ he 
grinned a death's head grin. 

* Like me, ain't it ? look here — ^round, ain*t it ? 
ruddy? ay, as the grave I' 

* What am I to do with this, Pragg ?' 

* Go and get your pardon and your money 
home, out of it.' 

* Do you mean it, Pragg ? I thought you said 
you knew me.' 

' I know you ; but I know myself better, and I 
know 'twould be a blessed relief to me to be 
delivered up by you; I want to feel paid out, 
I do, woman, I do ; pay me out — do, do, I say.' 

Maida tore the paper into shreds and trod it 
underfoot. 

' There, Pragg, I'll deliver you up to God ; but 
to no one else.' 

' To God !' shrieked Pragg ; ^ to God !' 

The wind wailed down the grove, and his tattered 
garments fluttered on him like rags upon a gibbet 

* To God, woman ! 'tis He I'm most afeared to 
meet ; if 'twernt for He I'd give my own self up, 
for death would be a grace to my rotted body. 
But Martha Grylls — you that I dragged away 
from your own baby's grave — you that I swore on, 
save me from He, as you would save your own soul.' 



362 THE BROAD AEROIT. 

* Oh, that Mr. Herbert were here !' groaned 
Maida. 

* Don't fetch of he I he'd bring the very light of 
hell long with him.' 

* Bob, he'd brit^ his Saviour with him.' 

* Ay, woman, ay; his Saviour, if you like — but 
Where's mine ? Oh, where's mine, I say ? where's 
mine?' 

' There he is, Bob ; look up I' 

And Maida pointed up to where shone calmly 
down the bt^ht, bright moon, untouched by the 
stormy blast 

Bob turned up his glaring eyes — a cloud drove 
past and bid the moon. Bob threw down his head 
and cried — 

* Yon lie, woman — ^you lie ; 'tain't mine — he 
r^ht hides himself when I look up.' 

'Bob, I am a poor sinner myself, and there- 
fore a bad one to talk about such things ; but thU

famished and sunken features — for an instant he 
looked like his old self; he winked a twinkling 
wink which came horribly from his glaring eye, 
and he said in his own familiar voice— 

* That ain't the word ! Sorry ! I b'ain't sorry 
for them ; but they be sorry for me — ay, sorry, 
woman ! shoving me headermost into the brim- 
stone that I've heard tell of — ^Hell I I smell it 
nigh/ 

Maida was bewildered ; for all that she had 
heard the gospel so faithfiiUy declared — ^for all 
that she longed to receive it herself, her tongue 
now seemed to cleave to the roof of her mouth. 
She knew that the Redeemer bled for anners ; but 
as she looked on the ghastly object before her, 
dyed in his fellow-mortal's blood, she feared 
whether she had any right to speak comforting 
words to him ; whether, by so speaking, she should 
not be deceiving him to his double despair. 

* Can you pray, Martha Grylls ?* 

* Yes, Bob ; for any one but myself.' 

* Pray then — quick.* 

Maida knelt, and commenced a few words — 
when Bob tore down her hands. 

* Don't pray, I can't bear it; it's worse than 
hell, because it's hell before its time.* 

But quietly, though trembling in every limb, 
Maida again clasped her hands, and uttered a short 
prayer for pardon for the wretched man before her. 



364 THE BROAD ARROW. 

* Oh, oh !' groaned Bob, and the wailing wind 
bore on and prolonged the oh — oh — oh ! 

The dogs set up a loud, fierce bark, which was 
snapped up and reverberated by the terrier withm 
doors. Maida started. 

* Bob, I must leave you ; creep into the shed, 
and cover yourself over with this ; I'll be out in 
the morning, before it is light. Oh, Bob! I 
grieve to say it ; but hadn't you better give your- 
self up ? you must be caught, for you are weak 
and can't crawl far — poor, poor Bob !' 

She burst into tears, and crouching down by 
him, said, ' Bob, I'd save you if I could ; but I'm 
only a prisoner myself, I'll never give you up ; but 
leave you I must, for I'm going to be sent away 
to-morrow.' 

* Maybe, I'll be dead of cold 'fore morning ! oh, 
it's freezing, ain't it ?' and his teeth chattered and 
his whole frame shook. 

The dogs sounded a second and louder alarm. 

' Creep into this shed, Bob ; the master '11 be 
getting up. Quickly as you can.' 

Bob crept in, and Maida covered him as well as 
she could. 

* Martha, is the gate free, 'sposing I makes up 
my mind to crawl away ?' 

He turned a look so piteous on her, that she 
wrung her hands. 

' That little gate there shall be free. I can see 



A DAY DREAM AND NIGHT VISION. 366 

it from a window up stairs. I'll sit up all nighty 
and watch it that I may leave it safely open.' 

Without venturing a second look, Maida glided 
into the back door, speaking low and soothingly to 
the dogs to keep them quiet. She passed swiftly 
into the nursery and locking the door, took her 
station at the window to watch the gate. She 
heard her master go down stairs and make the 
round of the house — as he always did when the 
dogs were vociferous. 

She also heard him fire off a. pistol from the 
lobby-window, and then all was peace again for 
the night. 

She watched for two hours, when she fancied 
she perceived a slight movement of the gate ; but 
the moon rays glancing about gave an appearance 
of motion to every object ; therefore, she looked 
long and stedfastly ere she could decide whether 
it opened or not. It did open, and just then the 
moon rode out from a cloud and a baptism of cold, 
clear glory, fell around, making every dim outline 
give out distinctly the form it before had shrouded 
in uncertainty. It fell extra bright and clear over 
the little gate, when Maida saw a heap of rags 
crawling along the earth and pushing its way 
through the open gate. Softly as possible she slid 
up the sash. Bob heard her and turned towards 
the window ; the large, white eye-balls rolled up 



366 THE BROAD ARROW. 

and stared very ghastly, towards her earnest face. 
Bob slowly raised his long arm thrice, he had not 
strength to wave it ; but the shreds, hanging from 
it, fluttered his farewell. Maida threw up her 
hands in an attitude of prayer and then closed the 
window. The moon again was overcast, and all 
once more was shadow and twilight. 

In the morning Maida hurried down the grove, 
a vestige of Bob in the form of a tattered kerchief 
together with the shawl with which she had covered 
him, was all that remained to attest the reality of 
that terrible night vision. 

She heard no more of Pragg ; but when on her 
way to the boat with Father Evermore — a cart 
guarded by two armed constables, and drawn by 
four chained convicts, drove slowly by her. The 
cart was covered by a rug — its contents were not, 
therefore, revealed. Yet with a shudder, Maida 
turned from it, for the middle of the rug was 
arched pointedly, as though forced up by two 
sharp knees. There was an awed gloom in the 
countenances of each of the driven men, and a 
mysterious expression in the faces of the con- 
stables. 

That night, when Maida was sleeping at the 
station, on her way to Port Arthur, the dead-house 
of H. M. Gr. Hospital was opened and a collapsed 
and stiffened corpse was laid there. The very

doctors, accustomed to death in its most horrible 
appearance — turned, heart-sick, away, as the wide, 
staring eye and distorted figure of Bob Pragg met 
their sight. 

His body had been discovered by a road party, 
on its progress to the bush, behind Macquarie 
Street,

CHAPTER XI. 

THE ISLE OF THE DEAD. 

* I went her lily hand to take. 

Its coldness made me start.* 

The winter passed cheerfully. The mild climate 
of Port Arthur had only once or twice yielded to 
the stern control of winter. Snow had fallen on 
Mount Arthur, but had not dared to show itself 
further. Again had the sweet month of November 
opened on the imprisoned family. Again came 
the flowers bursting from their leafy folds. The 
aflernoon was fresh and fair, and Emmeline said 
she had not felt so well for a long time ; she should 
enjoy a little draw in her primitive carriage. Opal 
therefore was ordered to hold himself in readiness 
to obey his young mistress's pleasure, and brightly 
shone his olive face as from his full lips came the 
answer — 

* Opal leady always for she ; nice lady, me lufls 
her wely much ; always got a smile for poor chain- 
gang.' 




THE ISLE OP THE DEAD. 369 

When asked where she would like to go, Emme- 
line replied'^ 

* Let my litde carriage be drawn in sight of the 
Isle of the Dead, and there let me re^ and look 
out on the lovely spot.' 

And there she stayed, Opal waiting reveren- 
tially at her side until her father feared that gentle 
as the air was it mighi be too strong for her. 

' Very well, papa dear, I will return. I have 
enjoyed my joiurney or my rest — ^which is it ? more 
than I can tqll you.' 

Mr. Herbert smiled, but how subduedly ! and 
softly inquired — 

* Enjoyed it ? that sea-girt grave-yard always 
makes me feel sad.' 

' Ah, papa, you think of liie many poor crea- 
tures lying there, far from their home and friends, 
that is sad; but as I sat gazing on it, I only 
thought how peaceful a rest it would afford my 
aching frame, and how much, if you approved, I 
should like to be laid there.' 

She pressed his hand fondly, and watched for 
when he should turn his face to her. 

* My child's wishes are mine ; what makes you 
speak so, my Emmeline ? you just now said you 
felt better.' 

* And I do ; but still, papa, we won't talk of it ; 
it makes you low spirited.' 

* My daughter, I would not keep you one hour

Emmelioe buried her &ee in her hands^ and then 
suddenly raising it she exclaimed — 

^ Ah, papa, bat is there not one still dearer 
within that veil ? Oh, think that He is there, and 
then what sorrow voor dear heart must still feel

* My iove, He is not within the veil, or we be- 
reaved ones could not forget our grie^ even know- 
ing, as we do, that our treasures are safe. What 
says our blessed Saviour ?' 

Emmeline looked ; she did not remember. 

' Lo, I am with you alway ; we are not with 
Him, but is He not with us ?' 

By this the carriage had arrived at the avenue, 
and Charlie rushing out upon them prevented fur- 
ther cjonverse. 

Emmeline stayed up later that night; she ap- 



THE ISLE OF THE DEAD. 371 

peared so unwilling to retire that it had struck nine 
before Mr. Herbert reminded her she had exceeded 
her usual hour. 

As she bade him good night she said almost 
lightly — 

* To-morrow I shall be alive for a trip to Stuart's 
Bay!' 

* To-morrow is God's !' replied Mr. Herbert, 
somewhat solemnly. 

There was something in his daughter's manner 
and appearance that perplexed him. He returned 
her long embrace fervently and fondly, but a vague 
sensation of near sorrow mingled with his farewell, 
as he clasped her in his arn^s. 

* I shall like to sleep alone to-night. I am sure 
I shall require nothing. Maida shall sit up a little, 
and then I shall send her to bed.' 

She looked over the stairs, and repeated — 

* Good night, papa ; God bless you,' 

' And you, my precious,' replied her father. 
Bridget assisted her to undress, and then sat by 
her until it was Maida's time to come in. 

* Bridgy, when I am gone, which shall you do, 
go back to England or stay here ?' 

* I don't know, Em — I don't want you to go, 
therefore I put off thinking of what it would be 
best to do ; I hate talking about anything that ha§ 
to take place when you are no longer here. I can't 
spare your dear face, it has become a necessity to me.' 



^ 



372 THE BROAD ARROW. 

She laid her head on her eooan's piUow, and by 
half playfully smoothing her thin dieek tried to 
hide the emotion that made her voice unsteady. 

^ Has it ever struck you, dear Bridget, to be 
thankful that I'm not a prisoner?' 

' How fimny ! No ! Much they'd find to make 
prisoner of in you,' and Bridget started up quite 
amused at the idea. 

But Emmeline was serious. She continued — 

^ Instead of being what I am, a poor heljJess 
giri waited upon by a cheerfol, loving sister as you 
are to me ; instead of having a tender parent to 
love and feel for me, widi Uncle Ev, and all the 
other dear ones around me, I might have been 
not only helpless, but friendless and uncared for. 
Oh, what am I that I should have so many 
mercies above my fellow creatures! above poor 
Wilcox and Sallv !' 

As Bridget listened to her cousin, and observed 
the holy expression of her countenance, she was 
puzzled to imagine : had Em been a convict, what 
sort of crime she would have committed ; she was 
just going to say as much, when Emmeline turned 
on her a look so wistful, that she could not help 
asking — 

' What is it, dear ?' 

* There is only one question that troubles me — 
no not troubles, that is not the word, for I cast my 
cares on the Lord, but only one point I should like 



THE ISLE OP THE DEAD. 373 

to have settled, if it be God's will. Who will be 
with papa when I am dead ?* 

* Oh, my Em, can you doubt ? I would never 
leave him if I would do for him, but' — she added 
sadly, * I'm afraid I'm too giddy, too thoughtless 
for him.' 

* No, Bridget, you are not giddy. You are 
happy and gladsome, and he loves you as his own, 
so be his daughter. / have given him only pain, 
you must try to give him pleasure.' 

There came a gentle tap at the door, and Mr. 
Herbert entered to tell Bridget it was time she 
should retire to rest. She arose and kissed him, 
and the tears were in her eyes. He knew not 
wherefore, neither could he account for the extra 
warmth of her embrace, for he knew not of the 
compact that had just been made between his child 
and niece. 

* The Lord love you my daughter !' he said as 
he smoothed her hair. 

A glance of surprise passed between the cousins ; 
it was the first time he had ever so called her. 

* Baby is rather troublesome to-night, therefore 
Maida will be delayed a little, so I am going to 
remain by you until she is ready. I shall return 
presently.' 

* Good night then, my sweet Em, I must be 
gone before he comes back,' said Bridget. 

• Why was that unwillingness to part ? why did 



374 THE BROAD ARROW. 

they so cling to each other? why did tears so 
bleod with the farewell smile of the two cousins ? 

' Bridget, ray own one,' said Emmeline, still 
holding her, ' I cannot tell you what you have 
been to me. My sister, my friend, my nurse, my 
everything that my Father and my Saviour have 
not been, and yet they have been all diese ; you, 
then, have been my own, own Bridget' 

'What does it all mean?' sobbed Bridget; 
' everything is so strange to-night' 

' But still so happy — Oh, happy, happy !' 
* Happy things don't make people cry,' answered 
Bridget, for want of something else to say. 

' Em, darling, tell me,' she at last outburst^ 
' you're not going to die, are you ?* 
' I think not, I never felt better.' 
' Then don't talk of these horrid tilings.' 
' You will be glad hy-and-by to know what a 
comfort you have been. Oh ! I must, must thaiA 




THE ISLE OF THE DEAD. 375 

When you are in doubt remember it, and quietly 
observe God's ways ; and though they may seem 
confused and intricate, watch, and surely as morn- 
ing breaks out of night, so surely shall you find 
" that the end of the Lord is full of mercy/* Good 
night, darling, papa is coming.' 

* I don't like to leave you.' 

* Why not ? No person shall stay to-night ; I 
am sure I shall sleep soundly.' 

But Maida entered with Mr. Herbert. The 
baby had fallen asleep, and she was free to relieve 
her master, whose frail strength needed all the 
refreshment that rest could impart to fit him for 
the early service with the men. 

* Maida, you are only going to stay until twelve, 
and only that because I know you would be dis- 
appointed not to remain at all ; but I need nothing, 
so lean back and sleep.' 

Maida obeyed as to the reclining, hoping that 
Miss Evelyn would sleep if not spoken to. She 
closed her eyes ; but opening them suddenly, found 
her young mistress gazing fixedly at her. 

They both smiled, and Maida raised herself. 

' You see I am very obedient. Miss Evelyn, but 
I hope you will remove your injunction, and let 
me talk to you ; I looked forward to it all day.' 

*Dear Maida!' and Emmeline stretched her 
hand to her. 

* Ah !' thought Maida, * I little dreamt the 



376 THE BBOAD ARROW. 

time would ever come in which I should bear 
myself called dear.' 

And little, too, did she once think that she 
could ever again allow herself to be so addressed, 
much less that it would afford her pleasure^ ^nd 
that she should acknowledge that pleasute. 

Emraeline seemed to read her thought. 

' Do you remember wheu we first met ?' 

' Indeed I do, Miss Evelyn ; heaven has pa> 
dually opened to me since that moment. Can you 
forgive me my evil treatment of you V 

'Of me ! My dear, watchfal nurse, what do 
you mean ?' 

'We will not speak of it, then, if you pleasej 
for all you may kindly say but shows me more 
what I detest to see. This nuich I will say, that 
in time my debt to you and Mr. Herbert can never 
be known, bu.t ' — she stopped short. 

Emmeline listened in thrilling eagerness ; Maida 




THE ISLE OF THE DEAD. 377 

own misgivings, and reconcile my own inconsisten* 
cies.' 

* Never mind yourself, Maida ; thank God you 
have nothing to do with any one but Christ. The 
victory is given, not won by you/ 

* You excite yourself dear young lady ; we must 
not talk any more.' 

A bright flush lay on Emmeltne's cheeks. 

^ Oh, no, no ! to hear t/ou speak of these things) 
does me more good than all the sleep in the 
world.' 

* I who have been so vile 1' exclaimed Maida, 
with some bitterness ; ^ to hear me speak so I' 

' I have had one doubt happily settled to-night, 
and I foi^ot that I had yet another before I could 
say that the Lord had heard all my prayer. 
Maida, will you set that doubt at rest ?' 

An expression of pain was her only reply. 

* Maida, only tell me one thing, and I could die 
this moment' 

* Do not torture me. Miss Evelyn ; I cannot tell 
you what I do not feel. Would you have me lie ? 
Would you have me say I possess that which I 
know I have not got ?' 

* Maida, I would have you say what you do 
feel-^and that is, that you long, you crave, you 
thirst for peace, and peace is Christ. Won't you 
satisfy me ? Maida ! Maida ! won't you ?' 

There was almost awildness in her energy, with 



378 THE BROAD ABBOT. 

a vivid radiance in her countenance, that was 
unlike her usual serenity. She waited a moment, 
and then softly said — 
' Won't you, Maida ?' 

* What must I tell you. Miss Evelyn ?' 
'That you lor^ for the peace of Christ.' 

' I do; but that is not enough — it is not haTing it' 

* It is enough for me. I have heard suffident 
to make me very happy. Go now, dear Maida ; I 
can sleep sweetly on what you have told me. Good 
night, Maida ; won't you kiss me ?' 

*I have never done so, Miss Evelyn; why, 
then, to-night?' 

The colour rushed to her cheeks as the old look 
flashed one instant across her features. It passed ; 
and stooping, she printed one long kiss on Emme- 
line's brow. 

A smile, so rapt that it might have lighted an 
angel's face, repaid her, and she yearned to fall on 




THE ISLE OP THE DEAD. 379 

* That time will never come, Miss Evelyn. If 
I have a secret it is one that I can keep. But 
don't send me away — do let me stay, Miss Evelyn ; 
I have given you pleasure, now repay me.' 

* To-morrow you shall sleep here with me — to- 
night I wish to be alone : once more, good night, 
dear Maida ;' and the door closed. 

In a few moments all was silent in the parson- 
age: all weary eyes were closed in sleep, and 
sleep, sweeter than she had ever known, hushed 
Emmeline in calm repose. 

In the early morning, as was her wont, Maida 
entered Miss Evelyn's room on tiptoe. She still 
slept, so Maida, as she had often done before, 
crept over to look at her. 

Last night's smile still lingered on her lip, 
which had fallen gently apart, disclosing two pearly 
teeth ; one hand lay beneath, and partly supported 
her cheek, and the other lay upon the bed. Maida 
bent to kiss that hand — its coldness made her 
start. 

She stood before Death disarmed of his terrors, 
for Emmeline was in heaven. 

How long she stood entranced she knew not. 
The door shutting upon Mr. Herbert as he left the 
house for his duty aroused her. 

* Dear creature ! O God ! I thank Thee that 
Thou didst give me power to place that smile upon 
those precious lips, now hushed for ever. I, who 



380 THE BROAD AEROW. 

have given her so many pangs am not worthy of a 
mercy so great.' 

Bridget was dressing when Maida, with a faint 
tap, entered her room. 

* How pale you are : what's the matter, Maida ?' 

* I am cold. Miss Bridget. You are up early.' 

* Do you know I awoke with such an uneasy 
feeling about Em, that, goose that I am, I was 
obliged to get up. Directly my dressing-gown is 
on I shall run up to peep at the darlmg ; she was 
so extra exquisite last night that I can't forget her 
— that^s why I'm up so early, Miss Curiosity.' 

< I will go with you, Miss Bridget' 
What meant that trembling voice? Bridget 
looked at her. Involuntarily upturned the large 
eye, over which now quivered an undropped tear. 

* Tell me, or I shall think she's dead T screeched 
Bridget, catching both Maida's hands and shakii^ 
her.

* Oh, no ! she only sleeps. This cannot be death. 
Eiiameline, my own one, look up and speak to me.' 

But never answer came. 

« « « « ♦ 

No weeds funereal lay scattered about — at once 
chilling the heart with their dreary aspect and 
calling for energies which, though given reluptantly, 
relieve the burdened mind. There was no hurry 
of preparation. In the dim twilight, accompanied 
by an overseer, two convicts were seen approaching 
tiie house bearing on their shoulders a plain deal 
coffin ; then stealing in through the back door, 
Aey made their silent way to the chamber of 
death, where Maida awaited them ; and ere the 
father knew what was taking place, Emmeline was 
tenderly laid in her last resting-place, and smiled 
the pale face up from that simple bed, as sweetly 
and calmly as though it had been wrapped in 
costly cerements. 

But the men would not depart ; they said they 
must see the parson, no one else would do. 

* Well, my men, you wish to speak to me ?' 
asked Mr. Herbert. 

* It's gone abroad, your reverence, that the free 
is going to offer to carry Miss Evelyn. Your 
reverence will never take from us the last sight of 
her that's been the pride of the station. Sure, sir, 
you shall find us steady, and all so willing as them 
that's got wills of their own. There isn't a man

in the gang that won't feel hurt if they sees her go 
by on other shoulders.' 

* You shall carry her, for had she been asked 
she would have chosen you. I will see to it, and 
thank you,' 

Mr. Herbert shook them by the hand. 

' God bless your reverence, and them that's left ! 
You won't say we've had a word with you, sir ; it 
may go wrong with the Gov'nor.' 

Mr. Herbert bowed, for his voice failed him. 

The man who had not spoken before now said — 

' It's bad to our feelings to put that there rough 
timber over against her that should have the best 
of everything ; but your reverence knows there Js 
no help for it down here, where it's all for prisouers. 
I know the best in the store was picked out, but 
bad's the best' 

The father could almost smile : he had not ob- 
ierved the coffin— the gentle sleepi

Ev, alighting at the church, led his horse slowly 
towards the house. At that instant out struck the 
church bell, one, two — one, two. Mr. Herbert 
approached his brother, and in silence they grasped 
each other's hands. 

* I can't see her ?' at last whispered the elder 
brother, in choking utterance. 

* Not until you see her there /' replied Mr. Her- 
bert, pointing upward. 

* Herbert, I have but one wish, and that is, that 
when yon dreary bell tolls for one of my chil- 
dren, that child may have your Emmeline*s hope, 
and I may have your comfort.' 

One two — one two. There must be no delay. 
The procession moved slowly though the settle- 
ment. As officiating minister and chief mourner, 
Mr. Herbert walked first, bareheaded, and in his 
surplice. Then, borne by six prisoners in white 
blouses, came the simple coffin. Mr. Evelyn, 
Bridget, and Charlie following close after, and 
then, forming a part of the procession, and yet 
isolated from it, succeeded a solitary figure, wrapt 
in a lonely grief that it was striking to behold ; 
beyond her lingered Opal, his eye wistfully follow- 
ing the mournful band as it wound through the 
settlement and stopped at the Bay, where three 
boats awaited it; one of which was empty and 
attached to the second by a stout rope. In the 
other two sat the boat's crew in white jackets ; they 



384 THE BROAD ARROW. 

bent reverently on their oars as Mr. Herbert 
passed by tbem and took his place in the first boat 
Mr. Evelyn, Bridget, and Charlie entered the 
next ; then the coffin was lowered into the third 
boat, and the bearers retired to the jetty. Th»e 
was no room for Maida — she must be left behind. 
She watched the signal for departure being given 
with a look of anguish, which Mr. Herbert per- 
ceived as he just raised his head fix>m the folds of 
his surplice to take a last look at the coffin, ere it 
was towed onward. He no sooner met that an- 
guished eye than he motioned her to step into t^e 
third boat. ' What, with the dear creature herself! 
he cannot mean it,' thought Maida ; but Mr. 
Herbert beckoned again; and with a treml^ing 
foot she entered, and almost flung herself at the 
coffin's side. Plash ! plash ! with measured strokes 
the oars beat solemn time, ajnd alternately with 




THE ISLE OP THE DEAD. 385 

Now all have landed ; Mr. Herbert turns, and 
in the same order the procession threads its way 
up the narrow defile. 

One, two ! one, two ! one, two ! swings rapidly 
from the steeple rising from yon knot of trees. 
The vibrations die away, and all again is silence. 
When swept onward by the gentle breeze, a voice 
bursts fi'om that solitary spot — 

* *' I am the resurrection and the life, he that 
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he 
live, and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall 
never die." * 

At first the tone is tremulous, for it is a father 
who speaks ; but lofty it swells, and yet more lofty, 
till, like sweet music from a distant shore, is wafled 
over the quiet bay that Christian hope and holy 
aspiration, triumphant over pain and death. 

But now the funeral disappears, lost amid the 
foliage. 

Unseen it moves on until two chained prisoners 
waiting at an open grave mark the resting-place it 
comes to sanctify. 

Hitherto, in compassion to the father, there has 
been but slight outward show of grief; all have 
controlled their feelings; a very muffled sob has 
been the only audible indication of the heart's 
sorrow. But when the bidding word is spoken and 
falls the heavy clod upon the cherished form, one 
loud and bitter wail rings through the quiet of that

386 THE BROAD AREOW. 

desert isle, startling the wild goat from his rock 
and making the bird wheel, frightened, from bis 
nest. 

The cry comes neither from parent nor relative, 
but from that lonely captive, into the desolation of 
whose soul the fallen clod has struck and aroused 
a mighty echo of despair. 

None tries henceforth to hide that sorrow it is a 
strife to hold within. The father alone weeps not 
The bitter cry for a moment subdues bis voice 
into a murmur ; but it again breaks forth in holy 
rapture — * Blessed are the dead that die in the 
Lord!' 

All is over ! the moment comes when grief may 
no longer feed its infatuated sight on the visibilities 
of death — when, as though it had never been, tie 
joy of years is buried out of sight and death in 
fiction is all they may gaze upon. Oh happy 
they, who in this moment of darkest bereavement, 




THE ISLE OP THE DEAD. 387 

There have they left Emmeline alone in that 
desolate yet lovely Isle. There is she left sur- 
rounded by convict graves, from which hers is only 
distinguished by its flowers and freshness. Here 
and there a headstone peeps from a cluster of trees, 
announcing the grave of one who has never been 
galled with chains ; yet these exceptions make still 
more pained the painful show of graves, unmarked, 
uncared for, and barely seeming more than the 
natural roughness of the mould. 

Over one such a heap droops a withered branch 
of acacia, which, torn from a neighbouring tree, 
has there been planted in stealthy haste by some 
more kindly hand, who was fain to leave over his 
comrade's grave a token whereby to recognise it. 
Nor all in vain the rude memorial — life is within 
that apparently withered branch and is timidly 
budding from the lowest stalk. It is a wonder no 
overseer has discovered that In memoriam, and 
jealously pulled it .from out the earth. . But there 
it still lowly blooms, and when years have swept 
by, and that mound is trodden from view, it shall 
rise in its fragrant verdure, and none shall know 
the origin of that fair acacia. There shall it 
bloom an enduring memorial of that convict grave, 
a fitting emblem of that resurrection power which 
shall call beauty from ashes, joy out of sorrow, 
life out of death. Of the further secrets of this 
sea-girt grave-vard few are known, and those few 



388 THE BROAD ARROW. 

are, alas ! too often the records of despair ; but this 
is known, that many a convict stops on his path to 
cast a sigh towards the shore of the lonely Island. 
Many a captive pines for its hallowed rest, to 
attain which some have laid violent hands on 



All yearn towards this peaceful spot, for it is 
known of all that here is heard no more the voice 
of the oppressor. Here the prisoners rest together 
and the servant is free firom his master ; ' Here 
the wicked cease from trouhling, and the weary 
are at rest.' 




( 389 ) 



CHAPTER XII. 

ACCEPTED. 

It was now the Sunday after the funeral. The 
congregation, free and bond, were surprised to see 
Mr. Herbert take his accustomed place in the 
desk, and still more surprised were they to see 
him enter the pulpit to preach his own child's 
funeral sermon. All waited for when the stricken 
father should arise from his knees and commence 
that lament oyer which all had prepared them- 
selves to weep. All looked forward to experience 
a luxuriant tenderness when the minister should 
merge into the parent, and yield himself to sor- 
rowful recollections of the past. A sensation of 
astonishment, therefore, ran through the whole 
people, when in a voice loud, clear, and, if possible, 
more sonorous than usual, Mr. Herbert, looking 
calmly around him, thrice repeated slowly and dis- 
tinctly, no funeral text, but Agrippa's words — 
* Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.' 
Then dropping his voice into a low, earnest tone, 
he said — 



390 THE BROAD ABROW. 

' My friends, I thank you all for your kindness 
to my departed child. I am about to leave you ; 
to your care I commit that grave lying in yom 
Isle of the Dead. To your attention I commend 
her who ties within that grave. My bond brethren, 
you who are the same flesh and blood, heart and 
soul, I implore you to note that grave. I do not 
by this ask you to keep it in order, your own kind 
feelings will prompt f ou to do that unbidden, hut 
this I do ask you, to attend to that grave as a voice 
from God, as a voice from heaven, bidding you go 
to Christ. And, oh, would God, that the answer 
of your hearts might be, not Almost, but Alto- 
gether thou persuadest me to be a Christian. 
Could but OQC such voice reach my ear, I should 
bless God for my child's death in this place. I 
should bless Him to eternity that in this far«ff 
Isle, on which mine eye may never rest again, I 
leave her to the stranger's care.' 




ACCEPTED. 391 

Mrs. Evelyn said it was like a prisoner not to 
care more for such an affecting sermon than to go 
out just for a little headache. But Mr. Herbert 
discerned more than physical pain in the lowly 
dignity of Maida's carriage ; he knew it was no 
common feeling that could weigh down that head, 
so erect and noble in its bearing. He sought her 
directly after the service. The rest of the family 
had proceeded to take a quiet walk in the Govern- 
ment garden ; he therefore feared no interruption 
in seeking an interview with her, whom he con- 
sidered one of his flock as well as one of his bro- 
ther's family. But she was neither to be found in 
the kitchen nor in the outhouses. Opal said, ' He 
had se^n dat leddie come in fast, quick, big, and go 
up stairs, but he hadn't seen her since.' (He 
would persist in calling her a lady, for that she 
was a prisoner could not be brought to his under- 
standing.) 

In going up stairs Mr. Herbert had to pass his 
daughter's room. He thought from within he 
heard a suppressed voice ; he listened and entered ; 
Maida knelt there. On seeing Mr. Herbert she 
arose, and approaching him, extended both her 
hands, exclaiming, * It is over, sir I not Almost 
but Altogether. The moment of decision has 
come. With dying lips Miss Evelyn persuaded 
me, you have decided me. Her God shall be my 
God ; her Saviour my Saviour !' 

* Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory 



392 THE BROAD ARROW. 

through Jesus Christ our Lord/ said Mr. Her- 
bert, clasping his hands and looking upwards, his 
pale, careworn face bright as had been his dying 
daughter's. 

* Sir ! those were Miss Evelyn's very words to 
me.' 

* They are, and ever will be the Christian's 
words, Maida. O Maida! I bless God for my 
child this day, I bless Him for the sorrow I have 
had, I bless Him for you, my daughter. Come, 
let us thank Him together.' 

They knelt, and ere their praiseful prayer con- 
cluded, a third joined with them. Bridget had 
stolen back to weep in her cousin's room ; entering 
on tiptoe she beheld her uncle and Maida, and 
immediately bent silently beside them. They 
arose. Then was there joy in heaven. Then the 
glad shout of triumph proclaimed another heir born 
into the world of glory. And may it be that the 
shout passing from Angel to Angel, at last reached 
that Paradise where wait the gathered saints their 
entrance into the celestial regions, and there pro- 
claimed the welcome tidings to one who through 
pain and disappointment had still hoped for Maida, 
who had yearned over her in life and had prayed 
for her in death. These mysteries we know not 
of. But we do know that one sinner gathered into 
the bundle of life is worth a worldlong trial, is a 
treasure beyond the toil of ages, and cost a Sa- 
viour's blood. 




( 393 ) 



CHAPTER XIII. 

BRIDGET AGAIN 

Is all of a fluster. . Uncle Ev tells her that Mr. 
Walkden has once more found his way to Hobar- 
ton, and is waiting below to renew acquaintance 
with her. 

Bridget hopes to her heart that he will make no 
allusion to days past, and the something that 
passed in them. 

Mrs. Evelyn hopes he will, and that her niece 
will not make a simpleton of herself, for a real 
M. A. is not an every-day catch in the antipodes. 
Episcopal hands there rarely find true Oxford or 
Cambridge heads on which to exercise their ghostly 
function. Poor Mr. Walkden, too, has given so 
very decided a proof that, renouncing all other, 
he will either go without a wife, or have Miss 
D'Urban, that really she ought to accept him. 
Her former refusal of him and his resignation of 
the comfortable living of Clarence Plains had oc- 
curred together, or rather on one and the same 
day. But in resigning his living he had taken 



394 THE BROAD ARROW. 

care to accept the Wardenship of Bishopbourne, 
where to the present time he has been trying hard 
but uselessly to forget Miss D'Urban in the 
scholastic duties of the college. So uselessly try- 
ing, that yesterday the Launceston coach brought 
him into Hobartou; and he means to try how 
Bridget feels, or at any rate how she looks now 
her former objection has for months been dead and 
buried. As she enters the room, he determines 
that whatever she feels^ she certainly looks none 
the worse. Her cheeks, if possible, are of a richer 
carnation; and her eyes as full of light — less 
merry, though not less cheerful ; in fact, they are 
more suitable than ever to a clergyman's wife. 

However, she has not entered alone. Uncle 
Ev comes, too — for Bridget declared she would 
not go down unless he accompanied her. The 
visit ends in Mr. Walkden being invited to dinner 
— an early, friendly dinner — after which, by some 
* horrid' chance, Bridget finds herself left alone 
with him. She gives an imploring look towards 
Uncle Ev, as she sees him stratagising for the 
door ; but he only shuts his eyes wickedly at her, 
and departs, when Mr. Walkden asks her if any 
persuasion of his may prevail on her to change 
her mind, and revoke a sentence that makes him 
the most miserable of colonial clergymen. 

She says she has undertaken to be Uncle Her- 
bert's daughter, instead of Emmeline. 



BRIDGET AGAIN. 396 

Mr. Walkden inquires if it may not be possible 
to unite the relationships of wife and daughter. 
But Bridget seems to think — ^no. 

So the matter drops for that afternoon. Mr. 
Walkden, beseeching her to consider it, and let 
him know the result of her thoughts, dejectedly 
leaves the house ; but not, as she supposes, to go 
to his hotel. He walks straight to the prisoners' 
barracks, and there watches for Mr. Herbert; 
whom he no sooner espies returning from his 
duties, than he joins him, and renews the matri- 
monial suit. 

Bridget is out watering her plants after tea, 
when she sees Uncle Herbert approaching ; she is 
quickly at his side ; and then he tells her that, as 
far as he is concerned, nothing would give him 
greater pleasure than to marry her to Mr. Walkden ; 
but he would on no account bias her against her 
wishes. Entirely off her guard, Bridget exclaims, 
*0h, uncle! I like him very much; only — ' 
She stops and looks vexed. 

* Only you are divided between love and duty,' 
says Uncle Herbert kindly. 

She still more vexed, and, somewhat hurt, re- 
plies, ' Uncle, if I am divided at all, it is between 
love and love. If it be a duty to fulfil dear Em's 
last wish, it is one of so much pleasure that I am 
loath to resign it.' 



396 THE BROAD ARROW. 

Nevertheless, she did resign it, and shortly be- 
came Mrs. Walkden, to the infinite satisfaction of 
her aont, who, in kissing her after the wedding, 
said, with one of her little quick laughs — ^ Of 
course, my dear I what else do you suppose your 
motlier sent you out for ?' 



397 



CHAPTEK XIV. 

THE AWAKENING MORE VICTIMS. 

In an elegant drawing-room, in one of the Wes 
End houses of London, sat Mrs. Norwell, or Mary 
Doveton, as, laying aside the proprieties of wedded 
life, we are still fain to name her, for we cannot 
reconcile om^elves to her union with him whom 
she fondly and proudly calls her husband. 

Now she arose and flitted about the room for 
some time, as if in search of something ; and then 
she resolutely nestled into a couch, determined to pa- 
tiently await whatever it might be that she ex- 
pected — her fairy fingers pretended to diligence 
over a dainty heap of muslin and lace : now draw- 
ing forth a garment so small that it could only be 
meant for a doll or a baby, then ruflfling it al- 
together back into the basket, she would raise 
her head and listen. 

There came a brisk rat-tat in double-singleness 
at the front-door; and we know for what Mary 



398 THE BROAD ARROW. 

had been watching. She walked to the door, and, 
holding it open, \rished the servants would not be 
so long. 

Her pale face tinted with the gentlest rose, as 
she took a letter from the silver tray handed her 
by the footman. She nestled back into the cush- 
ion, held the letter up, and then threw it down. 
'Dear — ! it is not from him. Naughty man, 
that he is I' 

But her pout of disappomtraent gives us plea- 
sure not because her delicate lip peeps so prettily 
from its wonted line of beauty, but because it tells 
us that which we have been longing to hear, 
namely, that Norwell makes her happy. The 
letter lay unnoticed for half the evening. Mary 
was too engaged in accounting for her husband's 
silence to care about opening it At last, she 
heaved a little sigh, and whispered, * Ah, well ! 
now it's a pleasure to come-, only I shall not sleep 




THE AWAKENING. — MORE VICTIMS. 399 

nullified. The shamed secret was in his wife's 
possession. 

Mary withdrew the envelope, and her husband's 
own handwriting met her sight. She read, * My 
beloved Maida/ and repeated the name over and 
over again, but could not remember where she had 
before heard it. Then came the name Martha 
Grylls — then Maida's own letter — ^when through 
all her sweet simplicity — through all her unwilling- 
ness, stared out on Mary a truth she would have 
died to make false — a lie she would have given 
her life to abrogate. But the awakening had 
come — there was no reprieve — no room for doubt 
— the accusation was from Maida — the confession 
from himself! Poor Mary ! you must depart from 
your paradise, for the evil one is there. The 
canker is at the root of your gourd, and it perishes 
before you. Your sun goeth down while it is yet 
day. She was not one to show either grief or joy 
by ecstacy. When the array of servants filed 
silently in for evening prayer, and when the butler 
laid before her the Bible and Prayer-book, she 
merely raised her eyes to him, shook her head, 
how drearily ! and faintly articulated, * I can't 
to-night !' 

And more silently the servants glided from the 
room — each mystified and sorrowful at what should 
ail their gentle mistress. 

There was the same dreary reftisal of the refresh- 



400 THE BROAD ARROW. 

ment tray, when it was wistfully presented her by 
her own maid — for all the others had feared to 
disturb her. 

The maid waited; but Mary spoke not until 
looking up she saw tears in her servant's eyes ; she 
then smiled a smile more touching in its misery 
than could have been the bitterest display of grief, 
* My dear lady, are you ill ?' 

' Very, very !' and Mary drooped her head, but 
she shed not a single tear. 

' Allow me, ma'am ; you should not pass the 
night alone. The nurse was here to-night, and I 
gave her your message, saying you did not expect 
to want her for three weeks.' 

' 'Tis not that, Fanny. I do not want her. My 
illness is all here.' 

She folded her hands at once upon the letters 
and her heart, for she had re-sealed the former and 
laid them in her bosom. 




THE AWAKENING. — MORE tlOTIMS, 401 

her, but not of joy ; the paleness of her cheek 
became yet more deathlike as she received and 
mechanically opened the expected letter. Each 
endearing word called forth a desponding moan, 
and with each word the pain gathered more closely 
to her heart. She once more '■ htoke the seal of 
Maida's packet, and placing Norwell's within she 
closed it again for ever. Then putting the whole 
in another cover, she sealed it, and, after a few 
moments of anxious thought^ wrote on it, with a 
trembling hand : 

*For dear Henry, with Mary's love and — 
prayers.' 

The struggle was ended : she flung herself into 
her chair and wept until she could weep no more. 
Faint and shadowlike she moved about all that 
day and the next. The morning after a second 
note from Norwell announced his return within 
two hours of her receipt of his announcement 

Not knowing that the servants had, after united 
consultation, agreed to send for their master, 
Mary wondered at his change of purpose; she 
had not expected his return for another week. 
Now one dull emotion of suspense numbed her into 
a cold quiet. She heard the loud rap at the door, 
and then her husband's voice sounded through the 
house ; the well-known airy step was on the stair, 
but she moved not ; another instant, the door flew 
open and Norwell entered. A glance at his wife's 

VOL. II. 2 D 



402 TEE BROAD ARROW. 

fece sufficed to tell him that the alarm of Iier 
illness was not unfounded. He was shocked and 
startled, but the servants liad begged him not to 
let Mary know that he had been summoned. 

* Why, what ails you, darling ? Are you ill ? 
Surely not, or you would have sent for me.' 

She had approached to meet him; he now 
folded her in his arms; but the form he held 
yielded itself so lifelessly to his eaibrace that he 
was tenified. He sat her gently back on the so& 

* Mary, love, what is it ?" 

He leant her head upon his shoulder, but she 
raised it again — not loathing, it was not in Mary 
Doveton to despise, but she felt she had no ri^t 
to lie there. 

' Mary, love, speak to me ; what is it ?' 

She could not longer resist. 

She fell upon his neck and wept piteoualy. 

'Oh, Henry, Henry!' she said no more. 




THE AWAKENING. — MORE VICTIMS. 403 

none could doubt that it fluttered its little wings 
for flight The servant was hastily sent for a 
clergyman to baptize it 

Despite all remonstrance, Mary would have the 
ceremony performed by her bedside. Her husband 
asked what name she would like : she whispered — 

* I — have — one.' 

The clergyman came, the preparatory prayers 
were read, he received the child from the nurse, 
and said — 

* Name this child.' 
Norwell turaed to Mary. 
Looking flxedly at him she said — 
^MaidaGwynnham.' 

* Maida Gwynnham, I baptize thee in the name 
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost.* 

Norwell stole to Mary's side, and kneeling by 
her strove to read in her coxmtenance some ex- 
planation of the strange proceeding ; but the eyes 
were closed, and the pale features were mute; 
there was neither speech nor utterance in them ; 
he only gazed on a sweet blank. He recollected, 
with poignant grief, the time when those same 
features, angelical and admiring, had sought into 
his face as he now sought into hers, and then he 
remembered, with a rush of pain, the artless 
words — 

* I have loved you, Norwell, since that day ' 



404 THE BROAD ABROV. 

He obserred that one hand rested finoly on her 
heart, as thoi^h. it vould arrest a pain. He laid 
his hand upon it, and Mary pressed it more firmly 
down. 

' Mary !' he whispered. 

She opened her eye ; there was that in it which 
made a cold terror fall upon him. 

' Oh, Mary ! we are not going to be parted — 
are we ? My life with you has been heaven apon 
earth.' 

' Yes, Henry; and when I am gone, foiget that 
you have ever loved me, and do your duty to — ' 

Norwell gasped over her for the last word, bnt 
it was a mere breath that passed and left him 
desolate. 

The hand relaxed, the letter fell, and he who 
should have received it earlier, all too late read his 
fate and the cause of his Mary's death. 

That evening the fair fragile flower, with its

Maiba had just entered the fifth year of her 
transported life, of which she had now to experi- 
ence but two more changes — ^the ticket-of-leave 
and the conditional pardon. Both were still 
distant* According to the regulations then in 
force she had to serve yet three years (tc^ether 
with the two months abstracted from the reckoning 
by reason of her punishment in the Factory)

conld claim her conditional pardon. But all save 
her mistress had given up speaking to her of either 
the one or the other. To hoth these indulgences 
she displayed so utter an indifference that her 
master deemed it useless to encourage her with 
the hope of them, and Mr. Herhert considered it 
more a mortification than otherwise to her, to have 
either of these presented as incitements to good 
behaviour. Mrs. Evelyn would still threaten her 
with a protracted term of involuntary servitude, 
when the quiet curl of Maida's lip alone showed 
how much the threat affected her. 

She had dropped into a peculiar position in the 
family — a position of her own forming, one on 
which her fellow-servants dared as little to encroach 
as to question its existence, though to spite it they 
persecuted her in every possible way ; a position 
which her master did not choose to molest for all 
his wife's protestations against convict upstartism.

* What are you about there, Gwynnham, idling 
your time, or rather my time ?* 

* Bother it, Clara I I wish • you'd let her alone ; 
see, she is coming over, and there'll be a row, and 
I shall have to scold her, which you know I detest' 

*OhI you needn't fear, my dear; she bears 
things a great deal better than she used to.' 

^ For that reason she should have less to bear ; 
iherey I shall leave you to finish what you have 
begun ; but mind, I'll not be appealed to.' 

Mr. Herbert, who had been read ng at the table, 
looked anxiously up as Maida mounted the steps 
and stood in the balcony. 

* Did you call me, ma'am ?' 

Mrs. Evelyn, annoyed at her husband's tenacity, 
snappishly asked — 

' What business have you in the garden at this 
hour ?' 

* I was tending my flowers.' 

*Then you ought to have been scouring your 
knives.' 

* I have done them already, ma'am.' 
' Then you've your piaster's boots.' 

* They are also cleaned, ma'am.' 

* Then your sewing.' 

* I have none, ma'am.' 

* Such nonsense ! you know that's a story ; 
there's always plenty of work in a large house.' 

Maida's lip quivered and her eye flashed. 



408 THE BROAB ARROW. 

' Now I hope you are not going to be insolent. 
I haven't seen tliat face put up for a long time : I 
was in hopes yon had left it off since you professed 
reli^oQ.' 

Maida fixed her eye hai^htily on her mistress, 
who went on to say — 

'The thing is, I plainly see, we've been too 
indulgent to you ; you foi^et what you are ; and 
that'll never do : your own will mustn't be allowed 
as it has been.' 

' I pray Grod that my will may never again be 
my guide, ma'am. To be left to my own devices 
would be to be given over to evil,' exclaimed 
Kaida, the fire fading ^om her glance, and an 
expression of pain gathering on her countenance. 

' What does the woman mean ?' turning to Mr. 
Herbert; he arose and approached the window. 

' Once, ma'am, my own will was the rale of my 
life, now God's word directs my actions, or I could 




MAIDA. 409 

woman without such a to-do, and that after I have 
kept you three years and a half.' 

^ I am ready to fulfil your wishes, ma'am I' said 
Maida, meekly. 

* Go along, Gwynnham I I haven't patience with 
such nonsense^ makipg a goodness out of your 
duty, which you either must fulfil or get into 
trouble ; you know it's only because Mr. Herbert 
lA listening to you that you talk such cant.' 

* I acknowledge it, ma'am. Had not my master'^ 
reproachful look reminded me of the solemn vow 
I made, I should not have borne with you, for 
grace has not changed my nature though it has 
subdued my temper.' 

The calm dignity of her voice and manner at 
onciB irritated and awed Mrs. Evelyn. She hastily 
replied — 

* Well, I don't believe in convict piety ; go and 
act it, then perhaps I may.' 

* Where shall I find the needlework, ma'am ?* 

* If you can't get it without troubling me leave 
it alone.' 

* Then I may continue my work in the garden ?' 

* If the master chooses ; but remember I don't 
choose to have you speak of the flowers as yourSf^ 
it's a piece of insolence in a convict that I cannot 
stand.' 

Maida stared. 

* You did I you said you were tending your 



410 THE BROAD ARROW. 

flowers. If the master allows you to work in the 
gardeD that does oot make l^em yours.' 

* I beg your pardon, ma'am, the flowers I spoke 
of are mine.' 

* You must have stolen them from us then ?' 

* I broi^t them from Port Arthur. They 
were dear — ' 

She stopped and casta look at Mr. Herbert, 
who averted his head for an instant, and then, with 
a smile, inquired — 

' My Emmeline's ? I must go aud see them.* 
Mr. Herbert went out and Maida prepared to 
follow him, but her mistress called her. 

* Gwynnham, come back, you bold woman, I'm 
ashamed of you : do you think a fetiier — ' 

Mr. Herbert turned, and in a decided voice, 
bade Maida accompany him. 
She hesitated. 
' You permit her, Clara ?' 




MAID A. 411 

* Ah, sir, the victory being imperfect the conso- 
lation can be but slight/ 

* The time of perfect conquest is not yet, Maida, 
nor will it be till we lay our bodies in the dust ; not 
till then may we put oflF our armour. The conflict is 
one of flesh against spirit and only to end when our 
course is finished ; then, Maida, may it be ours to 
triumph with the apostle, ^^ I have fought the good 
fight." ' 

* O, sir I Mr. Herbert, you ?' 
Mr. Herbert smiled sadly. 

* Why not me, Maida ? Do you suppose I have 
no warfare to accomplish ?' 

* Oh, yes, a mighty warfare, but for Christ, not 
for yourself.* 

* Mr. Herbert shook his head. 

* Maida, my battle is with myself more than you 
know of, the last enemy to be destroyed is self.' 

A look of perfect delight irradiated Maida's 
face, and clasping her hands, she cried — 

* Oh ! then / well may struggle on : if t/ou have 
conflict, how should not I ?' 

But the bright glow of pleasure vanished. She 
observed Mr. Herbert press down his eyes with his 
two fingers, in a manner that indicated mental 
pain; his lips moved, then removing his hand 
from his brow he fixed his eye steadily on her — 

' Ay, Maida, flesh and blood cannot inherit the 
kingdom of God.* 



412 THE BROAB ARROW. 

* I wish you could have a little rest,, sir ; your 
duties wear you out' 

But Mr. Herbert did not seem to hear h», 'he 
was deep in thought, aud she heffltated whether to 
leave him or not She stood still, leaving him 
to advance alone : this arrested his attention. He 
turned suddenly to her, and in a quick, earaest 
voice, said — 

' Maida, one thing disappoints me. The im- 
pression you made on my mind the first time I 
visited you in prison has inereased with my know- 
let^ of you, until it has ^most become a convic- 
tion, and I am disappointed, that with your open 
profession of religion, yira. have made no acknow- 
ledgment of that which, as a Christian woman, 
should trouble you—r' 

' Sir ! what do you mean ? explain yourself.' 

Drawn to her fiill height, she was the Maida oX 
olden days, but only for a moment. 




MAIDA. 413 

cared for you ; as one wHo would deliver his own 
soul by speaking faithfully to you/ 

Maida trembled in every limb. Mr. Herbert 
laid his hand upon her shoulder, when, as though 
the touch had paralysed her, she became rigid and 
statue-like. 

* Have you no secret, which, as a Christian 
woman, you have no right to keep to yourself?' 

She stood speechless, dreading yet breathless to 
hear more. 

* No secret for the preservation of which you 
stake your peace of mind ?' 

Maida tried to shake off her terror, but it was 
impossible; making a desperate effort, she ex- 
claimed— 

* Sir, you speak in parables. What Hght have 
you to try to frighten me thus ?' 

* I have the right of God ! By His permission, 
and as His minister, I ask you, have you no con- 
fession which should long since have been 
jnade ?' 

* I understood, sir, our church had no priestly 
confession. I thought a confession to God was 
sufficient.' 

There was a slight sneer in her tone. 

' A confession to God without a corresponding 
action to our fellow-creatures is useless — it is more 
than useless — it is a spiritual lieV 

* Are there no occasions, sir, on which we may 



414 THE BBOAD AKROW. 

throw ourselves on God's mercy without expoeuig 
ourselves to man's weak judgment' 

' Doubtless, God searches the heart-, but you 
misapprehend me perhaps ? Simply, I would say, 
it is no use to kneel to our heavenly Father, and 
say, I have sinned against heaven and in Thy 
sight, and then, arising, continue that siu we have 
just confessed — confession and restitution must 
succeed each other ; I deal iaithfully with you.' 

* And you must be yet more faithful if you 
would have me profit hy your candour, sir. I do 
not understand anything: you have spoken, save 
that you are torturing me ; yes, by cruel d^rees.' 

' Then I will be plain, Maida.' 

She longed to say. Oh don't, don't, but she said 
just die reverse. 

' I pray you go on, sir.' 

*. In the days of your rebellion to God and man, 
I perceived you hid some mystery in your heart; 




MAID A. 415 

' As a Christian yearning for peace of mind, it is 
necessary to yourself^ Maida I believe me you can 
neither enjoy the peace of God nor communion 
with Him whilst you are not true to yourself. You 
start, but I have told you before, that much of my 
life has been spent in hearing tales of sorrow from 
my bond brethren and sisters. I have heard of 
miseries that have wrung my soul, — of crimes which 
have revolted me. I have heard of infatuations 
and of fallacies that have excited my pity, of in- 
justices which have called forth my indignation ; 
but amidst all these, I have found that mystery is 
never used where it is not needed, that there is 
never mental (mind I do not say spiritual) conflict 
without a cause, a something yet undiscovered by 
law or unthought of by justice.' 

* Sir, pardon me, I cannot let you proceed, 
have never troubled you with my story, how, then, 
can you know either that I have wrapped myself 
m mystery or experienced mental conflict ?' 

She tried to speak calmly, but her voice 
shook. 

* Maida, do not deceive yourself, your whole 
transported life has been one long conflict ; eyes 
less watchful than mine have discovered that ; / 
have seen far more.' 

* Sir, give me but one instance, that I may 
know what you mean ; this is very cruel.' 

* So must ever be the piercing asunder of the 



416 THE BROAb ARROW, 

soul and spirit, for tiie clearer discovery of die in- 
tents and purposes of the heart.' 

A new light burst upon Maida. It was as the 
light which struck Saul to the earth, and from it 
came forth the question-^ 

' Is it a lie ? Canst thou brave Giod with a lie V 

She could have fallen to the grouad ; a chiUing 
.sensation oppressed her, but she battled with it 
and repeated — 

* An instance, sir ?' 

' Do you remember that night in which you 
came to my room for writing materials ? was tha% 
DO conflict that night? no mystery of pain and 
grief that turned those few brief hours into an age 
of suffering,. and ere morning added years to your 
appearance ?' 

' You must have watched me very narrowly, 
sir?' 

Without noticing these words, Mr. Herbert drew 




MAIDA. 417 

written to Norwell. It was the very one she had 
considered most violent and earnest — the very 
one that showed too much of her feelings and 
sorrows ; fortunately it mentioned not his name ; 
the cold sir, at the commencement, alone told that 
it was addressed to a man. 

The writing swam before her eyes; she had 
been pale before, now the pallor of her cheek was 
deathlike, livid ; but suddenly a deep purple 
colour rushed over her whole face, and she clenched 
her hand upon Mr. Herbert's arm. 

* Tell me, sir, how came you by that paper ? 
I defy the right of any one upon earth to interfere 
with my private actions, harmless to every one but 
myself; by what means did you possess yourself 
of it ? I insist on being satisfied.' 

* I will satisfy you, Maida. The night referred 
to I could not rest, your whole appearance alarmed 
me ; now I may tell you, I feared you were medi- 
tating suicide ; I passed the night in prayer for 
you. In the early morning I heard you leave the 
house ; I followed you, and by the way I picked 
up this paper, dropped by you in your flight, and 
since carefully preserved by me as a proof.' 

Maida interrupted him. 

* Sir, you needed no proof; yourself first told 
me of a seducer, and I have never sought to hide 
ray shame !' 

* You are impatient, Maida. Shall I tell you 

VOL. II. 2 E 



418 THE BROAD ARROW. 

why I preserve this paper ? as a proof of what has 
long been establish^l in my mind, that there is 
some grand mistake in your conviction. I do not 
believe you wbolly guilty of the crimes for which 
you are in this colony.' 

' Then why have you not made your droughts 
public, sir ? an endeavour should be made to clear 
an innocent person !' 

There was a strangeness of manner and voice in 
the enunciation of this, that made Mr. Herbert 
look hastily at her. 

' Because, Maida, the time has not fully 
come.' 

' It has not !' (the same strange voice). ' Sir, you 
would be deemed a mere enthusiast to found a 
plea of innocence on the ravings of a disappointed 
woman — a felon maddened by her punishment as 
all felons are. But I must leave you, sir ; I am in 
pain, great pain. My heart beats as though it

you walk up and down the garden. She really 
seemed to talk to you as her equal.' 

* / beg to renounce all claim to either amuse- 
ment or annoyance on the subject,' said Mr. Evelyn. 

* Yes ; but, my dear, don't you think it makes 
Gwynnham vain, and the others jealous ? People 
will begin to talk by-and-by.' 

* What do you say to that Herbert ?' asked Mr. 
Evelyn, putting up his eyebrows. 

' Persons may talk of me as they please,' he 
answered quietly. 

* Well, I dorCt knowy when she gets her ticket,' 
laughed Uncle Ev, unable to resist an opportunity 
of quizzing. But his brother bit his lip with so 
grieved an expression, at the same time sending 
him so reproachful a glance, which seemed to say, 

* And you too ?' that he changed his manner and 
inquired — 

* What were you talking about ? I'm always 
glad to see you pitching it into that Maida^ she 
gets on so well after!' (Then more seriously) 

* There is a great change in her, the lion has become 
a lamb.' 

* My dear, she looked anything but lamblike 
just now. You should have seen her ! a tigress — / 
should say,' replied Mrs. Evelyn. 

Maida excused herself from attending prayer 
that night ; and long after all the others were in 
bed, Mr. Herbert, who still read in his study, 



420 THE BROAD ABROW. 

heard her moving about up stairs. The next 
morning, when she had removed the breaki'ast, 
she turned quickly to her master and said — 

' Sir, I am ill ; I must go to the hospital.' 

' Oh, pish, pish, Maida ; get your mistress to 
give you a little gr^ory, and you'll be r^ht to- 
morrow f 

' I wish to go, if you please, sir ; I am ill.' 

' Well then put on your bonnet, and Fll take 
you to Dr. Lamb, he'll soon settle the point' 

' My dear, if Maida's ill she had better go to 
the hospital ; I am quite pleased to] see her so 
reasonable as to request it,' urged Mrs. Evelyn. 

Mr. Evelyn nodded. 

' Bonnet, Maida, bonnet,* and both mistress and 
servant knew it was useless to contend. 

' Just tell me what you complain of^ and then 
make haste and be ready.' 

' I am only sensible of a strange fulness at i 




MAIDA. 42 1 

Leaving her master she went straight to Mr. 
Herbert's study, and scarcely closed the door ere 
she said — 

^ Sir, do you mean to say that I cannot have 
God's forgiveness unless I confess my history ?' 

Taken by surprise, Mr. Herbert started. 

* I dare to say no such a thing, Maida !' 

* What do you say then, sir ?* 

* That you cannot expect the Christian's peace 
while you do not act the repentant's part' 

* Then peace of mind is all I shall lose by tell- 
ing my tale to no one but God ?' 

* This is not the proper way to talk of subjects 
so deeply important : if you wish to speak of these 
things, first seek the Holy Spirit's aid by prayer.' 

' I have been praying all night, sir, and I am 
driven to distraction by the alternate light and 
darkness which follows me. As to propriety of 
way, opportunity must sanctify that ; I may not 
have another.' 

*What do you mean, Maida?' exclaimed Mr. 
Herbert, rising; *your words are strange, your 
manner stranger.' 

* I am ill, sir ; Mr. Evelyn is going to take me 
to the doctor, and then I mean to enter the hos- 
pital.' 

* I'll speak to my brother.' 

He went towards the door ; she stretched her 
arms towards him. 



THE BROAD ARROW. 



'One moment, sir. If you will wait for my 
dying hour, then shall you hear all you seek to 
know ; till then, since peace of mind is all I must 
forego in keeping my secret to myself I commit 
myself to God, and resign my present p^ace od 
your solemn promise, that in so doing I shall not 
resign my eternal happiness, for that no mortal has 
a right to do, and I have no wish to resign it 
Mind, sir t I rest on your promise that I shall not 
lose heaven by my silence.' 

'Maida, Maida!' cried Mr. Herbert; but she 
had left the room. As she had her bundle to pre- 
pare, and as Mr. Evelyn was impatiently calling 
for her, he had only to return to his study to pray 
for his convict chaise. 

Dr. Lamb prescribed perfect rest with quiet; 
and strongly advised her to enter the hospital 
He privately told Mr. Evelyn that she was in a 
very broken state of health ; en the morrow he

worse paw than yours I shall count myself a happy 
man. Mind one thing, Gwynnham — just this: I 
shall be as glad to see you back as I am sorry to 
send you in. You know we married men can't be 
Comptrollers-general, or you should have been laid 
up at my house.' 

He shook her hand the second time, and walked 
down the path ; then turning, he called out — 

* I'll send Mr. Herbert to see you on Thursday ; 
you'll like that, shan't you ?' 

She was ordered to Ward No. 4, there to 
behold the Excrescence still bearing the iron 
rod. 

There was a grin of satisfaction in her teeth as 
she hailed Maida back to her clutches. 

* Why, woman, what ails you ? death's in your 
very face ; are you come in to die ?' 

She should have known Maida better than to 
suppose this apostrophe would terrify her. 

Seating herself on the bottom of a stretcher, 
Maida replied — 

* Nurse, if you can tell me that you see death in 
my face, you will tell me better news than I have 
heard for years.' 

* You don't b'lieve in hell, I suppose.' 

*Yes, and in heaven, too; and. Nurse, I can 
say from my soul I hope to see you there,' 

The Excrescence grmned incredulity and malice, 
and then sniffed. 



424 THE BROAD AHROW. 

* Yes'! I think if ever you gets there, you'll 
find me there before you.' 

Durini5 Maida's absence the Nurse's ill-will had 
increased rather than diminished, the former having 
resolutely forbade her her master's kitchen, into 
which she had several times endeavoured to intrude 
under pretence of visiting her old patient In this 
way she carried on an extensive traffic among the 
pantries of masters, owning former hospitallers of 
Ward No. 4. 

Maida tried to avoid quarrellii^, but in vab; 
something occurred in the course of the evening 
that aroused her anger and forced her into a 
dispute. Nurse was a little the worse for drink 
(how bad, then, must she have been?), and, 
clenching her fist at Maida, she swore a fearful oath 
to the effect that, instead of closing her eyes and 
folding her arms if she died within her reach, she 
would make her a corpse so frightful as to make 




maida/ 425 

her to sleep semi-recumbently, and received the 

pleasant answer — 

^ She might sleep in hell if she liked.' 
'Mrs. Cott came round showing her kindly face 

at the bedside of every poor weary patient. When 

she arrived at Maida's she exclaimed — 

* Go for the doctor, this woman's worse !' 

The house-doctor came and prescribed for her ; 
he requested that some one should sit up with her, 
and that he should be called if certain symptoms 
appeared. 

But sitting up with a convict is a dissimilar 
operation to sitting up with a free patient ; there 
is an obvious want of that comforting confusion, of 
soft treadings, murmuring voices, and thoughtful 
appliances which love alone can produce. There 
may be muffled steppings to and fro, but then list 
slippers and not affection is the cause — list must be 
quiet. Surly and gaunt the Excrescence took her 
place near Maida. Then, throwing off her cap, 
and rumpling her grizzled hair, she became, in the 
dim light of the lamp, the ex-lunatic of the trans- 
port magnified into double deformity. 

* Nurse, do you think Mrs. Cott would send for 
Mr. Herbert Evelyn ?' 

^ I am not going to try ; you must bide without 
the parson for to-night' 

^ Nurse, I think I'm dying ; I feel so strange.' 

* The devil may care, I don't. He's more con- 
cerned in it than i^e or any one else/ 



426 TEE BROAD ARROW. 

Maida tried once more. 

* Nurse, do send for Mr. Herbert ; I'm sure he'll 
come. I must, must see him.' 

* If you are worse I'U send for the doctor, and 
nobody else.' 

All was silent for a while. 

* I'm dying [' whispered Kaida ; but the Nurse 
heard not, she was heary with drink bartered 
from the patients; and soon her thick, bull-like 
snore was the only lullaby that soothed the dying 
convict to her last rest. 

For Maida Gwynnham was dying! Had the 
Nurse been awake she might have heard a low, 
gui^ling sound working its way up Maida's chest ; 
she m^ht have seen her raise her hands and gently 
shut her own eyes ; and then she might have seen 
her arms fold upon her breast. Ere long she 
might have seen the stream of life ooze, crimson, 
from Maida's mouth, dyeing her pillow i

Captain laughingly says there must be a Jonah on 
board ; and as he speaks, his eye rests upon a tall 
figure wrapped in a mourning cloak, standing aloof 
from all, gloomy and taciturn, watching the con- 
trary sea. The deep-set eye of the stranger in its 
turn raises itself, and fixes on him a long, delibe- 
rative stare. 

* No oflence, I hope,' says the Captain. 

The eyes drop quickly back to their watch of 
the striving waves. 

* Well now, I shouldn't like such a welcome as 
that every day,' thought the Captain, turning with 
a sense of uneasiness from the yellow of those 
bloodshot balls. 

But Nofwell knows not that he has turned such 
a look on the speaker ; it came up from the dark- 
ness of his soul, and unaware wandered in the 
direction of the voice that had uttered the name of 
the miscreant prophet. 

Norwell knows not that he has become a bye- 
word on board, nor that he is a marked object to 
all — not so much by his mourning garb, which 
proclaims him a desolated man, as by a forbidding 
investiture of countenance, which hints at a troubled 
conscience. He has been shut up four months 
with his fellow-passengers, yet has made no friend, 
formed no acquaintance. 

The children have shunned him; the sailors 
declare he is bewitched. With one consent the

wind side of the poop has been accorded him, and 
the Bound of his measured tread has become an 
accustomed sound on board. It ceases not in storm 
or calm, in the tropical heat or the cold of the 
Cape ; he seems to he waiting out a penance, which 
he dare not stop at the peril of his soul. 

The next day Mr. Herbert sat at his seat, poring 
. as usual over his book, when a lai^ letter was 
handed him. It was only O.P.S.O., and could 
therefore be nothing requiring immediate attention ; 
he laid it down. "When the tea was brought in he 
took the letter and opened it 

' Herbert, what is it ?' cried Mrs. Evelyn. ' My 
dear, he's faint.' 

But Mr. Herbert, waving his h nd, signified No. 
Mr. Evelyn came round and picked up the paper 
his brother had dropped. It was as official 
despatch irom H. M. G. Hospital. The brothers 
exchanged glances of surprise. Tears sufiused Mr.

But the vessel is at last in harbour. The port-

are free to land. Boats in all (Ureetions push from 
the wharf to bring back their living freight. The 
poop is quickly deserted of all, save one passei^er, 
and that is Captain Norwell. It seems he does 
not know his own mind, for more .violently than

ing to set him down at the Macquarie Hotel, which 
having done, he flops. 

* Straight from home, sir ? Fine country this 
for them that's free.' 

Norwell shudders. Simple as are these words, 
they tell him he has reached his goal, and. is once 
more near Maida. 

* Very like, sir, you'd find a drive round agree- 
able. I'd learn you up a bit of what's worths— the 
gentry in general likes it' 

Anything is preferable to being left to himself, 
so Norwell re-enters the cab, and Sanders drives 
slowly on, stopping occasionally to point out sur^ 
rounding beauties. 

* The gaol, sir. Rare wall that. Darned fool 
that would dim' 'em.' 

The bloodshot eyes frown on the heavy wall. 

* Canaries, sir, just fledged.' 

Norwell looks up^ but the butt-end of the whip 
is pointing dovm at a road-gang clanking by in 
their yellow clothes.

He's he that frisked the Bank.' 

Norwell looks, and the man exhibited shrinks 
agonisedly, , perceiving that he is the object of 
attention

way?' 

* 'Es, sure— all alike — why they'd clap them 
there irons and things on you, if you waa govem- 
ment' 

' G'up here V 

The harnessed men had stopped to take breath ; 
at this word of command they trot off again, and 
Norwell groans aloud. 

' Prisoners' hospital, sir.' 

* Go on, can't you I' 

Sanders obeys, but again out goes the whip, as 
they turn up Campbell Street. 

' Prisoners' barracks, sir — us calls it Tench.'

buildings that tempts Norwell. With an abrupt 
No, he throws himself moodily back into the seat. 
Pulling the check-string shortly after, he asks 
where he must inquire to find any particular 
convict 

* Govemnaent books, sir ; 'bliged to report our- 
selves once in six months ; or mayhap you'll find 
your man at Tench. Can I assist you, sir ? The 
new gentry'^ generally got a prisoner they wants to 
find out for somebody at home. Iv'e helped out a 
lot' 

But learning that it is a woman Norwell is in 
search of, Sanders advises him to try first at the 
Brickfields. To* that dep6t they accordingly drive, 
and are there told that Martha Grylls, under the 
alias of Maida Gwynnham, is at a Mr. Evelyn's, 
the Lodge. 

* Darned ! my old place !' cries Robert. * Then 
it's Madda Gy wnnham you'm after ! an old mate 
of mine — a darned fine woman ; but she's had no 
end of trouble. Her and my wife is fine to- 
gether.' 

They arrive at the Lodge, and to Sanders' per- 
plexities, the gentleman will have him ring at the 
back-door, notwithstanding that he is warned of 
the certain salute there awaiting every unfortunate 
interloper from the mouth of Jags, the terrier. 

' Take your fare, and leave me. I'll find my

ring. 

' If it's Madda you'm after, she's an old sweet- 
heart of mine, and very like she'd be pleased for 
me to bide 'long with you, to ase the shyness a 
hit' 

* Curse the mau ! How he worries me 1 Go 
about your business.' 

And aggrieved, thoi^h Korwell has given him 
half a sovereign, Sanders drives slowly off. 

As the key turned in the gate, Norwell caught 
hold of the handle. What if it should be Maida 
herself? His heart sickened, and his brain swam 
dizzily. But it was a man who appeared. 

' Kound to the other door, sir.' 

' No, I only want to inquire for a person called 
Gwynnham, said to be at a Mr. Evelyn's.' 

' This is it. but Gwyniiham went away herefrom

^ CoDfocind die man ! Will yoa admit me or 
not?'^ 

A gentleman who had just entered without 
hindrance tamed and looked on him, as from his 
clenched teeth hissed these angry words. 

^Who are yoa hannting me thos?* thon^t 
Norwell. When meeting Mr Herbert's eye, a 
rush of memcny broug^ back to him die English 
prison and the scene at the railway stadon« 

^ That man blends widi my fate. I hate the 
sight of him. I haven't been a day in the place 
ere he rises, like a ^lost, before me.' 

He tamed to the porter, and asked — 

^ Who's that jost gone op ?' 

^ Farscm ETclyiu Ton can follow him, if you 
please, sir.' 

The porter had taken Kr. Herbert's look as 
intended tor himsdi^ and hastily granted a per- 
mission that odierwise mi^t have been forced from 
him ; for twice again had Mr. Herbert turned, and 
each time the offidal appropriated the lode Nor- 
well waited and waited, but no one appeared to 
inquire his message. He did not wish to ring, for 
fear he should re^ncoonter Mr. Herbert. 

At last a woman passed down the stairs. He 
beckoned her oot, and made known his request. 
She pulled at an exiisreseence on her under lip, and 
seemed to think he asked impossible things.

• Quite contrairey to all rule, sir. If I'd ever 
such a mind to oblige you, there'd be do gettiDg at 
the key — and at this time too !' 

' Key ! Do they lock her up ?' muttered Nor- 
well. 

' Stop where you are, sir, saA I'll be back 
presently.' 

There was something in her manner which gave 
him to understand that her services were purchase- 
able. 

* If it's money that you want — ' He said 
enough. The Excrescence was his humble ser-

After a few moments' absence, she again ap- 
peared, but from a different door. She signalised 
Captain Norwell forward, and then whispered — 

' Can't be a better time, sir. The key's in the 
door, and there's nobody about Come along, sir.' 
She laid her finger on the excrescence, and witli a

A cold tremor ran through him. He could not 
advance. 

* You don't mind going in alone, sir ? I can't 
for my life go in too. If I was caught 'twould be 
certain trouble. That's her over there, right along 
by the wall. Shut your eyes a minute, and then 
open them, and you'll see famous.' 

Norwell did so. The outer day excluded, a 
long line of dusky light stretched athwart the 
room from the bull's eye, and rested on a row of 
narrow benches. As his eye gradually accommo- 
dated itself to the misty twilight, a strange horror 
rooted him to the spot. Suspense and dread 
smote heavily at his heart. He scarcely dared to 
look to the right hand or to the left 

A flash of a terrible truth struck through him as 
a bench shaped itself into a coffin, and then another, 
and another, and another loomed out of the dim 
forms before him, imtil he found himself surrounded 
by coffins of every size ; but they were empty, 
waiting for their prey. 

In unconscious terror he advanced, 

* Oh, God ! Maida, are you here ?' 

He spread his arms wildly around, groping — for 
what? 

From without, the Nurse pulled back a second 
bull's eye ; another line of light rushed in, 
scattering the darkness before it, and made way 



438 T^B BKOAD ARROTV^. 

towards Norwell. He need look no further, for 
Maida was at his side. His long black cloak 
swept over the coffin. 

' Sir ! Sir ! do 'e come out, it's mortal cold in 
here,' at last murmured the Nurse, tired of wailing 
for the gentleman. But he neither moved nor 
answered ; she was getting frightened ; llie tall 
black figure keeping silent watch in the dead-house 
was enough to see ; it aroused every superstitious 
feeling in her wicked heart ; but more terrible to 
see was the speechless despair of that tranced face, 
she would rather look at the corpse than it. 

' Sir, sir, do 'e come along out,' her teeth began 
to chatter. 

The dull yellow of his bloodshot eye turned 
slowly upon her. 

' Woman, this is a foul trick to play upon me.' 

But how guilty soever elsewhere, here Nurse 
was innocent. Taking for granted that he knew of

man intently watching, but Norwell saw nothing 
save the one object before him, every power of his 
soul was harrowed on it. Harrowed 1 was there 
aught in those noble features to alarm ? 

The coarse envelopments that shrouded Maida 
disfigured her not As she lay there she had 
never looked more beautiful,— -of what loveliness 
pain and sorrow had deprived her had been re- 
stored by death, 

* Could I but cry aloud would she raise those 
lashes and speak forgiveness to me,' groaned Nor- 
well. 

No, no, closed, ever closed those depths so rare, 

and dream-like in their beauty; so brilliant and 
quenchless in their fire ; they may not bless thee 
now ; rejected once, they mock thee evermore. 
The line of light was obstructed by an approach- 
ing figure that had emerged fi*om the darkness of 
the remote corner. Norwell's thoughts were still 
at work too busily, confusedly, poignantly, to 
notice it. The figure stood by him, still he ob- 
served it not, till a calm, low voice thrilled through 
him and made him start, again to meet Mr. Her- 
bert's piercing gaze. 

* Her first rest, sir !' he pointed to the coffin. 
Spellbound, Norwell had no choice but to face 
his adversary. 

' Who are you, sir, in God's name ?' 



440 THE BROAD AEROW. 

There was no defiance in the speech, it was 
spoken tremulously, almost beseechingly. 

' As you will answer at the dreadful day of 
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be 
disclosed, I adjure you tell me what you know 
of this woman,' exclaimed Mr. Herbert, letting 
his hand fall audibly on the side of the coffin. 

' Sir, rather tell me what tou know of her ?' 
said Norwell, shrinking back a step or two. 

* I know she died a victim to some base man ! 
and I would seek that man, sir, and show him 
what a destruction he has wrought. Would God 
I could bring him here, and face him with his 
crime I' 

' You have your desire, sir. Behold the 
manl' 

There was a stem despair in his bloodshot eye, 
as folding his arms, he drew his cloak about him, 
and waited what Mr. Herbert should say ; but

that every dissolute man could stand where you 
do now ; could look around this house and count' 
the coffins yawning for their victims ; for here, sir, 
are many who had been still in peace and health 
but for the seducer's art/ 

* Do you know no more than tJiaiy sir? Tell 
me, what know you more of me ?' said Norwell, 
huskily ; the bloodshot eyes lured darkly, terribly, 
and he almost stayed his breath to hear the 
answer. 

' I know where your crime commenced towards 
this woman, and there it ends. But what inter- 
vening guilt has helped to fill your measure of 
sin, I cannot tell, and now before the living God 
— ^before this murdered woman, I charge you reveal 
what more you know of her.* 

Norwell laid his forefinger on Maida's hand, and 
murmured, as if in a dream — 

* She lived, she suffered, she died for-m^j and in 
my stead; go and tell them so, and bid 'them find 
in me, Captain Norwell, all they sought of guilt in 
her. Chains should never have galled these 

hands.' 

The bloodshot eyes started wildly, and he broke 
into a low, hissing laugh. 

* Were these hajiAs made for murder! then 
there is murder in heaven, and I shall go there as 
well as she.' 



442 THE BROAD ARROW. 

His voice gui^led in bis throat aod he fell un- 
conscious to the ground. 

« • • • 

We would not have you follow him, his dark, 
despairing eye would haunt you evermore. His 
oft-repeated question none can answer ; he would 
ask it you, for his voice finds but oue utterance, 
and that is full of woe. 

' Is she coining ? Maida, Maida, is it you ? 
O God ! O God ! It was I ! It was I !' 

The door of his cell draws back and he glooms 
out upon you as a spirit lost. One alone can 
soothe him; one before whose tall and solemn 
figure the raving maniac cowers into silence, until, 
reassured by Mr. Herbert's sad but kindly voice, 
the bloodshot eyes look up, and the Ups assume a 
murmured wail. 

'OGod! OGod!' 
When Mr, Herbert secretly pleads that the wail
