2 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

receiving and executing orders with that air of pro- 
found importance of which only really first-class 
waiters have the secret. The atmosphere was an 
atmosphere of serenity and repose, characteristic of 
the Grand Babylon. It seemed impossible that 
anything could occur to mar the peaceful, aristo- 
cratic monotony of existence in that perfecdy- 
managed establishment. Yet on that night was to 
happen the mightiest upheaval that the Grand 
Babylon had ever known. 

* Yes, sir ? ' repeated Jules, and this time there 
was a shade of august disapproval in his voice : it 
was not usual for him to have to address a customer 
twice. 

* Oh I • said the alert, middle-aged man, looking 
up at length. Beautifully ignorant of the identity 
of the great Jules, he allowed his grey eyes to 
twinkle as he caught sight of the expression on the 
waiter's face. * Bring me an Angel Kiss.' 

* Pardon, sir ? ' 

* Bring me an Angel Kiss, and be good enough 
to lose no time.' 

* If it's an American drink, I fear we don't 
keep it, sir.' The voice of Jules fell icily distinct, 
and several men glanced round uneasily, as if to 
deprecate the slightest disturbance of their calm. 
The appearance of the person to whom Jules was 
speaking, however, reassured them somewhat, for 



THE MILLIONAIRE AND THE WAITER 3 

he had aU the look of that expert, the traveUed 
Englishman, who can differentiate between one 
hotel and another by instinct, and who knows at 
once where he may make a fiiss with propriety, 
and where it is advisable to behave exactly as at 
the club. The Grand Babylon was a hotel in 
whose smoking-room one behaved as though one 
was at one's club. 

* I didn't suppose you did keep it, but you can 
mix It, I guess, even in this hotel.' 

• This isn't an American hotel, sir.* The cal- 
culated insolence of the words was cleverly masked 
beneath an accent of humble submission. 

The alert, middle-aged man sat up straight, 
and gazed placidly at Jules, who vas pulling his 
famous red side-whiskers. 

'Get a liqueur glass,' he said, half curtly and 
half with good-humoured tolerance, *pour into 
it equal quantities of maraschino cream and crdme 
de menthe. Don't stir it ; don't shake it. Bring 
It to me. And, I say, tell the bar-tender ' 

* Bar-tender, sir ? ' 

*Tell the bar-tender to make a note of the 
recipe, as I shall probably want an Angel Kiss 
every evening before dinner so long as this weather 
lasts.* 

* I will send the drink to you, sir,* said Jules 
distantly. That was his parting shot, by which

he indicated that he was not as other waiters arc, 
and that any person who treated him with disre- 
spect did so at his own peril. 

A few minutes later, while the alert, middle- 
aged man was tasting the Angel Kiss, Jules sat in 
conclave with Miss Spencer, who had charge of the 
bureau of the Grand Babylon. This bureau was 
a foirly large chamber, with two sliding glass parti- 
tions which overlooked the entrance-hall and the 
smoking-room. Only a small portion of the 
clerical work of the great hotel was performed 
there. The place served chiefly as the lair of 
Miss Spencer, who was as well known and as 
important as Jules himself. Most modern hotels 
have a male clerk cO superintend the bureau. 
But the Gtund Babylon went its own way. Miss 
Spencer had been bureau clerk almost since the 
Grand Babylon had first raised its massive chimneys 
to heaven, and she remained in her place despite 
the vagaries of other hotels. Always admirably 
dressed in plain black silk, with a small diamond 
brooch, immaculate wristbands, and frizzed yellow 
hair, she looked now just as she had looked an 
mdefinite number of years ago. Her age— none 
knew it, save herself and perhaps one other, and 
none cared. The gracious and alluring contours 
of her figure were irreproachable ; and in the 
evenings she was a useful ornament of which any

Miss Spencer smiled grimly in response. The 
nouon of «ferring to Theodore Racksole as < ^ 
New Yorker appeuied to her sense of humour 
. «nse m which she was not entirely deficient! 
She knew, of course, and she knew that Jules 
knew, that this Theodore Racksole must be the 
unjque and only Theodore Racksole, the third 
nchest man .n the United States, and therefore

probably in the world. Nevertheless she ranged 
herself at once on the side of Jules. Just as there 
was only one Racksole, so there was only one 
Jules, and Miss Spencer instinctively shared the 
latter's indignation at the spectacle of jny person 
whatsoever, millionaire or Emperor, presuming to 
demand an * Angel Kiss,' that unrespectable con- 
coction of maraschino and cream, within the 
precincts of the Grand Babylon. In the world of 
hotels it was currently stated that, next to the 
proprietor, there were three gods at the Grand 
Babylon— Jules, the head waiter, Miss Spencer, 
and, most powerful of all, Rocco, the renowned 
chef, who earned two thousand a year, and had 
a chalet on the Lake of Lucerne. All the great 
hotels in Northumberland Avenue and on the 
Thames Embankment had tried to get Rocco 
away from the Grand Babylon, but without suc- 
cess. Rocco was well aware that even he could rise 
no higher than the maltre d'hotel of the Grand 
Babylon, which, though it never advertised itself, 
and didn't belong to a limited company, stood an 
easy first among the hotels of Europe— first in 
expensiveness, first in exclusiveness, first in that 
mysterious quality known as * style.' 

Situated on the Embaiikment, the Grand 
Babylon, despite its noble proportions, was some- 
what dwarfed by several colossal neighbours. It 



THE MILLIONAIRE AND THE WAITER 7 

had but three hundred and fifty rooms, whereas 
there are two hotels within a quarter of a mile 
with six hundred and four hundred rooms respec- 
tively. On the other hand, the Grand Babylon 
was the only hotel in London with a genuine 
separate entrance for Royal visitors constantly in 
use. The Grand Babylon counted that day wasted 
on which it did not entertain, at the lowest, a 
German prince or the Maharajah of some Indian 
State. When Filix Babylon — ^after whom, and 
not with any reference to London's nickname, the 
hotel was christened— when Fdix Babylon founded 
the hotel in 1869 he had set himself to cater for 
Royalty, ar.d that was the secret of his triumphant 
eminence. The son of a rich Swiss hotel pro- 
prietor and financier, he had contrived to establish 
a connection with the officials of several European 
Courts,, and he had not spared money in that 
respect. Sundry kings and not a few princesses 
called him F61ix, and spoke familiarly of the hotel 
as * Felix's * ; and Fdix had found that this was 
very good for trade. The Grand Babylon was 
managed accordingly. The «note* of its policy 
was discretion, always discretion, and quietude, 
simplicity, remoteness. The place was like a 
palace incognito. There was no gold sign over 
the roof, not even an explanatory word at the 
entrance. You walked down a small side street

departed, rubbing his fine white hands slowly and 
meditatively. It was a trick of his, to rub his 
hands with a strange, roundabout motion, and the 
action denoted that some unusual excitement was 
in the air. 

At eight o'clock precisely dinner was served in 
the immene ^lle i manger, that chaste yet splendid 
apartment ot white and gold. At a small table 
near one of the windows a young lady sat alone. 
Her frock said Paris, but her face unmistakably 
said New York. It was a self-possessed and 
bewitching fece, the face of a woman thoroughly 
accustomed to doing exactly what she liked, when 
she liked, how she liked : tht face of a woman 
who had taught hundreds of gilded young men 
the true art of fetching and carrying, and who, 
by twenty years or so of parental spoiling, had 
come to regard herself as the feminine equivalent 
of the Tsar of All the Russias. Such women are 
only made in America, and they only come to their 
full bloom in Europe, which they imagine to be a 
continent created by Providence for their diver- 
sion. 

The young lady by the window glanced dis- 
approvingly at the menu card. Then she looked 
round the dining-room, and, while admiring the 
diners, dec'ded that the room itself was rather 
smaU and plain. Then she gazed through the 



THE MILLIONAIRE AND THE WAITER ii 

open window, and told herself that though the 
Thames by twilight was passable enough, it was 
by no means level with the Hudson, on whose 
shores her father had a hundred thousand dollar 
country cottage. Then she returned to the menu, 
and with a pursing of lovely lips said that there 
appeared to be nothing to eat. 

* Sorry to keep you waiting, Nella.* It was 
Mr. Racksole, the intrepid millionaire who had 
dared to order an Angel Kiss in the smoke-room 
of the Grand Babylon. Nella— her proper name- 
was Helen — smiled at her parent cautiously, re- 
serving to herself the right to scold if she should 
feel so inclined. 

* You always are late, father,* she said. 
'Only on a holiday,' he added. «What is 

there to eat ? * 
'Nothing.* 

* Then let's have it. I'm hungry. I'm never 
so hungry as when I'm being seriously idle.' 

* Consommd Britannia^ she began to read out 
from the menu, * Saumon tTEcossey Sauce Gdnoise, 
Aspics de Homard. Oh, heavens I Who wants 
these horrid messes on a night like this ? ' 

•But, Nella, this is the best cooking in 
Europe,' he protested. 

* Say, father,' she said, with seeming irrelevance, 
« bad you forgotten it's my birthday to-morrow } *

* I read in the New York papers some months 
ago,* Theodore started, without even a clearing of 
the throat, *that this hotel of yours, Mr. Babylon, 
was to be sold to a limited company, but it 
appears that the sale was not carried out.* 

* It was not,' answered Mr. Babylon frankly, 
* and the reason was that the middle-men between 
the proposed company and myself wished to make 
a large secret profit, and I declined to be a party 
to such a profit. They were firm ; I was firm ; 
and so the affair came to nothing.* 

* The agreed price was satisfactory ? * 
« Quite.* 

* May I ask what he price was ? * 

* Are you a buyer, Mr. Racksole .? * 

* Are you a seller, Mr. Babylon ? ' 

* I am,' said Babylon, * on terms. The price 
was four hundred thousand pounds, including the 
leasehold and goodwill. But I sell only on the 
condition that the buyer does not transfer the 
property to a limited company at a higher figure.* 

* I will put one question to you, Mr. Babylon,' 
said the millionaire. *What have your profits 
averaged during the last four years ? ' 

* Thirty-four thousand pounds per annum.* 

* I buy,' said Theodore Racksole, smiling con- 
tentedly ; * and we wiu, if you please, exchange 
contract-letters on the spot.* 



MR. RACKSOLE'S DINNER ,9 

* You come quickly to a resolution, Mr. 
Racksole. But perhaps you have been consider- 
ing this question for a long time ? ' 

*On the contrary,' Racksole looked at his 
watch, <I have been considering it for just six 
mmutes. •' 

Filix Babylon bowed, as one thoroughly 
accustomed to every eccentricity of wealth 

*The beauty of being well-known,' Racksole 
contmued, Ms that you needn't trouble about pre- 
Iimmary explanations. You, Mr. Babylon, prob- 
ably know aU about me. I know a good deal 
about you We can take each other for granted 
without reference. Really, it is as simple to buy 
a hotel or a railroad as it is to buy a watch, pro- 
vided one is equal to the transaction.' 

Shall we draw up the little informal contract ? 
There are details to be thought of But it occurs 
to me that you cannot have dined yet, and might 
prefer to deal with minor questions after dinner.' 
I have not dined,' said the millionaire, with 
emphasis 'and in that connection will you do me 
a fkyour .? Will you send for Mr. Rocco ? ' 
'You wish to see him, naturally.' 

* I do,' said the millionaire, and added, 'about 
my dinner. 

* Rocco is a great man,' murmured Mr. Babylon

MR. RACKSOLE'S DINNER 23 

'Is the purchase of hotels your notion of 
relaxation, then ? * 

Racksolc shrugged his shoulders. * It is a 
change from railroads,' he laughed. 

'Ah, my friend, you little know what you 
have bought.' 

* Oh ! yes I do,' returned Racksole ; « I have 
bought just tile first hotel in the world.' 

* That ?s true, tiiat is true,' Babylon admitted, 
g^ing meditatively at the antique Persian carpet. 
* There is nothing, anywhere, like my hotel. But 
you will regret the purchase, Mr. Racksole. It is 
no business of mine, of course, but I cannot help 
repeating that you will regret the purchase.' 

* I never regret.' 

'Then you will begin very soon—perhaps 
to-night.' '^ 

* Why do you say that .? ' 

* Because the Grand Babylon Is the Grand 
Babylon. You think because you control a rail- 
road, or an ironworks, or a line of steamers, 
tiierefore you can control anything. But no. Not 
the Grand Babylon. There is something about 
the Grand Babylon ' He threw up his hands. 

'Servants rob you, of course.' 

* Of course. I suppose I lose a hundred 
pounds a week in tiiat way. But it is not tiiat I 
mean. It is die guests. The guests are too— too

dark as night. Mr. Racksole, I never'know by 
whom I am surrounded. I never know what is 
going forward. Only sometimes I get hints 
glimpses of strange acts and strange secrets. YoJ 
mentioned my servants. They are almost aUgood 
servants skilled, competent. But what are they 
besides ? For anything I know my fourth sul^

ment. For anything I know my invaluable Miss

May I respectfully inquire his name .? '

with cou.m Hetty last fall. Oh ; here he is 
Mr. Dimmock, this is my dear father. He has 
succeeded with the steak.' 

Theodore Racksole found himself confronted 
by a very young man, with deep black eyes, and 
a tresh boyish expression. They began to talk 

Jules approached with the steak. Racksole 
tried to catch the waiter's eye, but could not. The 
dinner proceeded. 

*Oh, father!' cried Nella, *what a lot of 
mustard you have taken ! ' 

' Have I .? ' he said, and then he happened to 
glance into a mirror on his left hand between two 

s ood behind his chair, and he saw Jules give a 
slow significant, ominous wink to Mr. Dimmock 
— v^hristian name, Reginald. 

He examined his mustard in silence. He 
thought that perhaps he had helped himself rather 
plenteously to mustard.

CHAPTER III 

AT THREE A.M. 

Mr. Reginald D.mmock proved himself, desoite 
h.s extreme youU,, to be a man of the worid a^d 
of experience, and a practised talker. Convem- 

never to fl^. They chattered about St. Peters-

"Stayed tiU the final piece of steak was eaten 

Th«.d„re Racksole noticed that Mr. DL^^k 
g»ve very meagre information about his own 
movements, either past or fUture. He reLId 
the youth as a typical haneerK>n of CouT f ^ 
wondered how he had obtaLd his postof com- 
panion to Prince Aribert of Posen, and who PrZ 



fl 




ill! 



a8 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

Aribert of Posen might be. The millionaire 
thought he had once heard of Posen, but he 
wasn't sure ; he rather fencied it was one of those 
small nondescript German States of which five- 
sixths of the subjects are Palace officials, and the 
rest charcoal-burners or innkeepers. Until the 
meal was nearly over, Racksole said little— perhaps 
his thoughts were too busy with Jules' wink to 
Mr. Dimmock ; but when ices had been followed 
by coffee, he decided that it might be as well, in 
the interests of the hotel, to discover something 
about his daughter's friend. He never for an 
mstant questioned her right to possess her own 
friends ; he had always left her in the most amaz- 
mg liberty, relying on her inherited gooa sense to 
keep her out of mischief; but, quite apart from 
the wink, he was struck by Nella's attitude towards 
Mr. Dimmock, an attitude in which an amiable 
scorn was blended with an evident desire to propi- 
tiate and please. 

*Nella teUs me, Mr. Dimmock, that you hold 
a confidential position with Prince Aribert of 
Posen,' said Racksole. * You will pardon an 
American's ignorance, but is Prince Aribert a 
reigning Prince— what, I believe, you call in 
Europe, a Prince Regnant ? 

* His Highness is not a reigning Prince, nor 
ever likely to be,' answered Dimmock. «The 



■ * 



AT THREE A.M. ^g 

Grand Ducal Throne of Posen is occupied by his 
Highness s nephew, the Grand Duke Eugen * 

* Nephew ? • cried Nella with astonishment. 

* Why not, dear lady ? ' 

*But Prince Aribert is surely very young ?' 

* The Prince, by one of those vagaries of chance 
which occur sometimes in the history of families, 
js precisely the same age as the Grand Duke. The 
late Grand Duke's father was twice married. 
Hence this youthfulness on the part of an uncle ' 

* How delicious to be the uncle of some one as 
old as yourself! But I suppose it is no fun for 
Prince Aribert. I suppose he has to be fright- 
fully respectful and obedient, and all that, to his 
nephew ? ' 

* The Grand Duke and m ♦ me master are 
like brothers. At present, .. course. Prince 
Aribert is nominally heir to the throne, but 
as no doubt you are aware, the Grand Duke 
will shortly marry a near relative of the Emperor's 

and should there be a family ' Mr. Dimmock 

stopped and shrugged his straight shoulders. 

Ihe Grand Duke,' he went on, without finishing 
the last sentence, * would much prefer Prince 
Aribert to be his successor. He really doesn't 
want to marry. Between ourselves, strictly 
between ourselves, he regards marriage as rather 
a bore. But, of course, being a German Grand

Duke, he is bound to marry. He owes it to his 
country, to Posen.' 

* How large is Pose., ? ' asked Racksole bluntly. 

'Father,' Nella interposed laughing, *you 
shouldn't ask such inconvenient questions. You 
ought to have guessed that it isn't etiquette to 
inquire about the size of a German Dukedom.* 

*I am sure,' said Dimmock, with a polite 
smile, « that the Grand Duke is as much amused as 
anyone at the size of his territory. I forget the 
exact acreage, but I remember that once Prince 
Aribert and myself walked across it and back again 
in a single day.' 

* Then the Grand Duke cannot travel very far 
within his own dominions ? You may say that 
the sun does set on his empire ? ' 

* It does,' said Dimmock. 

* Unless the weather is cloudy,' Nella put in. 
*Is the Grand Duke content always to stay at 
home ? ' 

* On the contrary, he is a great traveller, much 
more so than Prince Aribert. I may teU you, what 
no one knows at present, outside this hotel, that 
his Royal Highness the Grand Duke, with a small 
suite, will be here to-morrow.' 

* In London > ' asked Nella. 
*Yes.' 

* In this hotel?* 



AT THREE A.M. 



3X 



* Yes.' 

* Oh ! How lovely ! * 



* That is why your humble servant is here to- 
night — a sort of advance guard.' 

* But I understood,' Racksole said, « that you 
were— er— attached to Prince Aribert, the uncle.' 

*I am. Prince Aribert will a!so be here. 
The Grand Duke and the Prince have business 
about important investments connected with the 
Grand Duke's marriage setdement. ... In the 
highest quarters, you understand.' 

*For so discreet a person,' thought Racksole, 
*you are fairly communicative.' Then he said 
aloud : * Shall we go out on the terrace ? * 

As they crossed the dining-room Jules 
stopped Mr. Dimmock and handed him a letter. 

* Just come, sir, by messenger,' said Jules. 

Nella dropped behind for a second with her 
fether. 

* Leave me alone with this boy a little— there's 
a dear parent,' she whispered in his ear. 

*I am a mere cypher, an obedient nobody,' 
Racksole replied, pinching her arm surreptitiously. 

* Treat me as such. Use me as you like. I will 
go and look after my hotel.' And soon afterwards 
h*; disappeared. 

Nella and Mr. Dimmock sat together on the 
terrace, sipping iced drinks. They made a hand-

some couple, bowered amid plants which blossomed 

thelookofthmgs there was the beginning of a ro- 
mance m that conversation. Perhaps there was, but 
a more mtimate acquaintance with the character of 

NeUaRacksolewouldhavebeennecessaryinorderto 
predict what precise form that romance would take 
Jules himself served the liquids, and at ten 
o clock he brought another no^. Entreating a 
thousand pardons, Reginald Dimmock, after he 
had glanced at the note, excused himself on the 
plea of urgent business for his Serene master, 
uncle of the Grand Duke of Posen. He asked 
if he might fetch Mr. Racksole, or escort Miss 
Racksole to her father. But Miss Racksole said 
gaily diat she felt no need of an escort, and should 
go to bed. She added that her tather and herself 
alwaysendeavoured to be independent of e.ch other 
Just then Theodore Racksole had found his 
way once more into Mr. Babylon's private room. 
Before arriving there, however, he had discovered 
that in some mysterious manner the news of the 
change of proprietorship had worked its way down 
to the lowest strata of the hotel's cosmos. The 
corridor^ hummed with it, and even under-servants 
were to be seen discussing the thing, just as though 
it mattered to them. ^ 



t AT THREE A.M. 33 

Ayr ' ?f ^, * ""'^^'^ ^^' Racksole; said the urbane 
Mr. Babylon, « and a mouthful of the oldest 
cognac in all Europe.* 

In a few minutes these two were talking 
eagerly, rapidly. Fdix Babylon was astonished 
at Racksole's capacity for absorbing the details of 
hotel management. And as for Racksole he soon 
realised that Fdix Babylon must be a prince of 
hotel managers. It had never occurred to Rack- 
sole before that to manage a hotel, even a large 
hotel, could be a specially interesting affair, or that 
It could make any excessive demands upon the 
brams of the manager ; but he came to see that he 
had under-rated the possibilities of a hotel The 
busmess of the Grand Babylon was enormous. It 
took Racksole, with all his genius for organisation, 
exactly half an hour to master the details of the 
hotel laundry-work. And the laundry-work was 
but one branch of activity amid scores, and not a 
very arge one at that. The machinery of checking 
supphes, and of establishing a mean ratio between 
the raw stuff received in the kitchen and the 
number of meals served in the saUe k manger and 
the private rooms, was very complicated and 
delicate. When Racksole had grasped it 
he at once suggested some improvements, and 
this led to a long theoretical discussion, and the 
discussion led to digressions, and then Filix

Babylon, in a moment of absent-mindedness, 
yawned. 

Racksole looked at the gilt clock on the high 
mantelpiece. 

* Great Scott I * he said. * It's three o'clock. 
Mr. Babylon, accept my apologies for having 
kept you up to such an absurd hour.' 

* I have not spent so pleasant an evening for 
many years. You have let me ride my hobby to 
my heart's content. It is I who should apologise.' 

Racksole rose. 

* I should like to ask you one question,' said 
Babylon. * Have you ever had anything to do with 
hotels before ? ' 

* Never,' said Racksole. 

* Then you have missed your vocation. You 
could have been the greatest of all hotel-managers. 
You would have been greater than me, and I am 
unequalled, though I keep only one hotel, and 
some men have half a dozen. Mr. Racksole, why 
have you never run a hotel ?' 

* Heaven knows,' he laughed, * but you flatter 
me, Mr. Babylon.' 

* I ? Flatter ? You do not know me. I 
flatter no one, except, perhaps, now and then an 
exceptionally distinguished guest. In which case 
I give suitable instructions as to the bill.'

Travelling in a lift, one is unconscious of floors. 
He passed several lift-doorways, but he could see 
no glint of a staircase ; in all self-respecting hotels 
staircases have gone out of fashion, and though 
hotel architects stiU continue, for old sake's sake, 
to build staircases, they are tucked away in remote 
corners where their presence is not likely to offend 
the eye of a spoiled and cosmopolitan public. 

The hotel seemed vast, uncanny, deserted. 
An electri. '".ght glowed here and there at long 
intervals. On the thick carpets, Racksole's thinly- 
shod feet made no sound, and he wandered at 
ease to and fro, rather amused, rather struck ly 
the peculiar sense of night a^d n /stery which had 
suddenly come over him. He fancied he could 
hear a thousand snores peacefully descending from 
the upper realms. At length he found a staircase, 
a very dark nnd narrow one, and presently he was 
on the first floor. He soon discovered that the 
numbers of the rooms on this floor did not get 
beyond seventy. He encountered another stair- 
case and ascended to the second floor. By the 
decoration of the walls he recognised this floor as 
his proper home, and as he strolled through the 
long corridor he whistled a low, meditative whistle 
of satisfaction. He thought he heard a step in the 
transverse corridor, and instinctively he obliterated 
himself in a recess which held a service-cabinet 



AT THREE A.M. 



37 



and a chair. He did hear a step. Peeping 
cautiously out, he perceived, what he had not 
perceived previously, that a piece of white ribbon 
had been tied round the handle of the door of 
one of the bedrooms. Then a man came round 
the corner of the transverse corridor, and Racksole 
drew back. It was Jules— Jules with his hands 
in his pockets and a slouch hat over his eyes, but 
in other respects attired as usual. 

Racksole, at that instant, remembered with a 
special vividness what Fdix Babylon had said to him 
at their first interview. He wished he had brought 
his revolver. He didn't know why he should 
feel the desirability of a revolver in a London 
hotel of the most unimpeachable fair fame, but he 
did feel the desirability of such an instrument of 
attack and defence. He privately decided that if 
Jules wer t his recess he would take him by 
the throat and in that attitude put a few plain 
questions to this highly dubious waiter. But 
Jules had stopped. The millionaire made another 
cautious observation. Jules, with infinite gentle- 
ness, was turning the handle of the door to which 
the white ribbon was attached. The door slowly 
yielded and Jules disappeared within the room. 
After a brief interval, the night-prowling Jules 
reappeared, closed the door as softly as he had 
opened it, removed the ribbon, returned upon

his steps, and vanished down the transverse 
corridor. 

* This is quaint,' said Racksole ; * quaint to a 
degree I ' 

It occurred to him to look at the number of 
the room, and he stole towards it. 

* Well, I'm d d ! ' he murmured wonder- 

ingly. 

The number was in, his daughter's room ! 
He tried to open it, but the door was locked. 
Rushing to his own room, No. 107, he seized one 
of a pair of revolvers (the kind that are made for 
millionaires) and followed after Jules down the 
transverse corridor. At the end of this corridor 
was a window ; the window was open ; and Jules 
was innocentiy gazing out of the window. Ten 
silent strides, and Theodore Racksole was upon 
him. 

* One word, my friend,' the millionaire began, 
carelessly waving the revolver in the air. Jules 
was indubitably startled, but by an admirable 
exercise of self-control he recovered possession 
of his faculties in a second. 

* Sir ? ' said Jules. 

* I just want to be informed what the deuce 
you were doing in No. 1 1 1 a moment ago.' 

* I had been requested to go there,' was the 
calm response.

* You are a liar, and not a very clever one. 
That is my daughter's room. Now— out with it, 
before I decide whether to shoot you or throw 
you into the street.' 

* Excuse me, sir, No. in is occupied by a 
gentleman.' 

* I advise you that it is a serious error of judg- 
ment to contradict me, my friend. Don't do it 
again. We will go to the room together, and you 
shall prove that the occupant is a gentleman, and 
not my daughter.' 

* Impossible, sir,' said Jules. 

* Scarcely that,' said Racksole, and he took 
Jules by the sleeve. The millionaire knew for a 
certainty that Nella occupied No. in, for he 
had examined the room with her, and himself 
seen that her trunks and her maid and herself 
had arrived there in safety. * Now open the 
door,' whispered Racksole, when they reached 
No. III. 

*I must knock.' 

* That is just what you mustn't do. Open it. 
No doubt you have your pass-key.' 

Confronted by the revolver, Jules readily 
obeyed, yet with a deprecatory gesture, as though 
he would not be responsible for this outrage 
against the decorum of hotel life. Racksole 
entered. The room was brilliantly lighted. 







40 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

* A visitor, who insists on seeing you, sir* 
said Jules, and fled. 6 / > » 

Mr. Reginald Dimmock, still in evening dress, 
^nd^smoking a cigarette, rose hurriedly from a 

• HeUo, my dear Mr. Racksole, this is an 
unexpected— ah— pleasure.' 

« Where is my daughter ? This is her room.' 
^ Did I catch what you said, Mr. Racksole .? ' 
^ I ventured to remark that this is Miss Rack- 
sole s room.' 

*My good sir,' answered Dimmock, 'you 
must be mad to dream of such a thing. Only my 
respect for your daughter prevents me from 
expelling you forcibly, for such an extraordinary 
suggestion.' ' 

A smaU spot half-way down the bridge of the 
millionaires nose turned suddenly white. 

* With your permission,' he said in a low calm 
voice, I will examine the dressing-room and the 
bath-room. 

«r«!i"'' ^'^T. *° """^ * moment,' Dimmock 
urgttd, in a milder tone. 

* m listen to you afterwards, my young friend.' 
said Racksole, and he proceeded to search the 
bath-room and the dressing-room, without any 
result whatever. « Lest my attitude might be open 
to misconstruction, Mr. Dimmock, I may as well 



AT THREE A.M. 



♦« 



tell you that I have the most perfect confidence in 
my daughter, who is as well able to take care of 
herself as any woman I ever met, but since 
you entered it there have been one or two rather 
mysterious occurrences in this hotel. That is all.* 
Feeling a draught of air on his shoulder, Racksole 
turned to the window. * For instance,' he added, 
*I perceive that this window is broken, badly 
broken, and from the outside. Now, how could 
that have occurred ? ' 

* If you will kindly hear reason, Mr. Racksole,* 
scid Dimmock in his best diplomatic manner, * I 
will endeavour to explain things to you. I re- 
garded your first question to me when you entered 
my room as being offensively put, but I now see 
that you had some justification.' He smiled 
politely. * I was passing along this corridor about 
eleven o'clock, when I found Miss Racksole in a 
difficulty with the hotel servants. Miss Racksole 
was retiring to rest in this room when a large 
stone, which must have been thrown from the 
Embankment, broke the window, as you see. 
Apart from the discomfort of the broken window, 
she did not care to remain in the room. She 
argued that where one stone had come another 
might follow. She therefore insisted on her room 
being changed. The servants said that there was 
no other room available with a dressing-room and

bath-room attached, and your daughter made a 
point of these matters. I at once offered to 
exchange apartments with her. She did me the 
honour to accept my offer. Our respective 
belongings were moved— and that is all. Miss 
Racksole is at this moment, I trust, asleep in 
No. 124.' 

Theodore Racksole looked at the young man 
for a few seconds in silence. 

There was a faint knock at the door. 

* G)me in,' said Racksole loudly. 
Someone pushed open the door, but remained 

standing on the mat. It was Nella's maid, in a 
dressing-gown. 

* Miss Racksole's compliments, and a thousand 
excuses, but a book of hers was left on the 
mantel-shelf in this room. She cannot sleep, and 
wishes to read.' 

* Mr. Dimmock, I tender my apologies — my 
formal apologies,' said Racksole, when the girl had 
gone away with the book. * Good-night.' 

* Pray don't mention it,' said Dimmock suavely 
— and bowed him out.

CHAPTER IV 

ENTRANCE OF THE PRINCE 

Nevertheless, sundry small things weighed on 
Racksole's mind. First there was Jules' wink. 
Then there was the ribbon on the door-handle 
and Jules' visit to No. iii, and the broken 
window — broken from the outside. Racksole did 
not forget that the time was 3 a.m. He slept but 
little that night, but he was glad that he had 
bought the Grand Babylon Hotel. It was an 
acquisition which seemed to promise fun and 
diversion. 

The next morning he came across Mr. Babylon 
early. 

* I have emptied my private room of all 
personal papers,' said Babylon, * and it is now at 
your disposal. I purpose, if agreeable to your- 
self, to stay on in the hotel as a guest for the 
present. We have much to setde with regard to 
the completion of the purchase, and also there 
are things which you might want to ask me. 
Also, to tell the truth, I am not anxious to leave

* How long has the hotel enjoyed the advantage 
of your services?' 

* A little over twenty years.' 

* That is a long time to be in one place. Don't 
you think it's time you got out of the rut. You 
are still young, and migh make a reputation for 
yourself in another and wider sphere.' Racksole 
looked at the man steadily, and his glance was as 
steadily returned. 

* You aren't satisfied with me, sir ? ' 

*To be frank, Jules, I think— I think you— er 
—wink too much. And I think that it is regret- 
table when a head waiter falls into a habit of taking 
white ribbons from the handles of bedroom doors 
at three in the morning.' 

Jules started slightly. 

* I see how it is, sir. You wish me to go, and 
one pretext, if I may use the term, is as good as 
another. Very well, I can't say that I'm surprised. 
It sometimes happens that there is incompatibility 
of temper between a hotel proprietor and his head 
waiter, and then, unless one of them goes, the hotel 
is likely to suffer. I will go, Mr. Racksole. In 
fact, I had already thought of giving notice.' 

The millionaire smiled appreciatively. 

« What wages do you require in Ueu of notice f 
It is my mtention that you leave the hotel within 
an hour.' 



ENTRANCE OF THE PRINCE 



47 



* I require no wages in lieu of notice, sir. I 
would scorn to accept anything. And I will leave 
the hotel in fifteen minutes.' 

* Good-day, then. You have my good wishes 
and my admiration, so long as you keep out of my 
hotel.' 

Racksole got up. 

* Good-day, sir. And thank you.* 

* By the way, Jules, it will be useless for you 
to apply to any other first-rate European hotel for 
a post, because I shall take measures which will 
ensure the rejection of any such application.' 

* Without discussing the question whether or 
not there aren't at least half a dozen hotels in 
London alone that would jump for joy at the chance 
of getting me,' answered Jules, * I may tell you, 
sir, that I shall retire from my profession.* 

* Really 1 You will turn your brains to a 
different channel.' 

* No, sir. I shall take rooms in Albemarle 
Street or Jermyn Street, and just be content to be 
a man-about-town. I have saved some twenty 
thousand pounds — a mere trifle, but sufficient for 
my needs, and I shall now proceed to enjoy it. 
Pardon me for troubling you with my personal 
afikirs. And good-day again.' 

That afternoon Racksole went with Filix 
Babylon first to a firm of solicitors in the City, and

then to a stockbroker, in order to carry out the 
practical details of the purchase of the hotel. 

*I mean to settle in England,' said Racksole. 
as they were coming back. « It is the only country 
and he stopped. 

* The only country f * 

* The only country where you can invest 
money and spend money with a feeling of security. 
In the Umted States there is nothing worth spend- 
ing money on, nothing to buy. In France or 
Italy, there is no real security.' 

* ^^t surely you are a true American .? ' ques- 
tioned Babylon. ^ 

*I am a true American,' said Racksole, « but 
my fadier who began by being a bedmaker at an 
Ojtford college, and ultimately made ten million 
dollars out of iron in Pittsburg-my father took 
the wise precaution of having me educated in 
lingland. I had my three years at Oxford, like 
any son of the upper middle class ! It did me 
good. It has been worth more to me than many

* You have dismissed him ? * 
•Why not?' 

'There is no reason why not. But I have 
felt inclined to dismiss him for the past ten years, 
and never found courage to do it.' 

* It was a perfectly simple proceeding, I assure 
you. Before I had done with him, I rather liked 
the fellow.' 

* Miss Spencer and Jules — both gone In one 
day ! ' mused Fdix Babylon. 

* And no one to take their places,' said Rack- 
sole. * And yet the hotel continues its way 1 ' 

But when Racksole reached the Grand Babylon 
he found that Miss Spencer's chair in the bureau 
was occupied by a stately and imperious girl, 
dressed becomingly in black. 

* Heavens ! Nella I ' he cried, going to the 
bureau. * What are you doing here .? ' 

*I am taking Miss Spencer's place. I want 
to help you with your hotel, dad. I fancy I shall 
make an excellent hotel clerk. I have arranged 
with a Miss Selina Smith, one of the typewriters 
in the office, to put me up to all the tips and 
tricks, and I shall do very well.' 

* But, look here, Helen Racksole. We shall 
have the whole of London Iking about this 
thing — the greatest of all American heiresses a 
hotel clerk I And I came here for quiet and rest ' *

* I suppose it was for the sake of quiet and 
rest that you bought the hotel, papa ? * 

* You would insist on the steak,' he retorted. 
* Get out of this, on the instant.' 

* Here I am, here I stay,' said Nella, and deli- 
berately laughed at her parent. 

Just then the face of a fair-haired man of about 
thirty years appeared at the bureau window. He 
was very well-dressed, very aristocratic in his 
pose, and he seemed rather angry. 

He looked fixedly at Nella, and started back. 

* Ach 1 ' he exclaimed. * You ! ' 

« Yes, your Highness, it is indeed I. Father, 
this is his Serene Highness Prince Aribert of 
Posen — one of our most esteemed customers.' 

* You know my name, Fraulein ? ' the new- 
comer murmured in German. 

* Certainly, Prince,' Nella replied sweetly. 
* You were plain Count Steenbock last spring in 
Paris — doubtless travelling incognito—' 

* Silence,' he entreated, with a wave of the 
hand, and hie forehead went as white as paper.

quite easily, and with at any rate n appearance of 
being natural. Prince Aribert became suave, even 
deferential to Nella, and more friendly towards 
Nella's father thai- their respective positions de- 
manded. The latter amused himself by studying 
this sprig of royalty, the first with whom he had 
ever come into contact. He decided that the 
young fellow was personable enough, * had no frills 
on him,* and would make an exceptionally good 
commercial traveller for a first-class firm. Such 
was Theodore Racksole's preliminary estimate of 
the man who might one day be the reigning 
Grand Duke of Posen. 

It occurred to Nella, and she smiled at the idea, 
that the bureau of the hotel was scarcely the 
correct place in which to receive this august young 
man. There he stood, with his head half-way 
through the bureau window, negligently leaning 



WHAT OCCURRED TO DIMMOCK 53 

against the woodwork, just as though he were a 
stockbroker or the manager of a New York bur- 
lesque company. 

* Is your Highness travelling quite alone ? * she 
asked. 

*By a series of accidents I am,' he said. 
« My equerry was to have met me at Charing 
Cross, but he fkUed to do so— I cannot imagine 
why.' ^ 

* Mr. Dimmock ? ' questioned Racksole. 

* Yes, Dimmock. I do not remer iber that he 
ever missed an appointment before. You know 
him ? He has been here ? ' 

* He dined with us last night,' said Racksole— 
*on NeUa's invitation,' he added maliciously; 
* but to-day we have seen nothing of him. I know, 
however, that he has engaged the State apartments, 
and also a suite adjoining the State apartments- 
No. 55. That is so, isn't it, NeUa ? ' 

*Yes, papa,' she said, having first demurely 
examined a ledger. *Your Highness would 

doubtless like to be conducted to your room 

apartments I mean.' Then Nella laughed deliber- 
ately at the Prince, and said, « I don't know who 
is the proper person to conduct you, and that's a 
fact.^ The truth is that papa and I are rather raw 
yet in the hotel line. You see, we only bought 
the place last night.'

54 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

* You have bought the hotel 1 * exclaimed the 
Prince. 

* That's so,* said Racksole. 
•And Filix Babylon has gone ? ' 

* He is going, if he has not already gone.* 

* Ah I I see,' said the Prince ; * this is one of 
your American "strokes." You have bought to 
sell again, is that not it ? You are on your holi- 
days, bu you cannot resist making a few thousands 
by way of relaxation. I have heard of such things.' 

* We sha'n't sell again. Prince, untU we are 
tired of our bargain. Sometimes we tire very 
quickly, and sometimes we don't. It depends— 
eh ? what ? ' Racksole broke off suddenly to 
attend to a servant in livery who had quietly 
entered the bureau and was making urgent 
mysterious signs to him. 

* If you please, sir,' the man by frantic gestures 
implored Mr. Theodore Racksole to come out. 

* Pray don't let me detain you, Mr. Racksole,' 
said the Prince, and therefore the proprietor of the 
Grand Babylon departed after the servant, with a 
queer, curt little bow to Prince Aribert. 

* Mayn't I come inside .? ' said the Prince to 
Nella immediately the millionaire had gone. 

•Impossible, Prince,' Nella laughed. «The 
rule against visitors entering this bureau is frieht- 
fully strict.' * 



WHAT OCCURRED TO DIMMOCK 55 

* How do you know the rule is so strict if 70U 
only came into possession last night ? ' 

* I know because I made the rule myself this 
morning, your Highness.* 

* But seriously, Miss Racksole, I want to talk 
to you.* 

* Do you want to talk to me as Prince Aribert 
or as the friend — the acquaintance — whom I knew 
in Paris last year ? ' 

* As the friend, dear lady, if I may use the 
term.* 

* And you are sure that you would not like 
first to be conducted to your apartments .? * 

* Not yet. I will wai: till Dimmock comes ; 
he cannot fail to be here soon.* 

*Then we will have tea served in fether's 
private room — the proprietor's private room, you 
know.* 

* Good ! * he said. 

Nella talked through a telephone, and rang 
several bells, and behaved generally in a manner 
calculated to prove to Princes and to whomever 
it might concern that she was a young woman of 
business instincts and training, and then she 
stepped down from her chair of office, emerged 
from the bureau, and, preceded by two menials, 
led Prince Aribert to the Louis XV. chamber 
in which her father and F61ix Babylon had had 



r »• 




56 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

their long confabulation on the previous even- 
ing. 

* What do you want to talk to me about ? * she 
asked her companion, as she poured out for him a 
second cup of tea. The Prince looked at her for 
a moment as he took the proffered cup, and being 
a young man of sane, healthy instincts, he could 
thmk of nothing for the moment except her loveli- 
ness. Nella was indeed beautifiil that afternoon. 
The beauty of even the most beautiful woman ebbs 
and flows from hour to hour. Nella's this after- 
noon was at the flood. Vivacious, alert, imperious 
and yet inefl=ably sweet, she seemed to radiate the 
very joy and exuberance of life. 

* I have forgotten,' he said. 

* You have forgotten I That is surely very 
wrong of you ? You gave me to understand that 
It was something terribly important. But of 
course I knew it couldn't be, because no man, and 
especially no Prince, ever discussed anything 
really important with a woman.' 

* Recollect, Miss Racksole, that this afternoon, 
here, I am not the Prince.' 

* You are Count Steenbock, Is that it ? ' 

He started. * For you only,' he said, uncon- 
sciously lowering his voice. * Miss Racksole, I 
particularly wish that no one here should know 
that I was in Paris last spring.' 



WHAT OCCURRED TO DIMMOCK 57 

' An affair of State ? ' she smiled. 

* An aflairofState,' he replied soberly. «Even 
Dimmock doesn't know. It was strange that we 
should be fellow guests at that quiet out-of-the-way 
hotel--strange but delightful. I shall never forget 
that rainy afternoon that we spent together in the 
Museum of the Trocadiro. Let us talk about that.' 

* About the rain, or the museum ? ' 

•I shall never forget that afternoon,* he 
repeated, ignoring the lightness of her question. 

* Nor I,* she murmured, corresponding to his 
mood. 

* You, too, enjoyed it ? * he said eagerly. 

* The sculptures were magnificent,' she replied, 
hastily glancing at the ceiling. 

*Ah I So they were ! Tell me. Miss Rack- 
sole, how did you discover my identity.' 

* I must not say,' she answered. « That is my 
secret. Do not seek to penetrate it. Who knows 
what horrors you might discover if you probed too 
far .? ' She laughed, but she laughed alone. The 
Prince remained pensive— as it were, brooding. 

* I never hoped to see you again,' he said. 
« Why not?' 

* One never sees again those whom one wishes 
to see.* 

* As for me, I was perfectly convinced that we 
should meet again.* 



5» THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

«Why?» 

* Because I always gtt what I want. 

* Then you wanted to see me again ? * 
'Certainly. You interested me extremely. 

I have never met another man who could talk 
so well about sculpture as the Count Steen- 
bock.' 

*Do you really always get what you want, 
Miss Racksole ? ' 

* Of course.* 

*That is because joSir hther is so rich, I sup- 
pose ?' 

* Oh, no, it isn't ! * she said. « It's simply 
because I always do get what I want. It's got 
nothing to do with father at all.' 

* But Mr. Racksole is extremely wealthy ?* 

* Wealthy isn't the word. Count. There is no 
word. It's positively awful the amount of dollars 
poor papa makes. And the worst of it is he can't 
help it. He told me once that when a man had 
made ten millions no power on earth could stop 
those ten millions from growing into twenty. And 
so it continues. I spend what I can, but I can't 
come near coping with it ; and of course papa is 
no use whatever at spending.' 

* And you have no mother ? * 

« Who told you I had no mother ? ' she asked 
quickly. 



WHAT OCCURRED TO DIMMOCK 59 

«I — er— inquired about you,' he said, with 
equal candour and humility. 

* In spite of the fact that you never hoped to 
see me again ? ' 

* Yes, in spite of that.* 

* How funny 1 ' she said, and lapsed into a 
meditative silence. 

* Yours must be a wonderful existence,' said 
the Prince. * I envy you.' 

* You envy me—what ? My father's wealth .? ' 

* No,' he said ; * your freedom and your respon- 
sibilities.' 

* I have no responsibilities,' she remarked. 

* Pardon me,' he said ; * you have, and the 
time is coming when you will feel them.' 

* I'm only a girl,' she murmured with sudden 
simplicity. * As for you. Count, surely you have 
sufficient responsibilities of your own .? ' 

* I ? ' he said sadly. * I have no responsibili- 
ties. I am a nobody — a Serene Highness who has 
to pretend to be very important, always talcing 
immense care never to do anything that a Serene 
Highness ought not to do. Bah 1 ' 

•But if your nephew, Prince Eugen, were to 
die, would you not come to the throne, and would 
you not then have these responsibilities which you

* Eugen die ? ' said Prince Aribert, in a curious

tone * Impossible. He is the perfection of 
ftealth. In three months he wiU be married. No. 
I shaU never be anything but a Serene Highness, 
the most despicable of God's creatures.' 

* But what about the State secret which you 
mentioned ? Is not that a responsibility ? ' 

'Ah I 'he said. * That is over. That belongs 
o the past. It was an accident in my duU career. 
I shall never be Count Steenbock again ' 

•Who knows r she said. *By the way, is 
not Pnnce Eugen coming here to-day ? Mr. 
Dimmock told us so.' 

* See I ' answered the Prince, standing up and 
bending over her. « I am going to confide in you. 
1 don t know why, but I am.' 

'Don't betray State secrets,' she warned him, 
smiling into his face. ^ 

But just then the door of the room was uncere- 
moniously opened. 

* Go right in,' said a voice sharply. It was 
Theodore Racksole's. ^^ 

Two men entered, bearing a prone form on a 
stretcher, and Racksole followed them. Nella 
sprang up. ^ Racksole stared to see his daughter. 

1 didn t know you were in here, NeU. Here ' 
to the two men, « out again.' * 

« Why I • exclaimed Nella, gazing fearfuUy at 
the form on the stretcher, « it's Mr. Dimmock 1 * 



♦» ■', ,fV, 



WHAT OCCURRED TO DIMMOCK 6i 

* It is,' her fether acquiesced. » He's dead,' he 
added laconicaUy. « I'd have broken it to you 
more gendy had I known. Your pardon, Prince.' 
There was a pause. 

* Dimmock dead I ' Prince Aribert whispered 
under his breath, and he kneeled down by the 
side of the stretcher. « What does this mean .? ' 

*The poor fellow was just walking across the 
quadrangle towards the portico when he feU down. 
A commissionaire who saw him says he was walk- 
ing very quickly. At first 1 thought it was 
sunstroke, but it couldn't have been, though the 
weather certainly is rather warm. It must be 
heart disease. But anyhow, he's dead. We did 
what we could. I've sent for a doctor, and for 
the police. I suppose there'll have to be an 
inquest.' 

Theodore Racksole stopped, and in an awkward 
solemn silence they all gazed at the dead youth. 
His features were slighdy drawn, and his eyes 
closed ; that was all. He might have been asleep. 

* My poor Dimmock I ' exclaimed the Prince, 
his voice broken. « And I was angry because the 
lad did not meet me at Charing Cross ! ' 

* Are you sure he is dead, father ? ' Nella said. 

* You'd better go away, Nella,' was Racksole's 
only reply ; but the giri stood still, and began to 
sob quietly. On the previous night she had 






^ THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

sco-ctly made fun of Reginald Dimmock. She 
had dchbcrately set herself to get information from 
him on a topic in which she happened to be ape- 
aaUy mterested and she had got it, laughing JS 
while at his youthful crudities-his vanity, his 
transient cunning, his absurd airs. She had 
not hked him ; she had even distrusted him, and 
decided that he was not ' nice.' But now, as he 
Uy on the stretcher, these things were forgotten. 
She went so for as to reproach herself for them. 
J>uch IS the strange commanding power of death. 
Oblige me by taking the poor fellow to mv 
apartaients,* said the Prince, with a gesture to the 
attendants 'Surely it is time the doctor came.' 
Racksole felt suddenly at that moment he was 
nothing but a mere hotel proprietor with an 
awk^d affair on his hands. For a fraction of a 
second he wished he had never bought the Grand 
isabylon, 

Tk^''"^*'^°^/'' ^°'''' ^^^^ P"«c« Aribert, 
Theodore Racksole, a doctor, and an inspector of

had just come from an ante-chamber, in which lay

WeU ? ' said Racksole, glancing at the doctor. 

Ihe doctor was a big, boyish-looking man, 
with keen, quizzical eyes. ' 

' It is not heart disease,' said liie doctor. 



WHAT OCCURRED TO DIMMOCK 63 

* Not heart disease?' 
•No/ 

* Then what is it ? * asked the Prince. 

* I nuy be able to answer that question after 
the post-mortem/ said the doctor. «I certainly 
can't answer it now. The symptoms are unusual 
to a degree.* 

The inspector of police began to write in a 
note-book.

64 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 



CHAPTER VI 

IN THE COLD ROOM 

At die Grand Babylon a great ball was given that 
mght m the Gold Room, a huge saloof attached 
to the hotel, though scarcely part of it, and cer- 
tainly less exclusive than the hotel itself. Theo- 
dore Racksole knew nothing of the affair, except 
that It was an entertainment offered by a Mr. and 
Mrs Sampson Levi to their friends. Who Mr 
and Mrs Sampson Levi were he did not know! 
nor could any one tell him anything about them 
except that Mr. Sampson Levi was^a prol^nent 
member of that part of the Stock Exchange famili- 
arly called the Kaffir Circus, and that his wife was 
a stout lady with an aquiline nose and many dia- 
monds and diat they were very rich and very 
hospitab^. Theodore Racksole did not wantT 
ball m his hotel that evening, and just before 

.tTi^'i. ^^"'°'' ' '"^"^ '° issue a decree that 
the Gold Room was to be closed and the ball for- 
bidden and Mr. and Mrs. Sampson Levi might 
name the amount of damages suffered by them 






IN THE GOLD ROOM 



6S 



His reasons for such a course were threefold— 
first,^ he felt depressed and uneasy ; second, he 
didn't like the name Sampson Levi ; and, third, 
he had a desire to show these so-called plutocrats 
that their wealth was nothing to him, that 
they could not do what they chose with Theodore 
Racksole, and that for two pins Theodore Rack- 
sole would buy them up, and the whole Kaffir 
Circus to boot. But something warned him that 
though such a high-handed proceeding might be 
tolerated in America, that land of freedom, it would 
never be tolerated in England. He felt instinc- 
tively that in England there are things you can't 
do, and that this particular thing was one of them. 
So the ball went forward, and neither Mr. nor 
Mrs. Sampson Levi had ever the least suspicion 
what a narrow escape they had had of looking very 
foolish in the eyes of the thousand or so guests 
invited by them to the Gold Room of the Grand 
Babylon that evening. 

The Gold Room of the Grand Babylon was 
built for a ball-room. A balcony, supported by 
arches faced with gilt and lapis-lazuli, ran round 
It, and from this vantage men and maidens and 
chaperons who could not or would not dance 
might survey the scene. Everyone knew this, and 
most people took advantage of it. What everyone 
did not know—what no one knew-— was that 



66 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

higher up than the balcony there was a little barred 
window in the end wall from which the hotel 
authorities might keep a watchful eye, not only on 
the dancers, but on the occupants of the balcony 
itself. ' 

It may seem incredible to the uninitiated that 
the guests at any social gathering held in so 
gorgeous and renowned an apartment as the Gold 
Room of the Grand Babylon should need the 
observation of a watchfUl eye. Yet so it was. 
Strange matters and unexpected faces had been 
descried from that little window, and more than 
one European detective had kept vigil there with 
the most eminendy satisfactory results. 

At eleven o'clock Theodore Racksole, afflicted 
by vexation of spirit, found himself gazing idly 
through the little barred window. Nella was with 
him. Together they had been wandering about 
the corridors of the hotel, still strange to them 
both, and it was quite by accident that they had 
lighted upon the smaU room which had a surrep- 
titious view of Mr. and Mrs. Sampson Levi's ball. 
Except for the light of the chandelier of the ball- 
room the little cubicle was in darkness. Nella was 
looking through the window ; her father stood 
behind. 

* I wonder which is Mrs. Sampson Levi,' Nella 
•aid, »and whether she matches her name.

father-something that people could take hold of 
—instead of Racksole ? ' 

The sound of violins and a confused murmur 
of voices rose gently up to them. 

'UmphI' said Theodore. « Curse those 
^ening papers 1 ' he added, inconsequently but 
With sincerity. ^ ^ 

* Father, you're very horrid to-night. What 
have the evemng papers been doing ?' 

* Well, my young madame, they've got me in 
for one, and you for another ; and they're manu-- 
fo:turing mysteries like fun. It's young Dim- 
mock s death that has started 'em.' 

* Well, father you surely didn't expect to keep 
yourselfoutof the papers. Besides, as regards 
newspapers you ought to be glad you areft in 

Herald would have made out of a little trans- 
action hke yours of last night.' 

* That's true,' assented Racksole. ' But it'll 

same. The worst of it is that Babylon has gone 
off to Switzerland.' ^ 

*Why?' 

* What difference does it make to you .?'

* None. Only I feel sort of lonesome. I feel 
I want some one to lean up against in running 
this hotel.* 

* Father, if you have that feeling you must be 
getting ill.' 

* Yes,' he sighed, * I admit it's unusual with mc. 
But perhaps you haven't grasped the fact, Nella, 
that we're in the middle of a rather queei business.* 

* You mean about poor Mr. Dimmock ? * 
'Partly Dimmock and partly other things. 

First of all, that Miss Spencer, or whatever her 
wretched name is, mysteriously disappears. Then 
there was the stone thrown into your bedroom. 
Then I caught that rascal Jules conspiring with 
Dimmock at three o'clock in the morning. Then 
your precious Prince Aribert arrives without any 
suite — which I believe is a most peculiar and 
wicked thing for a Prince to do — and moreover I 
find my daughter on very intimate terms with the 
said Prince. Then young Dimmock goes and dies, 
and there is to be an inquest ; then Prince Eugen 
and his suite, who were expected here tor dinner, 
foil to turn up at all ' 

* Prince Eugen has not come ? * 

* He has not ; and Uncle Aribert is in a deuce 
of a stew about him, and telegraphing all over 
Europe. Altogether, things are working up pretty 
lively.*

' Do you really think, dad, there was anything 
between Jules and poor Mr. Dimmock ? ' 

* Think ! I know ! I tell you I saw that 
scamp give Dimmock a wink last night at dinner 
that might have meant — well ! * 

* So you caught that wink, did you, dad ? ' 

* Why, did you?* 

* Of course, dad. I was going to tell you 
about it.' 

The millionaire grunted. 

* Look here, father,' Nella whispered suddenly, 
and pointed to the balcony immediately below 
them. * Who's that ? * She indicated a man with 
a bald patch on the back of his head, who was 
propping himself up against the railing of the 
balcony and gazing immovable into the ball-room. 

* WeU, who is it ? • 
'Isn't it Jules.?' 

* Gemini ! By the beard of the prophet, it is ! ' 

* Perhaps Mr. Jules is a guest of Mrs. Sampson 
Levi.' 

* Guest or no guest, he goes out of this hotel, 
even if I have to throw him out myself.' 

Theodore Racksole disappeared without an- 
other word, and Nella followed him. But when 
the millionaire arrived on the balcony floor he 
could see nothing of Jules, neither there nor in 
the ball-room itself. Saying no word aloud, but

quietly whispering wicked expletives, he searched 
everywhere in vain, and then, at last, by tortuous 
stairways and corridors returned to his original 
post of observation, that he might survey the 
place anew from that vantage ground. To his 
surprise he found a man in the dark little room, 
watching the scene of the ball as intently as he 
himself had been doing a few minutes before. 
Hearing footsteps, the man turned with a start. 
It was Jules. 

The two exchanged glances in the half light 
for a second. ° 

* Good-evening, Mr. Racksole,' said Jules 
calmly. I must apologise for being here.'

*And, I say, Mr. Jules, if Mr. and Mrs. 
Sampson Levi, or any other Hebrews or Christians, 
should again invite you to my hotel you will 
oblige me by declining the invitation. You'll 
find that will be the safest course for you.' 

* Good-night, sir.' 

Before midnight struck Theodore Racksole 
had ascertained that the invitation-list of Mr. and 
Mrs. Sampson Levi, though a somewhat lengthy 
one, contained no reference to any such person as 
Jules. 

He sat up very late. To be precise, he sat 
up all night. He was a man who, by dint of 
training, could comfortably dispense with sleep 
when he felt so inclined, or when circumstances 
made such a course advisable. He walked to and 
fro in his room, and cogitated as few people 
beside Theodore Racksole could cogitate. At 
6 A.M. he took a stroll round the business part 
of his premises, and watched the supplies come 
in from Covent Garden, from Smithfield, from 
Billingsgate, and from other strange places. He 
found the proceedings of the kitchen department 
quite interesting, and made mental notes of things 
that he would have altered, of men whose wages 
he would increase and men whose wages he would 
reduce. At 7 a.m. he happened to be standing 
near the luggage lift, and witnessed the descent of 




f

vast quantities of luggage, and its disappearance 
into a Carter Paterson van. 

'Whose luggage is that?' he inquired 
peremptorily. ^ 

The luggage clerk, with an aggrieved expres- 
sion, explained to him that it was the luggage of 
nobody m particular, that it belonged to vlious 
guests, and was bound for various destinations ; 
that It was, m feet, * expressed ' luggage despatched 
in advance, and that a similar quantity of it left 
the hotel every morning about that hour. 

Theodore Racksole walked away, and break- 
tasted upon one cup of tea and half a slice of toast 
At ten o'clock he was informed that the 
inspector of police desired to see him. The 
inspector had come, he said, to superintend the 
removal of the body of Reginald Dimmock to the 
mortuary adjoining the place of inquest, and a 
suitable vehicle waited at the back entrance of the 
hotel. 

The inspector had also brought subpoenas for 
himself and Prince Aribert of Posen and the com- 
missionaire to attend the inquest. 

* I tiiought Mr. Dimmock's remains were re- 
moved last night,' said Racksole wearily 

anotW jot' "^'^ '"' '' ^'^ '''' "^^ ^"^^^^^ - 
The inspector gave the least hint of a pro- 



IN THE GOLD ROOM 73 

fessional smile, and Racksole, disgusted, told him 
curtly to go and perform his duties. 

In a few minutes a message came from the 
mspector reqocstmg Mr. Racksole to be good 
emugh to come to him on the first floor. Rack- 
sole went. In the ante-room, where the body of 
Reginald Dimmock had originally been placed, 
were the inspector and Prince Aribert, and two 
policemen. 

*Well?' said Racksole, after he and the 
Prmce had exchanged bows. Then he saw a 
coBn laid across two chairs. < I see a coffin has 
been obtained,' he remarked. * Quite right." 
He approached it. < It's empty,' he observed un- 
thinkingly. 

* Just so,' said the inspector. < The body of 
the deceased has disappeared. And his Serene 
Highness Prince Aribert informs me that though 
he has occupied a room immediately opposite, on 
the other side of the corridor, he can throw no 
light on the aflair.' 

* Indeed, I cannot I ' said the Prince, and though 
he spoke with sufficient calmness and dignity, 
you could see that he was deeply pained, even 
distressed. 

*Well, I'm ' murmured Racksole, and 

stopped.

CHAPTER VII 

NELLA AND THB PRIKCB 

It appeared impossible to Theodore Racksole 
that so cumbrous an article as a corpse could be 
removed out of his hotel, with no trace, no hint, 
no clue as to the time or the manner of the per- 
formance of the deed. After the first feeling of 
surprise, Racksole grew coldly and severely angry. 
He had a mind to dismiss the entire staff of the 
hotel. He personally examined the night-watch- 
men, the chambermaids and all other persons who 
by chance might or ought to know something of 
the aflair ; but without avail. The corpse of 
Reginald Dimmock had vanished utterly— disap- 
peared like a fleshiest £pirit. Of course there were 
the police. But Theodore Racksole held the police 
in sorry esteem. He acquainted them with the 
facts, answered their queries with a patient weari- 
ness, and expected nothing whatever from that 
quarter. He also had several interviews with 
Prince Aribert jf Posen, but though the Prince 
was suavity itself, and beyond doubt genuinely 






m 



NELLA AND THE PRINCE 75 

concerned about the fate of his dead attendant, yet 
It seemed to Racksole that he was keeping some- 
Aing back, that he hesitated to say aU he knew. 
Racksole, with characteristic insight, decided that 
the death of Reginald Dimmock was only a minor 
event, which had occurred, as it were, on the fringe 
of some far more profound mystery. And, there- 
tore, he decided to wait, with his eyes very wide- 
open, until something else happened that would 
throw light on the business. At the moment he 
took only one measure— he arranged that the theft 
of Dimmock's body should not appear in the 
newspapers. It is astonishing how well a secret 
can be kept, when the possessors of the secret are 
handled with the proper mixture of firmness and 
persuasion. Racksole managed this very neady 
It was a complicated job, and his success in it 
rather pleased him. 

At the same time he was conscious of being 
temporarily worsted by an unknown group of 
schemers, in which he felt convinced that Jules 
was an important item. He could scarcely look 
NeUa in the eyes. The giri had evidently expected 
him to unmask this conspiracy at once, with a 
single stroke of the millionaire's magic wand. She 
was thoroughly accustomed, in the land of her 
birth, to seeing him achieve impossible feats

his name ; when he wished a thing to happen 

well, it happened ; if he desired to know a thing, 
he just knew it. But here, in London, Theodore 
Racksolewas not quite the same Theodore Racksole. 
He dominated New York ; but London, for the 
most part, seemed not to take much interest in him ; 
and there were certainly various persons in London 
who were capable of snapping^ their fingers at him 
—at Theodore Racksole. Neither he nor his 
daughter could get used to that fact. 

As for Nella, she concerned herself for a little 
with the ordinary business of the bureau, and 
watched the incomings and outgoings of Prince 
Aribert with a kindly interest. She perceived, 
what her father had failed to perceive, that His 
Highness had asr.umed an attitude of reserve 
merely to hide the secret distraction and dismay 
which consumed him. She saw that the poor 
fellow had no settled plan in his head, and that he 
was troubled by something which, so for, he had 
confided to nobody. It came to her knowledge that 
each morning he walked to and fro on the Victoria 
Embankment, alone, and apparently with no object. 
On the third morning she decided that driving 
exercise on the Embankment would be good for 
her health, and thereupon ordered a carriage and 
issued forth, arrayed in a miraculous putty-coloured 
gown. Near Blackfriars Bridge she met the 



NELLA AND THE PRINCE 



77 



Prince, and the carriage was drawn up by the 
pavement. 

* Good-morning, Prince,* she greeted him. 
* Are you mistaking this for Hyde Park ? * 

He bowed and smiled. 

* I usually walk here in the mornings,' he said. 

* You surprise me,* she returned. * I thought 
I was the only person in London who preferred 
the Embankment, with this view of the river, to the 
dustiness of Hyde Park. I can't imagine how it is 
that London will never take exercise anywhere ex- 
cept in that ridiculous Park. Now, if they had 
Central Park ' 

* I think the Embankment is the finest spot in 
all London,* he said. 

She leaned a little out of the landau, bringing 
her face nearer to his. 

* I do believe we are kindred spirits, you and 
I,' she murmured ; and then, * Au revoir, Prince ! ' 

*One moment. Miss Racksole.* His quick 
tones had a note of entreaty. 

* I am in a hurry,' she fibbed ; * I am not 
merely taking exercise this morning. You have 
no idea how busy we are.' 

* Ah ! then I will not trouble you. But I 
leave the Grand Babylon to-night.' 

* Do you ? ' she said. * Then will your High- 
ness do me the honour of lunching with me to- 



78 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

day in father's room ? Father will be out— he is' 
having a day in the City with some stockbroking 
persons.' 

* I shall be charmed,' said the Prince, and his 
face showed that he meant it. 

Nella drove off. 

If the lunch was a success that result was due 
partly to Rocco, and partly to Nella. The Prince 
said little beyond what the ordinary rules of the 
conversational game demanded. His hostess talked 
much and talked well, but she failed to rouse her 
guest. When they had had coffee he took a rather 
formal leave of her. 

* Good-bye, Prince,' she said, * but I thought— 
that is, no I didn't. Good-bye.' 

* You thought I wished to discuss something 
with you. I did ; but I have decided that I 
have no right to burden your mind with mv 
affairs.' ^ 

•But suppose— suppose I wish to be bur- 
dened ? ' 

* That is your good-nature.* 

*Sit down,' she said abruptly, «and tell me 
everything ; mind, everything, i adore secrets.' 

Almost before he knew it he was talking to 
her, rapidly, eagerly. 

*Why should I weary you with my confi- 
dences ? ' he said. * I don't know, I cannot tcU ; 






NELLA AND THE PRINCE 79 

but I feel that I must. I feel that you will 
understand me better than anyone else in the 
world. And yet why should you understand me ? 
Again, I don't know. Miss Racksole, I will dis- 
close to you the whole trouble in a word. Prince 
Eugen, the hereditary Grand Duke of Posen, has 
disappeared. Four days ago 1 was to have met 
him at Ostend. He had affairs in London. He 
wished me to come with him. I sent Dimmock 
on in front, and waited for Eugen. He did not 
arrive. I telegraphed back to Cologne, his last 
stopping-place, and I learned that he had left 
there in accordance with his programme ; I 
learned also that he had passed through Brussels. 
It must have been between Brussels and the 
railway tation at Ostend Quay that he disappeared. 
He was travelling with a single equerry, and the 
equerry, too, has vanished. I need not explain 
to you. Miss Racksole, that when a person of the 
importance of my nephew contrives to get lost 
one must proceed cautiously. One cannot adver- 
tise for him in the London «* Times." Such a 
disappearance must be kept secret. The people 
at Posen and at Berlin believe that Eugen is in 
London, here, at this hotel ; or, rather, they did 
so believe. But this morning I received a cypher 
telegram from— from His Majesty the Emperor, 
a very peculiar telegram, asking when Eugen

might be expected to return to Posen, and re-

telegram was addressed to myself. Now, if the 
Emperor thought that Eugen was here, why- 
should he have caused the telegram to be 
addressed to me ? I have hesitated for three 
days, but I can hesitate no longer. I must myself 
go to the Emperor and acquaint him with the facts.' 
« I suppose you've just got to keep straight with 
him ? ' Nella was on the point of saying, but she 
checked herself and substituted, * The Emperor is 
your chief, is he not ? « First among equals," you 
call him.' 

* His Majesty is our over-lord,' said Aribert 
quietly. 

* Why do you not take immediate steps to 
inquire as to the whereabouts of your Royal 
nephew ? ' she asked simply. The affair seemed 
to her just then so plain and straightforward. 

* Because one of two things may have 
happened. Either Eugen may have been, in plain 
language, abducted, or he may have had his own 
reasons for changing his programme and keeping 
in the background — out of reach of telegraph and 
post and railways.' 

* What sort of reasons ? *

* A thousand pardons, but he was not.* 

* Misb Racksole, if any other than yourself 
made that assertion, I would — I would * 

* Consign them to the deepest dungeon in 
Posen ? ' she laughed lightly. * Listen.' And 
she told him of the incidents which had occurred 
in the nighc preceding his arrival in the hotel. 

*Do you mean, Miss Racksole, that there 
lyas an understanding between poor Dimmock and 
this fellow Jules ? ' 

* There was an understanding.* 

* Impossible 1 ' 

*Your Highness, the man who wishes to 
probe a mystery to its root never uses the word 
" impossible." But I will say this for young Mr. 
Dimmock. I think he repented, and I think that 
it was because he repented that he — er— died so 
suddenly, and that his body was spirited away.* 

* Why has no one told me these things before ?* 
Aribert exclaimed. 

* Princes seldom hear the truth,' she said. 

He was astonished at her coolness, her firm- 
ness of assertion, her air of complete acquaintance 
with the world. 

* Miss Racksole,* he said, * if you will permit 
me to say it, I have never in my life met a woman 
like you. May I rely on your sympathy — your 
support ? * 

* My support, Prince ? But hov/ ?'

* I do not know,* he replied. * But you could 
help me if you would. A woman, when she has 
bram, always has more brain than a man." 

* Ah 1 ' she said ruefiiUy, * I have no brains, 
but I do believe I could help you.' 

What prompted her to make that assertion 
she could not have explained, even to herself. 
But she made it, and she had a suspicion— a 
prescience—that it would be justified, though by 
what means, through what good fortune, was stiU 
a mystery to her. 

'Go to Berlin,' she said. *I see that you 
must do that ; you have n alternative. As for 
the rest, we shaU see. Sor thing will occur. I 
shaU be here. My father will be here. You 
must count us as your friends.' 

He kisied her hand when he left, and after- 
wards, when she was alone, she kissed the spot 
his lips had touched again and again. Now, 
thinking the .natter out in the calmness of solitude, 
all seemed strange, unreal, uncertain to her. 
Were conspiracies actuaUy possible nowadays.? 
Did qx things actually happen in Europe ? 
And did they actually happen in London hotels .? 
She dined with her father that night. 

* I hear Prince Aribert has left,' said Theodore 
Racksole. 

*Yes,' she assented. She said not a word 
about their interview.

84 THE GRAND riBYLON HOTEL 



CHAPTER VIII 

ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF THE BARONESS 

On the following morning, just before lunch, a 
lady, accompanied by a maid and a considerable 
quantity of luggage, came to the Grand Babylon 
Hotel. She was a plump, little old lady, with 
white hair and an old-fashioned bonnet, and she 
had a quaint, simple smile of surprise at every- 
thing in general. Nevertheless, she gave the 
impression of belonging to some aristocracy, 
though not the English aristocracy. Her tone to 
her maid, whom she addressed in broken English 
— the girl being apparently English — was distinctly 
insolent, with the calm, unconscious insolence 
peculiar to a certain type of Continental nobility. 
The name on the lad;, 's card ran thus : * Baroness 
Zerlinski.' She desired rooms on the third floor. 
It happened that Nella was in the bureau. 

* On thf third floor, madam ^ ' questioned 
Nella, in her best clerkly manner. 

* I did say on de tird floor,' said the plump 
little old lady. 



i 



THE BARONESS 



BS 



* We have accommodation on the second floor.* 

* I wish to be high up, out of de dust and in 
de light,' explained the Baroness. 

*We have no suites on the third floor, 
madam.* 

* Never mind, no mattaire ' Have you not 
two rooms that communicate ? ' 

Nella consulted her books, rather awkwardly. 

* Numbers 122 and 123 communicate.* 

* Or is it 121 and 122 ?' the little old Luly 
remarked quickly, and then bit her lip. 

*I beg your pardon. I should have said 121 
and 122.' 

At the moment Nella regarded the Baroness's 
correction of her figures as a curious chance, but 
afterwards, when the Baroness had ascended in the 
lift, the thing struck her as somewhat strange. 
Perhaps the Baroness Zerlinski had stayed at the 
hotel before. For the sake of convenience an 
index of visitors to the hotel was kept, and the 
index extended back for thirty years. Nella 
examined it, but it did not contain the name of 
Zerlinski. Then it was that Nella began to 
imagine, what had swiftly crossed her mind when 
first the Baroness presented herself at the bureau, 
that the features of the Baroness were remotely 
familiar to her. She thought, not that she had 
seen the old lady's face before, but that she had 



■-*! 






m

THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 



1^ 
If 




seen somewhere, some time, a face of a similar 
cast. It occurred to Nella to look at the *A1- 
manach de Gotha'— that record of all the mazes 
of Continental blue blood ; but the * Almanach 
de Gotha ' made no reference to any barony of 
Zerlinski. Nella inquired where the Baroness 
meant to take lunch, and was informed that a 
table had been reserved for her in the dining-room, 
and she at once decided to lunch in the dining- 
room herself Seated iil a corner, half-hidden )y 
a pillar, she could survey all the guests, and 
watch each group as it entered or left. Presently 
the Baroness appeared, dressed in black, with a 
tiny lace shawl, despite the June warmth ; very 
stately, very quaint, and gentiy smiling. Nella 
observed her intently. The lady ate heartily, 
workmg without haste and without delay through 
the elaborate menu of the luncheon. NeUa 
noticed that she had beautiflil white teeth. Then 
a remarkable thing happened. A cream pufFwas 
served to the Baroness by way of sweets, and 
Nella was astonislied to see the little lady remove 
the top, and with a spoon quietly take something 
from the interior which looked like a piece of 
folded paper. No one who had not been watching 
with the eye of a lynx would have noticed any- 
thing extraordinary in the action ; indeed, tJ 2 
chances were nine hundred and ninety-nine to 



"1. 



THE BARONESS 



87 



one that It would pass unheeded. But, unfortu- 
nately for the Baroness, it was the thousandth 
chance that happened. Nella jumped up, and 
walking over to the Baroness, said to her : 

*Vm afraid that the tart is not quite nice, 
your ladyship.' 

* Thanks, it is delightful,* said the Baroness 
coldly ; her smile had vanished. * Who are you ? 
I thought you were de bureau clerk.* 

* My father is the owner of this hotel. I thought 
there was something in the tart which ought not 
to have been there.' 

Nella looked the Baroness full in the face. 
The piece of folded paper, to which a little cream 
had attached itself, lay under the edge of a plate. 

* No, thanks.' The Baroness smiled her simple 
smile. 

Nella departed. She had noticed one trifling 
thing besides the paper — namely, that the Baroness 
could pronounce the English * th ' sound if she 
chose. 

That afternoon, in her own room, N:lla sat 
meditating at the window for a long time, and 
then she suddenly sprang up, her eyes brightening. 

* I know,' she exclaimed, clapping her hands. 
« It's Miss Spencer, disguised ! Why didn't I 
think of that before ? * Her thoughts ran instantly 
to Prince Aribert. * Perhaps I can help him,' she 




88 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

Mid to herself, and gave a Htde sigh. She went 
down to the office and inquired whether the 
^oness had given any instructions about dinner. 
2>iie relt that some plan must be formulated. She 
wanted to get hold of Rocco, and put him in the 
rack. She knew now that Rocco, the unequalled, 
was also concerned in this mysterious afiair. 

* The Baroness Zerlinskx has kft, abou* a 
quarter of an hour ago,' said the attendant. 
*But she only arrived t: is morning.' 
'The Baroness's maid said that her mistrew 
had received a telegram, and must leave at once. 
The Baroness paid the bill, ard went away in a 
four-wheeler.' ^ 

* Where to } * 

* The trunks were labelled for Ostend.* 
Perhaps it was mstinct, perhap. it was the 

mere spirit of ad. .nture ; but that evening Nella 
was to he seen of all men on the steamer for 
Ostend which leaves Dover at ii p.m. She had 
told no one of her intentions—not even her father, 
who was not in the hotel when she left. She had 
scribbled a brief note to him to expect her back 
in a day or two, and had posted this at Dover, 
rhe steamer was the M^rie Henriette, a large and 
liumnous boat, whose State rooms on deck vie 
with the glories of the Cunard and White Star 
Uners. One of these State rooms, the best, was 






THE BARONESS 



89 









evidently occupied, for t very curtain of its windows 
was carefully drawn. Nel i did not hope that 
the Baroness was on board ; it was quite possible 
for the Baroness to have caught the eight o'clock 
steamer, and it was also possible for the Baroness 
not to have gone to Ostend at all, but to some 
other place in an entirely different direction. 
Nevertheless, Nella had a fail., hope that thj 
lady who called herself Zerlinski might be in 
that curtained State room, and throughout the 
smooth moonlit voyage she nevei once relaxed her 
observation ot its doors and its windows. 

The Marie Henriette arrived in Ostend 
Harbour punctually at 2 a.m. in the morning. 
There was the usual heterogeneous, gesticulating 
crowd on the quay. Nella kept her post near the 
door of the State room, and at length she was 
rewarded by seeing it open. Four middle-aged 
Englishmen issued from it. From a glimpse of 
the interior Kella saw that they had spent the 
voyage in card-playing. 

It would not be too much to ssy that she was 
distinctly annoyed. She pretended to be p.nnoyed 
with circumstances, but really she was annoyed 
with Nella Racksole. .it two in the morning, 
without lugga£':e, without any companionship, and 
without a plan of campaign, she found herself in a 
strange foreign port— a port of evil repute, possess- 








Ij- 



sn 



90 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

ing some of the worst-managed hotels in Europe. 
She strolled on the quay for a few minutes, and 
then she saw the smoke of another steamer in the 
offing. She inquired from an official what that 
steamer might be, and was told that it was the 
eight o'clock from Dover, which had broken down, 
put into Calais for some slight necessary repairs 
and was arrivmtr at its destination nearly four 
hours late. Her mercurial spirits rose again. A 
minute ago she was regarding herself as no better 
than a ninny engaged irt a wild-goose chase. Now 
she felt that after all she had been very sagacious 
and cunning. She was moraUy sure that she 
would find the Zerlinski woman on this second 
steamer, and she took all the credit to herself in 
advance. Such is human nature. 

The steamer seemed interminably slow in 
coming into harbour. Nella walked on the D^aue 
for a few minutes to watch it the better. The 
town was silent and almost deserted. It had a 
felse and sinister aspect. She remembered tales 
which she had heard of this glittering resort, which 
in the season holds more scoundrels than any place 
in Europe, save only Monte Carlo. She remem- 
bered that the gilded adventurers of every nation 
under the sun foregathered there either for busi- 
ness or p'easure, and that some of the most 
wonderful crimes of the latter half of the century 



THE BARONESS 



9« 



had been schemed and matured in that haunt of 
cosmopolii^n iniquity. 

When the second steamer arrived Nelu stood 
at the end of the gangway, close to the ticket- 
collector. The first person to step on shore was 

not the Baroness Zerlinski, but Miss Spencer her- 
self ! Nella turned aside instantly, hiding her face, 
and Miss Spencer, carrying a small bag, hurried 
with assured footsteps to i... . Custom House. It 
seemed as if she knew the port of Ostend fairly 
well. The moon shone like day, and Nella had 
fuU opportunity to observe her quarry. She could 
see now quite plainly that the Baroness Zerlinski 
had been only Miss Spencer in disguise. There 
was the same gait, the same movement of the 
h'^ad and of the hios ; the white hair was easily 
to be accounted for by a wig, and the wrinkles 
by a paint brush and some grease paints. Miss 
Spencer, whose hair was now its old accustomed 
yellow, got through the Custom House without 
difficulty, and Nella saw her call a closed carriage 
and say something to the driver. The vehicle 

drove off. Nella jumped into the next carriage 

an open one — that came up. 

* Follow that carriage,' she said succinctly to 
the driver in French. 

* Bien, madame I * The driver whipped up his 
horse, and the animal shot forward with a terrific

him into the house. She was astonished at her 
own audacity. 

Miss Spencer was just going into a room oflF 
the narrow hall. Nella followed her into the 
apartment, which was shabbily furnished in the 
Belgian lodging-house style. 

* Well, Miss Spencer,' she greeted the former 
Baroness Zerlinski, * I guess you didn't expect to 
see me. You left our hotel very suddenly this 
afternoon, and you left it very suddenly a few days 
ago ; and so I've just called to make a few inquiries.' 

To do that lady justice, Miss Spencer bore the 
surprising ordeal very well. She did not flinch ; 
she betrayed no emotion. The sole sign of per- 
turbation was in her hurried breathing. 

* You have ceased to be the Baroness Zerlinski,' 
Nella continued. * May I sit down .? ' 

* Certainly, sit down,' said Miss Spencer, copy- 
ing the girl's tone. * You are a fairly smart young 
woman, that I will say. What do you want ? 
Weren't my books all straight ? ' 

*Your books were all straight. I haven't 
come about your books. I have come about 
the murder of Reginald Dimmock, the disap- 
pearance of his corpse, and the disappearance of 
Prince Eugen of Posen. I thought you might 
be able to help me in some investigations which 
I am making.'

CHAPTER IX 

TWO WOMEN AND THE REVOLVER 

< You— you're only doing that to frighten me,' 
stammered Miss Spencer, in a low, quavering 
voice. 

* Am I ? • Nella replied, as firmly as she could, 
though her hand shook violently with excitement, 
could Miss Spencer but have observed it. * Am 
I ? You said just now that I might be a Yankee 
girl, but I was a fool. Well, I am a Yankee girl, 
as you call it ; and in my country, if they don't 
teach revolver-shooting in boarding-schools, there 
are at least a lot of girls who can handle a revolver. 
I happen to be one of them. I tell you that if 
you ring that bell you will suffer.' 

Most of this was simple bluff on Nella's part, 
and she trembled lest Miss Spencer should per- 
ceive that it was simple bluff. Happily for her. 
Miss Spencer belonged to that order of women 
who have every sort of courage except physical 
courage. Miss Spencer could have withstood suc- 
cessfully any moral trial, but persuade her that

her skin was in danger, and she would succumb. 
Nella at once divined this useful fact, and proceeded 
accordingly, hiding the strangeness of her own 
sensations as well as she could. 

c \ T°"„^^'^ ^^"^"^ ^^' '^ow" now,' said Nella. 
and I will ask you a few questions.' 

And Miss Spencer obediently sat down, rather 
white, and trying to screw her lips into a formal 
smile. 

/ '^^'If'^ y°" Jeaye the Grand Babylon that 
night .? Nella began her examination, putting on 
a stern, barrister-like expression. 

* I had orders to, Miss Racksole.*

woman, and it was my husband's orders.' 

* Who is your husband } '

' I'm sure I don't know. Miss Racksole. I 
swear I don't know. He's my husband, and, of 
course, I do what he tells me, as you will some day 
do what your husband teUs you. Please Heaven 
you U get a better husband than mine I ' 

Miss Spencer showed a sign of tears. 

Nella fingered the revolver, and put* it at ftiU

cock. *Well,' she repeated, *why did he want 
you to leave ? ' She was tremendously surprised 
at her own coolness, and somewhat pleased with 
it, too. 

* I can't tell you, I can't tell you.' 

* You've just got to,' Nella said, in a terrible, 
remorseless tone. 

*He — he wish2d me to come over here to 
Ostend. Something had gone wrong. Oh ! he's 
a fearful man, is Tom. If I told you, he'd ' 

* Had something gone wrong in the hotel, or

*Both.* 

* Was it about Prince Eugen of Posen .? ' 

* I don't know — that is, yes, I think so.' 

* What has your husband to do with Prince 
Eugen ? ' 

* I believe he has some — some sort of business 
with him, some money business.' 

* And was Mr. Dimmock in this business .?' 
*I fancy so. Miss Racksole. I'm telling you 

all I know, that I swear.' 

* Did your husband and Mr. Dimmock have 
a quarrel that night in Room in .? ' 

* They had some difficulty.' 

* And the result of that was that you c?mc to

* Yes ; I suppose so.*

*And what were you to do in Ostend ? 
What V ere your instructions from this husband 
of yours ? ' 

Miss Spencer's head dropped on her arms on 
the table which separated her from Nella, and she 
appeared to sob violently. 

* Have pity on me,' she murmured, * I can't 
tell you any more.' 

*Why.?' 

* He'd kill me if he knew. 

* You're wandering from the subject,' observed 
Nella coldly. * This is the last time I shall warn 
you. Let me tell you plainly I've got the best 
reasons for '>eing desperate, and if anything hap- 
pens to you I shaU say I did it in self-defence. 
Now, what were you to do in Ostend ? ' 

*I shall die for this anyhow,' whined Miss 
Spencer, and then, with a sort of fierce despair, 
* I had to keep watch on Prince Eugen." 

* Where ? In this house ? ' 

Miss Spencer nodded, and, looking up, Nella 
could see the traces of tears in her face. 

* Then Prince Eugen was a prisoner .? Some 
one had captured him at the instigation of Jules .?' 

* Yes, if you must have it.' 

*Why was it necessary for you specially to 
come to Ostend ? ' 

*Oh ! Tom trusts me. You see, I know 



TWO WOMEN AND THE REVOLVER 99 

Ostend. Before I took that place at the Grand 
Babylon I had travelled over Europe, and Tom 
knew that I knew a thing or two.' 

* Why did you take the place at the Grand 
Babylon ? ' 

* Because Tom told me to. He said 1 should 
be useful to him there.' 

* Is your husband an Anarchist, or something 
of that kind, Miss Spencer ? ' 

* I don't know. I'd tell you in a minute if I 
knew. But he's one of those that keep themselves 
to themselves.' 

* Do you know if he has ever committed a 
murder ? ' 

* Never ! ' said Miss Spencer, with righteous 
repudiation of the mere idea. 

* But Mr. Dimmock was murdered. He was 
poisoned. If he had not been poisoned why 
was his body stolen ? It must have been stolen 
to prevent inquiry, to hide traces. Tell me 
about that.' 

* I tak my dying oath,' said Miss Spencer, 
standing up a little way from the table, * I take 
my dying oath I didn't know Mr. Dimmock was 
dead till I saw it in the newspaper.' 

* You swear you had no suspicion of it ? * 

* I swear I hadn't.' 

Nella was inclined to believe the statement

The woman and the girl looked at each other in 
the tawdry, frowsy, lamp-lit room. Miss Spencer 
nervously patted her yellow hair into sha^e, 
as if gradually recovering her composure and 
equanimity. The whole afiair seemed like a dream 
to Nella, a disturbing, sinister nightmare. She 
was a little uncertain what to say. She felt that 
she had not yet got hold of any very definite in- 
formation. « Where is Prince Eugen now ? ' she 
asked at length. 

* I don't know, miss.' 

* He isn t in this house ?* 

* No, miss.' 

* Ah I We will see presently.* 

*They took him away. Miss Racksole.' 

' Who took him away .? Some of your hus- 
band's friends ? ' 

* Some of his — acquaintances.* 

* Then there is a gang of you f ' 

* A gang of us— a gang ! I don't know what 
you mean,' Miss Spencer quavered. 

*Oh, but you must know,' smiled Nella 
calmly. < You can't possibly be so innocent as all 
that, Mrs. Tom Jackson. You can't play games 
with me. You've just got to remember that I'm 
what you call a Yankee girl. There's one thing 
that I mean to find out, within the next five 
minutes, and that is— how your charming husband 



m

kidnapped Prince Eugen, and why he kidnapped 
him. Let us begin with the second question. 
You have evaded it once.* 

Miss Spencer looked into Nella's fece, and then 
her eyes dropped, and her fingers worked nervously 
with the table-cloth. 

* How can I tell you,' she said, * when I don't 
know ? You've got the whip-hand of me, and 
you're tormenting me for your own pleasure.* 
She wore an expression of persecuted innocence. 

*Did Mr. Tom Jackson want to get some 
money out of Prince Eugen ?* 

* Money I Not he I Tom's never short of 
money.' 

* But I mean a lot of money — tens of thousands, 
hundreds of thousands ? ' 

* Tom never wanted money from anyone,' said 
Miss Spencer doggedly. 

*Then had he some reason for wishing to 
prevent Prince Eugen from coming to London ? * 

* Perhaps he had. I don't know. If you kill 
me, I don't know.' 

Nella stopped to reflect. Then she raised the 
revolver. It was a mechanical, unintentional sort 
of action, and certainly she had no intention of 
using the weapon, but, strange to say, Miss 
Spencer again cowered before it. Even at that 
moment Nella wondered that a woman like Miss

M 



102 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

Spencer could be so simple as to think the 
revolver would actually be used. Having abso- 
lutely no physical cowardice herself, Nella had the 
greatest difficulty in imagining that other people 
could be at the mercy of a bodily fear. Still, she 
saw her advantage, and used it relentlessly, and 
with as much theatrical gesture as she could 
command. She raised the revolver tir it was 
level with Miss Spencer's face, and suddenly a 
new, queer feeling took hold of her. She knew 
that she would indeed use that revolver now, if 
the miserable woman before her drove her too 
for She felt afraid-afraid of herself; she was 
in the grasp of a savage, primeval instinct. In a 
flash she saw Miss Spencer dead at her feet-the 
horribk^ "°"^' °^ iustice-the scaffold. It was 

* Speak,' she said hoarsely, and Miss Spencer'- 
fece went whiter. ^ 

*Tom did say,' the woman whispered rapidlv 
awesomely, <that if Prince Eugen got to LoVn 
It would upset his scheme.' 

'What scheme.? What scheme.? Answer me.' 

Heaven help me, I don't know.' Miss 

Spencer sank into a chair. ^He said Mr. Dimmock 

had turned tail, and he should have to settle him, 

and then Rocco * 

*Roccol What about Rocco .? • Nella could

scarcely hear herself. Her grip of the revolver 
tightened. 

Miss Spencer's eyes opened wider ; she gazed 
at Nella with a glassy stare. 

* Don't ask me. It's death I * Her eyes were 
fixed as if in horror. 

* It is,' said Nella, and the sound of her voice 
seemed to her to issue from the lips of some third 
person. 

* It's death,* repeated Miss Spencer, and gradu- 
ally her head and shoulders sank back, and hung 
loosely over the chair. Nella was conscious of a 
sudden revulsion. The woman had surely feinted. 
Dropping the revolver she ran round the table. 
She was herself again — feminine, sympathetic, the 
old Nella. She felt immensely relieved that this 
had happened. But at the same instant Miss 
Spt.ncer sprang up from the chair like a cat, seized 
the revolver, and with a wild movement of the 
arm flung itagainst the window. It crashed through 
the glass, exploding as it went, and there was a 
tense silence. 

* I told you that you were a fool,' remarked 
Miss Spencer slowly, * coming here like a sort of 
female Jack Sheppard, and trying to get the best 
of me. We are on equal terms now. You 
frightened me, but I knew I was a cleverer woman 
than you, and that in the end, if I kept on long

* Well, say a million. I can rely on my father, 
and so may you.' 

* You think you are worth a million to him ?* 

* I do,' said Nella. 

* And you think we could trust you to see that 
it was paid ? ' 

* Of course you could.' 

* And we should not suffer afterwards in any 
way ? ' 

*I would give my word, and my father's 
word.' 

* Bah ! ' exclaimed Miss Spencer ; * ho\y do you 
know I wouldn't let you go free for nothing ? 
You are only a rash, silly girl.' 

* I know you wouldn't. I can read your face 
too well.' 

* You are right,' Miss Spencer replied slowly. 
* I wouldn't. I wouldn't let you go for all the 
dollars in America.' 

Nella felt cold down the spine, and sat down 
again in her chair. A draught of air from the 
broken window blew on her cheek. Steps sounded 
in the passage ; the door opened, but Nella did 
not turn round. She could not move her eyes 
from Miss Spencer's. There was a noise of rush- 
ing water in her ears. She lost consciousness, and 
slipped limply to the ground.

CHAPTER X 

AT SEA 

It seemed to Nella that she was being rocked 
gendy in a vast cradle, which swayed to and fro 
with a motion at once slow and incredibly gende. 
This sensation continued for some time, and there 
was added to it the sound of a quick, quiet, 
muffled beat. Soft, exhilarating breezes wafted 
her forward in spite of herself, and yet she 
remained in a delicious calm. She wondered if 
her mother was kneeling by her side, whispering 
some lullaby in her childish ears. Then strange 
colours swam before her eyes, her eyelids wavered, 
and at last she awoke. For a few moments h^r 
gaze travelled to and fro in a vain search for some 
clue to her surroundings. She was aware of 
nothmg except a sense of repose and a feeling of 
relief that some mighty and fatal struggle was 
over ; she cared not whether she had conquered 
or suffered defeat in that struggle of her soul with 
some other soul ; it was finished, done with, and 



AT SEA 



107 



the consciousness of its r --nclusion satisfied and 
contented her. Gradually her brain, recovering 
from its obsession, began to grasp the phenomena 
of her surroundings, and she saw that she was on 
a yacht, and that the yacht was moving. The 
motion of the cradle was the smooth rolling of 
the vessel ; the beat was the beat of its screw ; 
the strange colours were the cloud tints thrown 
by the sun as it rose over a distant and receding 
shore in the wake ot the yacht ; her mother's 
lullaby was the crooned song of the man at the 
wheel. Nella all through her life had had many 
experiences of yachting. From the vvaters of the 
River Hudson to those bluer tides of the Medi- 
terranean Sea, she had yachted in all seasons and 
all weathers. She loved the water, and now it 
seemed deliciously right and proper that she 
should be on the water again. She raised her 
head to look round, and then let it sink back : 
she was fatigued, enervated ; she desired only 
solitude and calm ; she had no care, no anxiety, 
no responsibility : a hundred years might have 
passed since her meeting with Miss Spencer, and 
the memory of that meeting appeared to have 
feded into the remotest background of her mind. 
It was a small yachl, and her practised eye 
at once told that it belonged to the highest 
aristocracy of pleasure craft. As she reclined in 






m 






^ 






io8 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

the deck-chair (it did not occur to her at that 
moment to speculate as to the identity of the 
person who had led her therein) she examined all 
visible details of the vessel. The deck was as 
white and smooth as her own hand, and the seams 
ran along its length like blue veins. All the 
brass-work, from the band round the slender 
funnel to the concave surface of the binnacle, shone 
like gold. The tapered masts stretched upwards 
at a rakish angle, and the rigging seemed like spun 
silk. No sails were set ; the yacht was under 
steam, and doing about seven or eight knots. She 
judged that it was a boat of a hundred tons or so, 
probably Clyde-built, and not more than two or 
three years old. No one was to be seen on deck 
except the man at the wheel : this man wore a 
blue jersey ; but there was neither name nor initial 
on the jersey, nor was there a name on the white 
lifebuoys lashed to the main rigging, nor on the 
polished dinghy which hung high on the starboard 
davits. She called to the man, and called again, 
m a feeble voice, but the steerer took no notice of 
her, and contin' ed his quiet song as though 
nothing else existed in the universe save the yacht 
the sea, the sun, and himself. * 

Then her eyes swept the outline of the land 
from which they were hastening, and she could 
just distinguish a lighthouse and a great white

irregular dome, which she recognised as the 
Kursaal at Ostend, that gorgeous rival of the 
gaming palace at Monte Carlo. So she was 
leaving Ostend. The rays of the sun fell on her 
caressingly, like a restorative. All around the 
water was changing from wonderful greys and 
dark blues to still more wonderful pinks and 
translucent unearthly greens ; the magic kaleido- 
scope of '^iwn was going forward in its accustomed 
way, regardless of the vicissitudes of mortals. 
Here and there in the distance she descried a sail 
— the brown sail of some Ostend fishing-boat 
returning home after a night's trawling. Then 
the beat of paddles caught her ear, and a steamer 
blundered past, wallowing clumsily among the 
waves like a tortoise. It was the * Swallow ' from 
London. She could see some of its passengers 
leaning curiously over the aft-rail. A girl in a 
mackintosh signalled to her, and mechanically 5;h? 
answered the salute with her arm. The officer on 
the bridge of the ' Swallow ' hailed t^e yacht, but 
the man at the wheel offered no reply. In 
another minute the ' Swallow ' was nothing but a 
blot in the distance. 

Nella tried to sit straight in the deck-chair, 
but she found herself unable to do so. Throwing 
off the rug which covered her, she discovered that 
she had been tied to the chair by means of a piece

secret forces of crime continue to move, just 
as they did in the days when you couldn't go from 
Cheapside to Chelsea without being set upon by 
thieves. Her experience was in a fair way to teach 
her this lesson better than she could have learnt 
it even in the bureaus of the detective police of 
Paris, London, and St. Petersburg. 

* Good-morning,* the man repeated, and she 
glanced at him with a sullen, angry gaze. 

* You I ' she exclaimed, < You, Mr. Thomas 
Jackson, if that is your name ! Loose me from 
this chair, and I will talk to you.' Her eyes flashed 
as she spoke, and the contempt in them added 
mightily to her beauty. Mr. Thomas Jackson, 
otherwise Jules, erstwhile head waiter at the Grand 
Babylon, considered himself a connoisseur in femi- 
nine loveliness, and the vision of Nella Racksole 
smote him like an exquisite blow. 

* With pleasure,' he replied. * I had forgotten 
that to prevent you from falling I had secured you 
to the chair ; ' and with a quick movement he 
unfastened the band. Nella stood up, quivering 
with fiery annoyance and scorn. 

* Now,' she said, fronting him, * what is the

* You fainted,' he replied imperturbablj . < Per-

* Why did you mix yourself up in my affairs 
at all ? ' he went on. 

Again she made no reply, but the question 
set her thinking : \vhy had she mixed herself up 
in this mysterious business ? It was quite at 
variance with the usual methods of her gay and 
butterfly existence to meddle at all with serious 
things. Had she acted merely from a desire to 
see justice done and wickedness punished ? Or 
was it the desire of adyenture ? Or was it, perhaps, 
the desire to be of service to His Serene Highness 
Prince Aribert ? 

* It is no fault of mine that you are in this fix,' 
Jules continued. * I didn't bring you into it. 
You brought yourself into it. You and ycur 
Jather — you have been moving along at a pace 
which is rather too rapid.' 

* That remains to be seen,' she put in coldly. 

* It does,' he admitted. * And I repeat that I 
can't help admiring you — that is, when you aren't 
interfering with my private affairs. That is a 
proceeding which I have never tolerated from 
anyone — not even from a millionaire, not even 
from a beautiful woman.* He bowed. * I will 
tell you what I propose to do. I propose to escort 
you to a place of safety, and to keep you there till 
my operations are concluded, and the possibility 
pf interference entirely removed. You spoke just

now of murder. What a crude notion that was 
of yours ! It is only the amateur who practises 
murder ' 

* "What about Reginald Dimmock ? * she inter- 
jected quickly. 

He paused gravely. 

* Reginald Dimmock,' he repeated. * I had 
imagined his was a case of heart disease. Let me 
send you up some more chocolate. I'm sure 
you're hungry.* 

* I will star/e before I touch your food,' she 
said. 

* Gallant creature ! * he murmured, and his 
eyes roved over her face. Her superb, supercilious 
beauty overcame him. * Ah ! ' he said, * what a 
wife you would make ! * He approached nearer 
to her. * You and I, Miss Racksole, your beauty 
and wealth and my brains — we could conquer the 
world. Few men are worthy of you, but I am 
one of the few. Listen ! You might do worse. 
Marry me. I am a great man ; I shall be greater. 
I adore you. Marry me, and I will save your life. 
All shall be well. 1 will begin again. The past 
shall be as though there had been no past.' 

* This is somewhat sudden — Jules,' she said, 
with biting contempt. 

* Did you expect me to be conventional } ' he 
retorted. ' I love you.'

* Granted,' she said, for the sake of the argu- 
ment. *Then what will occur to your present 

wite r 

* My present wife ? * 

* Yes, Miss Spencer, as she is called. 

* She told you I was her husband ? ' 

* Incidentally, she did.' 

* She isn't.' 

* Perhaps she isn't. But, nevertheless, I think 
I won't marry you ' Nella stood like a statue of 
scorn befu e him. 

He went still nearer to her. *Give me a 
kiss, then ; one kiss — I won't ask for more ; one 
kiss from those lips, and you shall go free. Men 
have ruined themselves for a kiss. I will.' 

* Coward 1 ' she ejaculated. 

* Coward 1 ' he repeated. * Coward, am I } 
Then I'll be a coward, and you shall kiss me 
whether you will or not.' 

He put a hand on her shoulder. As she shrank 
back from his lustrous eyes, with an involuntary 
scream, a figure sprang out of the dinghy a few 
feet away. With a single blow, neatly directed 
to Mr. Jackson's ear, Mr. Jackson was stretched 
senseless on the deck. Prince Aribert of Posen 
stood over him with a revolver. It was probably 
the greatest surprise of Mr. Jackson's whole life. 

* Don't be nlarmed,' said the Prince to Nella,

*my being here is the simplest thing in the 
world, and I will explain it as soon as I have 
finished with this fellow.* 

Nella could think of nothing to say, but she 
noticed the revolver in the Prince's hand. 

« Why,' she remarked, * that's my revolver. ^ 

< It is,' he said, < and I will explain that, too. 

The man at the wheel gave no heed whatever 
to the scene.

* Mr. Sampson Levi wishes to see you, sir * 

These words, spoken by a servant to Theodore 
Raclcsole aroused the millionaire from a reverie 
which had been the reverse of pleasant. The fact 
was and ,t is necessary to insist on it, that Mr 
Raclcsole, owner of the Grand Babylon Hotel, was* 
by no means in a state of self-satisfaction. A 
mystery had attached itself to his hotel, and with 
all his acumen and knowledge of things in general 
he was unable to solve that mystery. He laughed 
at the fruitless efforts of the police, but he could 
not honestly say that his own efforts hadbeenless 
barren. The puMic was talking, for, after all, the 
dis^peai^nce of poor Dimmock's body had got 
noised abroad in an indirect sort of way, and 
Theodore Racksole did not like the idea of his 
impeccable hotel being the subject of sinister

property : of Miss Spencer's disappearance, of 
Jules strange visits, and of the non-arrival of 
Pnnce Eugen of Posen. Theodore Racksole had 
worried his brains without result. He had con- 
ducted an elaborate private investigation without 
result, and he had spent a certain amount of money 
without result. The police said that they had a 
clue ; but Racksole remarked that it was always 
the business of the police to have a clue, that they 
seldom had more than a clue, and that a clue with- 
out some sequel to it was a pretty stupid business. 
The only sure thing in the whole aflair was that a 
cloud rested over his hotel, his beautiful new toy 
the finest of its kind. The cloud was not inter- 
tenng with business, but, nevertheless, it was a 
cloud, and he fiercely resented Its presence ; per- 
haps It would be more correct to say that he 
fiercely resented his inability to dissipate it. 

* Mr. Sampson Levi wishes to see you, sir,' the 
servant repeated, having received no sign that his 
master had heard him. 

' So I hear,' said Racksole. * Does he want to 
see me, personally ? ' 

* He asked for you, sir.* 

* Perhaps it is Rocco he wants to see, about a 
menu or something of that kind ? ' 

* I wiU inquire, sir,' and the servant made a 
move to withdraw.

* Stop,* Racksole commanded suddenly. * De- 
sire Mr. Sampson Levi to step this way.* 

The great stockbroker of the * Kaffir Circus * 
entered with a simple unassuming air. He was a 
rather short, florid man, dressed like a typical 
Hebraic financier, with too much watch-chain and 
too litde waistcoat. In his fat hand he held a gold- 
headtd cane, and an absolutely new silk hat — for 
it was Friday, and Mr. Levi purchased a new hat 
every Friday of his life, holiday times only 
excepted. He breathed heavily and sniflTed 
through his nose a good deal, as though he had 
just performed some Herculean physical labour. 
He glanced at the American millionaire with an 
expression in which a slight embarrassment might 
have been detected, but at the same time his round, 
red face disclosed a certain frank admiration and 
good-nature. 

*Mr. Racksole, I believe — Mr. Theodore 
Racksole. Proud to meet you, sir.* Such were 
the first words of Mr. Sampson Levi. In form 
they were the greeting of a third-rate chimney- 
sweep, but, strangely enough, Theodore Racksole 
liked their tone. He said to himself that here, 
precisely where no one would have expected to 
find one, was an honest man. 

* Good-day,' said Racksole briefly. * To what 
do I owe the pleasure ' 




THE COURT PAWNBROKER 121 



*I expect your *i;^ie is limited,' answered 



Sampson Levi. 



nyhow, iiv.ii is, and so I'll 



come straight to th , point, Mr Racksole. I'm a 
plain man. I don't j_i2;e.'.i to be a gentleman or 
any nonsense of that kind. I'm a stockbroker, 
that's what I am, and I don't care who knows it. 
The other night I had a ball in this hotel. It cost 
me a couple of thousand and odd pounds, and, by 
the way, I wrote out a cheque for your bill this 
morning. I don't like balls, but they're useful to 
me, and my little wife likes 'em, and so we give 
'em. Now, I've nothing to say against the hotel 
management as regards that ball : it was very 
decently done, very decently, but what I want to 
know is this — Why did you have a private detec- 
tive among my guests.? ' 

* A private detective .? * exclaimed Racksole, 
somewhat surprised at this charge. 

*Yes,' Mr. Sampson Levi said firmly, fanning 
himself in his chair, and gazing at Theodore Rack- 
sole with the direct earnest expression of a man 
having a grievance. * Yes ; a private detective. 
It's a small matter, I know, and I dare say you 
think you've got a right, as proprietor of the show, 
to do what you like in that line ; but I've just 
called to tell you that I object. I've called as a 
matter of principle. I'm not angry ; it's the 
principle of the thing.'

* My dear Mr. Levi,' said Racksole, * I assure 
you that, having let the Gold Room to a private 
individual for a private entertainment, I should 
never dream of doing what you suggest.' 

* Straight ? ' asked Mr. Sampson Levi, using 
his own picturesque language. 

* Straight,' said Racksole smiling. 

* There was a gent present at my ball that I 
didn't ask. I've got a wonderful memory for faces, 
and I know. Several fellows asked me afterwards 
what he was doing there. I was told by someone 
that he was one of your waiters, but I didn't 
believe that. I know nothing of the Grand Baby- 
lon ; it's not quite my style of tavern, but I don't 
think you'd send one of your own waiters to watch 
my guests — unless, of course, you sent him as 
a waiter ; and this chap didn't do any waiting, 
though he did his share of drinking.' 

* Perhaps I can throw some light on this mys- 
tery,' said Racksole. * I may tell you that I was 
already aware that a man had attended your bali 
uninvited.' 

* How did you get to know ? * 

* By pure chance, Mr. Levi, and not by inquiry. 
That man was a former waiter at this hotel — the 
head waiter, in fact — ^Jules, No doubt you have 
heard of him.' 

* Not I,' said Mr. Levi positively. 






THE COURT PAWNBROKER 123 



* Ah I ' said Racksole, * I was informed that 
everyone knew Jules, but it appears not. Well, 
be that as it may, previously to the night of your 
ball, I had dismissed Jules. I had ordered him 
never to enter the Babylon again. But on that 
evening I encountered him here — not in the Gold 
Room, but in the hotel itself. I asked him to ex- 
plain his presence, and he stated he was your 
guest. That is all I know of the matter, Mr. Levi, 
and I am extremely sorry that you should have 
thought me capable of the enormity of placing a 
private detective among your guests.' 

*This is perfectly satisfactory to me,' Mr. 
Sampson Levi said, after a pause. * I only wanted 
an explanation, and I've got it. I was told by 
some pals of mine City I might rely on Mr. 

Theodore Racksole j ^ straight to the point, and 
I'm glad they were right. Now as to that feller 
Jules, I shall make my own inquiries as to him. 
Might I ask you why you dismissed him ? ' 

* I don't know why I dismissed him.' 

* You don't know .? Oh ! come now ! I'm 
only asking because I thought you might be able 
to give me a hint why he turned up uninvited at 
my ball. Sorry if I'm too inquisitive.' 

* Not at all, Mr. Levi ; but I really don't know. 
I only sort of felt that he was a suspicious character. 
I dismissed him on instinct, as it were. See .?'

Without answering this question Mr. Levi 
asked another. * If this Jules is such a well-known 
person,' he said, *how could the feller hope to 
come to my ball without being recognised ? ' 

* Give it up,' said Racksole prompdy. 

* Well, I'll be moving on,* was Mr. Sampson 
Levi's next remark. * Good-day, and thank ye. I 
suppose you aren't doing anything in Kaffirs .? ' 

Mr. Racksole smiled a negative. 

* I thought not,' said Levi. * Well, I never 
touch American rails myself, and so I reckon we 
sha'n't come across each other. Good-day.* 

* Good-day,' said Racksole politely, following 
Mr. Sampson Levi to the door. With his hand 
on the handle of the door, Mr. Levi stopped, and, 
gazing at Theodore Racksole with a shrewd, 
quizzical expression, remarked : 

* Strange things been going on here lately, eh .' ' 
The two men looked very hard at each other 

for ssveral seconds. 

* Yes,' Racksole assented. * Know anything 
about them ? ' 

* Well — no, not exactly,' said Mr. Levi. * But 
I had a fancy you and I might be useful to each 
other ; I had a kind of fancy to that effect.* 

* Come back and sit down again, Mr. Levi,* 
Racksole said, attracted by the evident straight- 
forwardness of the man's tone. ' Now, how can 



THE COURT PAWNBROKER 



125 



we be of service to each other ? I flatter myself 
I'm something of a judge of character, especially 
financial character, and I tell you — if you'll put 
your cards on the table, I'll do ditto with mine.' 

* Agreed,' said Mr. Sampson Levi. * I'll begin 
by explaining my interest in your hotel. I have 
been expecting to receive a summons from a 
certain Prince Eugen of Posen to attend him here, 
and that summons hasn't arrived. It appears that 
Prince Eugen hasn't come to London at all. 
Now, I could have taken my dying davy that he 
would have been here yesterday at the ];test.' 

* Why were you so sure ? ' 

* Question for question,' said Levi. * Let's 
clear the ground first, Mr. Racksole. Why did 
you buy this hotel .? That's a conundrum that's 
been puzzling a lot of our fellows in the City for 
some days past. Why did you buy the Grand 
Babylon .? And what is the next move to be ? ' 

* There is no next move,' answered Racksole 
candidly, * and I will tell you why I bought the 
hotel ; there need be no secret about it. I bought 
it because of a whim.' And then Theodore Rack- 
sole gave this little Jew, whom he had begun to 
respect, a faithful account of the transaction with 
Mr. Fdix Babylon. < I suppose,' he added, < you 
find a difficulty in appreciating my state of mind 
when I did the deal.'

* Not a bit,' said Mr. Levi. * I once bought 
an electric laun'-h on the Thames in a very 
similar way, and it turned out to be one of the 
most satisfactory purchases I ever made. Then 
it's a simple accident that you own this hotel at 
the present moment ? ' 

* A simple accident — all because of a beefsteak 
and a bottle of Bass.' 

* Um r grunted Mr. Sampson Levi, stroking 
his triple chin. 

*To return to Prince Eugen,' Racksole re- 
sumed. * I was expecting His Highness here. The 
State apartments had been prepared for him. He 
was due on the very afternoon that young Dim- 
mock died. But he never came, and I have not 
heard why he has failed to arrive ; nor have I seen 
his name in the papers. What his business was 
in London, I don't know.' 

* I will tell you,' said Mr. Sampson Levi, * he 
was coming to arrange a loan.* 

* A State loan.?' 

* No — a private loan.* 

* Whom from ? ' 

*From me, Sampson Levi. You look sur- 
prised. If you'd lived in London a little longer, 
you'd know that I was just the person the Prince 
would come to. Perhaps you aren't aware that 
down Throgmorton Street way I'm called « The

the mmor, second-class Princes of Europe. I'm a 
s^ckbroker but my real business is'financL 
some of the httleCourtsof Europe. Now,I ^^ 
tell you that the Hereditary Prince of Posen 
particularly wanted a million, and he wanted it by 
a certain date, and he knew that if the affair wasnt 
hxed up by a certain time here he wouldn't be 
able to get it by that certain date. That's why 
I m surprised he isn't in London.' ^ 

* What did he need a million for ? ' 

I Debts,' answered Sampson Levi laconically. 

* His own .? ' ^

^ But would not the Emperor know of this 
proposed loan ? ' 

*Not necessarily at once. It could be so 
managed. Twig ? ' Mr. Sampson Levi laughed. 
* I've carried these little afFairs through before. 
After marriage it might be allowed to leak out. 
And you know the Princess Anna's fortune is 
pretty big ! Now, Mr. Racksole,' he added, 
abruptly changing his tone, * where do you suppose 
Prince Eugen has disappeared to .? Because if 
he doesn't turn up to-day he can't have that 
million. To-day is the last day. To-morrow the 
money will be appropriated elsewhere. Of course, 
I'm not alone in this business, and my friends have 
something to say.' 

*You ask me where I think Prince Eugen 
has disappeared to ? ' 
«Ido.' 

• Then you think it's a disappearance .? ' 
Sampson Levi nodded. 'Putting two and 
two together,' he said, * 1 do. The Dimmock 
business is very peculiar — very peculiar, indeed. 
Dimmock was a left-handed relation of the Posen 
family. Twig ? Scarcely anyone knows that. 
He was made secretary and companion to Prince 
Aribert, just to keep him in the domestic circle. 
His mother was an Irishwoman, whose misfortune 
was that she was too beautiful. Twig ? * (Mr. 



THE COURT PAWNBROKER 129 

Sampson Levi ,^ways used this extraordinary word 
when he was in a communicative mood.) * My 
belief is that Dimmock's death has something to 
do with the disappearance of Prince Eugen. The 
only thing that passes me is this : Why should 
anyone want to make Prince Eugen disappear ? 
The poor little Prince hasn't an enemy in the 
world. If he's been « copped," as they say, why

* What do you mean ? ' ::sked JVIr. Levi. 

• I mean this : Suppose some other European 
pauper Prince was anxious to marry Princess 
Anna and her fortune, wouldn't that Prince have 
an mterest m stopping this loan of yours to Prince 
Eugen ? Wouldn't he have an interest in causing 
Pnnce Eugen to disappear~at any rate, for a 
time f* ' * 

Sampson Levi thought hard for a few 
moments. 

* Mr. Theodore Racksole,' he said at length, « I 
do believe you have hit on something.'

■ i! 






On the afternoon of the same day — the interview 
just described had occurred in the morning — Rack- 
sole was visited by another idea, and he said to 
himself that he ought to have thought of it before. 
The conversation vkh Mr. Sampson Levi had 
continued for a cj.iaiderable time, and the two 
men had exchanged various notions, and agreed to 
meet again, but the theory that Reginald Dimmock 
had probably been a traitor to his family — a traitor 
whose repentance had caused his death — had not 
been thoroughly discussed ; the talk had tended 
rather to Continental politics, with a view to dis- 
covering what princely family might have an 
interest in the temporary disappearance of Prince 
Eugen. Now, as Racksole considered in detail 
the particular affair of Reginald Dimmock, de- 
ceased, he was struc-k by one point especially, to 
wit : Why had Dimmock and Jules manoeuvred 
to turn Nella Racksole out of Room No. 1 1 1 on 
that first night ? That they had so manoeuvred, 






ROCCO AND ROOM NO. iii 131 

that the broken window-pane was not a mere 
accident, Racksole felt perfectly sure. He had 
felt perfectly sure all along ; but the significance 
of the facts had not struck him. It was plain to 
him now that there must be something of extra- 
ordinary and peculiar importance about Room 
No. III. After lunct; he wandered quietly up- 
stairs and looked at Room No. 1 1 1 ; that is to 
say, he looked at the outside of it j it happened 
to be occupied, but the guest was leaving that 
evening. The thought crossed his mind that 
there could be no object in gazing blankly at the 
outside of a room ; yet he gazed ; then he wan- 
dered quickly down again to the next floor, and 
in passing along the corridor of that floor he 
stopped, and with an involuntary gesture 
stamped his foot. 

}reat Scott ! ' he said, « I've got hold of 
something — No. iii is exactly over the State 
apartments.' 

He went to the bureau, and issued instructions 
that No. 1 1 1 was not to be re-let to anyone until 
further orders. At the bureau they gave him 
Nella's note, which ran thus : 

* Dearest Papa, — I am going away for a day 
or two on the trail of a clue. If I'm not back in 
three days, begin to inquire for me at Ostend. 

K2

132 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

Till then leave me alone.— Your sagacious 
daughter, 

* Nell/ 



These few words, in Nella's large scrawling 
hand, filled one side of the paper. At the bottom 
was a P.T.O. He turned over, and read the 
sentence, underlined, *P.S.— -Keep an eye on 
Rocco.* 

* I wonder what the little creature is up to ? ' 
he murmured, as he tore the letter into small 
fragments, and threw them into the waste-paper 
basket. Then, without any delay, he took the 
lift down to the basement, with the object of 
making a preliminary inspection of Rocco in his 
lair. He could scarcely bring himself to believe 
that this suave and stately gentleman, this en- 
thusiast of gastronomy, was concerned in the 
machinations of Jules and other rascals unknown. 
Nevertheless, from habit, he obeyed his daughter, 
giving her credit for a certain amount of per- 
spicuity and cleverness. 

The kitchens of the Grand Babylon Hotel are 
one of the wonders of Europe. Only three years 
before the events now under narration Fdix 
Babylon had had them newly installed with every 
device and patent that the ingenuity of two Con- 
tinents could supply. They covered nearly an 



ii 



-mr 



ROCCO AND ROOM NO. in 133 

acre of superficial space. They were walled and 
floored from end to end with tiles and marble, 
which enabled them to be washed down every 
morning like the deck of a man-of-war. Visitors 
were sometimes taken to see the potato-paring 
machine, the patent plate-dryer, the Babylon-spit 
(a contrivance of Fdix Babylon's own), the silver- 
grill, the system of connected stock-pots, and other 
amazing phenomena of the department. Some- 
times, if they were fortunate, they might also see 
the artist who sculptured ice into forms of men 
and beasts for table ornaments, or the first napkin- 
folder in London, or the man who daily in\'ented 
fresh designs for pastry and blancmanges. Twelve 
chefs pursued their labours in those kitchens, 
helped by ninety assistant chefs, and a further 
army of unconsidered menials. Over all these was 
Rocco, supreme and unapproachable. Half-way 
along the suite of kitchens, Rocco had an apartment 
of his own, wherein he thought out those magnifi- 
cent combinations, those marvellous feats of suc- 
culence and originality, which had given him his 
fame. Visitors never caught a glimpse of Rocco 
in the kitchens, though sometimes, on a special 
night, he would stroll nonchalantly through the 
dining-room, like the great man he was, to receive 
the compliments of the hotel habitues — people 
of insight who recognised his uniqueness. 















mi 



134 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

Theodore Racksole's sudden and unusual ap- 
pearance in the kitchen caused a little stir. He 
nodded to some of the chefs, but said nothing to 
anyone, merely wandering about amid the maze 
of copper utensils and white-capped workers. At 
length he saw Rocco, surrounded by several 
admiring chefs. Rocco was bending over a freshly- 
roasted partridge which lay on a blue dish. He 
plunged a long fork into the back of the bird, and 
raised it in the air with his left hand. In his right 
he held a long glittering carving-knife. He was 
giving one of his world-famous exhibitions of 
carving. In four swift, unerring, delicate, perfect 
strokes he cleanly severed the limbs of the 
partridge. It was a wonderful achievement — 
how wondrous none but the really skilful carver 
can properly appreciate. Th*? chefs emitted a 
hum of applause, and Rocco, long, lean, and 
graceful, retired to his own apartment. Racksole 
followed him. Rocco sat in a chair, one hand 
over his eyes ; he had not noticed Theodore 
Racksole. 

* What are you doing, M. Rocco ? ' the 
millionaire asked smiling. 

* Ah I ' exclaimed Rocco, starting up with an 
apology. * Pardon ! I was inventing a new 
mayonnaise, which I shall need for a certain menu 
next week.* 



ROCCO AND ROOM NO. in 135 



* Do you invent these things without materials, 
then ? ' questioned Racksole. 

* Certainly. I do dem in my mind. I tink 
dem. Why should I want materials ? I know 
all flavours. I tink, and tink, and tink, and it is 
done. I write down. I give the recipe to my 
best chef— dere you are. ! need not even taste, I 
know how it will taste. It is like composing 
music. De great composers do not compose at 
de piano.' 

* I see,' said Racksole. 

* It is because I work like dat dat you pay me 
tree tousand a year," Rocco added gravely. 

< Heard about Jules ? ' said Racksole abruptly. 

« Jules?' 

*Yes. He's been arrested in Ostend,' the 
millionaire continued, lying cleverly at a venture. 
* They say that he and several others are impli- 
cated in a murder case— the murder of Reginald 
Dimmock.' 

* Truly ? • drawled Rocco, scarcely hiding a 
yawn. His indifference was so superb, so gorgeous, 
that Racksole instantly divined that it was assumed 
for the occasion. 

* It seems that, after all, the police are good 
for something. But this is the first time I ever 
knew them to be worth their salt. There is to 
be a thorough and systematic search of the hotel

to-morrow; Racksole went on. < I have mentioned 
It to you to warn you that so far as you are con- 
cerned the search is of course merely a matter of 
form. You wiU not object to the detectives 
lookmg through your rooms ? ' 

'Certainly not,* and Rocco shrugged his 
shoulders. 

* I shaU ask you to say nothing about this to 
anyone,' said Racksole. «The news of Jules- 
arrest is quite private to myself. The papers 
know nothing of it. You comprehend ? * 

Rocco smiled in his grand manner, and Rocco's 
master thereupon went away. Racksole was very 
weU satisfied with the little conversation. It was 
perhaps dangerous to tell a series of mere lies to a 
clever feUow like Rocco, and Racksole wondered 
how he should ultimately explain them to this 
^eat master<:hef if his and Nella's suspicions 
should be unfounded, and nothing came of them. 
Nevertheless, Rocco's manner, a strange elusive 
somethmg in the man's eyes, had nearly convinced 
Racksole that he was somehow implicated in 
Jules' schemes— and probably in the death of 
Regmald Dimmock and the disappearance of 
Pnnce Eugen of Posen. 

That night, or rather about half-past one the 
next morning, when the last noises of the hotel's 
life had died down, Racksole made his way to 



ROCCO AND ROOM NO. in 137 

Room 111 on the second floor. He locked the 
door on the inside, and proceeded to examine the 
place, square foot by square foot. Every now 
and then some creak or other sound startled him, 
and he listened intently for a few seconds. The 
bedroom was ftirnished in the ordinary splendid 
style of bedrooms at the Grand Babylon Hotel, 
and m that respect called for no remark. What 
most mterested Racksole was the flooring. He 
pulled up the thick Oriental carpet, and peered 
along every plank, but could discover nothing 
unusual. Then he went to the dressing-room, 
and finaUy to the bathroom, both of which opened 
out of the main room. But in neither of these 
smaller chambers was he any more successful than 
m the bedroom itself Finally he came to the 
bath, which was enclosed in a panelled casing of 
pohshed wood, after the manner of baths. Some 
baths have a cupboard beneath the taps, with a 
door at the side, but this one appeared to have 
none. He tapped the panels, but not a single 
one of them gave forth that * curious hollow sound* 
which usually betokens a secret place. Idly he 
turned the cold-tap of the bath, and the water 
began to rush in. He turned off the cold-tap 
and turned on the waste-tap, and as he did so 
his knee, which was pressing against the panelling, 
slipped forward. The panelling had given way 



ill 



lit 

r 






138 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

and he saw that one large panel was hinged from 
the inside, and caught with a hasp, also on the 
inside. A large space withi. the casing at the 
end of the bath was *' us revealed. Before doing 
anything else, Racksole tried to repeat the trick 
with the waste-tap, but he failed ; it would not 
work again, nor could he in any way perceive that 
there was any connection between the rod of the 
waste-tap and the hasp of the panel. Racksole 
could not see into the cavity within the casing, 
and the electric light was fized, and could not be 
moved about like a candle. He felt in his 
pockets, and fortunately discovered a box of 
mat iies. Aided by these, he looked into the 
cavity, and saw nothing ; nothing except a rather 
large hole at the far end — some three feet from the 
casing. With some difficulty he squeezed himself 
through the open panel, and took a half-kneeling, 
hn^-sitting posture within. There he struck a 
match, and it was a most unfortunate thing that 
in striking, the box being half open, he set fire to 
all the matches, and was half smothered in the 
atrocious stink of phosphorus which resulted. One 
match burned clear on the floor of the cavity, and, 
rubbing his eyes, Racksole picked it up, and 
looked down the hole which he had previously 
descried. It was a hole apparently bottomless, 
and about eighteen inches square. The curious 



ROCCO AND ROOM NO. in 139 

part about the hole was that a rope-ladder hung 
down it. When he saw that rope-ladder Racksole 
smiled the smile of a happy man. 

The match went out. 

Should he make a long journey, perhaps to 
some distant corner of the hotel, for a fresh box 
of matches, or should he attempt to descend that 
rope-ladder in the dark ? He decided on the 
latter course, and he was the more strongly 
moved thereto as he could now distinguish a 
faint, a very faint tinge of light at the bottom of 
the hole. 

With infinite care he compressed himself into 
the well-like hole, and descended the ladder. At 
length he arrived on firm ground, perspiring, but 
quite safe and quite excited. He saw now that 
the tinge of light came through a small hole in 
the wood. He put his eye to the wood, and 
found that he had a fine view of the State bath- 
room, and through the door of the State bath- 
room into the State bedroom. At the massive 
marble-topped washstand in the State bedroom a 
man was visible, bending over some object which 
lay thereon. 

The man was Rocco I

CHAPTER XIII 



IK THB STATE BEDROOM 



It was of course plain to Racksole that the 
peculiar passage-way which he had, at great 
personal inconvenience, discovered between the 
bathroom of No. 1 1 1 and the State bathroom on 
the floor below must have been specially designed 
by some person or persons for the purpose of 
keeping a nefarious watch upon the occupants of 
the State suite of apartments. It was a means of 
communication at once simple and ingenious. 
At that moment he could not be sure of the pre- 
cise method employed for it, but he surmised that 
the casing of the waterpipes had been used as a 
* well,' while space for the pipes themselves had 
been found in the thickness of the ample brick 
walls of the Grand Babylon. The eye-hole, 
through which he now had a view of the bedroom, 
was a very minute one, and probably would scarcely 
be noticed from the exterior. One thing he 
observed concerning it, namely, that it had been 
made for a man somewhat taller than himselt ; he 



( 



IN THE STATE BEDROOM 



HI 



was obliged to stand on tiptoe in order to get his 



the 



correct position. He remembered 
both Jules and Rocco were distinctly above the 
average height ; also that they were both thin 
men, and could have descended the well with 
comparative ease. Theodore Racksole, though 
not stout, was a well-set man with large bones. 

These things flashed through his mind as he 
gazed, spellbound, at the mysterious movements 
of Rocco. The door between the bathroom and 
the bedroom was wide open, and his own situation 
was such that his view embraced a considerable 
portion of the bedroom, including the whole of 
the immense and gorgeously-upholstered bedstead, 
but not including the whole of the marble wash- 
stand. He could see only half of the washstand, 
and at intervals Rocco passed out of sight as his 
lithe hands moved over the object which lay on 
the marble. At first Theodore Racksole could 
not decide what this object was, but after a time, 
as his eyes grew accustomed to the position and 
the light, he made it out. 

It was the body of a man. Or, rather, to be 
more exact, Racksole could discern the legs of a 
man on that half of the table which was visible to 
him. Involuntarily he shuddered, as the convic- 
tion forced itself upon him that Rocco had some 
unconscious human being helpless on that cold 



ifi

marble surface. The legs never moved. There- 
fore, the hapless creature was either asleep or 
under the influence of an anaesthetic — or (horrible 
thought!) dead. 

Racksole wanted to call out, to stop by some 
means or other the dreadful midnight activity 
which was proceeding before his astonished eyes ; 
but fortunately J e restrained himself. 

On the washstand he could see certain 
strangely-shaped utensils and instruments which 
Rocco used from time to time. The work seemed 
to Racksole to continue for interminable hours, and 
then at last Rocco ceased, gave a sign of satisfaction, 
whistled several bars from * Cavalleria Rusticana,' 
and came into the bathroom, where he took off 
his coat, and very quietly washed his hands. As 
he stood calmly and leisurely wiping those long 
fingers of his, he was less than four feet from 
Racksole, and the cooped-up millionaire trembled, 
holding his breath, lest Rocco should detect his 
presence behind the woodwork. But nothing 
happened, and Rocco returned unsuspectingly to 
the bedroom. Racksole saw him place some sort 
of white flannel garment over the prone form on 
the table, and then lift it bodily on to the great 
bed, where it lay awfully still. The hidden 
watcher was sure now that it was a corpse upon 
which Rocco had been exercising his mysterious 



ill;

and sinister functions. But whose corpse ? And 
what functions ? 

Could this be a West End hotel, Racksole's 
own hotel, in the very heart of London, the best- 
policed city in the world ? It seemed incredible, 
impossible ; yet so it was. Once more he remem- 
bered what F61ix Babylon had said to him, and 
realised the truth of the saying anew. The 
proprietor of a vast and complicated establishment 
like the Grand Babylon could never know a tithe 
of the extraordinary and queer occurrences which 
happened daily under his very nose ; the atmos- 
phere of such a caravanserai must necessarily be 
an atmosphere of mystery and problems apparently 
inexplicable. Nevertheless, Racksole thought that 
Fate was carrying things with rather a high hand 
when she permitted his chef to spend the night 
hours over a man's corpse in this State bed— '-^. 
this sacred apartment which was supposed to be 
occupied only by individuals of Royal Blood. 
Racksole would not have objected to a cejtain 
amount of mystery, but he decidedly thought that 
there was a little too much mystery here for his 
taste. He thought that even Fdix Babylon would 
have been surprised at this. 

The electric chandelier in the centre of the 
ceiling was not lighted ; only the two lights on 
cither side of the washstand were switched on, and 



m.

144 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

these did not sufficiently illuminate the features 
of the man on the bed to enable Racksole to 
see them clearly. In vain the millionaire 
strained his eyes ; he could only make out that 
the corpse was probably that of a young man. 
Just as he was wondering what would be the best 
course of action to pursue, he saw Rocco with a 
square-shaped black box in his hand. Then the 
chef switched off the two electric lights, and the 
State bedroom was in darkness. In that swift 
darkness Racksole heard Rocco spring on to the 
bed. Another half-dozen moments of suspense, 
and there was a blinding flash of white, which 
endured for several seconds, and showed Rocco 
standing like an evil spirit over the corpse, the 
black box in one hand and a burning piece of 
aluminium wire in the other. The aluminium 
wire burnt out, and darkr.^ss followed blacker 
than before. 

Rocco had photographed the corpse by flash 

light. 

But the dazzling flare which had disclosed 
the features of the dead man to the insensible 
lens of the camera had disclosed them also to Theo- 
dore Racksole. The dc*d man was Reginald 
Dimmock 1 

Stung into a lion by this discovery, Racksole 
tried to find the exit from his place of conceal- 



IN THE STATE BEDROOM 145 

ment. He felt sure that there existed some way 
out into the State bathroom, but he sought for it 
fruitlessly, groping with both hands and feet. 
Then he decided that he must ascend the rope- 
ladder, make haste for the first-floor corridor, and 
intercept Rocco when he left the State apartments. 
It was a painful and difficult business to ascend 
that thin and yielding ladder in such a confined 
space, but Racksole was managing it very nicely, 
and had nearly reached the top, when, by some 
untoward freak of chance, the ladder broke 
above his weight, and he slipped ignominiously 
down to the bottom of the wooden tube. Smother- 
ing ail excusable curse, Racksole couched, baffled. 
Then he saw that the force of his fall had somehow 
opened a trap-door at his feet. He squeezed 
through, pushed open another tiny door, and in 
another second stood in the ^: *- bathroom. He 
was dishevelled, perspiring, rather bewildered ; 
but he was there. In the next second he had re- 
sumed absolute command of all his faculties. 

Strange to say, he had moved so quietly that 
Rocco had apparently not heard him. He stepped 
noiselessly to the door between the bathroom and 
the bedroom, and stood there in silence. Rocco 
had switched on again the lights over the wash- 
stand, and was busy with his utensils. 
Racksole deliberately coughed.

The most extraordinary thing about the situa- 
tion was that at this juncture Theodore Racksole 
did not know what to say. He was so dum-

absolute and sublime calm, that both speech and 
thought failed him. 

* I give in,' said Rocco. * From the moment 
you entered this cursed hotel I was afraid of you. 
I told Jules I was afraid of you. I knew there 
would be trouble with a man of your kidney, and 
I was right ; confound it I I tell you I give in.

ROCCO ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS 147 

And with that Rocco sat down on a chair. It 
was magnificently done. Only a truly great man 
could have done it. Rocco actually kept his 
dignity. 

For answer, Racksole walked slowly into the 
vast apartment, seized a chair, and, dragging it up 
to Rocco's chair, sat down opposite to him. Thus 
they faced each other, their knees almost touching, 
both in evening dress. On Rocco's right hand 
was the bed, with the corpse of Reginald Dimmock. 
On Racksole's right hand, and a little behind him, 
was the marble washstand, still littered with Rocco's 
implements. The electric light shone on Rocco's 
left cheek, leaving the other side of his face in 
shadow. Racksole tapped him on the knee twice. 

* So you're another Englishman masquerading 
as a foreigner in my hotel,' Racksole remarked, by 
way of commencing the interrogation. 

* I'm not,' answered Rocco quietly. * I'm a 
citizen of the United States.' 

* The deuce you are ! ' Racksole exclaimed. 
*Yes, I was born at West Orange, New 

Jersey, New York State. I call myself an Italian 
because it was in Italy that I first made a name as 
a chef— at Rome. It is better for a great chef 
like me to be a foreigner. Imagine a great chef 
named Elihu P. Rucker. You can't imagine it, 
Mr. Racksole. I defy you to imagine it. I

changed my nationality for the same reason that 
my friend and colleague, Jules, otherwise Mr. 
Jackson, changed his.' 

* So Jules is your friend and colleague, is he ? * 
*He was, but from this moment he is no 

longer. I began to disapprove of his methods no 
less than a week ago, and my disapproval will 
now take an active form.* 

* Will it ? ' said Racksole. * I calculate it just 
won't, Mr. Elihu P. Rucker, citizen of the United 
States. Before yoil are very much older you'll be 
in the kind hands of the police, and your activities, 
in no matter what direction, will come to an 
abrupt conclusion.' 

* It is possible,' sighed Rocco. 

*In the meantime, I'll ask you one or two 
questions for my own private satisfaction. You've 
acknowledged that the game is up, and so you may 
as well answer them with as much candour as you 
feel yourself capable of. See ? ' 

* I see,' replied Rocco calmly, * but I guess I 
can't answer aJl questions. I'll do what I can.* 

*Well,' said Racksole, clearing his throat, 
* what's the scheme all about ? Tell me in a word.* 

* Not in a thousand words. It isn't my secret, 
you know.'

an instant at the corpse of the unfortunate younff 
man. ' ° 

* I don't know/ said Rocco. «I don't mind 
informing you that I objected to that part of the 
busmess. I wasn't made aware of tiU after it was 
done and then I teU you it got my dander up 
considerable.' *^ 

* You mean to say you don't know why Dim- 
mock was done to death } ' 

* I mean to say I couldn't see the sense of it. 
Of course he~er-died, because he sort of cried 
off the scheme, having previously taken a share of 
It. I don t mind saying ^hat much, because you 
probably guessed it for yourself. But I solemnly 
state that I have a conscientious objection to 
murder. •* 

* Then it was murder f *

« Who did It ? ' 

* Unfair question,' said Rocco. 

* Who else is in this precious scheme besides 
Jules and yourself?* 

'Don't know, on my honour.' 

* Well, then, teU me this. What have you 
been doing to Dimmock's body ? ' 

'How long were you in that bathroom?' 
Rocco pamed, with sublime impudence. 

'Don't question me, Mr. Rucker,' saidTheo- 



,50 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

dore Racksole. * 1 feel very much incUncd to 
break your back across my knee. Therefore 
I advise you not to irritate me. What have you 
been doing to Dimmock's body ? * 

* I've been embalming it* 

* Em — balming it.' 

* Certainly ; Richardson's system of arterial 
fluid injection, as improved by myself. You 
weren't aware that I included the art of embalm- 
ing among my accomplishments. Nevertheless, it 

is so.' 

* But why ? ' asked Racksole, more mystified 
than ever. * Why should you trouble to embahn 
the poor chap's corpse ? ' 

< Can't you see? Doesn't it strike you? 
That corpse has to be taken care of. It contains, 
or, rather, it did contain, very serious evidence 
against some person or persons unknown to the 
police. It may be necessary to move it about 
from place to place. A corpse can't be hidden for 
long ; a corpse betrays itself. One couldn't throw 
it into the Thames, for it would have been found 
inside twelve hours. One couldn't bury it— it 
wasn't safe. The only thing was to keep it handy 
and movable, ready for emergencies. I needn't 
inform you that, without embalming, you can't 
keep a corpse handy and movable for more than 
four or five days. It's the kind ot thing that 



'ill 









ROCCO ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS 151 

won't keep. And so it was suggested that 1 
should embalm it, and I did. Mind you, I still 
objected to the murder, but I couldn't go back on 
a colleague, you understand. You do understand 
that, don't you ? Well, here you are, and here it 
is, and that's all.' 

Rocco leaned back in his chair as though he 
had said everything that ought to be said. He 
closed his eyes to indicate that so far as he was con- 
cerned the conversation was also closed. Theodore 
Racksole stood up. 

*I hope,* said Rocco, suddenly opening his 
eyes, * I hope you'll call in the police without any 
delay. It's getting late, and I don't like going 
without my night's rest.* 

* Where do you suppose you'll get your night's 
rest ? ' Racksole asked. 

* In the cells, of course. Haven't I told you 
I know when I'm beaten. I'm not so blind as not 
to be able to see that there's at any rate a primd 
facie case against me. I expect I shall get off with 
a year or two's imprisonment as accessory after the 
feet — I think that's what they call it. Anyhow, I 
shaU be in a position to prove that I am not im- 
plicated in the murder of this unfortunate nincom- 
poop.* He pointed, with a strange, scornful 
gesture of his elbow, to the bed. * And now, shall 
we go ? Everyone is asleep, but there will be a

policeman within call of the watchman in the 
portico. I am at your service. Let us go down 
together, Mr. Racksole. I give you my word to 
go quietly.' 

*Stay a moment,' said Theodore Racksole 
curtly ; * there is no hurry. It won't do you any 
harm to forego another hour's sleep, especially as 
you will have no work to do to-morrow. I have 
one or two more questions to put to you.* 

* Well ? ' Rocco murmured, with an air of tired 
resignation, as if to ?ay, ^ What must be must be.* 

* Where has Dimmock's corpse been during 
the last three or four days, since he — died ? ' 

* Oh 1 ' answered Rocco, apparently surprised 
at the simplicity of the question. * It's been in my 
room, and one night it was on the roof ; once it 
went out of the hotel as luggage, but it came back 
the next day as a case of Demerara sugar. I forget 
where else it has been, but it's been kept perfectly 
safe and treated with every consideration.* 

* And who contrived all these manoeuvres ? * 
asked Racksole as calmly as he could. 

* I JiJ. That is to say, I invented them and I 
saw that they were carried out. You see, the 
suspicions of your police obliged me to be parti- 
cularly spry.* 

* And who carried them out ? * 

* Ah 1 that would be telling tales. But I don't

ROCCO ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS 153 

mind assuring you that my accomplices were inno- 
cent accomplices. It is absurdly easy for a man 
like me to impose on underlings — absurdly easy/ 

* What did you intend to do with the corpse 
ultimately ? ' Racksole pu-sued his inquiry with 
immovable countenance. 

* Who knows ? ' said Rocco, twisting his beau- 
tiful moustache. « That would have depended on 
several things— on your police, for instance. But 
probably in the end we should have restored this 
mortal clay '—again he jerked his elbow—* to the 
man's sorrowing relatives.' 

* Do you know who the relatives are ? * 

« Certainly. Don't you ? If you don't I need 
only hint that Dimmock had a Prince for his 
fether.* 

*It seems to me,' said Racksole, with cold 
sarcasm, *that you behaved rather clumsily in 
choosing this bedroom as the scene of your opera- 
tions.' 

« Not at all,* said Rocco. < There was no other 
apartment so suitable in the whole hotel. Who 
would have guessed that anything was going on 
here ? It was the very place for me.* 

* I guessed,' said Racksole succinctly. 

* Yes, you guessed, Mr. Racksole. But I had 
not counted on you. You are the only smart man 
in the business. You are an American citizen, and

I hadn't reckoned to have to deal with that class 
of person/ 

'Apparently I frightened you this afternoon ?* 

* Not in the least.' 

* You were not afraid of a search ? ' 

* I knew that no search was intended. I knew 
that you were trying to frighten me. You must 
really credit me with a litde sagacity and insight, 
Mr. Racksole. Immediately you began to talk to 
me in the kitchen this afternoon I felt you were 
on the track. But I was not frightened. I 
merely decided that there was no time to be lost— 
that I must act quickly. I did act quickly, but, 
it seems, not quickly enough. I grant that your 
rapidity exceeded mine. Let us go down-stairs, I 
beg.' 

Rocco rose and moved towards the door. 
With an instinctive action Racksole rushed forward 
and seized him by the shoulder. 

* No tricks I * said Racksole. * You're in my 
custody, and don't forget it.' 

Rocco turned on his employer a look of gentle, 
dignified scorn. 

* Have I not informed you,' he said, * that I 
have the intention of going quiedy ? ' 

Racksole felt almost ashamed for the moment. 
It flashed across him that a man can be great, even 
in crime. 



ROCCO ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS 155 



* What an ineffable fool you were,' said Rack- 
sole, stopping him at the threshold, * with your 
talents, your unique talents, to get yourself mixed 
up in an afJair of this kind. You are ruined. And, 
by Jove ! you were a great man in your own line.' 

* Mr. Racksole,' said Rocco very quickly, * that 
is the truest word you have spoken this night. I 
was a great man in my own line. And I am an 
ineifeble fool. Alas ! ' He brought his long 
arms to his sides with a thud. 

•Why did you do it?' 

^ I was fascinated — fascinated by Jules. He, 
too, is a great man. We had great opportunities, 
here in the Grand Babylon. It was a great game. 
It was worth the candle. The prizes were enor- 
mous. You would admit these things yourself if 
you knew the facts. Perhaps some day you will 
know them, for you are a fairly clever person at 
getting to the root of a matter. Yes, I was blinded, 
hypnotised.* 

* And now you are ruined.* 

* Not ruined, not ruined. Afterwards, in a few 
years, I shall come up again. A man of genius like 
me is never ruined till he is dead. Genius is always 
forgiven. I shall be forgiven. Suppose I am sent 
to prison. When I emerge I shall be no gaol-bird. 
I shall be Rocco — the great Rocco. And half 
the hotels in Europe will invite me to join them.'

* Let me tell you, as man to man, that you have 
achieved your own degradation. There is no 
excuse.* 

* I know it,* said Rocco. « Let us go.* 
Racksole was distinctly and notably impressed 

by this man— by this master spirit to whom he was 
to have paid a salary at the rate of three thousand 
pounds a year. He even felt very sorry for him. 
And so, side by side, the captor and the captured, 
they passed into the vast deserted corridor of the 
hotel. Rocco stopped at the grating of the first lift. 

* It will be locked,' said Racksole. « We must 
use the stairs to-night.* 

* But I have a key. I always carry one,* said 
Rocco, and he pulled one out of his pocket, and, 
unfastening the iron screen, pushed it open. 
Racksole smiled at his readiness and aplomb. 

♦After you,* said Rocco, bowing in his finest 
manner, and Racksole stepped into the lift. 

With the swiftness of Ightning Rocco pushed 
forward the iron screen, which locked itself auto- 
matically. Theodore Racksole was nopclessly a 
prisoner within the lift, while Rocco stood free in 
the corridor. 

•Good-bye, Mr. Racksole,' he remarked 
suavely, bowing again, lower than before. < Good- 
bye : I hate to tzlc a mean advantage of you in 
this fashion, but really you must allow that you 



ROCCO ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS 157 

have been veiy simple. You are a clever man, as 
I have already said, up to a certain point. It is 
past that point that my own cleverness comes in. 
Again, good-bye. After aU, I shaU have no rest 
to-night, but perhaps even that will be better than 
sleeping m a police ceU. If you make a great 
noise you may wake someone and ultimately get 
released from this lift. But I advise you to com- 
pose yourself, and wait till morning. It wiU bo 
more dignified. For the third time, good-bye ' 

And with that Rocco, without hastening, 
walked down the corridor and so out of sight 

Racksole said never a word. He was too dis- 
gusted with himself to speak. He clenched his 
fists, and put his teeth together, and held his 
breath. In the silence he could hear the dwindling 
sound of Rocco's footsteps on the thick carpet 
It was the greatest blow of Racksole's life. 
The next morning the high-born guests of the 
Orand Babylon were aroused by a rumour that 
by some accident the millionaire proprietor of the 
hotel had remained all night locked up in the 
lift. It was also stated that Rocco had quarrelled 
with his new master and incontinently lef- the 
place. A duchess said that Rocco's departure 

rr^ ^"T-'t ?''' ^^'^^ ^°'^^' whereupon her 
husband advised her not to talk nonsense. 

As for Racksble, he sent a message for the

i' 



detective in charge of the Dimmock afEiir, and 
■bravely told him the happenings of the previous 
night. The narration was a decided ordeal to a 
man of Racksole's temperament. 

* A strange story 1 ' commented Detective 
Marshall, and he could not avoid a smile. * The 
climax was unfortunate, but you have certainly 
got some valuable facts.* 

Racksole said nothing. 

* I myself have a due,' added the detective. 
* When your message arrived I was just coming 
up to see you. I want you to accompany me to 
a certain spot not far from here. Will you come, 
now, at once ? ' 

* With pleasure,' said Racksole. 

At that moment a page entered with a telegram. 
Racksole opened it and read : * Please come 
instantly. Nella. H6tel Wellington, Ostend.' 

He looked at his watch. 

* I can't come,' he said to the detective. * I'm 
going to Ostend.' 

* To Ostend?* 
*Yes, now.' 

*But, really, Mr. Racksole,* protested the 
detective. * My business is urgent.' 

* So's mine,' said Racksole. 

In ten minutes he was on his way to Victoria 
Station.

CHAPTER XV 

END OF THE YACHT ADVENTURE 

We must now return to Nella Racksole and 
Prince Aribert of Posen on board the yacht with- 
out a name. The Prince** first business ^wis to 
make Jules, otherwise Mr. Tom Jackson, perfectly 
^cure by means of several pieces of rope. 
Although Mr. Jackson had been stunned into a 
complete unconsciousness, and there was a con- 
tused wound under his ear, no one could say how 
soon he might not come to himself and get very 
violent. So the Prince, having tied his arms and 
legs, made him fast to a stanchion. 

* I hope he won't die,' said Nella. « He looks 
very white.' 

*The Mr. Jacksons of this world,' said Prince 
Aribert sententiously, 'never die till they are 
hung. By the way, I wonder how it is that 
no one has interfered with us. Perhaps they arc 
discreetly afraid of my revolver— of your revolver 
I mean.' ' 

Both he and Nella glanced up at the imperturb-

able steersman, who kept the yacht's head straight 
out to sea. By this time they were about a couple 
of miles from the Belgian shore. 

Addressing him in French, the Prince ordered 
the sailor to put the yacht about, and make again 
for Ostend Harbour, but the fellow took no 
notice whatever of the summons. The Prince 
raised the revolver, with the idea of frightening 
the steersman, and then the man began to talk 
rapidly in a mixture of French and Flemish. He 
said that he had received Jules' strict orders not to 
interfere in any way, no matter what might happen 
on the deck of the yacht. He was the captain of 
the yacht, and he had to make for a certain 
English port, the name of which he could not 
divulge : he was to keep the vessel at full steam 
ahead under any and all circumstances. He 
seemed to be a very big, a very strong, and a very 
determined man, and the Prince was at a loss 
what course of action to pursue. He asked 
several more questions, but the only effect of them 
was to render the man taciturn and ill-humoured. 
In vain Prince Aribert explained that Miss Nellie 
Racksole, daughter of millionaire Racksole, had 
been abducted by Mr. Tom Jackson ; in vain he 
flourished the revolver threateningly ; the surly, 
but courageous, captain said merely that that had 
nothing to do with him ; he had instruttiohs, and

but the possession of Nella's revolver, the Prince 
scarcely knew whether to carry the argument 
further, and with stronger measures, or to accept 
the situation with as much dignity as the circum- 
stances would permit. 

* Let us take the dinghy,' said Nella ; * we can 
row ashore in an hour.' 

He felt that she was right. To leave the 
yacht in such a manner seemed somewhat igno- 
minious, and it certainly involved the escape of 
that profound villain, Mr. Thomas Jackson. But 
what else could be done ? The Prince and Nella 
constituted one party on the vessel ; they knew 
their own strength, but they did not know the 
strength of their opponents. They held the 
hostile ringleader bound and captive/' at this man 
had proved himself capable of giving orders, and 
even to gag him would not help them if the 
captain of the yacht persisted in his obstinate 
course. Moreover, there was a distinct objection 
to promiscuous shooting ; the Prince felt that ; 
there was no knowing how promiscuous shooting 
might end. 

* We will take the dinghy,' said the Trince 
quickly, to the captain. 

A bell rang below, and a sailor and the negro 
boy appeared on deck. The pulsations of the 
screw grew less ra~:d. The yacht stopped. The 



1 



END OF THE YACHT ADVENTURE 163 

dinghy was lowered. As the Prince and Nella 
prepared to descend into the little cockboat Mr. 
Tom Jackson addressed Nella, aU bound as he lay.* 
* Good-bye,* he said, * I shall see you again, 
never fear.' 

In another moment they were in the di.ighy, 
and the dinghy was adrift. The yacht's screw 
churned the water, and the beautiful vessel slipped 
away from them. As it receded a figure appeared 
at the stern. It was Mr. Thomas Jackson. He 
had been released by his minions. He held a 
white handkerchief to his ear, and offered a calm, 
enigmatic smile to the two forlorn 'jut victorious 
occupants of the dinghy. Jules had been defeated 
for once m his life ; or perhaps it would be more 
just to say that he had been out-manoeuvred. 
Men like Jules are incapable of being defeated. 
It was characteristic of his luck that now, in the 
very hour when he had been caught red-handed 
in a serious crime against society, he should be 
effecting a leisurely escape— an escape which left 
no clue behind. 

The sea was utterly calm and blue in the 
morning sun. The dinghy rocked itself lazily in 
the swell of the yacht's departure. As the mist 
cleared away the oudine of the shore became corm 
distinct, and it appeared as if Ostend was distant 
scarcely a cable's length. The white dome of the

great Kursaal glittered in the pale turquoise sky, 
and the smoke of steamers in the harbour could 
be plainly distinguished. In the offing was a 
crowd of brown-sailed fishing luggers returning 
with the night's catch. The many-hued bathing- 
could be counted on the distant beach. 



vans 



Everything seemed perfecdy normal. It was 
difficult for either Nella or her companion to 
realise that anything extraordinary had happened 
within the last hour. Yet there was the yacht, 
not a mile off, to prove to them that something 
very extraordinary had, in fact, happened. The 
yacht was no vision, nor was that sinister watching 
figure at its stern a vision, either. 

* I suppose Jules was too surprised and too 
feeble to inquire how I came to be on board his 
yacht,' said the Prince, taking the oars. 

* Oh I How did you ? ' asked Nella, her fiice 
lighting up. * Really, I had almost forgotten that 
part of the affiiir.* 

*I must begin at the beginning, and it will 
take some time,* answered the Prince. * Had we 
not better postpone the recital till we get ashore ? * 

* I will row and you shall talk,' said Nella. 
* I want to know now.' 

He smiled happily at her, but gently declined 
to yield up the oars. 

* Is it not sufficient that I am here ? ' he said.

*It is sufficient, yes,' she replied, « but I want 
to know.* 

With a long, easy stroke he was pulling the 
dinghy shorewards. She sat in the stern-sheets. 

♦There is no rudder,' he remarked, « so you 
must direct me. Keep the boat's head on the 
lighthouse. The tide seems to be running in 
strongly ; that will help us. The people on shore 
will think that we have only been for a litde early 
morning excursion.' 

* Will you kindly tell me how it came about that 
you were able to save my life, Prince ? ' she said. 

* Save your life, Miss Racksole ? I didn't 
save your life ; I merely knocked a man down.' 

'You saved my life,' she repeated. «That 
yillam would have stopped at nothing. I saw it 
m his eye.* 

*Then you were a brave woman, for you 
showed no fear of death.' His admiring gaze 
rested fuU on her. For a moment the oars ceased 
to move. 

She gave a gesture of impatience. 

* It happened that I saw you last night in your 
carnage,' he said. «The fact is, I had not had 
the audacity to go to Berlin with my story. I 
stopped in Osteiid to see whether I could do a 
litUe detective work on my own account. It was 
a piece of good luck that I saw yon. I followed

the carriage as quickly as I could, and I just caught 
a glimpse of you as you entered that awful house. 
I knew that Jules had something to do with that 
house. I guessed what you were doing. I was 
afraid for you. Fortunately I had surveyed the 
house pretty thoroughly. There is an entrance 
to it at the back, from a narrow lane. I made 
my way there. I got into the yard at the back, 
and I stood under the window of the room where 
you had the interview with Miss Spencer. I 
heard everything that was said. It was a cour- 
ageous enterprise on your part to follow Miss 
Spencer from the Grand Babylon to Ostend. 
Well, I dared not force an entrance, lest I might 
precipitate matters too suddenly, and involve both 
of us in a difficulty. I merely kept watch. Ah, 
Miss Racksole I you were magnificent with Miss 
Spencer ; as I say, I could hear every word, for 
the window was slightly open. I felt that you 
needed no assistan*,e from me. And then she 
cheated you with a trick, and the revolver came 
flying through the window. I picked it up ; I 
thought it would probably be useful. There was 
a silence. I did not guess at first that you had 
fainted. I thought that you had escaped. When 
I found out the truth it was too late for me to 
intervene. There were two men, both desperate, 
besides Miss Spencer——-*

* Who was the other man ?* asked Nella. 

' I do not know. It was dark. They drove 
away with you to the harbour. Again I followed. 
I saw them carry you on board. Before the 
yacht weighed anchor I managed to climb unob- 
served into the dinghy. I lay down full length 
in it, and no one suspected that I was there. I 
think you know the rest.' 

* Was the yacht all ready for sea ? ' 

* The yacht was all ready for sea. The captain 
fellow was on the bridge, and steam was up.' 

* Then they expected me ! How could that be ?' 
•They expected some one. I do not think 

they expected you.* 

* Did the second man go on board ? * 

* He helped to carry you along the gangway, 
but he came back again to the carriage. He was 
the driver.' 

* And no one else saw the business ? * 

* The quay was deserted. You see, the last 
steamer had arrived for the night.' 

There was a brief silence, and then Nella ejacu- 
lated, under her breath, * Truly, it is a wonderful 
world I * 

And it was a wonderful world for them, 
though scarcely, perhaps, in the sense which Nella 
Racksole had intended. They had but just 
emerged from a highly disconcerting experience.

Among other minor inconveniences, they had had 
no breakfiist. They were out in the sea in a tiny 
boat. Neither of them knew what the day might 
bring forth. The man, at least, had the most 
serious anxieties for the safety of his Royal nephew. 
And yet — and yet — neither of them wished that 
that voyage of the little boat on the summer tide 
should come to an end. Each, perhaps uncon- 
sciously, had a vague desire that it might last for 
ever, he lazily pulling, she directing his course at 
intervals by a movement of her distractingly pretty 
head. How was this condition of afikirs to be 
explained ? Well, they were both young ; they 
both had superb health, and all the ardour of 
youth ; and — they were together. The boat was 
very small indeed ; her face was scarcely a yard 
from his. She, in his eyes, surrounded by the 
glamour of beauty and vast wealth ; he, in her 
eyes, surrounded by the glamour of masculine in- 
trepidity and the brilliance of a throne. 

But all voyages come to an end, either at the 
sho- J or at the bottom of the sea, and at length 
the dinghy passed between the stone jetties of the 
harbour. The Prince rowed to the nearest steps, 
tied up the boat, and they landed. It was six 
o'clock in the morning, and a day of gorgeous 
sunlight had opened. Few people were about at 
that early hour. 



END OF THE YACHT ADVENTURE 169 



* And now, what next ? * said the Prince. * I 
must take you to a hotel/ 

* I am in your hands,' she acquiesced, with a 
smile which sent the blood racing through his 
veins. He perceived now that she was tired and 
overcome, suffering from a sudden and natural 
reaction. 

At the H6te! Wellington the Prince told the 
sleepy door-keeper that they had come by the 
early train from Bruges, and wanted breakfast at 
once. It was absurdly early, but a common 
English sovereign will work wonders in any 
Belgian hotel, and in a very brief time Nella and 
the Prince were breakfasting on the verandah of 
the hotel upon chocolate that had been specially 
and hastily brewed for them. 

* I never tasted such excellent chocolate,* ex- 
claimed the Prince. 

The statement was wildly untrue, for the H6tel 
Wellington is not celebrated for its chocolate. 
Nevertheless Nella replied enthusiastically, * Nor 
I.' Then there was a silence, and Nella, feeling 
possibly that she had been too ecstatic, remarked 
in a very matter-of-fact tone : * I must telegraph 
to papa instantly.' 

Thus it was that Theodore Racksole received 
the telegram which drew him away from Detective 
Marshall.

CHAPTER XVI 

THB WOMAN WITH THE RED HAT 

* There is one thing, Prince, that we have just 
got to settle straight off,' said Theodore Racksole. 
They were all three seated — Racksole, his 
daughter, and Prince Aribert — round a dinner 
table in a private room at the H6tel Wellington. 
Racksole had duly arrived by the afternoon boat, 
and haa been met on the quay by the other two. 
They had dined early, and Racksole had heard the 
full story of the adventures by sea and land of 
Nella and the Prince. As to his own adventure of 
the previous night he said very little, merely 
explaining, with as little detail as possible, that 
Dimmock's body had come to light. 

* What is that ? ' asked the Prince, in answer 
to Racksole's remark. 

* We have got to settle whether we shall tell the 
police at once all that has occurred, or whether we 
shall proceed on our own responsibility. There 
can be no doubt as to which course we ought to 
pursue. Every consideration of prudence points 




THE WOMAN WITH THE RED HAT 171 



to the advisability of taking the police into our 
confidence, and leaving the matter entirely in their 
hands.' 

* Oh, papa 1 * Nella burst out in her pouting, 
impulsive way. * You surely can't think of such 
a thing. Why, the fun has only just begun.* 

* Do you call last night fun ? * questioned 
Racksole, gazing at her solemnly. 

* Yes, I do,' she said promptly. * Now.' 

* Well, I don't,' was the millionaire's laconic 
response ; but perhaps he was thinking of his own 
situation in the lift. 

* Do you not think we might investigate a little 
further,' said the Prince judiciously, as he cracked 
a walnut, *just a litde further — ^and then, if we 
foil to accomplish anything, there would still be 
ample opportunity to consult the police ? ' 

* How do you suggest we should begin ? ' asked 
Racksole. 

* Well, there is the house which Miss Racksole 
so intrepidly entered last evening ' — he gave her 
the homage of an admiring glance ; * you and I, 
Mr. Racksole, might examine that abode in detail.' 

'To-night?' 

* Certainly. We might do something.' 

* We might do too much.' 

* For example ? * 

* We might shoot someone, or get ourselves

mistaken for burglars. If we outstepped the law, 
it would be no excuse for us that we had been 
acting in a good cause/ 

• True,* said the Prince. « Nevertheless * 

He stopped. 

* Nevertheless jrou have a distaste for bringing 
the police into the business. You want the hunt 
all to yourself. You are on fire with the ardour 
of the chase. Is not that it ? Accept the advice 
of an older man, Prince, and sleep on this affeir. I 
have little fancy for nocturnal escapades two nights 
together. As for you, Nella, off with you to bed. 
The Prince and I will have a yarn over such fluids 
as can be obtained in this hole.* 

« Papa,* she said, «you are perfecdy horrid to- 
night.' 

•Perhaps I am,* he said. 'Decidedly I am 
very cross with you for coming over here all alone. 
It was monstrous. If I didn't happen to be the 
most foolish of parents— There 1 Good-night. 
It's nine o'clock. The Prince, I am sure, will 
excuse you.' 

If Nella had not really been very tired Prince 
Aribert might have been the witness of a good- 
natured but stubborn conflict between the million- 
aire and his spirited offspring. As it was, Nella 
departed with surprising docility, and the two men 
were left alone. 




THE WOMAN WITH THE RED HAT 173 

' Now,' said Racksolc suddenly, changing his 
tone, « I fancy that after all I'm your man for a 
litde amateur investigation to-night. And, if I 
must speak the exact truth, I think that to sleep 
on this affair would be about the very worst thing 
we could do. But I was anxious to keep Nella 
out of harm's way at any rate till to-morrow. She 
is a very difficult creature to manage, Prince, and 
I may warn you,' he laughed grimly, « that if we 
do succeed in doing anything to-night we shall 
catch it from her ladyship in the morning. Are 
you ready to take that risk ? ' 

* I am,' the Prince smiled. * But Miss Rack- 
sole is a young lady of quite remarkable nerve.' 

* She is,' said Racksole drily. * I wish some- 
times she had less.' 

* I have the highest admiration for Miss Rack- 
sole,' said the Prince, and he looked Miss 
Racksole's father fixll in the face. 

* You honour us, Prince,' Racksole observed. 
*Let us come to business. Am I right in 
assuming that you have a reason for keeping the 
police out of this business, if it can possibly be 
done .' * 

* Yes,' said the Prince, and his brow clouded. 
* I am very much afraid that my poor nephew has 
involved himself in some scrape that he would 
wish not to be divulged.*

* Then you do not believe that he is the victim 
of foul play ? ' 

* I do not.' 

* And the reason, if I may ask it ? * 

* Mr. Racksole, we speak in confidence— is it 
not so ? Some years ago my foolish nephew had 
an affair— an affair with a feminine star of the 
Berlin stage. For anything I know, the lady may 
have been the very pattern of her sex, but where 
a reigning Prince is concerned scandal cannot be 
avoided in such a matter. I had thought that the 
affair was quite at an end, since my nephew's 
betrothal to Princess Anna of Eckstein-Schwartz- 
burg is shortly to be announced. But yesterday 
I saw the lady to whom I have referred driving 
on the Digue. The coincidence of her presence 
here with my nephew's disappearance is too extra- 
ordinary to be disregarded.' 

* But how does this theory square with the 
murder of Reginald Dimmock ? ' 

* It does not square with it. My idea is that 
the murder of poor Dimmock and the disappear- 
ance of my nephew are entirely unconnected— 
unless, indeed, this Berlin actress is playing into 
the hands of the murderers. I had not thoueht 
of that.' ** 

* Then what do you propose to do to-night .? ' 
*I propose to enter the house which Miss 



THE WOMAN WITH THE RED JfAT 175 

Racksole entered last night and to find out some- 
thing definite.' 

*I concur,' said Racksole. «I shall heartily 
enjoy it. But let me tell you, Prince, and pardon 
me for speaking bluntly, your surmise is incorrect. 
I would wager a hundred thousand dollars that 
Prince Eugen has been kidnapped.* 

•What grounds have you for being so sure .? ' 

*Ahr said Racksole, * that is a long story. 

Let me begin by asking you this. Are you aware 

that your nephew, Prince Eugen, owes a million 

of money ? ' 

* A miUion of money ! ' cried Prince Aribert 
astonished. * It is impossible ! ' 

* Nevertheless, he does,' said Racksole calmly. 
Then he told him all he had learnt from Mr. 
Sampson Levi. 

«What have you to say to that.?' Racksole 
ended. Pnnce Aribert made no reply. 

« What have you to say to that .? ' Racksole 
insisted. 

* Merely that Eugen is ruined, even if he is 
alive.' 

* Not at all,' Racksole returned with cheerful- 
ness. « Not at all. We shaU see about that. 
The special thing that I want to know just now 
from you is this : Has any previous application 
ever beenmade for thehand of the Princess Anna ?'

; Yes. Last year. The King of Bosnia sued 
tor It, but his proposal was declined.* 
«Why?' 

'Because my nephew was considered to be a 
more suitable match for her.' 

* Not because the personal character of his 
Majesty of Bosnia is scarcely of the brightest ?' 

* No. Unfortunately, it is usuaUy impossible 
to consider questions of personal character when a 
royal match is concerned.' 

*Then, if for any reason the marriage of 
Fnncess Anna with your nephew was frustrated, the 
King of Bosnia would have a fair chance in that 
quarter ? ' 

* He would. The political aspect^ of things 
would be perfectly satisfactory.' 

* Thanks r said Racksole. «I wiU wager 
another hundred thousand dollars that some one 
m Bosnia— I don't accuse the King himself— is at 
tiie bottom of this business. The methods of 
Balkan politicians have always been half-Oriental 
I-et us go.' 

'Where?* 

*To this precious house of NeUa's adventure ' 
But surely it is too early ? ' 

* So it is,' said Racksole, « and we shaU want a 
fewthings^^too. For instance, a dark lantern. I 
think I will go out and forage for a lantern.*

• She would probably know me, but she hasn't 
looked up yet.' 

* Keep behind her, then. I propose to find her 
a Htde occupation.* 

By dint of a carefully-exercised diplomacy, 
Racksole manoeuvred himself into a seat opposite 
to the lady in the red hat. The fame of his 
success at the other table had followed him, and 
people regarded him as a serious and formidable 
player. In the fitst turn the lady put a thousand 
francs on double zero ; Racksole put a hundred 
on number nineteen and a thousand on the odd 
numbers. Nineteen won. Racksole received 
four thousand four hui.dred francs. Nine times 
in succession Racksole backed number nineteen 
and the odd numbers ; nine times the lady backed 
double zero. Nine times Racksole won and the 
lady lost. The other players, perceiving that the 
aflfair had resolved itself into a duel, stood back for 
the most part and watched those two. Prince 
Aribert never stirred from his position behind the 
great red hat. The game continued. Racksole 
lost trifles from time to time, but ninety-nine 
hundredths of the luck was with him. As an 
English spectator at the table remarked, «he 
couldn't do wrong.' When midnight struck the 
lady in the red hat was reduced to a thousand 
francs. Then she fell into a winning vei i for half 



THE WOMAN WITH THE RED HAT i8i 

an hour, but at one o'clock her resources were 
exhausted. Of the hundred and sixty thousand 
francs which she was reputed to have had early in 
the evening, Racksole held about ninety thousand, 
and the bank had the rest. It was a calamity for 
the Juno of the red hat. She jumped up, stamped 
her foot, and hurried from the room. At a dis- 
creet distance Racksole and the Prince pursued her. 
•It might be well to ascertain her movements," 
said Racksole. 

Outside, in the glare of the great arc lights, and 
within sound of the surf which beats always at the 
very foot of the Kursaal, the Juno of the red hat 
summoned a fiacre and drove rapidly away. Rack- 
cole and the Prince took an open carriage and 
started in pursuit. They had not, however, 
traveUed more than half a mUe when Prince 
Aribert stopped the carriage, and, bidding Rack- 
sole get out, paid the driver and dismissed him. 

* I feel sure I know where she is going,* he 
explained, *and it will be better for us to follow 
on foot* 

* You mean she is making for the scene of last 
night*s affair ? ' said Racksole. 

*Exsictly. We shall— what you call, kill two 
birds with one stone.* 

Prince Aribert's guess was correct. The lady*s 
carriage stopped in front of the house where Nella

suddenly disappeared. He pushed the window 
wide open. The room v/as in darkness, and

capacious pocket of his dist coat, and lighted it.

furniture except the chair on which the Hereditary 
Prince of Posen sat and a small deal table on 
which were a plate and a cup. 

* Eugen/ cried Prince Aribert once more, but 
this time his forlorn nephew made no response 
whatever, and then Aribert added in a low voice 
to Racksole : • Perhaps he cannot see us clearly/ 

*But he must surely recognise your voice,* 
said Racksole, in a hard, gloomy tone. 

There was a pause, and the two men above 
ground looked at each other hesitatingly. Each 
knew that they must enter that cellar and get 
Prince Eugen out of it, and each was somehow 
afraid to take the next step. 

* Thank God he is not dead I • said Aribert. 

* He may be worse than dead ! ' Racksole 
replied. 

* Worse than What do you mean ? * 

* I mean — he may be mad.* 

* Come,' Aribert almost shouted, with a sudden 
access of energy— a wild impulse for action. And, 
snatching the lantern from Racksole, he rushed 
into the dark room where they had heard the con- 
versation of Miss Spencer and the lady in the red 
hat. For a moment Racksole did not stir from the 
threshold of the window. « Come,' Prince Aribert 
repeated, and there was an imperious command in 
his utterance. < What are you afraid of f ' 



THE RELEASE OF PRINCE EUGEN 187 

* I don't know,' said Racksole, feeling stupid 
and queer ; * 1 don't know/ Then he marched 
heavily after Prince Aribert into the room. On 
the mantelpiece were a couple of candles which 
had been blown out, and in a mechanical, unthink- 
ing way, Racksole lighted them, and the two 
men glanced round the room. It presented no 
peculiar features : it was just an ordinary room, 
rather small, rather mean, rather shabby, with an 
ugly wall-paper and ugly pictures in ugly frames. 
Thrown over a chair was a man's evening-dress 
jacket. The door was closed. Prince Aribert 
turned the knob, but he could not open it. 

* It's locked,' he said. < Evidently they know 
we're here.* 

* Nonsense,' said Racksole brusquely; «how 
can they know ? ' And, taking hold of the knob, 
he violently shook the door, and it opened. * I 
told you it wasn't locked,' he added, and this 
small success of opening the door seemed to 
steady the man. It was a curious psychological 
effect, this terrorising (for it amounted to that) 
of two courageous full-grown men by the mere 
apparition of a helpless creature in a cellar. 
Gradually they both recovered from it. The 
next moment they were out in the passage which 
led to the front door of the house. The front 
door stood open. They looked into the street,

up and down, but there was not a soul in sight 
The street, lighted by three gas-lamps only, seercd 
strangely sinister and mysterious. 

J She has gone, that's clear,' said Racksole. 
meanmg the woman with the red hat. 

n„.l"^"'^J^J''u^P^"''' ^^' ^^'' ^° y°" think ?• 
questioned Aribert. 

'No. She would stay. She would never dare

The ceUar steps were happily not difficult to 
discover, for in moving a pace backwards Prince

himself to the bottom of them. The lantern 
showed that they were built on a curve. Silently 
Racksole resumed possession of the lantern and 
went first, the Prince close behind him. At the 
foot was a short passage, and in this passage 
crouched the figure of a woman. Her eyes thrTw 
back the rays of the lantern, shining like a cat's at 
midnight. Then, as the men went nearer, they 
saw that It was Miss Spencer who barred their way. 
She seemed half to kneel on the stone floor, and 
in one hand she held what at first appeared to be 
a dagger, but which proved to be nothing more 
romantic than a rather long bread-knife. 

'GetVT^ ^°"* ^ ^""'^ 5^°"*' «^« exclaimed. 
<jret back ; you mustn't come here.' 

There was a desperate and dangerous look on 



THE RELEASE OF PRINCE EUGEN 189 

her face, and her form shock with scarcely con- 
trolJed passionate energy. 

* Now see here. Miss Spencer,* Racksole said 
c^mly I guess we've had enough of this fandango. 
Youd better gtt up and clear out, or we'U just 
nave to drag you off.* 

He went calmly up to her, the lantern in his 
hand. Without another word she struck the knife 
into h,s arm, and the lantern feU extinguished. 
Racksole ^vc a cry, rather of angry surprise than 
of pam, and retreated a few steps. In the darkness 
they could still perceive the glint of her eyes. 

I told you you mustn't come here.' the 
woman said. « Now get back.' 

Racksole positively laughed. It was a queer 
laugh but he laughed, and he could not help it. 
The Idea of this woman, this bureau clerk, srop- 
ping his progress and that of Prince Aribert bv 
means of a bread-knife aroused his sense of 
humour. He struck a match, relighted the 
candle and faced Miss Spencer once more.

* No,* she answered. 

* I shall shoot/ 

She pressed her lips together. 
*I shall shoot,' he repeated. •One— two- 
three.* 

^ Bang, bang ! He had fired twice, purposely 
missing her. 

Miss Spencer never blenched. Racksole was 
tremendously surprised— and he would have 
been a thousandfold more surprised could he 
have contrasted her behaviour now with her abject 
terror on the previous evening when Nella had 
threatened her. 

* YouVe got a bit of pluck,* he said, < but it 
won't help you. Why won't you let us pass ? * 

As a matter of feet, pluck was just what she 
had not, really ; she had merely subordinated one 
terror to another. She was desperately afraid of 
Racksole's revolver, but she was much more afraid 
of something else. 

« Why won't you let us pass ? ' 

* I daren't,' she said, with a plaintive tremor ; 
* Tom put me in charge.* 

That was all. The men could see tears 
running down her poor wrinkled face. Theodore 
Racksoh began to take off his light overcoat. 

* I see I must take my coat off to you,* he 
said, and he almost smiled. Then, with a quick 



THE RELEASE OF PRINCE EUGEN 191 

movement, he threw the coat over Miss Spencer's 
head and flew at her, seizing both her arms, while 
irnnce Anbert assisted. 

Her struggles ceased—she was beaten. 

'That's aU right,' said Racksole : «I could 
never have used that revolver-to mean business 
with It, of course.' 

They carried her, unresisting, upstairs and on 
to the upper floor, where they locked her in a 
bedroom. She lay in the bed as if exhausted.

•Tom's got it,' she replied, feintly, to their 
question : « Tom's got it, I swear to you. He 
took it for safety.' 

*Then how do you feed your prisoner?* 
Racksole asked sharply. 

* Through the grating,' she answered. 

Both men shuddered. They felt she was 
speakmg the truth. For the third time they went 
to the cellar door, In vain Racksole thrust him- 
self against it ; he could do no more than shake it. 

•Let's try both together,' said Prince Aribert. 
•Now I' There was a crack. « Again,' said 
Pnnce Aribert. Th,re was another crack, and 
then the unper hinge gave way. The rest was 
^sy. Over the wreck of the door they entered 
Prince Eugen's prison. 

The captive stiU sat on his chair. The terrific 
noise and bustle of breaking down the door seemed 
not to have aroused him from his lethargy, but 
when Prince Aribert spoke to him in German he 
looked at his uncle. 

• Will you not come with us, Eugen ? ' said 
Pnnce Aribert; «you needn't stay here any 
longer, you know.' 

• Leave me alone,' was the strange reply ; «leave 
me alone. What do you want ? ' 

•We are here to get you out of this scrape,* 
said Aribert gently. Racksole stood aside. 



THE RELEASE OF PRINCE EUGEN 193 



Who is that fellow ? ' said Eugen sharply. 



'That 



friend 



, Racksole, 

man — or rather, I should say, an American — to 
whom we o\ e a great deal. Come and have 
supper, Eugen.* 

* I won't,' answered Eugen doggedly. * I'm 
waiting here for her. You didn't think anyone 
had kept me here, did you, against my will ? I 
tell you I'm waiting for her. She said she'd come.' 

* Who is she } ' Aribert asked, humouring him. 

* She ! Why, you know ! I forgot, of course, 
you don't know. You mustn't ask. Don't pry, 
Uncle Aribert. She was wearing r red hat.' 

* I'll take you to her, my dear Eugen.' Prince 
Aribert put bis hands on the other's shoulder, but 
Eugen shook him off violently, stood up, and then 
sat down again. 

Aribert looked at Racksole, and they both 
looked at Prince Eugen. The latter's face was 
flushed, and Racksole observed that the left pupil 
was more dilated than ♦: .: right. The man stared, 
muttered odd, fragmentary scraps of sentences, 
now grumbling, now whining. 

* His mind is unhinged,' Racksole whispered 
in English. 

* Hush ! ' said Prince Aribert. * He under- 
stands English.' But Prince Eugen took 
notice of the brief colloquy.

•We had better get him upstairs, somehow/ 
said Rac::joIe. 

JYes,' Aribert assented. *Eugen, the lady 
with the red hat, the lady you are waiting for, is 
upstairs. She has sent us down to ask you to 
come up. Won't you come ? ' 

JHimmel I ' the poor feUow exclaimed, with a

He rose, staggered towards Aribert, and fell 
headlong on the floor. He had swooned. The 
two men raised him, carried him up the stone steps, 
and laid him with infinite care on a sofa. He lay 
breathing queerly through the nostrils, his eyes 
Closed, his fingers contracted ; every now and then 
a convulsion ran through his frame. 

« One of us must fetch a doctor,' said Prince 
Aribert. 

* I will,' said Racksole. At that moment there 
was a quick, curt rap on the French window, and 
both Racksole and the Prince glanced round 
startled. A giri's face was pressed against the 
large window-pane. It was Nella's. Racksole 
unfastened the catch, and she entered. 

• I have found you,' she said lightly; «yoa 
might have told me. I couldn't sleep. I inquired 
from the hotel-folks if you had retired, and they 
said no ; so I slipped out. I guessed where you

were.' Racksole interrupted her with a quesaon 
as to what she meant by this escapade, but she 
stopped him with a careless gesture. 'What's 
this ? ' She pointed to the form on the sofe. 

*That is my nephew, Prince Eugen,' said 
Aribert. 

* Hurt ? * she inquired coldly. * I hope not.* 

* I 'e is ill,' said Racksole, * his brain is turned.' 
Nella began to examine the unconscious Prince 

with the expert movements of a girl who had 
passed through the best hospital course to be ob- 
tained in New York. 

* He has got brain fever,' she said. < That is 
all, but it will be enough. Do you know if there 
is a bed anywhere in this remarkable house ? *

I He must on no account be moved,' said the dark 
little Belgian doctor, whose eyes seemed to peer 
so quizzically through his spectacles ; and he said 
It with much positiveness. 

That pronouncement rather settled their plans 
for them. It was certainly a professional triumph 
tor Nella, who, previous to the doctor's arrival, 
had told them the very sa.ie thing. Considerable 
argument had passed before the doctor was sent 
f^. Pnnce Aribert was for keeping the whole 
affeir a deep secret among their three selves. 
Theodore Racksole agreed so far, but he suggested 
turther that at no matter what risk they should 
b-ansport the patient over to England at once. 
Kacksole had an idea that he should feel safer in 
that hotel of his, and better able to deal with any 
situation that might arise. Nella scorned the idea. 
In her quality of an amateur nurse, she assured 
theni that Prince Eugen was much more seriously 
111 than either of them suspected, and she urged 



IN THE NIGHT-TIME 



197 



that they should take absolute possession of the 
house, and keep possession till Prince Eugen v 
convalescent. * 

* But what about the Spencer female ? ' Rack- 
sole had said. 

' Keep her where she is. Keep her a prisoner. 
And hold the house against all comers. If Jules 
should come back, simply defy him to enter- 
that IS all. There are two of you, so you must 
keep an eye on the former occupiers, if they 
return, and on Miss Spencer, while I nurse the 
patient. But first, you must send for a doctor.* 

'Doctor!' Prince Aribert had said, alarmed. 
* Will it not be necessary to make some awkward 
explanation to the doctor ? ' 

*Not at all ! ' she replied. « Why should it 
be .? In a place like Ostend doctors are far too 
discreet to ask questions ; they see too much 
to retam their curiosity. Besides, do you want 
your nephew to die ? ' 

Both the men were somewhat taken aback by 
the girl's sagacious grasp of the situation, and it 
came about that they began to obey her like 
subordinates. She told her father to saUy forth 
m search of a doctor, and he went. She gave 
Pnnce Aribert certain other orders, and he 
promptly executed them. 

By the evening of the following day, every-

thing was going smoothly. The doctor came and 
departed several times, and sent medicine, and 
seemed fairly optimistic as to the issue of the 
lilness An old woman had been induced to come 

wIl/^^'"^ '^''"- ^'''' Spencer was 
kept out of sight on the attic floor, pendi ig some 
deasion as to what to do with her. And no one 
outsKietheh -e had asked any questions. The 
inhabitants ot that particular street must have 
been accustomed to strange behaviour on the part 
of their neighbours, unaccountPble appearances 
and disappearances strange flittings and arrivals. 
This strong-minded and active trio-Racksole, 
Nella a. Pnnce Anbert-might have been the 
lawful rmd accustomed tenants cf the house, for 
any outward evidence to the contrary. 

On the afternoon of the third day Prince 
Eugen was distinctly md seriously worse. Nella 
had sat up with him the previous night and 
throughout the day Her father had spent the 
morning at the hotel, and Prince Aribert had kept 
watch. The two men were never absent from the 
house at the same time, and one of then, always 
did duty as sentinel at n.ght. On this afternoon 
Prince Anbert and Nella sat together in the 
patient's bedroom. The doctor had just 1 ft

near the window, which looked on to the back- 
garden. It was a queer shabby little bedroom to 
shelter the august body of a European personage 
u u xr'«" ^"^'" of Posen. Curiously enough, 
both Nella and her father, ardent democrats though 
they were, had been somehow impressed by the 
royalty and importance of the fever-stricken Prince 
--impressed as they had never been by Aribert. 
They had both felt that here, under their care, was 
a species of individuality quite new to them, and 
different from anything they had previously en- 
countered. Even the gestures and tones of his 
delirium had an air of abrupt yet condescending 
command— an imposing mixture of suavity and 
haughtiness. As for Nelk, she had been first struck 
by the beautiful *E' over a crown on the sleeves 
of his hnen, and by the signet ring on his pale, 
emaciated hand. After all, these trifling outward 
signs are at least as effective as others of deeper 
but less obtrusive significance. The Racksoles, 
too, duly marked the attitude of Prince Aribert to 
his nephew : it was at once paternal and reverential • 
it disclosed cleariy that Prince Aribert continued,' 
in spite of everything, to regard his nephew as his 
sovereign lord and master, as a being surrounded 
by a natural and inevitable pomp and awe. This 
attitude, at the beginning, seemed false and unreal 
to the Americans ; it seemed to them to be

assumed ; but gradually they came to perceive 
that they were mistaken, and that though LerL

nevertheless that 'superstition' had ^oZy 
survived in another part of the world 

'You and Mr. Racksole have been extra-

*Ah!' he said, *who knows how this thing 
will end? All our trouble, our anxieties, our 
watchfulness, may come to nothing. I tell you 
that when I see Eugen lying there, and think that 
we cannot learn his story until he recovers, I am 
ready to go mad. We might be arranging things, 
making matters smooth, preparing for the future. 
It only we knew— knew what he can tell us. I 
teU you that 1 am ready to go mad. If anything 
should happen to you, Miss Racl'.ole, I would 
kill myself 

*But why.?' she questioned. * Supposing, 
that IS, that anything could happen to me— which 
It can't.' 

« Because I have dragged you into this,' he 
replied, gazing at her. 'It is nothing to you. 
You are only being kind.' 

* How do you know it is nothing to me. 
Prince f ' she asked him quickly. 

Just then the sick man made a convulsive 
movement, and Nella flew to the bed and soothed 
him. From the head of the bed she looked over 
at Prince Aribert, and he returned her bright 
excited glance. She was in her traveUing-frock' 
with a large white Belgian apron tied over it. 
Large dark circles of fatigue and sleeplessness

surrounded her eyes, and to the Prince her cheek 
seemed hoUow and thin ; her hair lay thick over 
the temples, half covering the ears. Aribert gave 
no answer to her query-merely gazed ather with 
melancholy mtensity. 

c V *^ ^ir!^ ^ "^^ ^° ^"^ '^^*'* «^e said at last, 
rou will know aU about the medicine.' 

* Sleep well,' he said, as he softly opened the 
door for her. And then he w?. alone with Eugen. 
It was his turn that night to watch, for they 
still haltepected some strange, sudden visit, or 
onslaught, or move of one kind or another, from 
J ules. Racksole slept in the parlour on the ground 
floor. Nella had the front bedroom on the 
first floor ; Miss Spencer was immured in the 
attic ; the last-named lady had been singularly 
quiet and incurious, taking her food from Nella 
and asking no questions ; the old woman went at 
nights to her own abode in the puriieus of the 
harbour. Hour after hour Aribert sat silent by 
his nephew's bedside, attending mechanically to his 
wants, and every now and then gazing hard into 
the vacant, anguis ed face, as if trying to extort 
trom that mask the secrets which it held. Aribert 
was tortured by the idea that if he could have 
only half an hour's, only a quarter of an hour's, 
rational speech with Prince Eugen, all might be 
cleared up and put right, and by the fact that that

clutched at her slender body, picked her up, 
carried her to the chair by the fire-place, and laid 
her in it. He had forgotten all about Eugen. 

*What is it, my angel? 'he whispered, and 
then he kissed her— kissed her twice. He could 
only look at her ; he did not know what to do to 
succour her. 

At last she opened her eyes and sighed. 

* Where am I .? ' she asked vaguely, in a tremu- 
lous tone. * Ah I • as she recognised him. ' Is it 
you .? Did I do anything silly .? Did 1 faint ? ' 

* What has happened ? Were you ill .? ' he 
questioned anxiously. He was kneeling at her 
feet, holding her hand tight. 

*I saw Jules by the side of my bed,' she mur- 
mured ; * I'm sure I saw him ; he laughed at me. 
I had not undressed. I sprang up, frightened, but 
he had gone, and then I ran downstairs— to you.' 

* You were dreaming,' he soothed her. 
«WasI?' 

*You must have been. I have not heard a 
sound. No one could have entered. But if you 
like I will wake Mr. Racksole.' 

* Perhaps I was dreaming,' she admitted. 
* How foolish I ' 

*You were over-tired,' he said, still un- 
consciously holding her hand. They gazed at 
each other. She smiled at him. 



IN THE NIGHT-TIME 205 

*You kissed me,' she said suddenly, and he 
blushed red and stood up before her. « Why did 
you kiss me ? ' 

* Ah I Miss Racksole,* he murmured, hurrying 
the words out. * Forgive me. It is unforgivable, 
but forgive me. I was overpowered by my feel- 
ings. I did not know what I was doing.' 

* Why did you kiss me ? ' she repeated. 

* Because— Nella I I love you. I have no 
right to say it ? ' 

* Why have you no right to say it ? ' 

* If Eugen dies, I shall owe a duty to Posen— 
I shall be its ruler.' 

* Well I ' she said calmly, with an adorable 
confidence. *Papa is worth forty millions. 
Would you not abdicate ? ' 

* Ah ! ' he gave a low cry. « Will you force me 
to say these things ? I could not shirk my duty to 
Posen, and the reigning Prince of Posen can only 
marry a Princess.' 

'But Prince Eugen will live,' she said positively, 
*and if he lives * 

*Then I shall be free. I would renounce all 
my rights to make you mine, if— if * 

* If w.hat. Prince?' 

* If you would deign to accept my hand.' 
*Am I, then, rich enough ?'

CHAPTER XIX 

ROYALTY AT THE GRAND BABYLON 

The Royal apartments at the Grand Babylon are 
fomous in the world of hotels, and indeed else- 
where, as being, in their own way, unsurpassed. 
Some of the palaces of Germany, and in particular 
those of the mad Ludwig of Bavaria, may possess 
rooms and saloons which outshine them in 
gorgeous luxury and the mere wild fairy-like 
extravagance of wealth ; but there is nothing, 
anywhere, even on Eighth Avenue, New York,' 
which can fairly be called more complete, more 
perfect, more enticing, or-— not least important- 
more comfortable. The suite consists of six 
chambers— the ante-room, the saloon or audience 
chamber, the dining-room, the yellow drawing- 
room (where Royalty receives its friends), the 
library, and the State bedroom— to the last of which 
we have already been introduced. The most im- 
portant and most impressive of these six is, 
of course, the audience chamber, an apartment 
fifty feet long by forty feet broad, with a superb 



'\ 



ao8 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

outlook over the Thames, the Shot Tower, and 
the higher signals of the South-Western RaUway. 
The iecoration of this room is mainly in the 
German taste, since four out of every six of its 
Royal occupants are of Teutonic blood ; but its 
chief glory is its French ceiling, a masterpiece by 
Fragonard, taken bodily from a certain femous 
Palace on the Loire. The walls are of paneUed 
oak, with an eight-foot dado of Arras cloth imi- 
tated from unique Continental examples. The 
carpet, woven in one piece, is an antique specimen 
of the finest Turkish work, and it was obtained, 
a bargain, by Fdix Babylon, from an impecunious 
Roumanian Prince. The silver candelabra, now 
fitted with electric light, came from the Rhine, and 
each has a separate history. The Royal c^air— 
it is not etiquette to call it a throne, though it 
amounts to a throne— was looted by Napoleon 
from an Austrian city, and bought by Fdix Baby- 
lon at the sale of a French collector. At each 
corner of the room stands a gigantic grotesque 
vase of German faience of the sixteenth century. 
These were presented to F^lix Babylon by William 
the First of Germany, upon the conclusion of his 
first incognito visit to London in connection with 
the French trouble of 1875. There is only one 
picture in the audience chamber. It is a portrait 
of the luckless but noble Dom Pedro, Emperor 



M 



ROYALTY AT THE GRAND BABYLON 209 

of the Brazils. Given to F61ix Babylon by Dom 
Pedro himself, it hangs there solitary and sublime 
as a reminder to Kings and Princes that Empires 
may pass away and greatness fall. A certain 
Prince who was occupying the suite during the 
Jubilee of 1887— when the Grand Babylon had 
seven persons of Royal blood under its roof— sent 
a curt message to Fdix that the portrait must be 
removed. Fdix respectfully declined to remove 
it, and the Prince left for another hotel, where he 
was robbed of two thousand pounds' worth ot 
jewellery. The Royal audience chamber of the 
Grand Babylon, if people only knew it, is one of the 
sights of London ; but it is never shown, and if 
you ask the hotel servants about its wonders they 
will tell you only foolish facts concerning it, as 
that the Turkey carpet costs fifty pounds to clean, 
and that one of the great vases is cracked across 
the pedestal, owing to the rough treatment accorded 
to it during a riotous game of Blind Man's BufF, 
played one night by four young Princesses, a 
Balkan King, and his aides-de-camp. 

In one of the window recesses of this magnifi- 
cent apartment, on a certain afternoon in late July, 
stood Prince Aribert of Posen. He was faultlessly 
dressed in the conventional frock-coat of English 
civilisation, with a gardenia in his button-hole, and 
the indispensable crease down the front of the

trousers. He seemed to be feirly amused, and

tion of the door behind the Royal chair. At t

* One would have thought so,' agreed Prince 
Aribert, « but perhaps your master has a special 
reason. Tell me,* he went on, changing the sub- 
ject quickly, * how came it that you left the Prince, 
my nephew, at Ostend, and returned to Posen ? * 

* His orders. Prince,' and old Hans, who had 
had a wide experience of Royal whims and knew 
half the secrets of the Courts of Europe, gave 
Aribert a look which might have meant anythii^. 
' He sent me back on an -an errand, your High- 
ness ' 

* And you were to rejoin him here ?' 

*Just so. Highness. And I did rejoin him 
here, although, to tell the truth, I had begun to 
fear that I might never see my master again.' 

* The Prince has been very ill in Ostend, Hans.' 

* So I have gathered,' Hans responded drily, 
slowly rubbing his hands together. *And his 
Highness is not yet perfectly recovered.' 

* Not yet. We despaired of his life, Hans, at 
one time, but thanks to an excellent constitution, 
he came safely through the ordeal.' 

* We must take care of him, your Highness.' 

* Yes, indeed,' said Aribert solemnly, * his life 
is very precious to Posen.' 

At that moment, Eugen, Hereditary Prince of 
Posen, entered the audience chamber. He was 
pale and languid, and his uniform seemed to be a

delay in Ostend ; his name once more figured in 
the Court chronicle of the newspapers. In short, 
everything was smothered over. Only — only 
Jules, Rocco, and Miss Spencer were still at large ; 
and the body of Reginald Dimmocic lay buried in 
the domestic mausoleum of the palace at Posen ; 
and Prince Eugen had still to mterview Mr. 
Sampson Levi. 

That various matters lay heavy on the mind 
of Prince Eugen was beyond question. He 
seemed to have withdrawn within himself. 
Despite the extraordinary experiences through 
which he had recently passed, events which called 
aloud for explanations and confidence between the 
nephew and the uncle, he would say scarcely a 
word to Prince Aiibert. Any allusion, however 
direct, to the days at Ostend, was ignored by him 
with more or less ingenuity, and Prince Aribert 
was really no nearer a full solution of the mystery 
of Jules' plot than he had been on the night when 
he and Racksole visited the gaming tables at 
Ostend. Eugen was well aware that he had been 
kidnapped through the agency of the woman in 
the red hat, but, doubtless ashamed at having been 
her dupe, he would not proceed in any way with 
the clearing-up of the matter. 

* You will receive in this room, Eugen ? ' 
Aribert questioned him.

but some of the valley's shadow had clung to him, 
and it seemed he was una! h to dissipate it. 

* By the way,' said I'ligen sud'-nly, *I must 
reward these Racksole ., I suppose. I am indeed 
grateful to them. If pi-e the girl a bracelet, 
and the father a thousand guineas—how would 
that meet the case .? ' 

' My dear Eugen ! ' exclaimed Aribert aghast. 
*A thousand guineas ! Do you know that Theodore 
Racksole could buy up all Posen from end to end 
without making himself a pauper. A thousand 
guineas ! You might as well offer him sixpence.' 

* Then what must I offer ? ' 

* Nothing, except your thanks. Anything else 
would be an insult. These are no ordinary hotel 
people.' 

' Can't I give the little girl a bracelet ? ' Prince 
Eugen gave a sinister laugh. 

Aribert looked at him steadily. <No,' he 
said. 

* Why did you kiss her— that night .? ' asked 
Prince Eugen carelessly. 

*Kiss whom?' said Aribert, blushing and 
angry, despite his most determined efforts to keep 
calm and unconcerned. 

* The Racksole girl.' 

* When do you mean ? * 

* I mean,' said Prince Eugen, * that night in

Ostend when I was iU. You thought I was in 
a dehrium. Perhaps I was. But somehow I 
remember that with extraordinary distinction. I 
remember raising my head for a fraction of an 
instant, and just in that fraction of an instant 
you kissed her. Oh, Uncle Aribert ! ' 

*Listen,Eugen, for God's sake. IloveNeUa 
Racksole. I shall marry her.' 

* You I ' There was a long pause, and then 
Eugen laughed. «Ah!' he said. «They all 
talk hke that to start with. I have talked like 
that myself, dear uncle ; it sounds nice, and it 
means nothing.' 

^ In this case it means everything, Eugen,' 
said Aribert quietly. / a> 5 > 

Some accent of determination in the lattcr's 
tone made Eugen rather mor. serious. 

* You can't marr>' her,' he said. ' The Emperor 
won t permit a morganatic marriage.' 

*The Emperor has nothing to do with the 
affair. I shall renounce my rights. I shall become 
a plain citizen.' 

* In which case you will have no fortune to 
speak of 

* But my wife will have a fortune. Knowing the 
sacrifices which I shall have made in order to marry 
her, she will not hesitate to place that fortune in my 
hands for our mutual use,' said Aribert stiffly. 



ROYALTY AT THE GRAND BABYLON 217 

* You will decidedly be rich,' mused Eugen, 
as his ideas dwelt on Theodore Racksole's reputed 
wealth. *But have you thought of this,' he 
asked, and his mild eyes glowed again in a sort 
of madness. ' Have you thought that I am un- 
married, and might die at any moment, and then 
the throne will descend to you — to you, Aribert ? ' 

* The throne will never descend to me, Eugen,' 
said Aribert softly, ' for you will live. You are 
thoroughly convalescent. You have nothing to 
fear.' 

* It is the next seven days that I fear,' said 
Eugen. 

* The next seven days ! Why ? ' 

* I do not know. But I fear them. If I can 
survive them ' 

* Mr. Sampson T >>vi, sire,' Hans announced 
in a loud tone.

I have the honour to be the same age as you, and 
to have been your companion from youth up. 
Give me your confidence. I thought you had given 
it me years ago, but I have lately discovered that 
you had your secrets, even then. And now, 
since your illness, you are still more secretive.* 

* What do you mean, Aribert ? ' said Eugen, 
in a tone which might have been either inimical or 
friendly. * What do you want to say .? ' 

* Well, in the first place, I want to say that you 
will not succeed with the estimable Mr. Sampson 
Levi.' 

* Shall I not .? ' said Eugen light'/. * How do 
you know what my business is with him ? ' 

* Suffice it to say that I know. You will never 
get that million pounds out of him.' 

Prince Eugen gasped, and then swallowed his 
excitement. ' Who has been talking ? What 
million ? ' His eyes wandered uneasily round the 
room. * Ah ! ' he said, pretending to laugh. * I 
see how it is. I have been chattering in my 
delirium. You mustn't take any notice of that, 
Aribert. When one has a fever one's ideas 
become grotesque and fanciful.* 

* You never talked in your delirium,' Aribert 
replied ; * at least not about yourself. I knew 
about this projected loan before I saw you in 
Ostend.*

'Don't ask me, Aribert. I've been a fool. 
But I swear to you that the woman whom you 
call « the lady in the red hat " is the last of my 
follies. I am about to take a wife, and become a 
respectable Prince.' 

*Then the engagement with Princess Anna 
is an accomplished fact .'' ' 

I Practically so. As soon as I have settled with 
Levi, all will be smooth. Aribert, I wouldn't lose 
Anna for the Imperial throne. She is a good 
and pure woman, and I love her as a man ml-rht 
love an angel.' 

* And yet you would deceive her as to your 
debts, Eugen } ' 

* Not her, but her absurd parents, and perhaps 
the Emperor. They have heard rumours, and I 
must set those rumours at rest by presenting to 
them a clean sheet.' 

* I am glad you have been frank with me, 
Eugen,' said Prince Aribert, ' but I will be plain 
with you. You will never marry the Princess 
Anna.' 

* And why .?' said Eugen, supercilious again. 

* Because her parents will not permit it. 
Because you will not be able to present a clean 
sheet to them. Because this Sampson Levi will 
never lend you a million.' 

* Explain yourself.'

*Tilltheendof June.* 

* And it is now th- end of July.* 

« Well, what is a month ? He is only too glad

How on earth have you got into your sage old 
head this notion of a plot against me ? The idea 
is ridiculous. A plot against me .? What for .? ' 

« Have you ever thought of Bosnia ? ' asked 
Aribert coldly. 

* What of Bosnia.?' 

^ *I need not tell you that the King of Bosnia 
is naturally under obligations to Austria, to whom 
he owes his crown. Austria is anxious for him to 
make a good influential marriage.' 

* Well, let him.'

rrincess Anna.' 

* Not while I live. He made overtures there 
a year ago, and was rebuffed.' 

* Yes ; but he will make overtures again, and 
this time he will not be rebufl^ed. Oh, Eugen ! 
can't you see that this plot against you is being 
engineered by some persons who know all about 
your affairs, and whose desire is to prevent your

marriage with Princess Anna ? Only one man in 
iiurope can have any motive for wishing to 
prevent your marriage with Princess Anna, and 
«iat IS the man who means to marry her himself/ 
tugen went very pale. 

*Then, Aribert, do you mean to convey to me 
that my detention in Ostend was contrived by the 
agents of the King of Bosnia ? ' 

* I do.' 

* With a view to stopping my negotiations with 
bampson Levi, and so putting an end to the pos- 
sibility of my marriage with Anna ? ' 

Aribert nodded. 

* You are a p^ood friend to mc, Aribert. You 
mean well. Bi 70U are mistaken. You liave 
been worrying about nothing.' 

^Have you forgotten about Reginald Dim- 
mock .'' 

' I remember you said that he had died.' 
*I said nothing of the sort. I said that he 
had been assassinated. That was part of it mv 
poor Eugen.' ' ^ 

* Pooh ! ' said Eugen. « I don't believe he 
was assassinat :d. And as for Sampson Levi 1 
will bet you a thousand marks that he and I come 
to terms this morning, and that the million is in 
my hands before I leave London.' Aribert shook 
his head. 



LEVI AND THE PRINCE 



225 



* You seem to be pretty sure of Mr. Levi's 
character. Have you had much to do with him 
before ? * 

*WelJ,' Eugen hesitated a second, *a little. 
What young man in my position hasn't had some- 
thing to do with Mr. Sampson Levi at one time 
or another ? ' 

* I haven't,' said Aribert. 

* You ! You are a fossil." He rang a silver 
bell. * Hans ! I will receive Mr. Sampson Levi.' 

Whereupon Aribert discreetly departed, and 
Prince Eugen sat down in the great velvet chair, 
and began to look at the papers which Hans had 
previously placed upon the table. 

' Good-morning, yonr Royal Highness,' said 
Sampson Levi, bowing as he entered. * I trust 
your Royal Highness is well.' 

* Moderately, thanks,' returned the Prince. 

Mte of the fact that he had had as much 
to do with people of Royal blood as any plain 
man in Europe, Sampson Levi had never yet 
learned how to be at ease with these exalted 
individuals during the first few minutes o^ an 
inter\'iew. Afterwards, he resumed command of 
himself and his faculties, but at the beginning he 
was invariably flustered, scarlet of face, and 
inclined to perspiration. 

* We will proceed to business at once,' said

began Mr. Sampson Levi, in his homely English 
idiom * It's like this. I said I could keep that 
bit of money available tiU the end of June, and 
you were to give me an interview here before that 
date. Not having heard from your Highness, 
and not knowing your Highness's address, though 
my German agents made every inquiry, I con- 
cluded that you had made other arrangements, 
money being so cheap this last few months.' 

* I was unfortunately detained at Ostend,' said 
Prince Eugen, with as much haughtiness as he 
could assume, *by— by important business. I 
have made no other arrangements, and I shall 
have need of the million. If you will be so good 
as to pay it to my London bankers ' 

* I'm very sorry,' said Mr. Sampson Levi, with 
a tremendous and dazzling air of politeness, which 
surprised even himself, ^ but my syndicate has now 
lent the money elsewhere. It's in South America 
—I don't mind telling your Highness that we've 
lent it to the Chilian Government.' 

*Hang the Chilian Government, Mr. Levi,' 
exclaimed the Prince, and he went white. ' I must 
have that million. It was an arrangement.' 

' It was an arrangement, I admit,' said Mr. 
Sampson Levi, <but your Highness broke the 
arrangement.' 

There was a long silence.

Posen would not continue their own battle, never- 
theless he, Theodore Racksole, wanted to con- 
tinue it for them. To -. certain extent, of course, 
the battle had been won, for Prince Eugen had 
been rescued from an extremely difficult and 
dangerous position, and the enemy — consisting of 
Jules, Rocco, Miss Spencer, and perhapsothers 
—had been put to flight. But that, he conceived, 
was not enough ; it was very far from being 
enough. That the criminals, for criminals they 
decidedly were, should still be at large, he regarded 
as an absurd anomaly. And there was another 
point : he had said nothing to the police of all 
that had occurred. He disdained the police, but 
he could scarcely fail to perceive that if the police 
should by accident gain a clue to the real state of 
the case he might be placed rather awkawrdly, for 
the simple reason that in the eyes of the law it 
amounted to a misdemeanour to conceal as much 
as he had concealed. He asked himself, for the 
thousandth time, why he had adopted a policy of 
concealment from the police, why he had become 
in any way Interested in the Posen matter, and 
why, at this present moment, he should be so 
anxious to prosecute it further .? To the first two 
questions he replied, rather lamely, that he had 
been influenced by Nella, and also by a natural 
spirit of adventure ; to the third he replied that

the Thames. Here and there a pretty woman on 
the arm of a cavalier in immaculate attire swept 
her train as she turned to and fro in the promenade 
of the terrace. Waiters and uniformed commis- 
sionaires and gold-braided doorkeepers moved 
noiselessly about ; at short intervals the chief of 
the doorkeepers blew his shrill whistle and han- 
soms drove up with tinkling beU to take away a 
pair of butterflies to some place of amusement or 
boredom ; occasionally a private carriage drawn 
by expensive and self-conscious horses put the 
hansoms to shame by its mere outward glory. 
It was a hot night, a night for the summer woods, 
and save for the vehicles there was no rapid 
movement of any kind. It seemed as though the 
world— the world, that is to say, of the Grand 
Babylon— was fully engaged in the solemn pro- 
cesses of digestion and small-talk. Even the long 
row of the Embankment gas-lamps, stretching 
right and left, scarcely trembled in the still, warm, 
caressing air. The stars overhead looked down 
with many Winkings upon the enormous pile of 
the Grand Babylon, and the moon regarded it 
with bland and changeless face ; what they thought 
of it and its inhabitants cannot, unfortunately, be 
recorded. What Theodore Racksole thought of 
the moon can be recorded : he thought it was a 
nuisance. It somehow fascinated his gaze with its

be interested to hear that I happened to see Jules 
to-day.' 

* You did ! ' Racksole remarked with much 
calmness. * Where ? ' 

*WeU, it was early this morning, in Paris 
just before I left there. The meeting was quite 
accidental, and Jules seemed rather surprised at 
meeting me. He respectfully inquired where I 
was going, and I said that I was going to Switzer- 
land. At that moment I thought I was going to 
Switzerland. It had occurred to me that after all 
I should be happier there, and that I had better 
turn back and not see London any more. How- 
ever, I changed my mind once again, and decided 
to come on to London, and accept the risks of 
being miserable there without my hotel. Then 
I asked Jules whither he was bound, and he told 
me that he was off to Constantinople, being 
interested in a new French hotel there. I wished 
him good luck, and we parted.' 

J Constantinople, eh!' said Racksole. «A 
highly suitable place for him, I should say.' 

'But,' Babylon resumed,*! caught sight of 
him again.' 

'Where?' 

'At Charing Cross, a few minutes before I 
had the pleasure of meeting you. Mr. Jules had

'Do jrou know anything of the antecedents of 
this Jules, asked Theodore Racksole, helping 
himself to whisky. ^ ^ 

* Nothing whatever, said Babylon. « Until 
you told me, I don't think I war aware that his 
true name was Thomas Jackson, though of course 
I knew that it was not Jules. I certainly was not 
aware that Miss Spencer was his wife, but I 
had long suspected that their relations were some- 
what more intimate than the nature of their 
respective duties in the hotel absolutely demanded. 
AU that I do know of Jules^he wiU always be 
caUed Jules-is that he gradually, by some mys- 
terious personal force, acquired a prominent 
position in the hotel. Decidedly he was the 
cleverest and most inteUectual waiter I have ever 
known, and he was speciaUy skilled in the difficult 
tesk of retaining his own dignity while not inter- 
fenng with that of other people. I'm afraid this

information is a little too vague to be of any 
practical assistance in the present difficulty * 

* What is the present difficulty ? ' Racksole 
queried, with a simple air. 

* I should imagine that the present difficulty is 
to account for the man's presence in London ' 

^ That IS easily accounted for,' said Racksole. 
How Do you suppose he is anxious to 
give himself up to justice, or that the chains of 
nabit bind him to the hotel ? ' 

'Neither,' said Racksole'. « Jules is going to 
have another try— that's all. • ^ 

* Another try at what .? ' 

* At Prince Eugen. Either at his life or his 
liberty. Most probably the former this time ; 
almost certainly the former. He has guessed that 
we are somewhat handicapped by our anxiety to 
keep Prince Eugen's predicament quite quiet, and 
he IS taking advantage of that fact. As he is 
already fairly rich, on his own admission, the 
reward which has been offered to him must be 
enormous, and he is absolutely determined to get 
It. He has several times recently proved himself 
to be a daring fellow ; unless I am mistaken he 
will shortly prove himself to be stiU more daring ' 

But what can he do ? Surely you don't 
suggest that he will attempt the life of Prince 
liugen in this hotel ? ' 



IN THE WINE CELLARS 



245 



*Why not ? If Reginald Dimmock fell on 
mere suspicion that he would turn out unfaithful 
to the conspiracy, why not Prince Eugen ? ' 

* But it would be an unspeakable crime, and 
do infinite harm to the hotel ! ' 

* True ! ' Racksole admitted, smiling. Little 
F61ix Babylon seemed to brace himself for the 
grasping of this monstrous idea. 

*How could it possibly be done ?' he asked 
at length. 

* Dimmock was poisoned.* 

* Yes, but you had Rocco here then, and Rocco 
was in the plot. It is conceivable that Rocco 
could have managed it— barely conceivable. But 
without Rocro I cannot think it possible. I cannot 
even think that Jules would attempt it. You see, 
in a place like the Grand Babylon, as probably I 
needn't point out to you, food has to pass through 
so many hands that to poison one person without 
killing perhaps fifty would be a most delicate 
operation. Moreover, Prince Eugen, unless he 
has changed his habits, is always served by his 
own attendant, old Hans, and therefore any attempt 
to tamper with a cooked dish immediately before 
serving would be hazardous in the extreme.' 

* Granted,' said Racksole. ' The wine, how- 
ever, might be more easily got at. Had you 
thought of that f '

IN THE WINE CELLARS 247 

beneath us are one of the wonders of London. I 
hope you are aware, Mr. Racksole, that when you 
bought the Grand Babylon you bought what is 
probably the finest stock of wines in England, if 
not in Europe. In the valuation I reckoned them 
at sixty thousand pounds. And I may say that I 
always took care that the cellars were properly 
guarded. Even Jules would experience a serious 
difficulty in breaking into the cellars without the 
connivance of the wine-clerk, and the wine-clerk is, 
or was, incorruptible.' 

* I am ashamed to say that I have not yet in- 
spected my wines,' smiled Racksole ; * I have never 
given them a thought. Once or twice I have 
taken the trouble to make a tour of the hotel, but 
I omitted the cellars in my excursions.' 

* Impossible, my dear fellow ! ' said Babylon, 
amused at such a confession, to him— a great 
connoisseur and lover of fine wines—almost 
incredible. *But really you must see them to- 
morrow. If I may, I will accompany you.' 

*Why not to-night?' Racksole suggested, 
calmly. 

* To-night 1 It is very late : Hubbard will have 
gone to bed.' 

*And may I ask who is Hubbard.? I 
remember the name but dimly.'

Keys to Mr. Racksole m person, and after he had 



IN THE WINE CELLARS 249 

had a little chat with his former master, the 
proprietor and the ex-proprietor of the Grand 
Babylon Hotel proceeded on their way to the 
cellars. 

These cellars extend over, or rather under, 
quite half the superficial area of the whole hotel— 
the longitudinal half which lies next to the Strand. 
Owing to the fact that the ground slopes sharply 
from the Strand to the river, the Grand Babylon 
IS, so to speak, deeper near the Strand than it is 
near the Thames. Towards the Thames there is, 
below the entrance level, a basement and a sub- 
basement. Towards the Strand there is basement, 
sub-basement, and the huge wine ceUars beneath 
all. After descending the four flights of the ser- 
vice stairs, and traversing a long passage running 
parallel with the kitchen, the two found themselves 
opposite a door, which, on being unlocked, gave 
access to another flight of stairs. At the foot of 
this was the main entrance to the cellars. Outside 
the entrance was the wine-lift, for the ascension of 
delicious fluids to the upper floors, and, opposite, 
Mr. Hubbard's litde office. There was electric 
light everywhere. Babylon, who, as being most 
accustomed to them, held the bunch of keys, opened 
the great door, and then they were in the first 
cellar— the first of a suite of five. Racksole was 
struck not only by the icy coolness of the place, but 



■^ u 



250 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

also by its vastness. Babylon had seized a portable 
electric hand-light, attached to a long wire, which 
lay handy, and, waving it about, disclosed the 
dimensions of the place. By that flashing iUumina- 
tion the subterranean chamber looked unutterably 
weird and mysterious, with its rows of numbered 
bins, stretching away into the distance till the 
radiance was reduced to the occasional far gleam 
of the light on the shoulder of a bottle. Then 
Babylon switched on the fixed electric lights, and 
Theodore Racksole entered upon a personally-con- 
ducted tour of what was quite the most interesting 
part of his own property. 

To see the innocent enthusiasm of Fdix Baby- 
Ion for these stores of exhilarating liquid was what 
is called in the North * a sight for sair een.' He 
displayed to Racksole's bewildered gaze, in their 
due order, all the wines of three Continents-nay, 
of four, for the superb and luscious Constantia wine 
of Cape Colony was not wanfmg in that most 
cathohc collection of vintages. Beginning with 
the unsurpassed products of Burgundy, >•- con- 
tinued with the clarets of Midoc, Bordecnx and 
Sauterne ; then to the champagnes of Ay, Haut- 
viUiers and Pierry ; then to the hocks and 
moseUes of Germany, and the brilliant imitation 
champagnes of Main, Necker, and Naumberg ; then 
to the famous and adorable Tokay of Hungary 



IN THE WINE CELLARS 251 

and all the Austrian varieties of French wines, 
including Carlowitz and Somlauer ; then to the dry 
sherries of Spain, including purest ManzaniUa, and 
Amontillado, and Vino de Pasto ; then to the 
wines of Malaga, both sweet and dry, and aU the 
« Spanish reds * from Catalonia, including the dark 
*Tent' so often used sacramentally ; then to the 
renowned port of Oporto. Then he proceeded to 
the Italian cellar, and descanted upon the excel- 
lence of Barolo from Piedmont, of Chianti from 
Tuscany, of Orvieto from the Roman States, of 
the « Tears of Christ' from Naples, and the com- 
moner Marsala from Sicily. And so on, to an 
extent and with a ftilness of detail which cannot be 
rendered here. 

At the end of the suite of ceUars there was a 
glazed door, which, as could be seen, gave access 
to a supplemental and smaller ceUar,an apartment 
about fifteen or sixteen feet square. 

* Anything special in there .?' asked Racksole 
curiously, as they stood before the door, and looked 
withm at the serried ends of botdes. 

* Ah 1 ' exclaimed Babylon, almost smacking 
his hps, * therein lies the cream of all.' 

* The best champagne, I suppose ? ' said Rack- 
sole. 

*Yes,' said Babylon,* the best champagne is 
there— a very special Sillery, as exquisite as you 



^ 



252 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

wiU find anywhere. But I see, my friend, that 
you fall into the common error of putting cham- 
pagne first among wines. That distinction belongs 
to Burgundy. You have old Burgundy in that 
cellar, Mr. Racksole, which cost me— how much 
do you think !»— eighty pounds a botde. Probably 
It >1I never be drunk,' he added with a sigh. 
* It is too expensive even for princes and pluto- 
crats.' 

* Yes, it will,' said Racksole quickly. < You 
and I will have a botde up to-morrow.' 

*Then,' continued Babylon, still riding his 
hobby-horse, * there is a sample of the Rhine wine 
dated 1706 which caused such a «"2nsation at the 
Vienna Exhibition of 1873. There is also a sin- 
gularly glorious Persian wine from Shiraz, the like 
of which I have never seen elsewhere. Also there 
is an unrivaUed vintage of Roman^e-Conti, greatest 
of all modern Burgundies. If I remember right 
Pnnce Eugen invariably has a botde when he 
comes to stay here. It is not on the hotel wine 
list, of course, and only a few customers know of 
It. We do not precisely hawk Jt about the dining- 
room.' ° 

'Indeed 1 ' said Racksole. * Let us go inside.' 

They entered the stone apartment, rendered 

almost sacred by the preciousness of its contents, 

and Racksole looked round with a strangely intent 



IN THE WINE CELLARS 253 

and curious air. At the far side was a grating, 
through which came a feeble light. 

* What is that ? ' asked the millionaire sharply. 

* That is merely a ventilation grating. Good 
ventilation is absolutely essential.' 

* Looks broken, doesn't it ? * Racksole sug- 
gested, and then, putting a finger quickly on 
Babylon's shoulder, * there's someone in the cellar. 
Can't you hear breathing, down there, behind 
that bin ? ' 

The two men stood tense and silent for a 
while, listening, under the ray of the singk electric 
light in the ceiling. Half the cellar was involved 
in gloom. At length Racksole walked firmly down 
the central passage-way between the bins and 
turned to the corner at the right. 

* Come out, you villain ! ' he said in a low, well- 
nigh vicious tone, and dragged up a cowering 
figure. 

He had expected to find a man, but it was his 
own daughter, Nella Racksole, upon whom he 
had laid angry hands.

'Well, father/ NeUa greeted her astounded 
parent. « You should make sure that you have 
got hold of the right person before you use aU 
that terrible muscular force of yours. I do believe 
you have broken my shoulder bone.' She rubbed 
her shoulder with a comical expression of pain, 
and then stood up before the two men. The skin 
ot her dark grey dress was torn and dirty, and the 
usually tnm NeUa looked as though she had been 
shot down a canvas fire-escape. MechanicaUy she 

smoothed her frock, and gave a straightening touch 
to her hair. ° 

* Good-evening, Miss Racksole,' said Fdix 
Babylon, bowing formally. * This is an unexpected 
pleasure. Fdix's drawing-room manners never 
deserted him upon any occasion whatever. 

* May I inquire what you are doing in my 
^ne ceUar, Nella Racksole ? ' said the mUlionaire 
a httie stiffly. He was certainly somewhat annoyed 



FURTHER EVENTS IN THE CELLAR 255 

at having mistaken his daughter for a criminal ; 
moreover he hated to be surprised, and upon this 
occasion he had been surprised beyond any ordi- 
naiy surprise ; lastly, he was not at all pleased that 
Nella should be observed in that strange predica- 
ment by a stranger. 

*Iwill tell you,' said Nella. «I h.d been 
reading rather late in my room-the night was so 
close I heard Big Ben strike half-past tvv. ive, 
and then I put die book down, and went our on 
to the balcony of my window for a little fresh a-V 
before going to bed. I leaned over the balcony 
very quietly-you will remember that I am on the 
third floor now-and looked down below into the 
htde sunk yard which separates the wall of the hotel 
from Salisbury Lane. I was rather astonished to 
see a figure creeping across the yard. I knew 

ZlV'Z "° ^"''"'''^ ^"^° ^^ ^°^^^ fr°n^ ^hat yard, 
and besides, it is fifteen or twenty feet below the

quarter of an hour, I should think — a rasping sort 
of noise.' 

* Why on earth didn't you come and warn me 
or some one else in the hotel ? asked Racksole. 

* Oh, I don't know, dad,' she replied sweetly. 
* I had got interested in it, and I thought I 
would see it out myself. WeU, as I was saying, 
Mr. Babylon,' she continued, addressing her re- 
marks now to Fdlix, with a dazzling smile, * that 
noise went on for quite a long time. At last it 
stopped, and the figure reappeared from under the 
wall,, crossed the yard, climbed up the opposite wall 
by some means or other, and so over the railings 
into Salisbury Lane. I felt rather relieved then, 
because I knew he hadn't actually broken into the 
hotel. He walked down Salisbury Lane very 
slowly. A policeman was j ust coming up. " Good- 
night, officer," I heard him say to th : oliceman, 
and he asked him for a match. The policeman 
supplied the match, and the other man lighted a 
cigarette, and proceeded further down the lane. 
By cricking your neck from my window, Mr. 
Babylon, you can get a glimpse of the Embank- 
ment and the river. I saw the man cross the 
Embankment, and lean over the river wall, where 
he seemed to be talking to some one. He th^n 
walked along the Embankment to Westminster, 
and that was the last I saw of him. I waited a 



FURTHER EVENTS IN THE CELLAR 257 

minute or two for him to come back, but he didn't 
come back, and so I thought it was about time I 
began to make inquiries into the af*air. I went 
downstairs instantly, and out of the hotel, through 
the quadrangle, into Salisbury Lane, and I looked 
over those railings. There was a ladder on the 
other side, by which it was perfectly easy— once 
you had got over the railings— to climb down 
into the yard. I was horribly afraid lest some one 
might walk up Salisbury Lane and catch me in the 
act of negotiating those railings, but no one did, 
and I surmounted them, with no worse damage 
than a torn skirt. I crossed the yard on tiptoe, 
and I found that in the wall, close to the ground, 
and almost exactly under my window, there was 
an iron grating, about one foot by fourteen inches. 
I suspected, as there was no other ironwork near, 
that the mysterious visitor must have been sawing 
at this grating for private purposes of his own. I 
gave it a good shake, and I was not at all sur- 
prised that a good part of it came off in my hand, 
leaving just enough room for a person to creep 
through. I decided that I would creep through, 
and now wish I hadn't. I don't know, Mr. 
Babylon, whether you have ever tried to creep 
through a small hole with a skirt on. Have 
you ? • 

* I have not had that pleasure,' said little F^lix,

bowing again, and absently taking up a bottle 
which lay to his hand. 

* Well, you are fortunate,' the imperturbable 
Nella resumed. «For quite three minutes I 
thought I should perish in that grating, dad, with 
my shoulder inside and the rest of me outside. 
However, at last, by the most amazing and agon- 
ising efforts, I pulled myself through, and fell into 
this extraordinary cellar more dead than alive. 
Then I wondered what I should do next. Should 
I wait for the mysterious visitor to return, and 
stab Him with my pocket scissors if he tried to 
enter, or should I raise an alarm ? First of all I 
replaced the broken grating, then I struck a match, 
and saw that I had got landed in a wilderness of 
bottles. The match went out, and I hadn't 
another one. So I sat down in the corner to 
think. I had just decided to wait and see if the 
visitor returned, when I heard footsteps, and then 
voices, and then you came in. I must say I was 
rather taken aback, especially as I recognised the 
voice of Mr. Babylon. You see, I didn't want to 
frighten you. If I had bobbed up from behind 
the botties and said « Booh I " you would have 
had a serious shock. 1 wanted to think of a way 
of breaking my presence gently to you. But you 
saved me the trouble, dad. Was I really breath- 
ing so loudly that you could hear me ? * 



FURTHER EVENTS IN THE CELLAR 259 

The girl ended her strange recital, and there 
was a moment's silence in the cellar. Racksole 
merely nodded an affirmative to her concluding 
question. 

* Well, Nell, my girl,' said the m-Uionaire at 
length, * we are much obliged for your gymnastic 
efforts — ^very much obliged. But nox7, I think 
you had better go off to bed. There is going to 
be some serious trouble here, I'll lay my last 
dollar on that .? ' 

* But if there is to be a burglary I should so 
like to see it, dad,' Nella pleaded. * I've never

* This isn't a burglary, my dear. I calculate 
it's something far worse than a burglary.' 

* "What ? ' she cried. * Murder ? Arson ? 
Dynamite plot ? How perfectly splendid ! ' 

*Mr. Babylon informs me that Jules is in 
London,' said Racksole quietly, 

* Jules I * she exclaimed under her breath, and 
her tone changed instantly to the utmost serious- 
ness. * Switch off the light, quick 1 ' Springing 
to the switch, she put the cellar in darkness. 

* What's that for .? ' said her father. 

* If he comes back he would see the light, and 
be frightened away,' said Nella. * That wouldn't 
do at all.' 

*It wouldn't, Miss Racksole,' said Babylon,

and there was in his voice a note of admiration 
for the girl's sagacity which Racksolc heard with 
high paternal pride. 

'Listen, NeUa,' said the latter, drawing his 
daughter to him in the profound gloom of the 
cellar. * We fancy that Jules may be trying to 
tamper with a certain bottle of wine— a botde 
which might possibly be drunk by Prince Eugen. 
Now do you think that the man you saw might 
have been Jules ? ' 

* I hadn't previously thought of him as being 
Jules, but immediately you mentioned the name 
I somehow knew that he was. Yes, I am sure it 
was Jules.' 

* Well, just hear what I have to say. There 
h no time to lose. If he is coming at all he will 
be here very soon— and you can help.' Racksole 
explamed what he thought Jules' tactics might be. 
He proposed that if the man returned he should 
not be interfered with, but merely watched from 
the other sidj of the gl?cs door. 

*You want, as it were, to catch Mr. Jules 
alive ? ' said Babylon, who seemed rather taken 
aback at this novel method of dealing with crimi- 
nals. « Surely,* he added, * it would be simpler 
and easier to inform the police of your suspicion, 
and to leave everything to them.' 

*My dear fellow,' said Racksole, *we have

already gone much too far without the police to 
make it advisable for us to call them in at this 
somcwbat adranced stage of the proceedings. Be- 
sides, if you must know it, 1 have a particular 
desire to capture the scoundrel myself. I will 
leave you and Nella here, since Nella insists on 
seeing everything, and I will arrange things so 
that once he has entered the cellar Jules will not get 
out of it again — at any rate through the grating. 
You had better place yourselves on the other side 
of the glass door, in the big cellar ; you will be 
in a position to observe from there. I will skip 
off at once. All you have to do is to take note 
of what the fellow does. If he has any accomplices 
within the hotel we shall probably be able by that 
means to discover who the accomplice is.* 

Lighting a match and shading it with his 
hands, Racksole showed them both out of the 
litde cellar. * Now if you lock this glass door on 
the outside he can't escape this way : the panes of 
glass are too small, and the woodwork too stout. 
So, if he comes into the trap, you two will have 
the pleasure of actually seeing him frantically 
writhe therein, without any personal danger ; but 
perhaps you'd better not show yourselves.' 

In another moment F61ix Babylon and Nella 
were left to themselves in the darkness of the 
cellar, listening to the receding footfalls of Theo- 



I 



i 



262 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

dore Racksole. But the sound of these footfalls 
had not died away before another sound greeted 
their ears— the grating of the smaU cellar was 
being removed. 

* I hope your father wiU be in time/ whispered 
F61ix. 

* Hush ! • the girl warned him, and they stooped 
side by side in tense silence. 

A man cautiously but very neatly wormed his 
body through the aperture of the grating. The 
watchers could only see his form indistinctly in 
the darkness. Then, being fkirly within the 
cellar, he walked without the least hesitation to 
the electric switch and turned on the light. It 
was unmistakably Jules, and he knew the geo- 
graphy of the cellar very well. Babylon could 
with difficulty repress a start as he saw this bold 
and unscrupulous ex-waiter moving with such an 
air of assurance and determination about the 
precious cellar. Jules went directly to a small 
bin which was numbered 17, and took therefrom 
the tof nost bottle. 

* The Roman^e-Conti—Prince Eugen's wine I * 
Babylon exclaimed under his breath. 

Jules neatly and quickly removed the seal with 
an instrument which he had clearly brought for 
the purpose. He then took a little flat box from 
his pocket, which seemed to contain a sort of 



FURTHER EVENTS IN THE CELLAR 263 

black salve. Rubbing his finger in this, he 
smeared the top of the neck of the bottle with it, 
just where the cork came against the glass. In 
another Instant he had defdy replaced the seal 
and restored the botde to its position. He then 
turned off the light, and made for the aperture. 
When he was half-way through Nella exclaimed, 
* He will escape, after all. Dad has not had time 
— ^we must stop him.* 

But Babylon, that embodiment of caution, 
forcibly, but nevertheless politely, restrained this 
Yankee girl, whom he deemed so rash and 
imprudent, and before she could free herself the 
lithe form of Jules had disappeared.

CHAPTER XXIV 

THE BOTTLE OF WINl 

As reg^ards Theodore Racksole, who was to have 
caught his man from the outside of the cellar, 
he made his way as rapidly as possible from* 
the wine-cellars, up to the ground floor, out of 
the hotel ly the quadrangle, through the quad- 
rangle, and out into the top of Salisbury Lane. 
Now, owing to the vastness of the structure of 
the Grand Babylon, the mere distance thus to be 
traversed amounted to a little short of a quarter 
of a mile, and, as it included a number of stairs, 
about two dozen turnings, and several passages 
which at that time of night were in darkness more 
or less complete, Racksole could not have been 
expected to accomplish the journey in less than 
five minutes. As a matter of fact, six minutes 
had elapsed before he reached the top of Salisbury 
Lane, because he had been delayed nearly a minute 
by some questions addressed to him by a muddled 
and whisky-laden guest who had got lost in the 



THE BOTTLE OF WINE 



165 



corridors. As everybody knows, there is a sharp 
short bend in Salisbury Lane near the top. Rack- 
sole ran round this at good racing speed, but he 
was unfortunate enough to run straight up against 
the very policeman who had not long before so 
courteously supplied Jules with a match. The 
policeman seemed to be scarcely in so pliant a mood 
just then. 

' Hullo 1 ' he saia, his naturally suspicious 
nature being doubtless aroused by the spectacle of 
a bareheaded man in evening-dress running vio- 
lently down the lane. * What's this .? Where are 
you orf in such a hurry ? * and he forcibly detained 
Theodore Racksole for a moment and scrutinised 
his face. 

* Now, officer,* said Racksole quietly, * none 
of your larks, if you please. I've no time to 
lose.* 

*Beg your pardon, sir,* the policeman remarked, 
though hesitatingly and not quite with good 
temper, and Racksole was allowed to proceed on 
his way. The millionaire's scheme for trapping 
Jules was to get down into the little sunk yard 
by means of the ladder, and then to secrete him- 
self behind some convenient abutment of brick- 
work until Mr. Tom Jackson should have got 
into the cellar. He therefore nimbly surmounted 
the railings — the railings of his own hotel — and 



i 









266 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

was gingerly descending the ladder, when lo ! a 
rough hand seized him by the coat-collar and with 
a ferocious jerk urged him backwards. The fact 
was, Theodore Racksole had counted without the 
policeman. That guardian of the peace, mis- 
trusting Racksole's manner, had quiedy followed 
him down the lane. The sight of the millionaire 
climbing the railings had put him on his metde, 
and the result was the ignominious capture of 
Racksole. In vain Theodore expostulated, ex- 
plained, anathematised. Only one thing would 
satisfy the stolid policeman — namely, that Rack- 
sole should return with him to the hotel and there 
establish his identity. If Racksole then proved to 
be Racksole, owner of the Grand Babylon, well 
and good — the policeman promised to apologise. 
So Theodore had no alternative but to accept the 
suggestion. To prove his identity was, of course, 
the work of only a few minutes, after which Rack- 
sole, annoyed, but cool as ever, returned to his 
railings, while the policeman went off to another 
part of his beat, where he would be likely to meet 
a comrade and have a chat. 

In the meantime, our friend Jules, sublimely 
unconscious of the altercation going on outside, 
and of the special risk which he ran, was of 
course actually in the cellar, which he had reached 
before Racksole got to the railings for the first 



THE BOTTLE OF WINE 



267 



time. It was, indeed, a happy chance for Jules 
that his exit from the cellar coincided with the 
period during which Racksole was absent from 
the railings. As Racksole came down the lane 
for the second time, he saw a figure walking about 
fifty yards in front of him towards the Embank- 
ment. Instandy he divined that it was Jules, and 
that the policeman had thrown him just too late. 
He ran, and Jules, hearing the noise of pursuit, 
ran also. The ex-waiter was fleet ; he made direct 
for a certain spot in the Embankment wall, and, 
to the intense astonishment of Racksole, jumped 
clean over the wall, as it seemed, into the river. 
"• 18 he so desperate as to commit suicide ? ' 
Racksole exclaimed as he ran, but a second later 
the puff and snort of a steam launch told him that 
Jules was not quite driven to suicide. As the 
millionaire crossed the Embankment roadway he 
saw the funnel of the launch move out from 
under the river-wall. It swerved into midstream 
and headed towards London Bridge. There was 
a silent mist over the river. Racksole was 
helpless. . . 

Although Racksole had now been twice 
worsted in a contest of wits within the precincts 
of the Grand Babylon, once by Rocco and once 
by jules, he could not fairly blame himself for the 
present miscarriage of his plans — a miscarriage

due to the meddlesomeness of an extraneous 
person, combined with pure iU-fortune. He did 
not, therefore, permit the accident to interfere 
with his sleep that night. 

On the foUowing day he sought out Prince 
Aribert, between whom and himself there now 
existed a feeling of unmistakable, frank friendship, 
and disclosed to him the happenings of the 
previous night, and particularly the tampering with 
the bottle of Roman^e-Conti. 

* I believe you dined with Prince Eugen last 
night ? ^ 

hnJ^ ft ^"? curiously enough we had a 
bottle of Roman6e-Conti, an admirable wine, of 
which Eugen is passionately fond.' 

* And you wiU dine with him to-night ? * 
'Most probably. To-day will, I fear, be our 

last day here. Eugen wishes to return to Posen 
early to-morrow.' 

that if Jules had succeeded in poisoning you^ 
nephew, he would probably have succeeded also in 
poisoning you ? ' 

but It would seem so. It appears that so long 
as he brings down his particular quarry, Jules is 
careless of anything else that may be aTcidentally 
involved m the destruction. However, we need 



-tV-'arr^.-i «*c.io, j>*»i" jk# !.#,-.». 



THE BOTTLE OF WINE 269 

have no fear on that score now. You know the 
bottle, and you can destroy it at once.* 

*But I do not propose to destroy it,' said 
Racksole calmly. «If Prince Eugen asks for 
Romanie-Conti to be ser/ed to-night, as he 
probably wiU, I propose that that precise bottle 
shall be served to him— and to you." 

* Then you would poison us in spite of 01 r- 
selves .? * 

* Scarcely,' Racksole smiled. * My notion is to 
discover the accomplices within the hotel. I have 
already inquired as to the wine-clerk, Hubbard. 
Now does it not occur to you as extraordinary that 
on this particular day Mr. Hubbard should be ill 
in bed ? Hubbard, I am informed, is suffering 
from an attack of stomach poisoning, which 
has supervened during the night. He says that 
he does not know what can have caused it. His 
place in the wine cellars wiU be taken to-day by 
his assistant, a mere youth, but to all appearances 
a fairly smart youth. I need not say that we shall 
keep an eye on that youth.' 

*One moment,' Prince Aribert interrupted. 
*I do not quite understand how you think the 
poisoning was to have been effected." 

* The bottle is now under examination by an 
expert, who has instructions to remove as little as 
possible of the stuff which Jules put on the rim of 



270 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

the mouth of it. It wiU be secretly replaced in its 
bin during the day. My idea is that by the mere 
action of pouring out the wine takes up some of 
the poison, which I deem to be very strong, and 
thus becomes fatal as it enters the glass.' 

*But surely the servant in attendance would 
TVipe the mouth of the bottle f * 

* Very carelessly, perhaps. And moreov^f he 
would be extremely unlikely to wipe off all the 
stuiF: some of it has been ingeniouslv placed just 
on the inside edge of the rim. Besides, suppose 
he forgot to wipe the botde ? ' 

'Prince Eugen is always served at dinner by 
Hans. It IS an honour which the faithful old 
fellow reserves for himself.* 

*But suppose Hans ' Racksole stopped. 

'Hans an accomplice I My dear Racksole, 
the suggestion is wildly impossible.* 

That night Prince Aribert dined with his august 
nephew in the superb dining-room of the Royal 
apartnients. Hans served, the dishes being 
brought to the door by other servants. Aribert 
found his nephew despondent and taciturn. On 
the previous day, when, after the futile interview 
with Sampson Levi, Prince Eugen had despairingly 
threatened to commit suicide, in such a manner as 
to make it « look like an accident,* Aribert had 
compeUed him to give his word of honour not to 
do so. 



THE BOTTLE OF WINE 271 

'What wine will your Royal Highness take ?' 
asked old Hans in hi;i soothing tones, when the 
soup was served. 

* Sherry,' was Prince Eugen's curt order. 

* And Roman^e-Conti afterwards ? ' said Hans. 
Aribert looked up quickly. 

*No, not to-night. I'll try Sillery to-night,' 
said Prince Eugen. 

* I think I'll have Roman6e-Conti, Hans, after 
all,' he said. « It suits me better than champagne.' 

The famous and unsurpassable Burgundy was 
served with the roast. Old Hans brought it 
tenderly in its wicker cr ile, inserted the corkscrew 
with mathematical pre.iion, and drew the cork, 
which he offered for his master's inspection. 
Eugen nodded, and told him to put it down. 
Aribert watched with intense interest. He could 
not for an instant believe that Hans was not the 
very soul of fidelity, and yet, despite himself, 
Racksolt's words had caused him a certain uneasi- 
ness. At that moment Prince Eugen murmured 
across the table : 

Libert, I withdraw my promise. Observe 
that, I withdraw it.' 

Aribert shook his head emphatically, without 
removing his gaze from Hans. The white-haired 
servant perfunctorily dusted his napkin round the 
neck of the bottle of Roman6e-Conti, and poured 
out a glass. Aribert trembled from head to foot. 



Ji

: * 



Iw 



172 THE G AND BABYLON HOTEL 

Eugen took up the glass and held it to the light. 

* Don't drink it,' said Aribert very quietly. 
* It is poisoned.* 

* Poisoned ! * exclaimed Prince Eugcn. 

* Poisoned, sire ! ' exclaimed old Hans, with an 
air of profound amazement and concern, and he 
seized the glass. * Impossible, sire. I myself 
opened the bottle. No one else has touched it, 
and the cork was perfect.' 

* I tell you it is poisoned,' Aribert repeated. 

* Your Highness will pardon an old man,* said 
Hans, * but to say that this wine is poison is to 
say that I am a murderer. I will prove to you 
that it is not poisoned. I will drink it.* 

And he raised the glass to his trembling lips. 
In that moment Aribert saw that old Hans, at any 
rate, was not an accomplice of Jules. Springing 
up from his seat, he knocked the glass from the 
aged servitor's hands, and the fragments of it 
fell with a light tinkling crash partly on the table 
and partly on the floor. The Prince and the 
servant gazed it one another in a distressing and 
terrible silence. There was a slight noise, and 
Aritert looked aside. He saw that Eugen's body 
had .dipped forward limply over the left arm of 
his chair ; the Prince's arms hung straight and 
lifeless ; his eyes were dosed ; he was unconscious. 

* Hans I ' murmured Aribert, * Hans I What 
is this?'

CHAPTER XXV 

THE STEAM LAUNCH 

Mr. Tom Jackson's notion of making good 
his escape from the hotel by means of a steam 
launch was an excellent one, so far as it went, but 
Theodore Racksole, for his part, did not consider 
that it went quite far enough. Theodore Racksole 
opined, with peculiar glee, that he now had a 
tangible and definite clue for the catching of the 
Grand Babylon's ex-waiter. He knew nothing of 
the Port of London, but he happened to know a 
good deal of the far more complicated, though 
somewhat smaller. Port of New York, and he felt 
sure there ought to be no extraordinary difficulty 
in getting hold of Jules' steam launch. To those 
who are not thoroughly familiar with it the River 
Thames and its docks, from London Bridge to 
Gravesend, .eem a vast and uncharted wilderness 
of craft— a wilderness in which it would be 
perfectly easy to hide even a three-master success- 
fully. To such people the idea of looking for a 
small stewn launch on the river would be about 






^ i 



r 



i '! 






274 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

equivalent to the idea of looking for a needle In a 
bundle of hay. But the fact is, there are hundreds 
of men between St. Katherine's Wharf and Black- 
wall who literally know the Thames as the 
suburban householder knows his back-garden— 
who can recognise thousands of ships and put a 
name to them at a distance of half a mile who are 
informed as to every movement of vessels on the 
great stream, who know all the captains, all the 
engineers, all the lightermen, all the p lots, all the 
licensed watermen and all the unlicensed scoundrels 
from the Tower to Gravesend, and a lot further. 
By these experts of the Thames the slightest 
unusual event on the water is noticed and 
discussed— a wherry cannot change hands but they 
will guess shrewdly upon the price paid and the 
mtentions of the new owner with regard to it. 
They have a habit of watching the river for the 
mere interest of the sight, and they talk about 
everything like housewives gathered of an evening 
round the cottage door. If the first mate of a 
Castle Liner gets the sack they will be able to 
tell you what he said to the captain, what the old 
man said to him, and what both said to the Board, 
and having finished off that affair they will cheer- 
fully turn to discussing whether Bill Stevens sank 
his barge outside the West India No. 2 by 
accident or on purpose. 



I 



THE STEAM LAUNCH 275 

Theodore Racksole had no satisfactory m ^ans 
of identifying the steam launch which carried 
away Mr. Tom Jackson. The sky had clouded 
over soon after midnight, and there was also a 
slight mist, and he had only been able to make 
out that It was a low craft, about sixty feet lon^. 
probably painted black. He had personally kept 
a watch all through the night on vessels going up- 
stream, and during the next morning he had a 
man to take his place who warned him whenever 
a steam launch went towards Westminster. At 
noon, after his conversation with Prince Aribert. 
he went down the river in a hired row-boat as far 
as the Customs House, and poked about every- 
where in search of any vessel which could by any 
possibility be the one he was in search of. But 
lie found nothing. He was, therefore tolerably 
sure that the mysterious launch lay somewhere 
below the Customs House. At the Customs 
House stairs he landed, and asked for a very high 
official-an official inferior only to a Commissioner 
—whom he had entertained once in New York 
and who had met him in London on business aj 
^l-yd s. In the large but dingy office of this 
great man a long conversation took place— a con- 
versation in which Racksole had to exercise a certain 
amount of persuasive power, and which ultimately 
ended in the high official ringing his beU. 



^^(> THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

•Desire Mr. HazcU— room No. 332— to 
speak to me,' said the official to the boy who 
answered the summons, and then, turning to 
Racksole : * I need hardly repeat, my dear Mr. 
Racksole, that this is strictly unofficial.* 

'Agreed, of course,' said Racksole. 

Mr. Hazell cntc -d. He was a young man 
of about thirty, dressed in blue serge, /ith a pale, 
keen face, a brown moustache and a rather hana- 
some brown beard. 

*Mr. Hazell,' said the high official. Met me 
introduce you to Mr. Theodore Racksole- -you 
will doubtless be familiar with his name. Mr. 
Hazell,' he went on to Racksole, * is one of our 
outdoor staff-— what we call an examining officer. 
Just now he h doing night duty. He has a boat 
on the riv-r and a couple of men, and the right to 
board and examine any craft whatever. What 
Mr. Hazell and his crew don't know about the 
Thames between here and Gravesend isn't know- 
ledge.* 

*Glad to meet you, sir,' said Racksole 
simply, and they shook hands. Racksole observed 
with satisfaction that Mr. Hazell was entirely at 
his ease. 

*Now, Hazell,* the high official continued, 
•Mr. Racksole wants you to help in a little 
private expedition on the river to-night. I will 
give you a night's leave. 1 sent for you partly

because I thought you wo'old enjoy the aflfair and 
partly because' I think I can rely on you to regard 
it as entirely unofficial and not to talk about it. 
You understand ? I daie say you will have no 
cause to regret having obliged Mr. Racksole.' 

* I think I grasp the situation,* said Hazell, 
with a slight smile. 

«And, by the way/ aaded the high official, 
* although the business is unofficial, it might be 
well if you wore ^our official overcoat. See ? ' 

* Decidedly,' said Hazell ; « I should have done 
so in any case.' 

*And now, Mr. Hazell,' said Racksole, * will 
you do roe the pleasure of lunching with me } If 
you agree, I should like to lunch at the place you 
usually frequent.' 

So it cam? to pass that Theodore Racksole and 
George Hazell, outdoor clerk in the Customs, 
lunched together at « Thomas's Chop-House,' 
m the city cf London, upon mutton-chops and 
coiTee. The millionaire soon discovered that he 
had got hold of a keen-witted man and a person 
of much insight. 

*Tellme,' said Hazell, when they had reached 
the cigarette stage, * are t*-e magazine writers any- 
thing like corrixt ? * 

*What do you mean?' asked Racksole, 
mystified. 

• Well, you're a millionaire—" one of the best," 



I 



278 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

I believe. One often sees articles on and inter- 
views with millionaires, which describe their private 
railroad cars, their steam yachts on the Hudson, 
their marble stables, and so on, and so on. Do 
you happen to have those things ?* 

*I have a private car on the New York 
Central, and I have a two thousand ton schooner- 
yacht— tnuugh it isn't on the Hudson. It happens 
just now to be on East River. And I am bound to 
admit that the stables of my uptown place are 
fitted with marble.' Racksole laughed. 

* All I • said Hazell. * Now I can believe that 
I am lunching with a millionaire. It's strange 
how fkcts like those— unimportant in themselves 
—appeal to the imagination. You seem to me a 
real millionaire now. You've given me some 
personal -nformation ; I'll give you some in return. 
I earn three hundred a year, and p' .laps sixty 
pounds a year extra for overtime. I live by 
myself in two rooms in Musccvy Court. I've as 
much money as I need, and I always do exactly 
what I like outside office. As regards the office, 
I do as little work as I can, on principle— it's a fight 
between us and the Commissioners who shall get 
the best. They try to do us down, and we try to 

iV^l^ .^°^"-"^^'s P^ef^ even on the whole. 
All s fair m war, you know, and there ain't no ten 
commandments in a Government office.' 



THE STEAM LAUNC! 



279 



Racksole laugher'.. «Can you get off this 
afternoon ? ' he asked. 

* Certainly,' said Hazell ; * I'll get one of my 
pals to sign on for me, and then I shall be free.' 

* Well,' said Racksole, * I shoul ; like you to 
come down with me to the Grand Babylon. Then 
we can talk over my litde affair at length. And 
may we go on your boat : I want to meet your 
crew.' 

* That will be a!l right,' Hazell remarked. * My 
two men are the idlest, most soul-less chaps you 
ever saw. They eat too much, and they have an 
enormous appetite for beer ; but they know the 
river, and they know their business, and they will 
do anything within the fair game if they are paid 
ror it, and aren't asked to hurry.' 

That night, just after dark, Theodore Racksole 
embarked with his new friend George Hazell in 
one of the black-painted Customs wherries, manned 
by a crew of two men — both the latter freemen of 
the river, a distinction which carries with it certain 
privileges unfamiliar to the mere landsman. It 
was a cloudy and oppressive evening, not a star 
showing to illumine the slow tiae, now just past 
its flood. The vast forms of steamers at anchor 
— chiefly those of the General Steam Navigation 
and the Aberdeen Line — heaved themselves high 
out of the water, straining sluggishly at their 



i 

I! 



28o THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

mooring buoys. On either side the naked walls 
of warehouses rose like grey precipices from the 
stream, holding forth quaint arms of steam-cranes. 
To the west the Tower Bridge spanned the river 
with its formidable arch, and above that its sus- 
pended footpath— a hundred and fifty feet from 
earth. Down towards the East and the Pool of 
London a forest of funnels and masts were dimly 
oudined against the sinister sky. Huge barges, 
each steered by a single man at the end of a pair 
of giant oars, lumbered and swirled down-stream 
at all angles. Occasionally a tug snorted busily 
past, flashing its red and green signals and drag- 
ging an unwieldy tail of barges in its wake. Then 
a Margate passenger steamer, its electric lights 
gleaming from every porthole, swerved round to 
anchor, with its load of two thousand fatigued 
excursionists. Over everything brooded an air of 
mystery — a spirit and feeling of strangeness, re- 
moteness, and the inexplicable. As the broad flat 
litde boat bobbed its way under the shadow of 
enormous hulks, beneath stretched hawsers, and 
past buoys covered with green slime, Racksole 
could scarcely believe that he was in the very heart 
of London — the most prosaic city in the world. 
He had a queer idea that almost anything might 
happen in this seeming waste of waters at this 
weird hour of ten o'clock. It appeared incredible

to him that only a mile or two away people were 
sitting in theatres applauding forces, and that at 
Cannon Street Station, a few yards ofF, other 
people were calmly taking the train to various 
highly respectable suburbs whose names he was 
gradually learning. He had the uplifting sensa- 
tion of being in another wcrld which comes to us 
sometimes amid surroundings violently different 
from our usual surroundings. The most ordinary 
noises— of men calling, of a chain running through 
a slot, of a distant syren— translated themselves to 
his ears into terrible and haunting sounds, full of 
portentous significance. He looked over the side 
of the boat into the brown water, and asked him- 
self what frightful secrets lay hidden in its depth. 
Then he put his hand into his hip-pocket and 
touched the stock of his Colt revolver— that 
familiar substance comforted him. 

The oarsmen had instructions to drop slowly 
down to the Pool, as the wide reach below the 
Tower is called. These two men had not been 
previously informed of the precise object of the 
expedition, but now that they were safely afloat 
HazeU judged it expedient to give them some 
notion of it. « We expect to come across a rather 
suspicious steam launch,' he said. * My friend 
here is very anxious to get a sight of her, and 
until he has seen her nothing definite can be done.'

* What sort of a craft is she, sir ? ' asked the 
stroke oar, a fat-faced man who seemed absolutely 
incapable of any serious exertion. 

* I don't know,* Racksole replied ; * but as near 
as I can judge, she's about sixty feet in length, and 
painted black. I fancy I shall recognise her when 
I see her.' 

* Not much to go by, that,* exclaimed the other 
man curtly. But he said no more. He, as well 
as his mate, had received from Theodore Racksole 
one English sovereign as a kind of preliminary 
fee, and an English sovereign will do a lot towards 
silencing the natural sarcastic tendencies and free 
speech of a Thames waterman. 

* There's one thing I noticed,' said Racksole 
suddenly, *and I forgot to tell you of it, Mr. 
Hazell. Her screw seemed to move with a rather 
irregular, lame sort of beat.* 

Both watermen burst into a laugh. 

* Oh,* said the fat rower, * I know what you're 
after, sir — it's Jack Everett's launch, commonly 
called " Squirm." She's got a four-bladed propeller, 
and one blade is broken off short.' 

* Ay, that's it, sure enough,' agreed the man in 
the bows. * And if it's her you want, I seed her 
lying up against Cherry Gardens Pier this very 
morning.' 

*Let us go to Cherry Gardens Pier by all

means, as soon as possible,' Racksole said, and the 
boat swung across stream and then began to creep 
down by the right bank, feeling its way past 
wharves, many of which, even at that hour, were 
still busy with their cranes, that descended empty 
into the bellies of ships and came up full. As 
the two watermen gingerly manoeuvred the boat 
on the ebbing tide, Hazell explained to the million- 
aire that the * Squirm' was one of the most 
notorious craft on the river. It appeared that 
when anyone had a nefarious or underhand scheme 
afoot which necessitated river work Everett's 
launch was always available for a suitable monetary 
consideration. The * Squirm ' had got itself into 
a thousand scrapes, and out of those scrapes again 
with safety, if not precisely with honour. The 
river police kept a watchful eye on it, and the 
chief marvel about the whole thing was that old 
Everett, the owner, had never yet been seriously 
compromised in any illegal escapade. Not once 
had the officer of the law been able to prove any- 
thingdefinite against the proprietor of the * Squirm,* 
though several of it's quondam hirers were at that 
very moment in various of Her Majesty's prisons 
throughout the country. Latterly, however, the 
launch, with its damaged propeller, which Everett 
consistently refused to have repaired, had acquired 
an evil reputation, even among evil-doers, and this

fraternity had gradually come to abandon it for 
less easily recognisable craft. 

* Your friend, Mr. Tom Jackson/ said Hazell 
to Racksole, * committed an error of discretion 
when he hired the " Squirm." A scoundrel of his 
experience and calibre ought certainly to have 
known better than that. You cannot fail to get a 
clue now.* 

By this time the boat was approaching Cherry 
Gardens Pier, but unfortunately a thin night-fog 
had swept over the river, and objects could not 
be discerned with any clearness beyond a distance 
of thirty yards. As the Customs boat scraped 
down past the pier all its occupants strained eyes 
for a glimpse of the mysterious launch, but nothing 
could be seen of it. The boat continued to float 
idly down-stream, the men resting on their oars. 
Then they narrowly escaped bumping a large 
Norwegian sailing vessel at anchor with her stem 
pointing down-stream. This ship they passed on 
the port side. Just as they got clear of her bow- 
sprit the ht man cried out excitedly, * There's her 
nose 1 * and he put the boat about and began to 
puU back against the tide. And surely the missing 
• Squirm * was comfortably anchored on the star- 
board quarter of the Norwegian ship, hidden 
neatly between the ship and the shore. The men 
pulled very quietly alongside.

CHAPTER XXVI 

THE NIGHT CHASE AND THE MUD-LARK 

* I'll board her to start with,' said Hazell, whis- 
pering to Racksole. * I'll make out that I suspect 
they've got dutiable goods on board, and that will 
give me a chance to have a good look at her.' 

Dressed in his official overcoat and peaked cap, 
he stepped rather jauntily, as Racksole thought, 
on to the low deck of the launch. * Anyone 
aboard ? ' Racksole heard him cry out, and a 
woman's voice answered. * I'm a Customs ex- 
amining officer, and I want to search the launch/ 
Hazell shouted, and then disappeared down into 
the litde saloon amidships, and Racksole heard no 
more. It seemed to the millionaire that Hazell 
had been gone hours, but at length he returned. 

* Can't find anything,' he said, as he jumped 
into the boat, and then privately to Racksole : 
'There's a woman on board. Looks as if she 
might coincide with your description of Miss 
Spencer. Steam's up, but there's no engineer. 
I asked where the engineer was, and she inquired 



286 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

what business that was of mine, and requested me 
to get through with my own business and clear 
off. Seems rather a smart sort. I poked my 
nose into everything, but I saw no sign of anyone 
else. Perhaps we'd better pull away and lie near 
for a bit, just to see if anything queer occurs.' 

* You're quite sure he isn't on board ? ' 
Racksole asked. 

* Quite,' said Hazell positively ; * I know how 
to search a vessel. See this,' and he handed to 
Racksole a sort of steel skewer, about two feet 
long, with a wooden handle. * That,' he said, * is 
one of the Customs' aids to searching.' 

* I suppose it wouldn't do to go on board and 
carry off the lady ? ' Racksole suggested doubt- 
folly. 

* Well,' Hazell began, with equal doubtfulness, 
* as for that ' 

* Where's 'e orf ? ' It was the man in the 
bows who interrupted Hazell. Following the 
direction of the man's finger, both Hazell and 
Racksole saw with more or less distinctness a 
dinghy slip away from the forefoot of the Nor- 
wegian vessel and disappear down-stream into 
the mist. 

* It's Jules, I'll swear,' cried Racksole. * After 
him, men. Ten pounds a-piece if we overtake 
himP 



THE NIGHT-CHASE AND MUD-LARK 287 

« Lay down to it now, boys!' said HazeU, 
and the heavy Customs boat shot out in pursuit. 

* This IS going to be a lark,' Racksole re- 
marked. 

* Depends on what you caU a lark,' said Hazell ; 
Its not much of a lark tearing down midstream 

like this in a fog. You never know when you 
mayn t be in kingdom come with all these barges 
knocking around. I expect that chap hid in the 
dinghy when he first caught sight of us, and then 
shpped his painter as soon as I'd gone.' 

The boat was movmg at a rapid pace with the 
tide. Steering was a matter of luck and instinct 
more than anything else. Every now and then 
Hazell, Who held the lines, was obliged to jerk 
the boat s head sharply round to avoid a barge or 
an anchored vessel. It seemed to Racksole that 
vessels were anchored all over the stream. He 
looked about him anxiously, but for a long time 
he could se- nothing but mist and vague nautical 
orms. Then suddenly he said, quietly enough. 
Were on the right road ; I can see him ahead! 
We re gaming on him.' In another minute the 
dinghy was plainly visible, not twenty yards away 
and the sculler-scuUing frantically now-was 
unmistakably Jules-Jules in a light tweed suit 
and a bowler hat. 

* You were right,' Hazell said ; ' this is a lark.

I believe I'm getting quite excited. It's niore 
exciting than playing the trombone in an orchestra. 
rU run him down, eh ?— and then we can drag 
the chap in from the water/ 

Racksole nodded, but at that moment a barge, 
with her red saUs set, stood out of the fog clean 
across the bows of the Customs boat, which nar- 
rowly escaped instant destruction. When they 
got cle-.r, ind the usual interchange of calm, 
nonchalant swearing was over, the dinghy was 
barely to be discerned in the mis^ and the tat man 
was breathing in such a manner that his sighs 
might almost have been heard on the banks. 
Racksole wanted violendy to do something, but 
there was nothing to do ; he could only sit supine 
by Hazell's side in the stern-sheets. Gradually 
they began again to overtake the dinghy, whose 
one-man crew was evidently tiring. As they came 
up, hand over fist, the dinghy's nose swerved aside, 
and the tiny craft passed down a water-lane between 
two anchored mineral barges, which lay black and 
deserted about fifty yards from the Surrey shore. 
«To starboard,' said Racksole. «No, man !^ 
Hazell replied ; * we can't get through thers. He! 
bound to come out below ; it's only a feint. 1 1 
keep our nose straight ahead.' 

And they went on, the fat man pounding away 
with a fece which glistened even in the thid 



THE NIGHT-CHASE AND MUD-LARK 289 

gloom. It was an empty dinghy which emerged 
from between the two barges and went drifting 
and revolving down towards Greenwich. 

The fat man gasped a word to his comrade, 
and the Customs boat stopped dead. 

* E's all right,* said the man ia the bows. * If 
it's *im you want, *e*s on one o* them barges, so 
you've only got to step on and take 'im orf.' 

•That's all,* said a voice out of the depths of 
the nearest barge, and it was the voice of Jules, 
otherwise known as Mr. Tom Jackson. 

* 'Ear 'im ? ' said the fat man smiling. * *i7s a 
good 'un, 'e is. But if I was you, Mr. Hazell, 
or you, sir, I shouldn't step on to that barge so 
quick as all that.* 

They backed the boat under the stern of the 
nearest barge and gazed upwards. 

* It's all right,' said Racksole to Hazell ; * I've 
got a revolver. How can I clamber up there ? ' 

* Yes, I dare say you've got a revolver all right,* 
Hazell replied sharply. < But you mustn't use it. 
There mustn't be any noise. We should have 
the river police down on us in a twinkling if there 
was a revolver shot, and it would be the ruin of 
me. If an inquiry was held the Commissioners 
wouldn't take any official notice of the fact that 
my superior officer had put me on to this job, and 
I should be requested to leave the service.'

* Have no fear on that score,* said Racksole 

* I shall, of course, take all responsibility.* 

* It wouldn't matter how much responsibility 
you took,' Hazell retorted ; * you couldn't put 
me back into the senace, and my career would be 
at an end.' 

* But there are other careers,' said Racksole, 
who was really anxious to lame hij ex-waiter by 
means of a judiciously-aimed bullet. * There are 
other careers.' 

* The Customs is my career,' said Hazell, * so 
let's have no shooting. We'll wait about a bit ; he 
can't escape. You can have my skewer if you like ' 
— and he gave Racksole his searching instrument. 

* And you can do what you please, provided you 
do it nea*'y and don't make a row over it.' 

For a few moments the four men were passive 
in til.; boat, surrounded by swirling mist, with 
black water beneath them, and towering above 
them a half-loaded barge with a desperate and 
resourceful man on board. Suddenly the mist 
parted and shrivelled away in patches, as though 
before the breath of some monster. The sky 
was visible ; it was a clear sky, and the moon was 
shining. The transformation was just one of those 
meteorological quick-changes which happen most 
frequently on a great river. 

* That's a sight better,' said the fat man. At 
the same moment a head appeared over the edge 



THE NIGHT-CHASE AND MUD-LARK 291 

of the barge. It was Jules* face — dark, sinister 
and leering. 

* Is it Mr. Racksole in that boat . he inquired 
calmly ; * because, if so, let Mi . Racksole step up. 
Mr. Racksole has caught me, and he can have me 
for the asking. Here I am.' He stood up to 
his full height on the barge, tall against the night 
sky, and all the occupants of the boat could see 
that he held firmly clasped in his right hand a 
short dagger. * Now, Mr. Racksole, you've been 
after me for a long time,' he continued ; * her;? I 
am. Why don't you step up ? If you haven't 
got the pl'ick yourself, persuade someone else to 
step up in your place ... the same fair treat- 
ment will be accorded to all.' And Jules laughed 
a low, penetrating laugh. 

Ke was in the midst of this laugh when he 
lurched suddenly forward. 

* What'r' you doing of aboard my barge .? Off 
you goes ! ' It was a boy's small shrill voice 
that sounded in the night. A ragged boy's small 
form had appeared silently behind Jules, and two 
small arms with a vicious shove precipitated him 
into the water. He fell with a fine gurgling 
splash. It was at once obvious that swimming 
was not among Jules' accomplishments. He 
floundered wildly and sank. When he reappeared 
he was dragged into the Customs boat. Rope

was produced, and in a minute or two the man 
lay ignominiously bound in die bottom of the 
boat. With the aid of a mudlark — a mere barge 
boy, who probably had no more right on the barge 
than Jules himself — Rarksole had won his game. 
For the first time for several weeks the millionaire 
experienced a sensation of equanimity and satis^c- 
♦'.on. He leaned over the prostrate form vjf Jules, 
Hazell's professional skewer in his hand. 

* What are you going to do with him now ?' 
asked Hazell. 

* We'll row up to the landing steps in front of 
the Grand Babylon. He shall be well lodged at 
my hotel, I premise him.* 

Jules spoke no word. 

Before Racksole parted company with the 
Customs man that night Jules had been safely 
transported into the Grand Babylon Hotel and the 
two watermen had received their ;^to apiece. 

* You ^ill sleep here ? ' said the millionaire to 
Mr. George Hazell. * It is late.* 

* With pleasure,' said Hazell. The next 
morning he found a sumptuous breakfast awaiting 
him, and in his table-napkin was a Bank of Eng- 
land note for a hundred pounds. But, though he 
did not hoii cf them till much later, many things 
had happened before Hazell consumed that 
sumptuous breakfast.

CHAPTER XXVII 

THE CONFESSION OF MR. TOM JACKSON 

It happened that the small bedroom occupied by 
Jules during the years when he was head-waiter at 
the Grand Babylon had remained empty since his 
sudden dismissal by Theodore Racksole. No other 
head-waiter had been formally appointed in his 
place ; and, indeed, the absence of one man — even 
the unique Jules — could scarcely have been 
noticed in the enormous staff of a place like the 
Grand Babylon. The functions of a head-waitjr 
are generally more ornamental, spectacular and 
morally impressive than useful, and it was so at 
the great hotel on the Embankment. Racksole 
accordingly had the excellent idea of transporting 
his prisoner, with as much secrecy as possible, to 
this empty bedroom. There proved to be no 
difficulty in doing so; Jules showed himself 
perfecdy amenable to a show of superior force. 
Racksole took upstairs with him an old commis- 
sionaire who had been attached to the outdoor 



il! 



M

294 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

service of the hotel for many years — a grey-haired 
man, wiry as a terrier and strong as a mastiff. 
Entering the bedroom with Jules, whose hands 
were bound, he told the commissionaire to remain 
outside the door. Jules' bedroom was quite an 
ordinary apartment, though perhaps slighdy 
superior to the usual accommodation provided for 
servants in the caravanserais of the West End. 
It was about fourteen feet by twelve. It was 
furnished with a bedstead, a small wardrobe, a small 
washstand and dressing-table, and two chairs. 
There were two hooks behind the door, a strip of 
carpet by the bed, and some cheap ornaments on the 
iron mantelpiece. There was also one electric light. 
The window was a little square one, high up from 
the floor, and it looked on the inner quadrangle. 
The room was on the top storey — the eighth — and 
from it you had a view sheer to the ground. 
Twenty feet below ran a narrow cornice about a 
foot wide ; three feet or so above the window 
another and wider cornice jutted out, and above 
that was the high steep roof of the hotel, though 
you could not see it from the window. As Rack- 
sole examined the window and the outlook, he said 
to himself that Jules could not escape by that 
exit, at any rate. He gave a glance up the chimney, 
and saw that the flue was far too smaU to admit a 
man's body. 



i3*!*»'f.Si-'aS» 



THE CONFESSION O'' MR. JACKSON 295 

Then he called in the commissionaire, and to- 
gether they bound Jules firmly to the bedstead 
allowing him, however, to lie down. All the 
while the captive never opened his mouth— merely 
smiled a smile of disdain. Finally Racksole 
removed the ornaments, the carpet, the chairs and 
the hooks, and wrenched away the switch of the 
electric light. Then he and the commissionaire left 
the room, and Racksole locked the door on the 
outside and put the key in his pocket. 

*You will keep watch here,' '^e said to the 
commissionaire, 'through the night. You can sit 
on this chair. Don't go to sleep. If you hear the 
slightest noise in the room blow your cab-whistle ; 
I will arrange to answer the signal. If there is no 
noise do nothing whatever. I don't want this 
talked about, you understand. I shall trust you ; 
you can trust me.* 

• But the servants will see me here when they 
get up to-morrow,' said the commissionaire, with 
a faint smile, * and they will be pretty certain to 
ask what I'm doing of up here. What shall I say 
to 'em?' ' 

' You've been a soldier, haven't you ? ' asked 
Racksole. 

* I've seen three campagins, sir,' was the reply, 
and, with a gesture of pardonable pride, the grey- 
haired fellow pointed to the medals on his breast.

* Well, supposing you were on sentry duty an 
some meddlesome person in camp asked yo 
what you were doing — what should you say ? * 

* I should tell him to clear off or take the con 
sequences, and pretty quick too.' 

* Do that to-morrow morning, then, if neces 
sary,* said Racksole, and departed. 

It was then about one o'clock a.m. Th( 
millionaire retired to bed— not his own bed, butj 
bed on the seventh storey. He did not, however 
sleep very long. Shortly after dawn he was wide- 
awake, and thinking busily about Jules. He wasj 
indeed, very curious to know Jules' story, and he 
determined, if the thing could be done at all, by 
persuasion or otherwise, to extract it from him. 
With a man of Theodore Racksole's temperament 
there is no time like the present, and at six o'clock, 
as the bright morning sun brought gaiety into the 
window, he dressed and went upstairs again to the 
eighth storey. The commissionaire sat stolid but 
alert on ' is chair, and, at the sight of his master, 
rose and saluted. 

'Anything happened .? ' Racksole asked. 

* Nothing, sir.' 

* Servants say anything ? * 

* Only a dozen or so of *em are up yet, sir. 
One of 'em asked what I was playing at, and so I 
told her I was looking after a bull bitch and a

Sir. ' 

* Good/ said Racksole, as he unlocked the door 
and entered the room. All was exactly as he had 
left It except that Jules, who had been lying on his 
back, had somehow turned over and was now lying 
on h,. face. He gazed silently, scowling at the 
millionaire. Racksole greeted him and ostenta- 
tiously took a revolver from his hip-pocket and 
Uid It on the dressing-table. Then he seated 
himself on the dressing-table by the side of the

been treated very handsomely, my son. There 
you are I * and he loosened the lower extremities 
of his prisoner from their bonds. * Now I repeat 
you may as well be reasonable. You may as well 
admit that you've been fairly beaten in the game 
and act accordingly. I was determined to beat you, 
by myself, without the police, and I've done it.' 

* You've done yourself,' retorted Tules. 

* You've gone against the law. If you'd had any 
sense you wouldn't have meddled ; you'd have 
left everything to the police. They'd have 
muddled about for a year or two, and then done 
nothing. Who's going to tell the police now ? Are 
you ? Are you going to give me up to 'em, and 
say, " Here, I've caught him for you." If you do 
they'll ask you to explain several things, and then 
you'll look foolish. One crime doesn't excuse 
another, and you'll find that out.' 

With unerring insight, Jules had perceived 
exactly the difficulty of Racksole's position, and it 
was certainly a difficulty which Racksole did not 
attempt to minimise to himself. He knew well 
that it would have to be faced. He did not, 
however, allow Jules to guess his thoughts. 

* Meanwhile,' he said calmly to the other, 

* you're here and my prisoner. You've committed 
a variegated assortment of crimes, and among 
them is murder. You are due to be hung. 



THE CONFESSION OF MR. JACKSON 299 

You know that. There is no reason why I should 
call in the police at all. It w!ll be perfectly easy 
for me to finish you off, as you deserve, myself. 
I shall only be carrying out justice, and robbing 
the hangman of his fee. Precisely as I brought 
you into the hotel, I can take you out again. A 
few days ago you borrowed or stole a steam yacht 
at Ostend. What you have done with it I don't 
know, nor do I care. But I strongly suspect that 
my daughter had a narrow escape of being 
murdered on your steam yacht. Now I have a 
steam yacht of my own. Suppose I use it as you 
used yours I Suppose I smuggle you on to it, 
steam out to sea, and then ask you to step off it 
into the ocean one night. Such things have been 
done. Such things will be done again. If I acted 
so, I should, at least, have the satisfaction of 
knowing that I had relieved society from the 
incubus of a scoundrel.' 

* But you won't,' Jules murmured. 

* No,' said Racksole steadily, < I won't — if you 
behave yourself this morning. But I swear to you 
that if you don't I will never rest till you are dead, 
police or no police. You don't know Theodore 
Racksole.' 

*I believe you mean it,' Jjles exclaimed, with 
an air of surprised interest, as though he had 
discovered something of importance. 



1 



300 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 






* I believe I do,' Racksole resumed. * Nov 
listen. At the best, you will be given up to th< 
police. At the worst, I shall deal with you myself 
With the police you may have a chance— you maj 
get off with twenty years* penal servitude, because 
though it is absolutely certain that you murdered 
Reginald Dimmock, it would be a little difficult tc 
prove the case against you. But with me you 
would have no chance whatever. I have a few 
questions to put to you, and it will depend on how 
you answer them whether I give you up to the 
police or take the law into my own hands. And 
let me tell you that the latter course would be 
much simpler for me. And I would take it, too, 
did I not feel that you were a very clever 
and exceptional man ; did I not have a sort of 
sneaking admiration for your detestable skill and 
ingenuity.* 

*You think, then, that I am clever.?' said 
Jules. * You are right. I am. I should have 
been much too clever for you if luck had not been 
against me. You owe your victory, not to skill, 
but to luck.' 

*That is what the vanquished always say. 
Waterloo was a bit of pure luck for the English, 
no doubt, but it was Waterloo all the same.' 

Ju! s yawned elaborately. *What do you 
want to know ? ' he enquired, with politeness. 



■ItfHHMMliiMMI 



THE CONFESSION OF MR. JACKSON 301 

* First and foremost, I want to know the names 
of your accomplices inside this hote!.' 

* I have no more,' said Jules. * Rocco was the 
last.' 

* Don't begin by lying to me. If you had no 
accomplice, how did you contrive that one 
particular bottle of Romande-Conti should be 
served to his Highness Prince Eugen ? ' 

*Then you discovered that in time, did you ?' 
said Jules. * I was afraid so. Let me explain 
that that needed no accomplice. The bottle was 
topmost in the bin, and naturally it would be 
taken. Moreover, I left it sticking out a litde 
further than the rest.' 

*You did not arrange, then, that Hubbard 
should be taken ill the night before last ? ' 

* I had no idea,* said Jules, * that the excellent 
Hubbard was not enjoying his accustomed 
health.' 

* Tell me,' said Racksole, * who or what is the 
origin of your vendetta against the life of Prince 
Eugen ? ' 

* I had no vendetta against the life of Prince 
Eugen,' said Jules, * at least, not to begin with. I 
merely undertook, for a consideration, to see that 
Prince Eugen did not have an interview with a 
certain Mr. Sampson Levi in London before a 
certain date, that was all. It seemed simple

enough. I had been engaged in far more com- 
plicated transactions before. I was convinced 
that I could manage it, with the help of Rocco 
and Em — ana Miss Spencer.' 

* Is that woman your wife ? * 

* She would like to be,' he sneered. * Please 
don't interrupt. I had completed my arrange- 
ments, when you so inconsiderately bought the 
hotel. I don't mind admitting now that from the 
very moment when you came across me that 
night in the corridor I was secretly afraid of you, 
though I scarcely admitted the fact even to myselt 
then. I thought it safer to shift the scene of our 
operations to Ostend. I had meant to deal with 
Prince Eugen in this hotel, but I decide.', then, to 
intercept him on the Continent, and I despatched 
Miss Spencer with some instructions. Troubles 
never come singly, and it happened that just then 
that fool Dimmock, who had been in the swim 
with us, chose to prove refractory. The slightest 
hitch would have upset everything, and I was 
obliged to — to clear him off the scene. He 
wanted to back out — he had a bad attack oi 
conscience, and violent measures were essential, 
I regret his untimely decease, but he brought it or 
himself Well, everything was going serenelj 
when you and your brilliant daughter, apparent!) 
determined to meddle, turned up again among ui

at Ostend. Only twenty-four hours, however, 
had to elapse before the date which had been 
mentioned to me by my employers. I kept poor 
little Eugen for the allotted time, and then you 
managed to get hold of him. I do not deny that 
you scored there, though, according to my 
original instructions, you scored too late. The 
time had passed, and, so far as I knew, it didn't 
matter a pin whether Prince Eugen saw Mr. Samp- 
son Levi or not. But my employers were still 
uneasy. They were uneasy even after little 
Eugen had lain ill in Ostend for several weeks. 
It appears that they feared that even at that date 
an interview between Prince Eugen and Mr. Samp- 
son Levi might work harm to them. So they 
applied to me again. This time they wanted Prince 
Eugen to be — er — finished off entirely. They 
offered high terms.' 

* What terms .? ' 

* I had received fifty thousand pounds for the 
first job, of which Rocco had half Rocco was 
also to be made a member of a certain famous 
European order, if things went right. That was 
what he coveted far more than the money — the 
vain fellow ! For the second job I was oflrered a 
hundred thousand. A tolerably large sum. I 
regret that I have not been able to earn it.' 

* Do you mean to tell me,' asked Racksole,

304 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

horror-struck by this calm confession, in spite of 
his previous knowledge, * that you were offered 
a hundred thousand pounds to poison Prince 

Eugen ? * . 

*You put it rather crudely,* said Jules in 
reply. *I prefer to say that I ^as offered a 
hundred thousand pounds if Prince Eugen should 
die within a reasonable time.' 

* And who were your damnable employers ? ' 
•That, honestly, I do not know.* 

*You know, I suppose, who paid you the first 
fif; thousand pounds, and who promised you the 
hundred thousand.' 

* Well,' said Jules, * I know vaguely. I know 

that he came vid Vienna from— er— Bosnia. My 

impression was that the affair had some bearing, 

direct or indirect, on the projected marriage of 

the King of Bosnia. He is a young monarch, 

scarcely out of political leading-strings, as it were, 

and doubdess his Ministers thought that they had 

better arrange his marriage for him. They tried 

last year, and failed because the Princess whom 

they had in mind had cast her sparkling eyes or 

another Prince. That Prince happened to be 

Prince Eugen of Posen. The Ministers of the 

King of Bosnia knew exactly the circumstances ol 

Prince Eugen. They knew that he could noi 

marry without liquidating his debts, and the) 



BM 



THE CONFESSION OF MR. JACKSON 305 



knew that he could only liquidate his debts 
through this Jew, Sampson Levi. Unfortunately 
for me, they ultimately wanted to make too sure 
of Prince Eugen. They were afraid he might 
after all arrange his marriage without the aid of 
Mr. Sampson Levi, and so — well, you know the 
rest. ... It is a pity that the poor little innocent 
King of Bosnia can't have the Princess of his 
Ministers' choice.' 

* Then you think th^t the King himself had 
no part in this abominable crime ? ' 

* I think decidedly not.* 

* I am glad of that/ said Racksole simply. 
* And now, the name of your immediate employer.' 

* He was merely an agent. He called himself 
Sleszak — S-1-e-s-z-a-k. But I imagine that that 
wasn't his real name. I don't know his real 
name. An old man, he often used to be found 
at the H6tel Ritz, Paris.' 

* Mr. Sleszak and I will meet,' said Racksole. 

* Not in this world,' said Jules quickly. * He 
is dead. I heard only last night — just before our 
little tussle.' 

There was a silence. 

* It is well,' said Racksole at length. * Prince 
Eugen lives, despite all plots. After all, justice 
is done.' 

* Mr. Racksole is here, but he can see no one.

miss.* The words came from behind the door, 
and the voice was the commissionaire's. Rack- 
sole started up, and went towards the door. 

* Nonsense,' was the curt reply, in feminine 
tones. * Move aside instantly.' 

The door opened, and Nella entered. There 
were tears in her eyes. 

* Oh ! dad,' she exclaimed, * I've only jusl 
heard you were in the hotel. We looked for you 
everywhere. Come at once. Prince Eugen is 
dying — — ' Then she saw the man sitting or 
the bed, and stopped. 

Later, when Jules was alone again, he re- 
marked to himself, *I may get that hundrec 
thousand.'

CHAPTER XXVIII 

THE STATE BEDROOM ONCE MORE 

When, immediately after the episode of the bottle 
of Roman6e-Conti in the State dining-room, Prince 
Aribert and old Hans found that Prince Eugen 
had sunk in an unconscious heap over his chair, 
both the former thought, at the first instant, that 
Eugen must have already tasted the poisoned 
wine. But a moment's reflection showed that 
this was not possible. If the Hereditary Prince 
of Posen was dying or dead, his condition was 
due to some other agency than the Roman^e- 
Conti. Aribert bent over him, and a powerfUl 
odour from the man's lips at once disclosed the 
cause of the disaster : it was the odour of 
laudanum. Indeed, the smeU of that sinister 
drug seemed now to float heavily over the whole 
table. Across Aribert's mind there flashed then 
the true explanation. Prince Eugen, taking ad- 
vantage of Aribert's attention being momentarily 
diverted, and yielding to a sudden impulse of 

xa 



if 



liij' 






i I*" 



308 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

despair, had decided to poison himself, and hac 
carried out his intention on the spot. Th< 
laudanum must have been already in his pocket 
and this fact went to prove that the unfortunat< 
Prince had previously contemplated such a pro- 
ceeding, even after his definite promise. Ariben 
remembered now with painftxl vividness hi; 
nephew's words : * I withdraw my promise. Ob- 
serve that — I withdraw it.' It must have been 
instantly after the utterance of that formal with- 
drawal that Eugen attempted to destroy himself. 
•It's laudanum, Hans,' Aribert exclaimedj 
rather helplessly. 

* Surely his Highness has not taken poison ? ' 
said Hans. * It is impossible I ' 

* I fear it is only too possible,' said the other. 
•It's laudanum. What are we to do? Quick, 
man ! ' 

* His Highness must be roused, Prince. He 
must have an emetic. We had better carry him 
to the bedroom.' 

They did, and laid him on the great bed ; and 
then Aribert mixed an emetic of mustard and 
water, and administered it, but without \y 
effect. The sufferer lay motionless, with every 
muscle relaxed. His skin was ice-cold to the 
touch, and the eyelids, half-drawn, showed that 
the pupils were painfully contracted. 



: .'iU. 



THE STATE BEDROOM ONCE MORE 309 

«Go out, and send fc- a doctor, Hans. Say 
that Prince Eugen I- . been suddenly taken ill 
but that it isn't serio . s. The truth must neve^ 
be known. 

* He must be roused, sire,' Hans said again, 
as he hurried from the room. 

Aribert lifted his nephew from the bed, shook 
him, pinched him, flicked him cruelly, shouted at 
him, dragged him about, but to no avail. At 
length he desisted, from mere physical fatigue, 
and laid the Prince back again on the bed. Ever,? 
minute that elapsed seemed an hour. Alone 
with the unconscious organism in the silence of 
the great stately chamber, under the cold yeUow 
glare of the electric lights, Aribert became a prey 
to the most despairing thoughts. The tragedy 
of his nephew's career forced itself upon him, and 
It occurred to him that an early and shameful 
death had all along been inevitable for this good- 
natured, weak-purposed unhappy child of a 
historic throne. A little good fortune, and his 
character, so evenly balanced between right and 
wrong, might have followed the proper path, and 
t-ugen might have figured at any rate with 
dignity on the European stage. But now it ap- 
peared that all was over, the last stroke played. 
And m this disaster Aribert saw the ruin of his 
own hopes. For Aribert would have to occupy 



il 



•^' - 4p r-r^ r»--T. 



» • I 




310 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

his nephew's throne, and he felt instinctively that 
nature had not cut him out for a throne. By 
a natural impulse he inwardly rebelled against 
the prospect of monarchy. Monarchy meant so 
much for which he knew himself to be entirely 
unfitted. It meant a political marriage, which 
means a forced marriage, a union against inclina- 
tion. And then what of Nella — Nella ! 

Hans returned. * I have sent for the nearest 
doctor, and also for a specialist,' he said. 

* Good,' said Aribert. * I hope they will 
hurry.' Then he sat down and wrote a card. 
* Take this yourself to Miss Racksole. If she is 
out of the hotel, ascertain where she is and follow 
her. Understand, it is of the first importance.' 

Hans bowed, and departed for the second 
time, and Aribert was alone again. He gazed at 
Eugen, and made another frantic attempt to raise 
him from the deadly stupor, but it was useless. 
He walked away to the window : through the 
opened casement he could hear the tinkle of pas- 
sing hansoms on the Embankment below, whisdes 
of door-keepers, and the hoot of steam-tugs on 
the river. The world went on as usual, it ap- 
peared. It was an absurd world. He desired 
nothing better than to abandon his princely tide, 
and live as a plain man, the husband of the finest 
woman on earth. ... But now I . . . Pah ! 



THE STATE BEDROOM ONCE MORE 311 

How selfish he was, to be thinking of himself 
when Eugen lay dying. Yet — Nella I 

The door opened, and a man entered, who 
was obviously the doctor. A few curt questions, 
and he had grasped the essentials of the case. 
* Oblige me by ringing the bell, Prince. I shall 
want some hot water, and an able-bodied man 
and a nurse.' 

* Who wants a nurse } ' said a voice, and 
Nella came quietly in. * I am a nurse,' she added 
to the doctor, ' and at your orders.' 

The next two hours were a struggle between 
life and death. The first doctor, a specialist who 
followed him, Nella, Prince Aribert, and old 
Hans formed, as it were, a league to save the 
dying man. No*^ "Ise in the hotel knew the 
real seriousness : ' ; case. When a Prince 
falls ill, and especia ly oy his own act, the precise 
truth is not issued broadcast to the universe. 
According to official intelligence, a Prince is 
never seriously ill until he is dead. Such is 
statecraft. 

The worst feature of Prince Eugen's case was 
that emetics proved futile. Neither of the doc- 
tors could explain their failure, but it was only 
too apparent. The league was reduced to help- 
lessness. At last the great specialist from Man- 
chester Square gave it out that there was no 







312 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

chance for Prince Eugen unless the natural 
vigour of his constitution should prove capable 
of throwing oiF the poison unaided by scientific 
assistanc .'^ as a drunkard can sleep off his potion. 
Everything had been tried, even to artificial re- 
spiration and the injection of hot coffee. Having 
emitted this pronouncement, the great specialist 
from Manchester Square left. It was one o'clock 
in the morning. By one of those strange and 
futile coincidences which sometimes startle vs 
by their subtle significance, the specialist met 
Theodore Racksole and his captive as they were 
entering the hotel. Neither had the least sus- 
picion of the other's business. 

In the State bedroom the small group of 
watchers surrounded the bed. The slow minutes 
filed away in dreary procession. Another hour 
passed. Then the figure on the bed, hitherto 
so motionless, twitched and moved ; the lips 
parted. 

* There is hope,* said the doctor, and ad- 
ministered a stimijant which was handed to him 
by Nella. 

In a quarter of an hour the patient had 
regained consciousness. For the ten thousandth 
time in the history of medicine a sound con- 
stitution had accomplished a miracle impossible 
to the accumulated medical skill of centuries. 



THE STATE BEDROOM ONCE MORE 313 

In due course the doctor left, saying that 
Prince Eugen was * on the high road to recovery,* 
and promising to come again within a few hours. 
Morning had dawned. Nella drew the great 
curtains, and let in a flood of sunlight. Old 
Hans, overcome by fatigue, dozed in a chair in 
a far corner of the room. The reaction had 
been too much for him. Nella and Prince 
Aribert looked at each other. They had not 
exchanged a word about themselves, yet each 
knew what the other had been thinking. They 
clasped hands with a perfect understanding. 
Their brief love-making had been of the silent 
kind, and it was silent now. No word was 
uttered. A shadow had passed from over them, 
but only their eyes expressed relief and joy. 

* Aribert!* The faint call came from the 
bed. Aribert went to the bedside, while Nella 
remained near the window. 

* What is it, Eugen .? ' he said. « You are 
better now.' 

*You think so.?' murmured the other. *I 
want you to forgive me for all this, Aribert. I 
must have caused you an intolerable trouble. 
I did it so clumsily ; that is what annoys me. 
Laudanum was a feeble expedient ; but I could 
think of nothing else, and I daren't ask anyone 
for advice. I was obliged to go out and buy

W%' 






the stuff for myself. It was all very awkward. 
But, thank goodness, it has not been ineffectual.' 

*What do you mean, Eugen .' You are 
better. In a day or so you will be perfectly 
recovered.' 

* I am dying,' said Eugen quietly. * Do 
not be deceived. I die because I wish to die. 
It is bound to be so. I know by the feel of my 
heart. In a few hours it will be over. The 
throne of Posen will be yours, Aribert. You 
will fill it more worthily than I have done. 
Don't let them know over there that I poisoned 
myself Swear Hans to secrecy ; swear the 
doctors to secrecy ; and breathe no word your- 
self I have been a fool, but I do not wish it 
to be known that I was also a coward. Perhaps 
it is not cowardice ; perhaps it is courage, after 
all — courage to cut the knot. I could not have 
survived the disgrace of any revelations, Aribert, 
and revelations would have been sure to come. 
I have made a fool of myself, but I am ready to 
pay for it. We of Posen — we always pay— 
everything except our debts. Ah ! those debts ! 
Had it not been for those I could have faced her 
who was to have been my wife, to have shared 
my throne. I could have hidden my past, and 
begun again. With her help I really could have 
begun again. But Fate has been against me— 



THE STATE BEDROOM ONCE MORE 315 

always! always! By the way, what was that 
plot against me, Aribert ? I forget, I forget.' 

His eyes closed. There was a sudden noise. 
Old Hans had slipp :d from his chair to the floor. 
He picked himself up, dazed, and crept shame- 
facedly out of the room. 

Aribert took his nephew's hand. 

' Nonsense, Eugen ! You are dreaming. You 
will be all right soon. Pull yourself together.' 

*A11 because of a million,' the sick man 
moaned. * One miserable million English pounds. 
The national debt of Posen is fifty millions, and 
I, the Prince of Posen, couldn't borrow one. If 
I could have got it, I might have held my head 
up again. Good-bye, Aribert. . . . Who is that 
girl?' 

Aribert looked up. Nella was standing silent 
at the foot of the bed, her eyes moist. She came 
round to the bedside, and put her hand on the 
patient's heart. Scarcely could she feel its pulsa- 
tion, and to Aribert her eyes expressed a sudden 
despair. 

At that moment Hans re-entered the room 
and beckoned to her. 

*I have heard that Herr Racksole has re- 
turned to the hotel,' he whispered, « and that he 
has captured that man Jules, who they say is 
such a villain.' 



3i6 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

Several times during the night Nella had 
inquired for her father, but could gain no know- 
ledge of his whereabouts. Now, at half-past six 
in the morning, a rumour had mysteriously 
spread among the servants of the hotel about the 
happenings of the night before. How it had 
originated no one could have determined, but it 
had originated. 

* Where is my father ? ' Nella asked of Hans. 
He shrugged his shoulders, and pointed up- 
wards. * Somewhere at the top, they say.' 

Nella almost ran out of the room. Her 
interruption of the interview between Jules and 
Theodore Racksole has already been described. 
As she came downstairs with her father she said 
again, * Prince Eugen is dying — but I think you 
can save him.* 

* I .? ' exclaimed Theodore. 

* Yes,' she repeated positively. * I will tell 
you what I want you to do, and you must do 
it.'

CHAPTER XXIX 

THEODORE IS CALLED TO THE RESCUE 

As Nella passed downstairs from the top storey 
with her father— the lifts had not yet begun to 
work— she drew him into her own room, and 
closed the door. 

* What's this all about ?' he asked, somewhat 
mystified, and even alarmed by the extreme 
seriousness of her face. 

*Dad,' the girl began, «you are very rich, 
aren't you ? very, very rich ? ' She smiled 
anxiously, timidly. He did not remember to have 
seen that expression on her face before. He wanted 
to make a facetious reply, but checked himself. 

* Yes,' he said, * I am. You ought to know 
that by this time.' 

*How soon could you realise a million 
pounds .? ' 

* A million— what ? * he cried. Even he was 
staggered by her calm reference to this gigantic 
sum. « What on earth are you driving at ? ' 

* A miUion pounds,' I said. « That is to say, five 



■ ■'if 



3x8 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

million dollars. How soon could you realise as 
much as that ? ' 

* Oh r he answered, * in about a month, if ] 
went about it neatly enough. I could unload as 
much as that in a month without scaring Wall 
Street and other places. But it would want some 
management.' 

* Useless ! ' she exclaimed. * Couldn't you dc 
it quicker, if you really had to .' ' 

* If I really had to, I could fix it in a week, 
but it would make things lively, and I should lose 
on the job.' 

* Couldn't you,' she persisted, * couldn't you 
go down town this morning and raise a million, 
somehow, if it was a matter of life and death ?' 

He hesitated. *Look here, Nella,' he said, 
* what is it you've got up your sleeve } ' 

* Just answer my question, dad, and try not tc 
think that I'm a stark, staring lunatic' 

*I rather expect I could get a million thi; 
morning, e/en in London. But it would cosi 
pretty dear. It might cost me fifty thousanc 
pounds, and there would be the dickens of ai 
upset in New York — a sort of grand universa 
slump in my holdings.' 

*Why should New York know anything 
about it ? ' 

«Why should New York know anythim

about it I ' he repeated. * My gJH, when anyone 
borrows a milhon sovereigns the whole world 
knows about it. Do you reckon that I can go up 
o the Governors of the Bank of England and say. 
Look here, lend Theodore Racksole a million for 
a tew weeks, and he'll give you an I O U and a 
covering note on stocks ? " ' 

I But you could get it ?' she asked again. 
If there's a million in London I guess I 
could handle it,' he replied. ^ 

; Well, dad,' and she put her arms round his 
neck you ve just got to go out and fix it. See ?

«I know all about that—perhaps more than 
you do. But I don't see how it affects you or me.' 
«The point is this, dad,' Nella continued. 
•He's tried to commit suicide— he's so hipped. 
Yes, real suicide. He took laudanum last night. 
It didn't kill him straight off— he's got over the 
first shock, but he's in a very weak state, and he 
says he means to die. And I truly beheve he 
will die. Now, if you could let him have thai 
million, dad, you would save his life.' 

Nella's item of news was a considerable anc 

disconcerting surprise to Racksole, but he hid hi: 

feelings fairly well. . 

*I haven't the least desire to save his hk 

Neli. I don't over-much respect your Princ 

Eugen. I've done what I could for him— but onl; 

for the sake of seeing fair play, and because 

object to conspiracies and secret murders. It's 

different thing if he wants to kill himself. Whs 

I say is : Let him. Who is responsible for h: 

being in debt to the tune of a million pounds 

He's only got himself and his bad habits t 

thank for that. I suppose if he does happen 1 

peg out, the throne of Posen will go to Prin( 

Aribert. And a good thing, too ! Aribert 

worth twenty of his nephew.' 

« That's just it, dad,' she said, eagerly follov 
ing up her chance. * I want you to save Prm 



THEODORE CALLED TO THE RESCUE 321 

Eugen just because -A ribert— Prince Aribert— 
doesn't wish to occupy the throne. He'd much 
prefer not to have it.* 

* Much prefer not to have it ! Don't talk 
nonsense. If he's honest with himself, he'll 
admit that he'll be jolly glad to have it. Thrones 
are in his blood, so to speak.' 

' You are wrong, father. And the reason is 
this : If Prince Aribert ascended the throne of 
Posen he would be compelled to marry a 
Princess.' 

* Well I A Prince ought to marry a Princess.' 

* But he doesn't want to. He wants to give 
up all his royal rights, and live as a subject. He 
wants to marry a woman who isn't a Princess ' 

' Is she rich .? ' 

' Her father is,' said the giri. ' Oh, dad ! 
can't you guess.? He— he loves me.' Her 
head fell on Theodore's shoulder vnd she began 
to cry. ° 

The millionaire whistled a very high note. 



'Nell!' he said at length, 
you sort of cling to him ? ' 

'Dad,' she answered, 'you are stupid „ 
you imagine I should worry myself like this it 
1 didn't .? ' She smiled through her tears. Sh

* It's a mighty queer arrangement,' Theodore 
remarked. * But of course if you think it'll be of 
any use, you had better go down and tell your 
Prince Eugen that that million can be fixed up, 
if he really needs it. I expect there'll be decent 
security, or Sampson Levi wouldn't have mixed 
himself up in it.' 

* Thanks, dad. Don't come with me ; 1 may 
manage bett;er alone.' 

She gave a formal little curtsey and disappeared. 
Racksole, who had the talent, so necessary to mil- 
lionaires, of attending to several matters at once, 
the large with the small, went olF to give orders 
about the breakfast and the remuneration of his 
assistant of the evening before, Mr. George 
Hazell. He then sent an invitation to Mr. Felix 
Babylon's room, asking that gentleman to take 
breakfast with him. After he had related to 
Babylon the history of Jules' capture, and had a 
long discussion with him upon several points of 
hotel management, and especially as to the 
guarding of wine-cellars, Racksole put on his hat, 
sallied forth into the Strand, hailed a hansom, and 
was driven to the City. The order and nature of 
his operations there were too complex and technical 
to be described here. 

When Nella returned to th'; State bedroom 
both the doctor and the great specialist were again 



THEODORE CALLED TO THE RESCUE 323 

in attendance. The two physicians moved away 
from the bedside as she entered, and began to talk 
quietly together in the embrasure of the window. 

' A curious case ! ' said the specialist. 

* Yes. Of course, as you say, it's a neurotic 
temperament that's at the bottom of the trouble. 
When you've got that and a rigorous constitution 
working one against the other, the results are apt 
to be distinctly curious. Do you consider there 
is any hope, Sir Charles ? ' 

' If I had seen him when he recovered con- 
sciousness I should have said there was hope. 
Frankly, when I left last night, or rather this 
morning, I didn't expect to see the Prince alive 
again — let alone conscious, and able to talk. 
According to all the rules of the game, he ought 
to get over the shock to the system with per- 
fect ease and certainty. But I don't think he 
will. I don't think he wants to. And moreover, 
I think he is still under the influence of suicidal 
mania. If he had a razor he would cut his 
throat. You must keep his strength up. Inject, 
if necessary. I will come in this afternoon. I 
am due now at St. James's Palace.' And the 
specialist hurried away, with an elaborate bow and 
a few hasty words of polite reassurances to Prince 
Aribert. 

When he had gone Prince Aribert took the

other doctor aside. * Forget everything, doctor,' 
he said, * except that I am one man and you are 
another, and tell me the truth. Shall you be able 
to save his Highness } Tell me the truth.' 

* There is no truth,* was the doctor's reply. 

* The future is not in our hands, Prince.' 

* But you are hopeful ? Yes or no.* 

The doctor looLed at Prince Aribert. * No ! ' 
he said shortly. * I am not. I am never hopeful 
when the patient is not on my side.' 

* You mean } ' 

* I mean that his Royal Highness has no desire 
to live. You must have observed that.' 

* Only too well,' said Aribert. 

* And you are aware of the cause ? * 
Aribert nodded an affirmative. 

* But cannot remove it ? ' 

* No,' said Aribert. He felt a touch on his 
sleeve. It was Nella's finger. With a gesture 
she beckoned him towards the ante-room. 

* If you choose,' she said, when they were alone, 

* Prince Eugen can be saved. I have arranged it.' 

* You have arranged it ? ' He bent over her, 
almost with an air of alarm. 

'Go and tell him that the million pounds 
which is so necessary to his happiness will be 
forthcoming. Tell him that it will be forthcoming 
to-day, if that will be any satisfaction to him.'

* But what do you mean by this, Nella ? ' 

* I mean what I say, Aribert,* and she sought 
his hand and took it in hers. * Just what I say. 
If a million pounds will save Prince Eugen's life, 
it is at his disposal.* 

* But how — how have you managed it ? By 
what miracle ? ' 

* My father,' she replied softly, * will do any- 
thing that I ask him. Do not let us waste time. 
Go and tell Eugen it is arranged, that all wil' 
be well. Go ! ' 

* But we cannot accept this — this enormous, 
this incredible favour. It is impossible.' 

* Aribert,' she said quickly, * remember you 
are not in Posen holding a Court reception. You 
are in England and you are talking to an American 
girl who has always been in the habit of having 
her own way.' 

The Prince threw up his hands and went back 
m to the bedroom. The doctor was at a table 
writing out a prescription. Aribert approached the 
bedside, his heart beating furiously. Eugen 
greeted him with a faint, fatigued smile. 

* Eugen,' he whispered, < listen carefully to me. 
I have news. With the assistance of friends I 
have arranged to borrow that million for you. It 
IS quite setded, and you may rely on it. But you 
must get better. Do you hear me ? 



326 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

Eugen almost sa> up in bed. * Tell me I am 
not delirious,* he exclaimed. 

* Of course you aren't,* Aribcrt replied. * But 
you mustn't sit up. You must take care of 
yourself.* 

* Who will lend the money ? ' Eugen asked 
in a feeble, happy whisper. 

* Never mind. You shall hear later. Devote 
yourself now to getting better.* 

The change in the patient*s face was extra- 
ordinary. His mind seemed to have put on aa 
entirely different aspect. The doctor was startled 
to hear him murmur a request for food. As for 
Aribert, he sat down, overcome by the turmoil of 
his own thoughts. Till that moment he felt that 
he had never appreciated the value and the marvel- 
lous power of mere money, of the lucre which 
philosophers pretend to despise and men sell their 
souls for. His heart almost burst in its admira- 
tion for that extraordinary Nella, who by mere 
personal force had raised two men out of the 
deepest slough of despair to the blissful heights of 
hope and happiness. ' These Anglo-Saxons,' he 
said to himself, ' what a race ! ' 

By the afternoon Eugen was noticeably and 
distinctly better. The physicians, puzzled for the 
third time by the progress of the case, announced 
now that all danger was past. The tone of the 



'^aHm

announcement seemed to Aribert to imply that the 
fortunate issue was due wholly to unrivalled 
medical skill, but perhaps Aribert was mistaken. 
Anyhow, he was in a most charitable mood, and 
prepared to forgive anything. 

* Nella,' he said a little later, when they were 
by themselves again in the ante-chamber, * what 
am I to say to you } How can I thank you ? 
How can I thank your father ? ' 

* You had better not thank my father,' she said. 
' Dad will affect to regard the thing as a purely 
business transaction, as, of course, it is. As for 
me, you can — you can ' 

'Well?' 

* Kiss me,' she said. * There ! Are you sure 
you've formally proposed to me, mon prince ? ' 

' Ah ! Nell ! ' he exclaimed, putting his arms 
round her again. ' Be mine 1 That is all I 
want ! ' 

' You'll find,' she said, ' that you'll want dad's 
consent, too ! ' 

' Will he make difficulties } He could not, 
Nell — not with you ! ' 

* Better ask him,' she said sweetly. 

A moment later Racksole himself entered the 
room. 

' Going on all right } ' he enquired, pointing 
to the bedroom.

* Excellently,' the lovers answered together, and 
they both blushed. 

* Ah I ' said Racksole. « Then, if that's so, and 
you can spare a minute, I've something to show 
you, Prince.

CHAPTER XXX 

CONCLUSION 

'I've a great deal to tell you, Prince,' Racksole 
began, as soon as they were out of the room, » and 
also, as I said, something to show you. Will you 
come to my room ? We wiU talk there first. 
The whole hotel is humming with excitement.* 

*With pleasure,' said Aribert. 

* Glad his Highness Prince Eugen is recover- 
tng, Racksole said, urged by considerations ot 
politeness. 

I Ah I As to that ' Aribert began. 

If you don't mind, we'll discuss that later, 
i'nnce, Racksole interrupted him. 

They were in the proprietor's private room. 
I want to tell you all about last night,* 
Racksole resumed, « about my capture of Jules 
and my examination of him this morning.' And 
he launched into a full account of the whole 
thmg, down to the least details. « You see ' he 
concluded, « that our suspicions as to Bosnia were 
tolerably correct. But as regards Bosnia, the

more I think about it, the surer I feel that 
nothing can be done to bring their criminal poli- 
ticians to justice.' 

* And as to Jules, what do you propose to 
do?' 

*Come this way,' said Racksole, and led 
Aribert to another room. A sofa in this room 
was covered >vith a linen cloth. Racksole lifted 
the cloth — he could never deny himself a dra- 
matic moment — and disclosed the body of a dead 
man. 

It was Jules, dead, but without a scratch or 
mark on him. 

* I have sent for the police — not a street con- 
stable, but an official from Scotland Yard,' said 
Racksole. 

' How did this happen } ' Aribert asked, 
amazed and startled. * I understood you to say 
that he was safely immured in the bedroom.' 

* So he was,' Racksole replied. * I went up 
there this afternoon, chiefly to take him some 
food. The commissionaire was on guard at the 
door. He had heard no noise, nothing un- 
usual. Yet when I entered the room Jules was 
gone. He had by some means or other loosened 
his fastenings ; he had then managed to take the 
door off the wardrobe. He had moved the bed 
in front of the window, and by pushing the ward-

robe door three parts out of the window and 
lodging the inside end of it under the rail at the 
head of the bed, he had provided himself with a 
IT 1°^ '"^^^"'•e platform outside the window. 
All this he did without making the least sound. 
tic must then have got through the window, and 
stood on the little platform. With his fingers he 
would just be able to reach the outer edge of the 
wide cornice under the roof of the hotel. By 
mam strength of arms he had swung himself on 
to this cornice, and so got on to the roof proper. 
He would then have the run of the whole roof. 
At the side of the building facing Salisbury Lane 
there is an iron fire-escape, which runs right 
down from the ridge of the roof into a little su 
yard level with the cellars. Jules must hav,. 
thought that his escape was accomplished. Bl^

of the Grand Babylon, there was little trouble for 
the people whose adventures we have described. 
Miss Spencer, that yellow-haired, faithful slave and 
attendant of a brilliant scoundrel, was never heard 
of again. Possibly to this day she survives, a 
mystery to her fellow-creatures, in the pension of 
some cheap foreign boarding-house. As for Rocco, 
he certainly ■ was heard of again. Several years 
after the events set down, it came to the know- 
ledge of F^lix Babylon that the unrivalled Rocco 
had reached Buenos Ayres, and by his culinary 
skill was there making the fortune of a new and 
splendid hotel. Babylon transmitted the inform- 
ation to Theodore Racksole, and Racksole might, 
had he chosen, have put the forces of the law in 
motion against him. But Racksole, seeing that 
everything pointed to the fact that Rocco was no\. 
pursuing his vocation honestly, decided to leave hiru 
alone. The one difficulty which Racksole experi- 
enced after the demise of Jules — and it was 
a difficulty which he had, of course, anticipated— 
was connected with the police. The police, very 
properly, wanted *o know things. They desired 
to be informed v.^at Racksole had been doing in 
the Dimmock affair, between his first visit to 
Ostend and his sending for them to take charge ot 
Jules' dead body. And Racksole was by no means 
inclined to tell them everything. Beyond question

he had transgressed the laws of England, and 
possibly also the laws of Belgium ; and the moral 
excellence of his motives in doing so was, of 
course, in the eyes of legal justice, no excuse for 
such conduct. The inquest upon Jules aroused 
some bother ; and about ninety-and-nine separate 
and distinct rumours. In the end, however, 
a compromise was arrived at. Racksole's first aim 
was to pacify the inspector whose clue, which by 
the way was a false one, he had so curtly declined 
to follow up. That done, the rest needed only 
tact and patience. He proved to the satisfaction 
of the authorities that he had acted in a perfectly 
honest spirit, though with a high hand, and that 
substantial justice had been d -" Also, he subtly 
indicated that, if it came to the point, he should 
defy them to do their worst. Lastly, he was able, 
through the medium of the United States Ambas- 
sador, to bring certain soothing influences to bear 
upon the situation. 

One afternoon, a fortnight after the recovery of 
the Hereditary Prince of Posen, Aribert, who was 
still staying at the Grand Babylon, expressed a 
wish to hold converse with the millionaire. Prince 
Eugen, accompanied by Hans and some Court 
officials whom he had sent for, had departed with 
immense ^claty armed with the comfortable million, 
to arrange formally for his betrothal. Touching

the million, Eugc. had ,5,ven satisfactory personal 
security, and the mop..' ^vas to be paid off in 

fifteen years. ^ • j u i, 

« You wish to taVc ro me, T nucc/ said Rack- 
sole to Aribert, wi (.u th ■} c •; eated together in 
the former's room. 

* I wish, to tell ju,' rcplx '. Aribert, * that it is 
my intention to renounce all ny rights and titles 
as a Royal Prince of Posen, and to be known in 
futu'-e as ( ount Hartz— a rank to which 1 am 
ent-itled through my mother. Also that I have a 
private income often thousand pounds a year, atid 
a chateau and a town house in Posen. I tell you 
this because I am here to ask the hand of your 
daughter in marriage. I love her, and I am vain 
enough to believe that she loves me. I have 
already asked her to be my wife, and she has con- 
sented. We await your approval.' 

«You honour us. Prince,' said Racksole with a 
slight smile, * and in more ways than one. May 
I ask your reason for renouncing your princely 

titles } ' 

< Simply because the idea of a morganatic 
marriage would be as repugnant to me as it would 
be to yourself and to Nella.' 

* That is good.' 

The Prince laughed. 

•I suppose it has occurred to you that ten

335 



thousand pounds per annum, for a man in your 
position, is a somewhat small income. Nella is 
frightfully extravagant. I have known her to 
spend sixty thousand dollars in a single year, and 
have nothing to show for it at the end. Why ! 
she would ruin you in twelve months.' 

* Nella must reform her ways,' Aribert said. 

* If she is content to do so,' Racksole wtnt on, 
'wellr--' jood! I consent.' 

* In her name and my own, I thank you,' said 
Aribert gravely. 

* And,' the millionaire continued, * so that she 
may not have to reform too fiercely, I shall settle 
on her absolutely, with reversion to your children, 
if you have any, a lump sum of fifty million 
dollars, that is to say, ten million pounds, in 
sound, selected railway stock. I reckon that is 
about half my fortune. Nella and I have always 
shared equally.' 

Aribert made no reply. The two men shook 
hands m silence, and then it happened that Nella 
entered the room. 

That night, after dinner, Racksole and his 
friend Fdix Babylon were walking together on 
the terrace of the Grand Babylon Hotel. 

Felix had begun the conversation. 

*I suppose, Racksole,' he had said, 'you 
aren't getting tired of the Grand Babylon .? ' 



336 THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL 

* "Why do you ask ? ' 

« Because I am getting tired of doing without 
it. A thousand times since I sold it to you I 
have wished I could undo the bargain. I can't 
bear idleness. Will you sell ? ' 

« I might,' said Racksole, * I might be mduced 

tosell.' r. J 5. 1 ^ 

•What will you take, my friend? asked 

Filix. 

* What I gave,' was the quick answer. 

* Eh 1' F61ix exclaimed. * I sell you my hotel 
with Jules, with Rocco, with Miss Spencer. You 
go and lose all those three inestimable servants, 
and then offer me the hotel without them at the 
same price 1 It is monstrous.' The little man 
laughed heartily at his own wit. * Nevertheless, 
he added, * we will not quarrel about the price. I 
accept your terms.' 

And so was brought to a clooe the complex 
chain of events which had begun when Theodore 
Racksole ordered a steak and a botlle of Bass at 
the table d'hdtc of the Grand Babylon Hotel.
