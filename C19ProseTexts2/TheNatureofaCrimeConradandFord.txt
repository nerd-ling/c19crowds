THE NATURE OF A CRIME 




PREFACES 


I 

For years my consciousness of this 
small piece of collaboration has been 
very vague, almost impalpable, like 
fleeting visits from a ghost. If I ever 
thought of it, and I must confess that I 
can hardly remember ever doing it on 
purpose till it was brought definitely to 
my notice by my Collaborator, I always 
regarded it as something in the nature 
of a fragment. I was surprised and 
even shocked to discover that it was 
rounded. But I need not have been. 
Rounded as it is in form, using the word 
form in its simplest sense—printed form 
—it remains yet a fragment from its 
very nature and also from necessity. 
It could never have become anything 


V 



T^eface 


else. And even as a fragment it is but 
a fragment of something else that might 
have been—of a mere intention. 

But, as it stands, what impresses me 
most is the amount this fragment con¬ 
tains of the crudely materialistic atmos¬ 
phere of the time of its origin, the time 
when the English Review was founded. 
It emerges from the depths of a past as 
distant from us now as the square- 
skirted, long frock-coats in which un¬ 
scrupulous, cultivated, high-minded 
jouisseurs like ours here attended to 
their strange business activities and 
cultivated the little blue flower of 
sentiment. No doubt our man was 
conceived for purposes of irony; but 
our conception of him, I fear, is too 
fantastic. 

Yet the most fantastic thing of all, 
it seems to me, is that we two who had 
so often discussed soberly the limits and 
methods of literary composition should 
have believed for a moment that a 




VI 



Preface 


piece of work in the nature of an ana¬ 
lytical confession (produced in articulo 
mortis as it were) could have been 
developed and achieved in collabo¬ 
ration ! 

What optimism! But it did not last 
long. I seem to remember a moment 
when I burst into earnest entreaties 
that all these people should be thrown 
overboard without more ado. This, I 
believe, is the real nature of the crime. 
Overboard. The neatness and dis¬ 
patch with which it is done in Chapter 
VIII was wholly the act of my Col¬ 
laborator’s good nature in the face of 
my panic. 

After signing these few prefatory 
words I will pass the pen to him in the 
hope that he may be moved to contra¬ 
dict me on every point of fact, im¬ 
pression, and appreciation. I said ‘The 
hope.” Yes, eager hope. For it would 
be delightful to catch the echo of the 
desperate, earnest and funny quarrels 




Treface 


which enlivened those old days. The 
pity of it is that there comes a time 
when all the fun of one’s life must be 
looked for in the past.

No, I find nothing to contradict, for, 
the existence of this story having been 
recalled to my mind by a friend, the 
details of its birth and its attendant 
circumstances remain for me com¬ 
pletely forgotten, a dark, blind-spot 
on the brain. I cannot remember the 
houses in which the writing took place, 
the view from the windows, the pen, 
the table cloth. At a given point in my 
life I forgot, literally, all the books I 
had ever written; but, if nowadays I 
re-read one of them, though I possess 
next to none and have re-read few, 
nearly all the phrases come back 
startlingly to my memory and I see 
glimpses of Kent, of Sussex, of Carcas¬ 
sonne—of New York, even; and frag¬ 
ments of furniture, mirrors, who knows 


IX 


Preface 


what? So that, if I didn’t happen to 
retain, almost by a miracle, for me, 
of retention, the marked up copy of 
“Romance” from which was made the 
analysis lately published in a certain 
periodical, I am certain that I could 
have identified the phrases exactly as 
they there stand. Looking at the book 
now I can hear our voices as we read 
one passage or another aloud for pur¬ 
poses of correction. Moreover I could 
say: This passage was written in Kent 
and hammered over in Sussex; this, 
written in Sussex and worked on in 
Kent; or this again was written in the 
downstairs cafe and hammered in the 
sitting room on the first-floor, of an 
hotel that faces the sea on the Belgian 
coast. 

But of “The Nature of a Crime” no 
phrase at all suggests either the tones 
of a voice or the colour of a day. When 
an old friend, last year, on a Parisian 
Boulevard said: “Isn’t there a story 

X 



Preface 


by yourself and Collaborator buried in 
the So & So?” I repudiated the idea 
with a great deal of heat. Eventually 
I had to admit the, as it were, dead 
fact. And, having admitted that to 
myself, and my Collaborator having 
corroborated it, I was at once possessed 
by a sort of morbid craving to get the 
story re-published in a definitive and 
acknowledged form. One may care 
infinitely little for the fate of one’s 
work and yet be almost hypochondria- 
cally anxious as to the form its publi¬ 
cation shall take—if the publication is 
likely to occur posthumously. I be¬ 
came at once dreadfully afraid that 
some philologist of that Posterity for 
which one writes, might, in the course 
of his hyena occupations, disinter 
these poor bones and, attributing sen¬ 
tence one to writer A and sentence two 
to B, maul at least one of our memories. 
With the nature of those crimes one 
is only too well acquainted. Besides, 





"Treface 


though one may never read comments 
one desires to get them over. It is 
indeed agreeable to hear a storm rage 
in the distance and rumble eventually 
away. 

Let me, however, since my Collabo¬ 
rator wishes it and in the name of Fun 
that is to-day hardly an echo, differ 
from him for a shade as to the nature 
of those passages of time. I protest 
against the word: quarrels. There were 
not any. And I should like to make 
the note that our collaboration was 
almost purely oral. We wrote and read 
aloud the one to the other. Possibly 
in the end we even wrote to read aloud 
the one to the other: for it strikes me 
very forcibly that “The Nature of a 
Crime” is for the most part prose 
meant for recitation, or of that type. 

Anyhow, as the memory comes back 
to me overwhelmingly, I would read 
on and read on. One begins with a 

fine propulsion. Sometimes that would

last to the end. But, as often as not, 
by a real telepathy, with my eyes on 
the page and my voice going on I would 
grow aware of an exaggerated stillness 
on the part of my Collaborator in the 
shadows. It was an extraordinary kind 
of stillness: not of death: not of an ice 
age. Yes, it was the stillness of a 
prisoner on the rack determined to 
conceal an agony. I would read on, 
my voice gradually sticking to my jaws. 
When it became unbearable I would 
glance up. On the other side of the 
hearth I would have a glimpse of a 
terribly sick man, of a convulsed face, 
of fingers contorted. Guido Fawkes 
beneath the peine forte et dure looked 
like that. You are to remember that 
we were very serious about writing. I 
would read on. After a long time it 
would come: “Oh! . . . Oh, 

oh! . . . Oh my God. . . . 

My dear Ford. . . . My dear 

fallen . . .” (That in those days 


Xlll 



"Preface 

was the fashionable pronunciation of 
“fellow”.) 

For myself, I would listen always 
with admiration. Always with an ad¬ 
miration that I have never since re¬ 
captured. And if there were admirable¬ 
nesses that did not seem to me to fit in 
with the given scene I could at least, at 
the end of the reading, say with perfect 
sincerity: “Wonderful! How you do 
things! . . .” before beginning on: 

“But don’t you perhaps think. . . 

And I really do not believe that 
either my Collaborator or myself ever 
made an objection which was not 
jointly sustained. That is not quarrels. 
When I last looked through the bound 
proofs of Romance I was struck with the 
fact that whereas my Collaborator 
eliminated almost every word of action 
and eighty percent of the conversations 
by myself, I supplied almost all the 
descriptive passages of the really col¬ 
laborated parts—and such softer senti-

ment as was called for. And my 
Collaborator let them get through. 

All this took place long ago; most of 
it in another century during another 
reign; whilst an earlier but not less 
haughty and proud generation were 
passing away.

The Nature of 
a Crime 

I 

Y OU are, I suppose, by now in 
Rome. It is very curious how 
present to me are both Rome and your¬ 
self. There is a certain hill—you, and 
that is the curious part of it, will 
never go there—yet, yesterday, late in 
the evening, I stood upon its summit 
and you came walking from a place 
below. It is always midday there: 
the seven pillars of the Forum stand 
on high, their capitals linked together, 
and form one angle of a square. At 
their bases there lie some detritus, a 
broken marble lion, and I think but I 
am not certain, the bronze she-wolf 
suckling the two bronze children. 
Your dress brushed the herbs: it was 


I 



The Nature of a Crime 


grey and tenuous: I suppose you do not 
know how you look when you are un¬ 
conscious of being looked at? But I 
looked at you for a long time—at my 
You. 

I saw your husband yesterday at the 
club and he said that you would not 
be returning till the end of April. 
When I got back to my chambers I 
found a certain letter. I will tell you 
about it afterwards—but I forbid you 
to look at the end of what I am writing 
now. There is a piece of news coming: 
I would break it to you if I could—but 
there is no way of breaking the utterly 
unexpected. Only, if you read this 
through you will gather from the tenor, 
from the tone of my thoughts, a little 
inkling, a small preparation for my dis¬ 
closure. Yes: it is a “disclosure.” 

. . . Briefly, then, it was this 

letter—a business letter—that set me 
thinking: that made that hill rise before 
me. Yes, I ^tood upon it and there 

2 




I'he Nature of a Crime 


before me lay Rome—beneath a haze, 
in the immense sea of plains. I have 
often thought of going to Rome—of 
going with you, in a leisurely autumn of 
your life and mine. Now—since I have 
received that letter—I know that I 
shall never see any other Rome than 
that from an imagined hilltop. And 
when, in the wonderful light and shade- 
lessness of that noon, last evening, you 
came from a grove of silver poplars, I 
looked at you —my you—for a very 
long while. You had, I think, a parasol 
behind your head, you moved slowly, 
you looked up at the capitals of those 
seven pillars . . . And I thought 

that I should never—since you will not 
return before the end of April—never 
see you again. I shall never see 
again the you that every other man 
sees 

You understand everything so well 
that already you must understand the 
nature of my disclosure. It is, of 

3 





The Nature of a Crime 


course, no disclosure to tell you that I 
love you. A very great reverence is 
due to youth—and a very great latitude 
is due to the dead. For I am dead: I 
have only lived through you for how 
many years now! And I shall never 
speak with you again. Some sort of 
burial will have been given to me before 
the end of April. I am a spirit. I 
have ended my relations with the world. 
I have balanced all my books, my will is 
made. Only I have nothing to leave— 
save to you, to whom I leave all that is 
now mine in the world—my memory. 

It is very curious—the world now. 
I walked slowly down here from Gordon 
Square. I walked slowly—for all my 
work is done. On the way I met Gray- 
don Bankes, the K. C. It would have 
astonished him if he could have known 
how unreal he looked to me. He is six 
feet high, and upon his left cheek there 
is a brown mole. I found it difficult to 
imagine why he existed. And all sorts 

4 



I'he Nature of a Crime 


of mists hurried past him. It was just 
outside the Natural History Museum. 
He said that his Seaford Railway Bill 
would come before Committee in June. 
And I wondered: what is June? . . . 
I laughed and thought: why June will 
never come! 

June will never come. Imagine that 
for a moment. We have discussed the 
ethics of suicide. You see why June 
will never come! 

You remember that ring I always 
wear? The one with a bulging, green¬ 
ish stone. Once or twice you have 
asked me what stone it was. You 
thought, I know, that it was in bad 
taste and I told you I wore it for the 
sake of associations. I know you 
thought—but no: there has never 
been any woman but you. 

You must have felt a long time ago 
that there was not, that there could not 
have been another woman. The as¬ 
sociations of the ring are not with the 

5 




The Nature of a Crime 


past of a finished affection, or hate, or 
passion, Vith all these forms of unrest 
that have a term in life; they looked for¬ 
ward to where there is no end—whether 
there is rest in it God alone knows. If 
it were not bad taste to use big words in 
extremities I would say there was Eter¬ 
nity in the ring—Eternity which is the 
negation of all that life may contain of 
losses and disappointments. Perhaps 
you have noticed that there was one 
note in our confidence that never re¬ 
sponded to your touch. It was that 
note of universal negation contained 
within the glass film of the ring. It is 
not you who brought the ring into my 
life: I had it made years ago. It was 
in my nature always to anticipate a 
touch on my shoulder, to which the 
only answer could be an act of defiance. 
And the ring is my weapon. I shall 
raise it to my teeth, bite through the 
glass: inside there is poison. 

I haven’t concealed anything from

you. Have I? And, with the great 
wisdom for which I love you, you have 
tolerated these other things. You 
would have tolerated this too, you who 
have met so many sinners and have 
never sinned . . . 

Ah, my dear one—that is why I have 
so loved you. From our two poles we 
have met upon one common ground of 
scepticism—so that I am not certain 
whether it was you or I who first said: 
“Believe nothing: be harsh to no one.” 
But at least we have suffered. One 
does not drag around with one such a 
cannon-ball as I have done all these 
years without thinking some wise 
thoughts. And well I 'know that in 
your dreary and terrible life you have 
gained your great wisdom. You have 
been envied; you too have thought: 
Is any prospect fair to those among its 
trees? And I have been envied for my 
gifts, for my talents, for my wealth, for 
my official position, for the letters after

my name, for my great and empty 
house, for my taste in pictures—for my 
. . . for my opportunities. 

Great criminals and the very patient 
learn one common lesson: Believe in 
nothing, be harsh to no one! 

But you cannot understand how 
immensely leisurely I feel. It is one 
o’clock at night. I cannot possibly be 
arrested before eleven to-morrow morn¬ 
ing. I have ten hours in which, with¬ 
out the shadow of a doubt, I can write 
to you: I can put down my thoughts 
desultorily and lazily. I have half a 
score of hours in which to speak to you. 

The stress of every secret emotion 
makes for sincerity in the end. Silence 
is like a dam. When the flood is at 
its highest the dam gives way. I am 
not conceited enough to think that I 
can sweep you along, terrified, in the 
rush of my confidences. I have not the 
elemental force. Perhaps it is just that 
form of “greatness” that I have lacked 

8 



T'he Nature of a Crime 


all my life—that profound quality 
which the Italians call terribilita. There 
is nothing overpowering or terrible in 
the confession of a love too great to be 
kept within the bounds of the banality 
which is the safeguard of our daily life. 
Men have been nerved to crime for the 
sake of a love that was theirs. The call 
of every great passion is to unlawfulness. 
But your love was not mine, and my 
love for you was vitiated by that con¬ 
ventional reverence which, as to nine 
parts in ten, is genuine, but as to the 
last tenth a solemn sham behind which 
hide all the timidities of a humanity no 
longer in its youth. I have been of my 
time—altogether of my time—lacking 
courage for a swoop, as a bird respects a 
ragged and nerveless scarecrow. Al¬ 
together a man of my time. Observe, 
I do not say “our time.” You are of 
all time—you are the loved Woman 
of the first cry that broke the silence 
and of the last song that shall mark the 

9 









The Nature of a Crime 


end of this ingenious world to which 
love and suffering have been given, but 
which has in the course of ages invented 
for itself all the virtues and all the 
crimes. And being of this world and of 
my time I have set myself to deal ingen¬ 
iously with my suffering and my love. 

Now everything is over—even regrets. 
Nothing remains of finite things but a 
few days of life and my confession to 
make to you—to you alone of all the 
world. 

It is difficult. How am I to begin? 
Would you believe it—every time I left 
your presence it was with the desire, 
with the necessity to forget you. 
Would you believe it? 

This is the great secret—the heart 
of my confession. The distance did 
not count. No walls could make me 
safe. No solitude could defend me; 
and having no faith in the consolations 
of eternity I suffered too cruelly from 
your absence. 


10 



The Nature of a Crime 


If there had been kingdoms to con¬ 
quer, a crusade to preach—but no. I 
should not have had the courage to go 
beyond the sound of your voice. You 
might have called to me any time! 
You never did. Never. And now it 
is too late. Moreover, I am a man of 
my time, the time is not of great deeds 
but of colossal speculations. The mo¬ 
ments when I was not with you had 
to be got through somehow. I dared 
not face them empty-handed lest from 
sheer distress I should go mad and begin 
to execrate you. Action ? What form 
of action could remove me far enough 
from you whose every thought was re¬ 
ferred to your existence? And as you 
were to me a soul of truth and serenity 
I tried to forget you in lies and excite¬ 
ment. My only refuge from the tyr¬ 
anny of my desire was in abasement. 
Perhaps I was mad. I gambled. I 
gambled first with my own money and 
then with money that was not mine. 

II 



The Nature of a Crime 


You know my connection with the great 
Burden fortune. I was trustee under 
my friend’s, Alexander Burden’s will. 
I gambled with a determined reckless¬ 
ness, with closed eyes. You under¬ 
stand now the origin of my houses, of 
my collections, of my reputation, of 
my taste for magnificence—which you 
deigned sometimes to mock indulgently 
with an exquisite flattery as at some¬ 
thing not quite worthy of me. It was 
like a break-neck ride on a wild horse, 
and now the fall has come. It was 
sudden. I am alive but my back is 
broken. Edward Burden is going to 
be married. I must pay back what I 
have borrowed from the Trust. I can¬ 
not. Therefore I am dead. (A mouse 
has just come out from beneath one of 
the deed-boxes. It looks up at me. 
It may have been eating some of the 
papers in the large cupboard. To¬ 
morrow morning I shall tell Saunders to 
get a cat. I have never seen a mouse

here before. I have never been here so 
late before. At times of pressure, as 
you know, I have always taken my 
papers home. So that these late hours 
have been, as it were, the prerogative 
of the mouse. No. I shall not get a 
cat. To that extent I am still a part 
of the world: I am master of the fate of 
mice!) I have, then, ten hours, less the 
time it has taken me to chronicle the 
mouse, in which to talk to you. It is 
strange, when I look back on it, that in 
all the years we have known each other 
—seven years, three months and two 
days—I have never had so long as ten 
hours in which I might talk to you. The 
longest time was when we came back 
from Paris together, when your husband 
was in such a state that he could neither 
see nor hear. (I’ve seen him, by-the- 
bye,every day since you have been gone. 
He’s really keepingaway from itwonder- 
fully well; in fact, I should say that he 
has not once actually succumbed. I 

13 



7he Nature of a Crime 


fancy, really, that your d.bsence is good 
for him in a way: it creates a new set of 
circumstances, and a change is said to 
be an excellent aid in the breaking of a 
habit. He has, I mean, to occupy him¬ 
self with some of the things, innumer¬ 
able as they are, that you do for him. 
I find that he has even had his pass¬ 
book from the bank and has compared 
it with his counterfoils. I haven’t, on 
account of this improvement, yet been 
round to his chemist’s. But I shall cer¬ 
tainly tell them that they must sur¬ 
reptitiously decrease the strength of it.) 
That was the longest time we have ever 
really talked together. And, when I 
think that in all these years I haven’t 
once so much as held your hand for a 
moment longer than the strictest of 
etiquette demanded! And I loved you 
within the first month. 

I wonder why that is. Fancy, per¬ 
haps. Habit perhaps—a kind of ideal¬ 
ism, a kind of delicacy, a fastidiousness. 

14 



The Nature of a Crime 


As you know very well it is not on ac¬ 
count of any moral scruples. . . . 

I break off to look through what I 
have already written to you. There 
is, first, the question of why I never told 
you my secret: then, the question of 
what my secret really is; I have started 
so many questions and have not fol¬ 
lowed one of them out to the very end. 
But all questions resolve themselves 
into the one question of our dear and 
inestimable relationship. 

I think it has been one of the great 
charms of our relationship that all our 
talks have been just talks. We have 
discussed everything under the sun, 
but we have never discussed anything 
aufond. We have strayed into all sorts 
of byways and have never got anywhere. 
I try to remember how many evenings 
in the last five years we have not spent 
together. I think they must be less than 
a hundred in number. You know how, 
occasionally, your husband would wake 

15 



The Nature of a Crime 

out of his stupors—or walk in his stu¬ 
por and deliver one of his astonishingly 
brilliant disquisitions. But remember 
how, always, whether he talked of free 
love or the improvement in the breed 
of carriage-horses, he always thrashed 
his subject out to the bitter end. It 
was not living with a man: it was 
assisting at a performance. And, when 
he was sunk into his drugs or when he 
was merely literary, or when he was 
away, how lazily we talked. I think 
no two minds were ever so fitted one 
into another as yours and mine. It is 
not of course that we agree on all sub¬ 
jects—or perhaps upon any. In the 
whole matter of conduct we are so 
absolutely different—you are always for 
circumspection, for a careful prepara¬ 
tion of the ground, for patience; and 
I am always ready to act, and after¬ 
wards draw the moral from my own 
actions. But somehow, in the end, it 
has all worked out in our being in per- 

i6 




The Nature of a Crime 


feet agreement. Later I will tell you 
why that is. 

Let me return to my mouse. For 
you will observe that the whole question 
revolves, really, around that little 
allegorical mite. It is an omen: it is a 
symbol. It is a little herald of the 
Providence that I do not believe in— 
of the Providence you so implicitly seek 
to obey. For instinctively you believe 
in Providence—in God, if you will. I 
as instinctively disbelieve. Intellectu¬ 
ally of course you disbelieve in a God. 
You say that it is impossible for Reason 
to accept an Overlord; I that Reason 
forces one to accept an Overlord; that 
Reason forces one to believe in an Om¬ 
nipotent Ruler—only I am unable to 
believe. We, my dear, are in ourselves 
evidence of a design in creation. For 
we are the last word of creation. It has 
taken all the efforts, all the birthpangs 
of all the ages to evolve—you and me. 

17 







The Nature of a Crime 


And, being evolved, we are intellectually 
so perfectly and so divinely fashioned to 
dovetail together. And, physically too, 
are we not divinely meant the one for 
the other? Do we not react to the 
same causes: should not we survive the 
same hardships or succumb to the same 
stresses ? Since you have been away I 
have gone looking for people—men, 
women, children, even animals—that 
could hold my attention for a minute. 
There has not been one. And what 
purer evidence of design could you ask 
for than that? 

I have made this pact with the Prov¬ 
idence that I argue for, with the Prov¬ 
idence in whose existence I cannot 
believe—that if, from under the castle of 
black metal boxes, the mouse reappear 
and challenge death—then there is no 
future state. And, since I can find no 
expression save in you, if we are not 
reunited I shall no longer exist. So 
my mouse is the sign, the arbitrament, 

i8 





The Nature of a Crime 


a symbol of an eternal life or the herald 
of nothingness. 

I will make to you the confession that 
since this fancy, this profound truth, 
has entered my mind, I have not raised 
my eyes from the paper. I dread— 
I suppose it is dread—to look across the 
ring of light that my lamp casts. But 
now I will do so. I will let my eyes 
travel across the bundles of dusty 
papers on my desk. Do you know I 
have left them just as they were on the 
day when you came to ask me to take 
your railway tickets ? I will let my eyes 
travel across that rampart of blue and 
white dockets. . . . The mouse is 

not there. 

But that is not an end of it. I am 
not a man to be ungenerous in my deal¬ 
ings with the Omnipotent: I snatch no 
verdict.

Last night it was very late and I grew 
tired, so I broke off my letter. Perhaps 
I was really afraid of seeing that mouse 
again. Those minute superstitions are 
curious things. I noticed, when I 
looked at the enumeration of these 
pages to-night,! began to write upon the 
thirteenth sheet—and that gives me a 
vague dissatisfaction. I read, by-the- 
bye, a paragraph in a newspaper: it 
dealt with half-mad authors. One of 
these, the writer said, was Zola; he was 
stated to be half mad because he added 
together the numbers on the backs of 
cabs passing him in the street. Person¬ 
ally, I do that again and again—and I 
know very well that I do it in order to 
dull my mind. It is a sort of narcotic. 
Johnson, we know, touched his street- 

20

posts in a certain order; that, too, was 
to escape from miserable thoughts. 
And we all know how, as children, we 
have obeyed mysterious promptings to 
step upon the lines between the paving- 
stones in the street. . . . But the 

children have their futures: it is well 
that they should propitiate the mysteri¬ 
ous Omnipotent One. In their day, 
too, Johnson and Zola had their fu¬ 
tures. It was well that Johnson should 
“touch” against the evi] chance; that 
Zola should rest his mind against new 
problems. In me it is mere imbecility. 
For I have no future. 

Do you find it difficult to believe 
that? You know the Burdens, of 
course. But I think you do not know 
that, for the last nine years, I have ad¬ 
ministered the Burden estates all by 
myself. The original trustees were old 
' Lady Burden and I; but nine years ago 
Lady Burden gave me a power of at¬ 
torney and since then I have acted

alone. It was just before then that I 
had bought the houses in Gordon 
Square—the one I live in, the one you 
live in, and the seven others. Well, 
rightly speaking, those houses have 
been bought with Burden money, and 
all my pictures, all my prints, all my 
books, my furniture, my reputation as 
a connoisseur, my governorship of the 
two charities—all the me that people 
envy—have been bought with the Bur¬ 
den money. I assure you that at times 
I have found it a pleasurable excite¬ 
ment. . . . You see, I have wanted 
you sometimes so terribly—so terribly 
that the juggling with the Burden ac¬ 
counts has been as engrossing a narcotic 
as to Zola was the adding up of the 
numbers upon the backs of cabs. Mere 
ordinary work would never have held 
my thoughts. 

Under old Burden’s will young Ed¬ 
ward Burden comes of age when he 
reaches the age of twenty-five or when 

22 



The Nature of a Crime 


he marries with my consent. Well, he 
will reach the age of twenty-five and he 
will marry on April 5. On that day the 
solicitors of his future wife will make 
their scrutiny of my accounts. It is 
regarded, you understand, as a mere 
formality. But it amuses me to think 
of the faces of Coke and Coke when they 
come to certain figures! It was an 
outlaw of some sort, was it not, who 
danced and sang beneath the gallows? 
I wonder, now, what sort of traitor, out¬ 
law, or stealthy politician I should have 
made in the Middle Ages. It is certain 
that, save for this one particular of prop¬ 
erty, I should be in very truth illus¬ 
trious. No doubt the state shall come at 
last in which there shall no more be any 
property. I was born before my time. 

For it is certain that I am illustrious 
save in that one respect. To-day young 
Edward Burden came here to the office 
to introduce me to his fiancee. You 
observe that I have robbed her. The 

23 



‘The Nature of a Crime 


Burden property is really crippled. 
They came, this bright young couple, 
to get a cheque from me with which to 
purchase a motor-car. They are to try 
several cars in the next three weeks. 
On the day before the wedding they 
are to choose one that will suit them 
best—and on the wedding-day in the 
evening they are to start for Italy. 
They will be coming towards you. . . . 
Then no doubt, too, a telegram will 
reach them, to say that in all probabil¬ 
ity motor-cars will be things not for 
them for several years to come. What 
a crumbling of their lives! 

It was odd how I felt towards her. 
You know his pompous, high forehead, 
the shine all over him, the grave, 
weighty manner. He held his hat—a 
wonderful shiny, “good” hat—before 
his mouth, for all the world as if he had 
been in church. He made, even, a 
speech in introducing Miss Averies to 
me. You see, in a sense, he was in a 

24 



The Nature of a Crime 


temple. My office enshrined a deity, 
a divinity: the law, property, the rights 
of man as maintained by an august 
constitution. I am for him such a won¬ 
derfully “ safe ” man. My dear one, you 
cannot imagine how I feel towards him: 
a little like a deity, a little like an aveng¬ 
ing Providence. I imagine that the 
real Deity must feel towards some of 
His worshippers much as I feel towards 
this phoenix of the divines. 

The Deity is after all the supreme 
Artist—and the supreme quality of Art 
is surprise. 

Imagine then the feeling of the Deity 
towards some of those who most con¬ 
fidently enter His temple. Just imagine 
His attitude towards those who deal in 
the obvious platitudes that “honesty is 
the best policy,” or “genius the capac¬ 
ity for taking pains.” So for days the 
world appears to them. Then sud¬ 
denly: honesty no longer pays; the 
creature, amassing with his infinite 

25 



7he Nature of a Crime 


pains, data for his Great Work, is 
discovered to have produced a work of 
an Infinite Dulness. That is the all- 
suffering Deity manifesting Himself to 
His worshippers. For assuredly a day 
comes when two added to two no longer 
results in four. That day will come on 
April 5 for Edward Burden. 

After all he has done nothing to make 
two and two become four. He has not 
even checked his accounts: well: for 
some years now I have been doing as 
much as that. But with his fiancee it 
is different. She is a fair, slight girl 
with eyes that dilate under all sorts of 
emotion. In my office she appears not 
a confident worshipper but a rather 
frightened fawn led before an Anthro¬ 
pomorphic Deity. And, strangely 
enough, though young Burden who 
trusts me inspires me with a sardonic 
dislike, I felt myself saying to this poor 
little thing that faced me: “Why: I have 
wronged you!” . And I regretted it. 

26 



The Nature of a Crime 


She, you see, has after all given some¬ 
thing towards a right to enjoy the Bur¬ 
den estates and the Burden wealth; she 
has given her fragile beauty, her ami¬ 
ability, her worship, no doubt, of the 
intolerable Edward. And all this pay¬ 
ment in the proper coin: so she has in a 
sense a right. . . . 

Good-night, dear one, I think you 
have it in your power—you might have 
it in your power—to atone to this little 
creature. To-morrow I will tell you 
why and how. 


27 



Ill 

I wrote last night that you have 
something in your power. If you 
wished it you could make me live on. 
I am confident that you will not wish 
it: for you will understand that capri¬ 
ciously or intolerably I am tired of living 
this life. I desire you so terribly that 
now, even the excitement of fooling 
Burden no longer hypnotizes me into 
an acceptance of life without you. 
Frankly, I am tired out. If I had to go 
on living any longer I should have to 
ask you to be mine in one form or other. 
With that and with my ability—for of 
course I have great ability—I could go 
on fooling Burden for ever. I could re¬ 
store: I could make sounder than ever 
it was that preposterous “going con¬ 
cern” the Burden Estate. Unless I 

28 


The Nature of a Crime 


like to let tliem, I think that the wife’s 
solicitors will not discover what I have 
done. For, frankly, I have put myself 
out in this matter in order to be amus¬ 
ing to myself and ingenious. I have 
forged whole builder’s estimates for re¬ 
pairs that were never executed: I have 
invented whole hosts of defaulting ten¬ 
ants. It has not been latterly for money 
that I have done this: it has been simply 
for the sheer amusement of looking at 
Edward Burden and saying to myself: 

“Ah: you trust me, my sleek friend. 
Well. ...” 

But indeed I fancy that I am rich 
enough to be able to restore to them all 
that I have taken. And, looking at 
Edward Burden’s little fiancee^ I was 
almost tempted to set upon that weary 
course of juggling. But I am at the 
end of my tether. I cannot live with¬ 
out you longer. And I do not wish to 
ask you. Later I will tell you. Or 
No—I will tell you now. 

29 



The Nature of a Crime 


You see, my dear thing, it is a ques¬ 
tion of going one better. It would be 
easy enough to deceive your husband: 
it would be easier still to go away to¬ 
gether. I think that neither you nor I 
have ever had any conscientious scrup¬ 
les. But, analysing the matter down 
to its very depths, I think we arrive at 
this, that without the motives for self- 
restraint that other people have we 
are anxious to show more self-restraint 
than they. We are doing certain work 
not for payment but for sheer love of 
work. Do I make myself clear ? For my¬ 
self I have a great pride in your image. 
I can say to myself: “Here is a woman, 
my complement. She has no respect 
for the law. She does not value what a 
respect for the law would bring her. 
Yet she remains purer than the purest 
of the makers of law.” And I think it 
is the converse of that feeling that you 
have for me. 

If you desire me to live on, I will live 

30 



7he Nature of a Crime 


on: I am so swayed by you that if you 
desire me to break away from this ideal 
of you, the breath of a command will 
send me round to your side. 

I am ready to give my life for this 
Ideal: nay more, I am ready to sacrifice 
you to it, since I know that life for 
you will remain a very bitter thing. I 
know, a little, what renunciation means. 

And I am asking you to bear it—for 
the sake of my ideal of you. For, as¬ 
suredly, unless I can have you I must 
die—and I know that you will not ask 
me to have you. And I love you: 
and bless you for it.

IV 

I have just come in from Tristan 
and Isolde. 

I had to hurry and be there for the 
first notes because you—my you— 
would, I felt, be sitting beside me as 
you have so often. That, of course, is 
passion—the passion that makes us 
unaccountable in our actions. 

I found you naturally: but I found, 
too, something else. It has always a 
little puzzled me why we return to 
Tristan. There are passages in that 
thing as intolerable as anything in any 
of the Germanic master’s scores. But 
we are held—simply by the idea of the 
love-philtre: it’s that alone that in¬ 
terests us. We do not care about the 
initial amenities of Tristan and the 
prima donna: we do not believe in 

32 


The Nature of a Crime 


Mark’s psychologising: but, from the 
moment when those two dismal marion¬ 
ettes have drained unconsideringly the 
impossible cup, they become suddenly 
alive, and we see two human beings 
under the grip of a passion—acting as 
irrationally as I did when I promised 
my cabman five shillings to get me to 
the theatre in time for the opening bars. 

It is, you see, the love-philtre that 
performs this miracle. It interests— 
it is real to us—because every human 
being knows what it is to act, irration¬ 
ally, under the stress of some passion or 
other. We are drawn along irresistibly: 
we commit the predestined follies or 
the predestined heroisms: the other side 
of our being acts in contravention of 
all our rules of conduct or of intellect. 
Here, in Tristan, we see such madness 
justified with a concrete substance, a 
herb, a root. We see a vision of a state 
of mind in which morality no longer 
exists: we are given a respite, a rest: an 

33 



7he Nature of a Crime 


interval in which no standard of con¬ 
duct oppresses us. It is an idea of an 
appeal more universal than any other 
in which the tired imagination of hu¬ 
manity takes refuge. 

The thought that somewhere in the 
world there should be something that 
I could give to you, or you to me, that 
would leave us free to do what we wish 
without the drag of the thought of what 
we owe, to each other, to the world! 
An4 after all, what greater gift could 
one give to another.? It would be the 
essential freedom. For assuredly, the 
philtre could do no more than put it in 
a man’s power to do what he would do 
if he were let loose. He would not bring 
out more than he had in him: but he 
would fully and finally express himself. 

Something unexpected has changed 
the current of my thoughts. Nothing 
can change their complexion, which is 
governed not by what others do but by 
the action which I must face presently. 

34 



T'he Nature of a Crime 


And I don’t know why I should use the 
word unexpected, unless because at the 
moment I was very far from expecting 
that sort of perplexity. The correct 
thing to say would be that something 
natural has happened. 

Perfectly natural. Asceticism is the 
last thing that one could expect from 
the Burdens. Alexander Burden, the 
father, was an exuberant millionaire, 
in no vulgar way, of course; he was 
exuberant with restraint, not for show, 
with a magnificence which was for pri¬ 
vate satisfaction mainly. I am talking 
here of the ascetic temperament which 
is based on renunciation, not of mere 
simplicity of tastes, which is simply 
scorn for certain orders of sensations. 
There have been millionaires who have 
lived simply. There have been million¬ 
aires who have lived sordidly—but mi¬ 
serliness is one of the supreme forms of 
sensualism. 

Poor Burden had a magnificent phy- 

35 



The Nature of a Crime 


sique. The reserved abilities of gen¬ 
erations of impoverished Burdens, star¬ 
ved for want of opportunities, matured 
in his immense success—and all their 
starved appetites too. But all the re¬ 
serve quality of obscure Burdens has 
been exhausted in him. There was 
nothing to come to his son—who at 
most could have been a great match 
and is to-day looked upon in that light, 
I suppose, by the relations of his future 
wife. I don’t know in what light that 
young man looks upon himself. His 
time of trial is coming. 

Yesterday at eight in the evening he 
came to see me. I thought at first he 
wanted some money urgently. But 
very soon I reflected that he need not 
have looked so embarrassed in that case. 
And presently I discovered that it was 
not money that he was in need of. He 
looked as though he had come, with 
that characteristic gravity of his—so 
unlike his father—to seek absolution 

36 




The Nature of a Crime 


at my hands. But that intention he 
judged more decorous, I suppose, to 
present to me as a case of conscience. 

Of course it was the case of a girl— 
not his fiancee. At first I thought he 
was in an ugly scrape. Nothing of the 
kind. The excellent creature who had 
accepted his protection for some two 
years past—how dull they must have 
seemed to her—was perhaps for that 
reason perfectly resigned to forego that 
advantage. At the same time, she was 
not too proud to accept a certain pro¬ 
vision, compensation—whatever you 
like to call it. I had never heard of any¬ 
thing so proper in my life. He need 
not have explained the matter to me at 
all. But evidently he had made up his 
mind to indulge in the luxury of a con¬ 
science. 

To indulge that sort of conscience 
leads one almost as far as indulged 
passion, only, I cannot help thinking, on 
a more sordid road. A luxury snatched 

37 




The Nature of a Crime 


from the fire is in a way purified, but to 
find this one he had gone apparently to 
the bottom of his heart. I don’t charge 
him with a particularly odious degree of 
corruption, but I perceived clearly that 
what he wanted really was to project 
the sinful effect of that irregular con¬ 
nection—^let us call it—into his regu¬ 
lated, reformed, I may say lawfully 
blessed state—for the sake of retrospec¬ 
tive enjoyment, I suppose. This rather 
subtle, if unholy, appetite, he was 
pleased to call the voice of his con¬ 
science. I listened to his dialectic ex¬ 
ercises till the great word that was sure 
to come out sooner or later was pro¬ 
nounced. ' 

“It seems,” he said, with every ap¬ 
pearance of distress, “that from a 
strictly moral point of view I ought to 
make a clean breast of it to Annie.” 

I listened to him—and, by Heaven, 
listening to him I do feel like the God¬ 
head of whom I have already written 

38 



The Nature of a Crime 


to you. You know, positively he said 
that at the very moment of his “fall” 
he had thought of what I should think 
of him. And I said: 

“My good Edward, you are the most 
debauched person I have ever met.” 

His face fell, his soft lips dropped 
right down into a horseshoe. He had 
come to me as one of those bland 
optimists would go to his deity. He 
expected to be able to say: “I have 
sinned,” and to be able to hear the 
Deity say: “That’s all right, your very 
frank confession does you infinite 
credit.” His deity was, in fact, to 
find him some way out of his moral 
hole. I was to find him some genial 
excuse; to make him feel good in his ex¬ 
cellent digestion once more. That was, 
absolutely, his point of view, for at my 
brutal pronouncement he stuttered: 

“But—but surely . . . the faults 

of youth . . . and surely there are 

plenty of others? . . .” 

39 




T'he Nature of a Crime 


I shook my head at him and panic 
was dropping out of his eyes: “Can’t 
I marry Annie honourably?” he quav¬ 
ered. I took a sinister delight in turn¬ 
ing the knife inside him. I was going 
to let him go anyhow: the sort of cat 
that I am always lets its mice go. 
(That mouse, by-the-bye, has never 
again put in an appearance.) 

“My dear fellow,” I said, “does not 
your delicacy let you see the hole you 
put me into? It’s to my interest that 
you should not marry Miss Averies and 
you ask me to advise you on the point.” 

His mouth dropped open: positively 
he had never considered that when he 
married I lost the confounded three 
hundred a year for administering the 
Burden Trust. I sat and smiled at 
him to give him plenty of time to let his 
mind agonize over his position. 

“Oh, hang it,” he said. . . . 

And his silly eyes rolled round my room 
looking for that Providence that he 

40 



The Nature of a Crime 


felt ought to intervene in his behalf. 
When they rested on me again I said; 

“There, go away. Of course it’s a 
fault of your youth. Of course every 
man that’s fit to call himself a man has 
seduced a clergyman’s daughter.” 

He said: 

“Oh, but there was not anything 
common about it.” 

“No,” I answered, “you had an un¬ 
commonly good time of it with your 
moral scruples. I envy you the capac¬ 
ity. You’ll have a duller one with Miss 
Averies, you know.” 

That was too much for him to take 
in, so he smoothed his hat. 

“When you said I was . . . de¬ 

bauched . . . you were only laugh¬ 
ing at me. That was hardly fair. I’m 
tremendously in earnest.” 

“You’re only play-acting compared 
with me,” I answered. He had the air 
of buttoning his coat after putting a 
cheque into his breast pocket. He 

41 



7he Nature of a Crime 


had got,you see, the cheque he expected: 
my applause of his successful seduction, 
my envy of his good fortune. That 
was what he had come for—and he got 
it. He went away with it pretty bare¬ 
facedly, but he stopped at the threshold 
to let drop: 

“Of course if I had known you would 
be offended by my having recourse 
to Annie’s solicitors for the settle¬ 
ment . . .” 

I told him I was laughing at him 
about that too. 

“It was the correct thing to do, you 
know,” were the words he shut the door 
upon. The ass . . . 

The phrase of his—that he had 
thought of me at the moment of his fall 
—gives you at once the measure of his 
respect for me. But it gave me much 
more. It gave me my cue: it put it 
into my head to say he was debauched. 
And, indeed, that is debauchery. For 
it is the introduction of one’s morals 

42 




The Nature of a Crime 


into the management of one’s appetites 
that makes an indulgence of them de¬ 
bauchery. Had piy friend Edward re¬ 
garded his seduction as the thing he 
so much desired me to tell him it was; a 
thing of youth, high spirits—a thing we 
all do—had he so regarded it I could not 
really have called it debauchery. But 
—and this is the profound truth—the 
measure of debauchery is the amount of 
joy we get from the indulgence of our 
appetites. And the measure of joy we 
get is the amount of excitement: if it 
brings into play not only all our physical 
but all our moral nature then we have 
the crucial point beyond which no man 
can go. It isn’t, in fact, the profes¬ 
sional seducer, the artist in seduction 
that gets pleasure from the pursuit of 
his avocation, any more than it is the 
professional musician who gets thrills 
from the performance of music. You 
cannot figure to yourself the violinist, 
as he fiddles the most complicated 

43 




7he Nature of a Crime 


passage of a concerto, when he really 
surmounts the difficulty by dint of using 
all his knowledge and all his skill—you 
cannot imagine him thinking of his 
adviser, his mother, his God and all the 
other things that my young friend says 
he thought about. And it is the same 
with the professional seducer. He may 
do all that he knows to bring his object 
about—but that is not debauchery. It 
is, by comparison, a joyless occupation: 
it is drinking when you are thirsty. Put¬ 
ting it in terms of the most threadbare 
allegory—you cannot imagine that 
Adam got out of the fall the pleasure 
that Edward Burden got out of his bite 
of the apple. 

But Edward Burden, whilst he shilly¬ 
shallied with “Shall I?” and “Sha’n’t 
I?” could deliciously introduce into 
the matter all his human relationships. 
He could think of me, of his mother, of 
the fact that potentially he was casting 
to the winds the very cause for his ex- 

44 



The Nature of a Crime 


istence. For assuredly, if Edward Bur¬ 
den have a cause for existence it is that 
he should not, morally or physically, do 
anything that would unfit him to make 
a good marriage. So he had, along with 
what physical pleasure there might be, 
the immense excitement of staking his 
all along with the tremendous elation of 
the debate within himself that went 
before. For he was actually staking his 
all upon the chance that he could both 
take what he desired and afterwards 
reconcile it with his conscience to make 
a good match. Well, he has staked and 
won. That is the true debauchery. 
That, in a sense, is the compensating 
joy that Puritanism gets. 


45 




V 

I have just come in. Again you will 
not guess from where. From choosing 
a motor-car with Burden and his 
fiancee. It seems incredible that I 
should be called upon to preside at 
these preparations for my own execu¬ 
tion. I looked at hundreds of these 
shiny engines, with the monstrously 
inflated white wheels, and gave a half- 
amused—but I can assure you a half- 
interested—attention to my own case. 
For one of these will one day—and soon 
now—be arrested in a long rush, by my 
extinction. In it there will be seated 
the two young people who went with 
me through the garages. They will 
sit in some sort of cushioned ease—the 
cushions will be green, or red, or blue in 
shiny leather. ' I think, however, that 

46 



The Nature of a Crime 


they will not be green—because Miss 
Averies let slip to me, in a little flutter 
of shy confidence, the words: “Oh, 
don’t let’s have green, because it’s an 
unlucky colour.” Edward Burden, of 
course, suppressed her with a hurried 
whisper as if, in thus giving herself 
away to me, she must be committing a 
sin against the house of Burden. 

That, naturally, is the Burden tradi¬ 
tion: a Burden’s wife must possess 
frailties: but she must feign perfection 
even to a trusted adviser of the family. 
She must not confess to superstitions. 
It was amusing, the small incident, be¬ 
cause it was the very first attempt that 
little Miss Averies has ever made to get 
near me. God knows what Edward 
may have made me appear to her: but 
I fancy that, whatever Edward may 
have said, she had pierced through 
that particular veil: she realizes, with 
her intuition, that I am dangerous. 
She is alarmed and possibly fascinated 

47 



7he Nature of a Crime 


because she feels that I am not 
“straight”—that I might, in fact, be 
a woman or a poet. Burden, of course, 
has never got beyond seeing that I 
dress better than he does and choose a 
dinner better than his uncle Darlington. 

I came, of course, out of the motor¬ 
car ordeal with flying colours—on these 
lines. I lived, in fact, up to my char¬ 
acter for being orthodox in the matter 
of comfort. I even suggested two little 
mirrors, like those which were so com¬ 
forting to us all when we sat in hansom 
cabs. That struck Burden as being 
the height of ingenuity—and I know it 
proved to Miss Averies, most finally, 
that I am dangerous, since no woman 
ever looks in those little mirrors with¬ 
out some small motive of coquetry. It 
was just after that that she said to me: 

“Don’t you think that the little 
measures on the tops of the new canis¬ 
ters are extravagant for China tea?” 

That, of course, admitted me to the 

48 



The Nature of a Crime 


peculiar intimacy that women allow to 
other women, or to poets, or to danger¬ 
ous men. Edward, I know, dislikes the 
drinking of China tea because it is 
against the principle of supporting the 
British flag. But Miss Averies in her 
unequal battle with this youth of the 
classical features slightly vulgarized, 
called me in to show a sign of sympathy 
—to give at least the flicker of the 
other side—of the woman, the poet, or 
the pessimist among men. She asked 
me, in fact, not to take up the cudgels 
to the extent of saying that China tea 
is the thing to drink—that would have 
been treason to Edward—but she de¬ 
sired that her instinct should be acknowl¬ 
edged to the extent of saying that the 
measures of canisters should be con¬ 
trived to suit the one kind of tea as well 
as the other. In his blind sort of way 
Edward caught the challenge in the 
remark and his straight brows lowered 
a very little.

“If you don’t have more than three 
pounds of China tea in the house in a 
year it won’t matter about the meas¬ 
ures,” he said. “We never use more 
at Shackleton.” 

“But it makes the tea too strong, 
Edward.” 

“Thenyou need not fill the measure,” 
he answered. 

“Oh, I wish,” she said to me, “that 
you’d tell Edward not to make me make 
tea at all. I dread it. The servants 
do it so much better.” 

“So,” I asked, “Edward has arranged 
everything down to the last detail?” 

Edward looked to me for approval 
and applause. 

“You see, Annie has had so little 
experience, and I’ve had to look after 
my mother’s house for years.” His air 
said: “Yes! You’ll see our establish¬ 
ment will be run on the very best lines! 
Don’t you admire the way I’m taming 
her already?”. 

SO 



The Nature of a Crime 

I gave him, of course, a significant 
glance. Heaven knows why: for it is 
absolutely true that I am tired of ap¬ 
pearing reliable—to Edward Burden or 
any one else in the world. What I want 
to do is simply to say to Edward Bur¬ 
den: “No, I don’t at all admire your 
dragging down a little bundle of ideals 
and sentiments to your own fatted 
calf’s level.” 

I suppose I have in me something 
of the poet. I can imagine that if I 
had to love or to marry this little Aver- 
ies girl I should try to find out what was 
her tiny vanity and I should minister 
to it. In some way I should discover 
from her that she considered herself 
charming, or discreet, or tasteful, or 
frivolous, beyond all her fellows. And, 
having discovered it, I should bend all 
my energies to giving her opportunities 
for displaying her charm, her discreet¬ 
ness or her coquetry. With a woman 
of larger and finer mould—with you!— 

51 






7he Nature of a Crime 


I should no doubt bring into play my 
own idealism. I should invest her with 
the attributes that I consider the most 
desirable in the world. But in either 
case I cannot figure myself dragging 
her down to my own social or material 
necessities. 

That is what Edward Burden is doing 
for little Miss Averies. I don’t mean 
to say that he does not idealize her— 
but he sees her transfigured as the dis¬ 
penser of his special brand of tea or the 
mother of the sort of child that he was. 
And that seems to me a very valid rea¬ 
son why women, if they were wise, 
should trust their fortunes cold¬ 
bloodedly and of set reason to the class 
of dangerous men that now allure them 
and that they flee from. 

They flee from them, I am convinced, 
because they fear for their worldly ma¬ 
terial fortunes. They fear, that is to 
say, that the poet is not a stable man of 
business: they recognise that he is a 

52 



The Nature of a Crime 


gambler—and it seems to them that it 
is folly to trust to a gambler for life¬ 
long protection. In that they are per¬ 
haps right. But I think that no woman 
doubts her power to retain a man’s 
affection—so that it is not to the 
reputation for matrimonial instability 
that the poet owes his disfavour. A 
woman lives, in short, to play with this 
particular fire, since to herself she says: 
“Here is a man who has broken the 
hearts of many women. I will essay 
the adventure of taming him.” And, 
if she considers the adventure a dan¬ 
gerous one, that renders the contest 
only the more alluring, since at heart 
every woman, like every poet, is a 
gambler. In that perhaps she is 
right. 

But it seems to me that women make 
a great mistake in the value of the 
stakes they are ready to pay in order to 
enter this game. They will stake, that 
is to say, their relatively great coin— 

53 



7he Nature of a Crime 


their sentimental lives; but they hoard 
with closed fingers the threepenny bit 
which is merely the material future. 

They prefer, that is to say, to be 
rendered the mere presiding geniuses of 
well-loaded boards. It is better to 
be a lady—which you will remember 
philologically means a “loaf-cutter”— 
than to be an Ideal. 

And in this they are obviously wrong. 
If a woman can achieve the obvious 
miracle of making a dangerous man 
stable in his affections she may well be 
confident that she can persuade him to 
turn his serious attention to the task 
of keeping a roof over her head. Cer¬ 
tainly, I know, if I were a woman 
which of the two types of men I would 
choose. Upon the lowest basis it is 
better for all purposes of human con¬ 
tracts to be married to a good liar than 
to a bad one. For a lie is a figurative 
truth—and it is the poet who is the mas¬ 
ter of these illusions. Even in the 

54 




The Nature of a Crime 

matter of marital relations it is proba¬ 
ble that the poet is as faithful as the 
Edward Burdens of this world—only 
the Edward Burdens are more skilful 
at concealing from the rest of the world 
their pleasant vices. I doubt whether 
they are as skilful at concealing them 
from the woman concerned—from the 
woman, with her intuition, her power 
to seize fine shades of coolness and her 
awakened self-interest. Imagine the 
wife of Edward Burden saying to him, 
“You have deceived me!” Imagine 
then the excellent youth, crimsoning, 
stuttering. He has been taught all his 
life that truth must prevail though the 
skies fall—and he stammers; “Yes: I 
have betrayed you.” And that is trag¬ 
edy, though in the psychological sense 
—and that is the important one—Ed¬ 
ward Burden may have been as faith¬ 
ful as the ravens, who live for fifteen 
decades with the same mate. He will, 
in short, blunder into a tragic, false 

55 






The Nature of a Crime 


position. And he will make the trag¬ 
edy only the more tragic in that all the 
intellectual powers he may possess 
will be in the direction of perpetuating 
the dismal position. He will not be 
able to argue that he has not been 
unfaithful—but he will be able to find 
a hundred arguments for the miserable 
woman prolonging her life with him. 
Position,money, the interests of the chil¬ 
dren, the feelings of her family and of his 
—all these considerations will make him 
eloquent to urge her to prolong her mis¬ 
ery. And probably she will prolong it. 

This, of course, is due to the excellent 
Edward’s lack of an instinctive sym¬ 
pathy. The poet, with a truer vision, 
will in the same case, be able to face his 
Miss Averies’ saying: “You have de¬ 
ceived me!” with a different assurance. 
Supposing the deflection to have been 
of the momentary kind he will be able 
to deny with a good conscience since he 
will be aware of-himself and his feelings. 

56 



The Nature of a Crime 


He will at least be able to put the case 
in its just light. Or, if the deflection 
be really temperamental, really perma¬ 
nent, he will be unable—it being his 
business to look at the deeper verities— 
to lie himself out of the matter. He 
will break, strictly and sharply. Or, if 
he do not, it may be taken as a sign that 
his Miss Averies is still of value to him 
—that she, in fact, is still the woman 
that it is his desire to have for his com¬ 
panion. This is true of course, only in 
the large sense, since obviously there are 
poets whose reverence for position, the 
interest of children or the feelings of 
their friends and relatives, may out¬ 
weigh their hatred of a false position. 
These, however, are poets in the sense 
that they write verse: I am speaking of 
those who live the poet’s life; to such, a 
false position is too intolerable to be 
long maintained. 

But this again is only one of innum¬ 
erable side-issues: let me return to my 

57 




7he Nature of a Crime 


main contention that a dinner of herbs 
with a dangerous man is better than 
having to consume the flesh of stalled 
oxen with Edward Burden. Perhaps 
that is only a way of saying that you 
would have done better to entrust your¬ 
self to me than to- (But no, your 

husband is a better man than Edward 
Burden. He has at least had the cour¬ 
age to revert to his passion. I went 
this afternoon to your chemists and 
formally notified them that if they sup¬ 
plied him with more than the exactly 
prescribed quantity of that stuff, I, as 
holding your power of attorney, should 
do all that the law allows me to do 
against them.) 

Even to the dullest of men, marrying 
is for the most part an imaginative act. 
I mean marrying as a step in life 
sanctipned by law, custom and that 
general consent of mankind which is the 
hall-mark of every irrational institution. 
By irrational I ,do not mean wrong or 





The Nature of a Crime 


stupid. Marriage is august by the 
magnitude of the issues it involves, 
balancing peace and strife on the fine 
point of a natural impulse refined by 
the need of a tangible ideal. I am not 
speaking here of mere domestic peace or 
strife which for most people that count 
are a question of manners and a mode 
of life. And I am thinking of the peace 
mostly—the peace of the soul which 
yearns for some sort of certitude in this 
earth, the peaceof the heart which yearns 
for conquest, the peace of the senses 
that dreads deception, the peace of the 
imaginative faculty which in its restless 
quest of a high place of rest is spurred on 
by these great desires and that great fear. 

And even Edward Burden’s imagina¬ 
tion is moved by these very desires and 
that very fear—or else he Would not 
have dreamt of marrying. I repeat, 
marriage is an imaginative institution. 
It’s true that his imagination is a poor 
thing but it is genuine nevertheless. 

59 



7he Nature of a Crime 


The faculty of which I speak is of one 
kind in all of us. Not to every one 
is given that depth of feeling, that 
faculty of absolute trust which will not 
be deceived, and the exulting master¬ 
fulness of the senses which are the mark 
of a fearless lover. Fearless lovers are 
rare, if obstinate, and sensual fools are 
countless as grains of sand by the sea¬ 
shore. I can imagine that correct 
young man perfectly capable of setting 
himself deliberately to worry a dis¬ 
tracted girl into surrender.

VI 

I don’t know why, to-night in par¬ 
ticular, the fact that I am a dead man 
occurs to me very insistently. I had 
forgotten this for two whole days. If 
any one very dear to you has ever been 
in extremis at a distance and you have 
journeyed to be at the last bedside, you 
will know how possible this is—how for 
hours at a time the mind will go wander¬ 
ing away from the main fact that is 
drawing you onwards, till suddenly it 
comes back: some one is dying at a 
distance. And I suppose one’s I is the 
nearest friend that one has—and my I 
is dying at a distance. At the end of a 
certain number of days is the deathbed 
towards which I am hurrying—it is a 
fact which I cannot grasp. But one 
aspect grows more clear to me every 
time I return to this subject. 

6i 


7he Nature of a Crime 


You remember that, when we have 
discussed suicide, we have agreed that 
to the man of action death is a solution: 
to the man of thoughts it is none. For 
the man of action expresses himself in 
action, and death is the negation of ac¬ 
tion : the man of thought sees the world 
only in thoughts, and over thought 
death exercises no solution of con¬ 
tinuity. If one dies one’s actions cease, 
one’s problem continues. For that 
reason it is only in so far as I am a man 
of action that I shall be dying. You 
understand what I mean—for I do not 
mean that it is my actions that have 
killed me. It is simply because I have 
taken refuge from my thoughts in 
action, and because after April 5 that 
refuge will be closed to me, that I 
take refuge in a final action which, 
properly speaking, is neither action nor 
refuge. 

. And perhaps I am no man of action 
at all, since the action in which I have 

62 




The Nature of a Crime 


taken refuge is properly speaking no 
action at all, but merely the expression 
of a frame of mind. I have gambled, 
that is to say I have not speculated. 
For the speculator acts for gain: the 
gambler in order to interest himself. 
I have gambled—to escape from you: 
I have tried to escape from my thoughts 
of you into divining the undivinable 
future. For that is what gambling is. 
You try for a rise: you try for a fall— 
and the rise or the fall may depend on 
the momentary madness of a dozen men 
who declare a war, or upon the rain 
from heaven which causes so many 
more stalks of wheat to arise upon so 
many million square inches of earth. 
The point is that you make yourself 
dependent upon caprice—upon the ca¬ 
price of the weather or upon the move¬ 
ment in the minds of men more insane 
than yourself. 

To-day I have entered upon what is 
the biggest gamble of my whole life. 

63 





The Nature of a Crime 


Certain men who believe in me—they 
are not Edward Burdens, nevertheless 
they believe in me—have proposed to 
me to form a corner in a certain article 
which is indispensable to the daily life 
of the City. I do not tell you what it 
is because you will assuredly witness 
the effects of this inspiration. 

You will say that, when this is ac¬ 
complished, it will be utterly uninter¬ 
esting. And that is literally true: 
when it is done it will be uninteresting. 
But in the multiplicity of things that 
will have to be done before the whole 
thing is done—in the waiting for things 
to take effect, in the failures perhaps 
more than in the successes, since the 
failures will imply new devising—in all 
the meticulous thought-readings that 
will be necessary, the interest will lie, 
and in the men with whom one is 
brought into contact, the men with 
whom one struggles, the men whom one 
must bribe or, trick. 

64 





The Nature of a Crime 


And you will say: How can I who am 
to die in fourteen days embark upon an 
enterprise that will last many months 
or many years? That, I think, is very 
simple. 

It is my protest against being called 
a man of action, the misconception that 
I have had to resent all my life. And 
this is a thought: not an action: a 
thought made up of an almost infinite 
number of erring calculations. You 
have probably forgotten that I have 
founded two towns, upon the south 
coast: originated four railways in trop¬ 
ical climates and one in the west of 
England: and opened up heaven knows 
how many mines of one kind or another 
—and upon my soul I had forgotten 
these things too until I began to cast 
about in my mind. And now I go to 
my death unmindful of these glories 
in so far as they are concrete. In 
that sense my death is utter: it is a 
solution. But, in so far as they are my 

65 



7he Nature of a Crime 


refuges from you they remain problems 
to which, if my ghost is to escape you, 
I must return again and again. 

In dying I surrender to you and thus, 
for the inner self of myself, death is no 
ending but the commencement of who 
knows what tortures. It is only in 
the latent hope that death is the nega¬ 
tion of consciousness that I shall take 
my life. For death, though it can very 
certainly end no problem, may at least 
make us unconscious of how, eventu¬ 
ally, the problem solves itself. That, 
you see, is really the crux of the whole 
thing—that is why the man of action 
will take refuge in death: the man of 
thought, never. But I, I am the man 
of neither the one nor the other: I am 
the man of love, which partakes of 
action and of thought, but which is 
neither. 

The lover is, perhaps, the eternal 
doubter—simply because there is no 
certain panacea for love. Travel may 

66 



The Nature of a Crime 


cure it—but travel may cause to arise 
homesickness, which of all forms of love 
is the most terrible. To mix with many 
other men may cure it—but again, to 
the man who really loves, it may be a 
cause for still more terrible unrest, since 
seeing other men and women may set 
one always comparing the beloved 
object with the same thing. And, in¬ 
deed, the form that it takes with me— 
for with me love takes the form of a de¬ 
sire to discuss—the form which it takes 
with me renders each thing that I see, 
each man with whom I speak, the more 
torturing, since always I desire to ad¬ 
just my thoughts of them by your 
thoughts. I went down the other day 
—before I had begun to write these 
letters to you and before I knew death 
impended so nearly over me—to the sea 
at P—. I was trying to get rid of you. 
I sat in the moonlight and saw the 
smacks come home, visible for a minute 
in the track of the moon and then no 

67 








7he Nature of a Crime 


more than their lights in the darkness. 
The fishermen talked of death by drown¬ 
ing mostly: the passage of the boats 
across that trail of light suggested re¬ 
flections, no doubt trite. But, without 
you to set my thoughts by, I could get 
no more forward: I went round and 
round in a ring from the corpses fished 
up in the nets to the track of the moon. 
And since walking up and down on the 
parade brought me no nearer to you, I 
did not even care to move: I neither 
meditated nor walked, neither thought 
nor acted. And that is real torture. 

It was the next morning that I heard 
that young Burden desired that his 
fiancee s solicitors should scrutinise the 
accounts of the Burden Trust—and 
Death loomed up before me. 

You will ask: why Death? Why not 
some alternative? Flight or prison? 
Well: prison would be an unendurable 
travelling through Time, flight, an 
equally unendurable travelling through 

68 



The Nature of a Crime 


Time with Space added. Both these 
things are familiar: Death alone, in spite 
of all the experience that humanity has 
had of Death, is the utterly unfamiliar. 
For a gambler it is a coup alluring be¬ 
yond belief—as we know neither what 
we stake nor what we stand to win. I, 
personally, stand to win a great deal, 
since Life holds nothing for me and I 
stake only my life—and what I seek 
is only forgetfulness of you, or some sort 
of eventual and incomprehensible union 
with you. For the union with you that 
I seek is a queer sort of thing; hardly 
at all, I think, a union of the body, but 
a sort of consciousness of our thoughts 
proceeding onwards together. That we 
may find in the unending Afterwards. 
Or we may find the Herb Oblivion. 

Either of these things I desire. For, 
in so far as we can dogmatise about 
Death we may lay it down that Death 
is the negation of Action but is power¬ 
less against Thought. I do not desire 

69 





7he Nature of a Crime 


Action: and at the same time I do not 
fear Thought. For it is not my 
thoughts of you that I fear: left alone 
with them I can say: “What is she 
more than any other material object?” 
It is my feelings that wear out my brain 
■—^my feelings that make me know that 
you are more than every material ob¬ 
ject living or still, and more than every 
faith dead or surviving. For feeling 
is neither Thought nor Action: it is the 
very stuff of Life itself. And, if Death 
be the negation of Life it may well be 
the end of consciousness. 

The worst that Death can do to me is 
to deliver me up for ever to unsatisfied 
longings for you. Well, that is all 
that Life has done, that is all that Life 
can do, for me. 

But Life can do so much more that is 
worse. Believe me when I say that I 
dread imprisonment—and believe me 
when I say that I do not dread disgrace. 
For you know very well that it is true 

70 



The Nature of a Crime 


when I say that I positively chuckle at 
the thought of the shock my fall would 
give to all these unawakened intelli¬ 
gences of this world. You know how I 
despise Edward Burden for trusting in 
me; you know how I have always de¬ 
spised other people who trusted in 
established reputations. I don’t mean 
to say that I should not have liked to 
keep the game up, certainly I should, 
since in gambling it is more desirable 
to win than to lose. And it is more 
amusing to fool fools than to give them 
eye-openers. But I think that, in 
gambling, it is only a shade less desir¬ 
able, per se, to lose than to win. The 
main point is the sensation of either; 
and the only valid objection to losing is 
that, if one loses too often one has at last 
no longer the wherewithal to gamble. 
Similarly, to give people eye-openers is, 
per se^ nearly as desirable as to fool 
them. It is not quite so desirable, 
since the game itself is the fooling. 

71 



The Nature of a Crime 


But the great objection in my case 
is that the eye-opener would once and 
for all put an end to the chance of 
my ever fooling them again. That, 
however, is a very small matter and 
what I dread is not that. If people no 
longer trusted in me I could no doubt 
still find an outlet'for my energies with 
those who sought to take advantage of 
my abilities, trusting to themselves to 
wrest from me a sufficient share of the 
plunder that they so ardently desire, 
that I so really have no use for. 

No, I seek in Death a refuge from 
exposure not because exposure would 
cripple my energies: it would probably 
help them; and not because exposure 
would mean disgrace; I should prob¬ 
ably find ironical satisfaction in it 
—but simply because it would mean 
imprisonment. That I dread beyond 
belief: I clench my fingers when, in con¬ 
versation, I hear the words: “A long 
sentence.” For that would mean my 

72 




The Nature of a Crime 


being delivered up for a long time—for 
ever—to you. I write “for ever” 
advisedly and after reflection, since a 
long subjection, without relief, to that 
strain would leave upon my brain a 
wound that must prove ineffaceable. 
For to be alone and to think—those 
are my terrors. 

One reads that men who have been 
condemned for long years to solitary 
imprisonment go mad. But I think 
that even that sad gift from Omnipotent 
Fate would not be mine. As I figure 
the world to myself. Fate is terrible 
only to those who surrender to her. If 
I surrendered, to the extent of living 
to go to prison, then assuredly the 
future must be uniformly heavy, uni¬ 
formly doomed, in my eyes. For I 
would as soon be mad as anything else 
I can think of. But I should not go 
mad. Men go mad because of the 
opportunities they miss: because the 
world changes outside their prison 

73 



7he Nature of a Crime 


walls, or because their children starve. 
But I have no opportunities to miss or 
take: the changes of the world to me 
are nothing, and there is no soul be¬ 
tween whom and starvation I could 
stand. 

Whilst I am about making this final 
disposition of my properties—let me 
tell you finally what I have done in re¬ 
gard to your husband himself. It is a 
fact—and this I have been keeping up 
my sleeve as a final surprise for you— 
that he is almost cured. . . . 

But I have just received an incom¬ 
prehensible note from Edward Burden. 
He asks me for some particulars as to 
his confounded estate and whether I 
can lend him some thousands of pounds 
at short notice. Heaven knows what 
new scrape this is that he’s in. Of 
course this may precipitate my crash. 
But whatever happens, I shall find 
time to write my final words to you— 
and nothing else really matters. . . . 

74 




VII 

I haven’t yet discovered what Ed¬ 
ward Burden is doing. I have found 
him a good round sum upon mortgage— 
the irony of the position being that the 
money is actually his whilst the mort¬ 
gage does not actually exist. He says 
that what he is doing with the money 
will please me. I suppose that means 
that he’s embarking upon some sort of 
speculation which he imagines that I 
would favour. It is odd that he should 
think that I find gratification in his 
imitating myself. 

But why should I concern myself 
with this thing at all? Nothing in the 
world can ever please or displease me 
any more. For I have taken my re¬ 
solve: this is my last night upon earth. 
When I lay down this pen again, I 

75 



7he Nature of a Crime 


shall never take up any pen more. 
For I have said all that I can say to 
you. I am utterly tired out. To-night 
I shall make up into a parcel all these 
letters—I must sit through the night be¬ 
cause it is only to-morrow morning that 
I shall be able to register the parcel to 
you—and registering it will be my 
last act upon the habitable globe. For 
biting through the glass in the ring will 
be not an action, but the commence¬ 
ment of a new train of thought. Or 
perhaps only my final action will come 
to an end when you read these words in 
Rome. Or will that be only thought— 
the part of me that lives—pleading to 
you to give your thoughts for company. 
I feel too tired to think the matter out! 

Let me, then, fimish with this earth: 
I told you, when I finished writing last 
night, that Robert is almost cured. I 
would not have told you this for the 
sake of arrogating to myself the position 
of a saviour. But I imagine that you 

76 



The Nature of a Crime 


would like the cure to go on and, in the 
case of some accident after my death, it 
might go all to pieces once more. Quite 
simply then: I have been doing two 
things. In the first place I have per¬ 
suaded your chemists to reduce very 
gradually the strength of chloral, so 
that the bottles contain nearly half 
water. And Robert perceives no differ¬ 
ence. Now of course it is very import¬ 
ant that he shall not know of the trick 
that is being so beneficently played on 
him—so that, in case he should go away 
or for one reason or another change his 
chemists, it must be carefully seen to 
that instead of pure chloral he obtains 
the exactly diluted mixture. In this 
way he may be brought gradually to 
drinking almost pure water. 

But that alone would hardly be satis¬ 
factory: a comparatively involuntary 
cure is of little value in comparison 
with an effort of the will. You may, 
conceivably, expel nature with a fork, 

77 





The Nature of a Crime 


but nothing but a passion will expel a 
passion. The only point to be proved 
is whether there exists in your husband 
any other passion for the sake of which 
he might abandon his passion for the 
clearness of vision which he always says 
his chloral gives him. He has not, of 
course, the incentives usual to men; 
you cannot, in fact, “get” him along 
ordinary lines. . . . But apart 

from his physical craving for the drug 
he has that passion for clearness of in¬ 
tellect that he says the drug gives him 
—and it is through that, that at last, I 
have managed to hit his pride. 

For I have put it to him very strongly 
that one view of life is just as good as 
another—^no better, no worse, but just 
the same. And I have put it to him 
that his use of chloral simply limits for 
him the number of views of life that 
he might conceivably have. And, when 
you come to think of all the rhapsodies 
of his that we have listened to, I think 

78 




The Nature of a Crime 


that that piece of special pleading is 
sufficiently justified. I do indeed hon¬ 
estly believe that, for what it is worth, 
he is on the road to salvation. He 
means to make a struggle—to attempt 
the great feat of once more seeing life 
with the eyes that Fate originally gave 
to him. 

This is my legacy to you: if you ask 
me why I have presented you with this 
man’s new identity—since it will mean 
a new identity—I must answer that I 
simply don’t know. Why have we kept 
him alive all these years ? I have done 
it no doubt because I had nothing to 
give you. But you? If you have 
loved me you must have wished him— 
I won’t say dead—but no more there. 
Yet you have tried too—and I suppose 
this answer to the riddle is simply the 
answer to the whole riddle of our life. 
We have tried to play a supremely 
difficult game simply because it sancti¬ 
fied our love. For, after all, sanctifica- 

79 






‘The Nature of a Crime 


tion arises from difficulties. Well, we 
have made our way very strait and we 
have so narrowed the door of entrance 
that it has vanished altogether. We 
have never had any hope of a solution 
that could have satisfied us. If we had 
cared to break the rules of the game, I 
suppose we could have done it easily 
enough—and we could have done it the 
more easily since neither you nor I ever 
subscribed to those rules. If we have 
not it was, I think, simply because we 
sought the difficulty which sanctifies. 
. . . Has it been a very imbecile 

proceeding? I am most uncertain. 
For it is not a thing to be very proud of 
—to be able to say that for a whole life¬ 
time, one has abstained from that 
which one most desired. On the other 
hand, we have won a curious and 
difficult game. Well—there it is—and 
there is your legacy. I do not think 
that there is anything else for me to 
write about. . You will see that, in my 

8o 




T'he Nature of a Crime 


will, I have left everything I possess to 
—Edward Burden. This is not be¬ 
cause I wish to make him reparation, 
and it’s not because I wish to avoid 
scandal: it is simply because it may 
show him—one very simple thing. It 
will show him how very nearly I might 
have made things come right. I have 
been balancing my accounts very care¬ 
fully, and I find that, reckoning things 
reasonably against myself, Edward 
Burden will have a five-pound note with 
which to buy himself a mourning-ring. 

The being forced to attend to my 
accounts will make him gasp a good deal. 
It will certainly shake his belief in all 
accepted reputations—for he will look 
on the faces of many men each “as 
solid as the Bank of England,” and he 
will think: “I wonder if you are 
like ? ’ ’ His whole world will crum¬ 
ble—not because I have been dishonest, 
since he is coldblooded enough to be¬ 
lieve that all men may be dishonest. 

8i 





The Nature of a Crime 


But he will tremble because I have been 
able to be so wildly dishonest and yet 
to be so successfully respectable. He 
won’t even dare to “expose” me, since, 
if he did that, half of the shares which 
he will inherit from me would suffer an 
eclipse of disreputability, would tumble 
to nothingness in value—and would 
damage his poor pocket. He will have 
to have my estate set down at a high 
figure; he will have to be congratulated 
on his fortunate inheritance, and he will 
have, sedulously, to compound my 
felony. 

You will wonder how I can be cap¬ 
able of this final cruelty—the most cruel 
thing that, perhaps, ever one man did to 
another. I will tell you why it is: it is 
because I hate all the Edward Burdens 
of the world—because, being the eternal 
Haves of the world, they have made 
their idiotic rules of the game. And 
you and I suffer: you and I, the eternal 
Have Nots. . And we suffer, not because 

82 




The Nature of a Crime 


their rules bind us, but because, being 
the finer spirits, we are forced to set 
ourselves rules that are still more strict 
in order that, in all things, we may be 
the truly gallant. 

But why do I write: “You will wonder 
how I can be capable of this.” You 
will have understood—you who under¬ 
stand everything. 

Eight in the morning. —^Well: now we 
part. I am going to register the parcel 
containing all these letters to you. We 
part: and it is as if you were dropping 
back—the lost Eurydice of the world— 
into an utter blackness. For, in a 
minute, you will be no more than part 
of my past. Well then: good-night. 


83 



VIII 

You will have got the telegram I 
sent you long before you got the parcel 
of letters: you will have got the note I 
wrote you by the same post as the let¬ 
ters themselves. If I have taken these 
three days to myself before again writ¬ 
ing to you it has been because I have 
needed to recover my power of think¬ 
ing. Now, in a way, I have recovered 
it—and it is only fair to say that I have 
devoted all my thoughts to how the 
new situation affects you—and you in 
your relations to me. 

It places me in your hands—let that 
be written first and foremost. You 
have to decree my life or my death. 
For I take it that now we can never get 
back again into our old position: I have 
spoken, you have heard me speak. The 

84 


7he Nature of a Crime 


singular unity, the silence of our old life 
is done with for good. There is perhaps 
no reason why this should not be so: 
silence is no necessary part of our rela¬ 
tionship. But it has seemed to make 
a rather exquisite bond between us. 

It must, if I am to continue to live— 
it must be replaced by some other 
bond. In our silence we have seemed 
to speak in all sorts of strange ways: 
we have perhaps read each other’s 
thoughts. I have seen words form 
themselves upon your lips. But now 
you must—there is no way out of it— 
you must write to me. You must 
write to me fully; all your thoughts. 
You must, as I have done, find the 
means of speech—or I can no longer 
live. . . . 

I am reprieved! 

I don’t know if, in my note to you, I 
explained exactly what had happened. 
It was in this way. I was anxious to 
be done with my world very early and, 

8s 



The Nature of a Crime 


as soon as eight o’clock struck, I set out 
for the post-office at the corner to 
register that parcel of letters for you. 
Till the task was accomplished—the 
last I was to perform on earth—I 
noticed nothing: I was simply in a 
hurry. But, having given the little 
fagot into the hands of a sleepy girl, I 
said to myself suddenly: “Now I am 
dead!” I began suddenly as they say 
of young children, to “notice.” A 
weight that I had never felt before 
seemed to fall away from me. I 
noticed, precisely, that the girl clerk 
was sleepy, that, as she reached up one 
hand to take the parcel over the brass 
caging, she placed the other over her 
mouth to hide a yawn. 

And out on the pavement it was most 
curious what had befallen the world. 
It had lost all interest: but it had be¬ 
come fascinating, vivid. I had not, you 
see, any senses left, but my eyesight 
and hearing. ' Vivid: that is the word. 

86 



7he Nature of a Crime 


I watched a newsboy throw his papers 
down an area, and it appeared wonder¬ 
fully interesting to discover that that 
was how one’s papers got into the 
house. I watched a milkman go up 
some doorsteps to put a can of milk 
beside a boot-scraper md I was won¬ 
derfully interested to see a black cat 
follow him. They were the clearest 
moments I have ever spent upon the 
earth—those when I was dead. They 
were so clear because nothing else 
weighed on my attention but just 
those little things. It was an extraor¬ 
dinary, a luxuriant feeling. That, I 
imagine, must have been how Adam 
and Eve felt before they had eaten of 
the fruit of knowledge. 

Supposing I had tacitly arranged 
with myself that I would die in the 
street, I think I should still have walked 
home simply to dally longer with that 
delightful feeling of sheer curiosity. 
For it was sheer curiosity to see how 

87 




T'he Nature of a Crime 

this world, which I had never looked at, 
really performed before utterly un¬ 
biassed eyes. 

That was why, when I got home, I 
sent away the messenger that brought to 
me Edward Burden’s letter; there was 
to be no answer. Whatever Burden’s 
query might be I was not going to com¬ 
mit myself to any other act. My last 
was that of sending off the parcel to 
you. 

My opening Burden’s letter when 
the messenger had gone was simply a 
part of my general curiosity. I wanted 
to see how a Burden letter would look 
when it no longer had any bearings at 
all for me. It was as if I were going to 
read a letter from that dear Edward 
to a man I did not know upon a subject 
of which I had never heard. 

And then I was reprieved! 

The good Edward, imagining that I 
was seriously hurt at his having pro¬ 
posed to allow, his wife’s solicitors to 

88 



The Nature of a Crime 


superintend my stewardship—the good 
Edward in his concern had positively 
insisted that all the deeds should be 
returned to me absolutely unchecked. 
He said that he had had a hard fight 
for it and that the few thousands he 
had borrowed from me had represented 
his settlement, which he had thus paid 
in specie. . . . 

It chimed in wonderfully with his 
character, when I come to think of it. 
Of course he was disciplining Miss 
Averies’ representatives just as he had 
disciplined herself in the matter of 
China tea of which I have written to 
you. And he had imagined that I was 
seriously hurt! Can you figure to your¬ 
self such an imbecile? 

But, if you permit me to continue to 
live, you will be saving the poor fool 
from the great shock I had prepared 
for him—the avalanche of discovery, 
the earthquake of uncertainty. For 
he says in that so kind way of his that, 

89 




7he Nature of a Crime 


having thus shown his entire confidence 
in me—in the fact, that is, that Provi¬ 
dence is on the side of all Burdens—he 
will choose a time in the future, con¬ 
venient for me, when he will go thor¬ 
oughly with me into his accounts. And 
inasmuch as his wedding-tour will take 
him all round the world I have at least 
a year in which to set things straight. 
And of course I can put off his scru¬ 
tiny indefinitely or deceive him for 
ever. 

I did not think all these things at 
once. In fact, when I had read his 
letter, so strong within me was the 
feeling that it was only a mental pheno¬ 
menon, a thing that had no relation 
with me—the feeling of finality was so 
strong upon me that I actually found 
myself sitting in that chair before I 
realized what had occurred. 

What had occurred was that I had 
become utterly and for good your prop¬ 
erty. 


90 





7he Nature of a Crime 


In that sense only am I reprieved. 
As far as Edward Burden is concerned 
I am entirely saved. I stand before 
you and ask you to turn your thumb up 
or down. For, having spoken as I 
have to you, I have given you a right 
over me. Now that the pressing neces¬ 
sity for my death is over I have to ask 
you whether I shall plunge into new ad¬ 
ventures that will lead me to death or 
whether I am to find some medium in 
which we may lead a life of our own, in 
some way together. I was about to 
take my life to avoid prison; now prison 
is no more a part of my scheme of exist¬ 
ence. But I must now have some 
means of working towards you or I 
must run some new and wild risk to 
push you out of my thoughts. I don’t, 
as you know, ask you to be my secret 
mistress, I don’t ask you to elope with 
me. But I say that you must belong 
to me as much in thought as I have, in 
this parcel of letters, been revealed and 

91 



7he Nature of a Crime 


given over to you. Otherwise, I must 
once more gamble—and having tasted 
of gambling in the shadow of death, 
I must gamble for ever in that way. I 
must, I mean, feel that I am coming to¬ 
wards you or committing crimes that 
I may forget you. 

My dear, I am a very tired man. If 
you know what it was to long for you 
as I have longed for you all these years, 
you would wonder that I did not, sitting 
in that chair, put the ring up to my 
teeth, in spite of Burden’s letter, and 
end it. I have an irresistible longing for 
rest—or perhaps it is only your sup¬ 
port. To think that I must face for 
ever—or for as long as it lasts—this 
troublesome excitement of avoiding 
thoughts of you—that was almost un¬ 
bearable. I resisted because I had 
written these letters to you. I love you 
and I know you love me—yet without 
them I would have inflicted upon you 
the wound of my death. Having 

92 





The Nature of a Crime 


written them I cannot face the cruelty 
to you. I mean that, if I had died with¬ 
out your knowing why, it would have 
been only a death grievous to you— 
still it is the duty of humanity and of 
you with humanity to bear and to for¬ 
get deaths. But now that you must 
know, I could not face the cruelty of 
filling you with the pain of unmerited 
remorse. For I know that you would 
have felt remorse, and it would have 
been unmerited since I gave you no 
chance or any time to stretch out your 
hands to me. Now I give it you and 
wait for your verdict. 

For the definite alternatives are these; 
I will put Burden’s estate absolutely 
clear within the year and work out, in 
order to make safe money, the new and 
comparatively sober scheme of which 
I have written to you: that I will do if 
you will consent to be mine to the ex¬ 
tent of sharing our thoughts alone. Or, 
if you will not, I will continue to gamble 

93 



The Nature of a Crime 


more wildly than ever with the Burden 
money. And that in the end means 
death and a refuge from you. 

So then, I stand reprieved—and the 
final verdict is in your hands. 


94 



APPENDIX 

A Note on “Romance” 

Writing to his Collaborator in a letter pub¬ 
lished in the Transatlantic Review for January, 
1924, Mr. Conrad makes the following ascrip¬ 
tion of passages in the work above named: 

First Part, yours; Second Part, mainly yours, with a 
little by me on points of seamanship and suchlike small 
matters; Third Part, about 60 per cent mine with import¬ 
ant touches by you; Fourth Part, mine with here and there 
an important sentence by you; ^ Fifth Part practically all 
yours, including the famous sentence at which we both 
exclaimed; “This is Genius,” (Do you remember what it 
is?) with perhaps half a dozen lines by me. . . . 

Mr. Conrad’s recollections—except for the 
generosity of his two “importants”—tally well 
enough with those of his Collaborator if con¬ 
ception alone is concerned. When it comes 
however to the writing the truth is that Parts 
One, Two, Three and Five are a singular mosaic 
of passages written alternately by one or other 
of the collaborators. The matchless Fourth 
Part is both in conception and writing entirely 
the work of Mr. Conrad. 

95 


(Appendix 


Below will be found the analysis of “Ro¬ 
mance.” Any student of literature with an 
ear for prose will hardly need these under¬ 
linings, for Mr. Conrad’s definitenesses of 
statement stand out amongst his Collaborator’s 
more English keyings down so that when one 
of his half sentences bursts into the no doubt 
suaver prose of the other it is as if the page 
comes to life and speaks. 

Every collaboration is a contest of tempera¬ 
ments if it be at all thoroughly carried out; and 
this collaboration was carried out so thoroughly 
that, even when the book came to the proof 
stage, the original publishers, half way through 
the printing, sent the MS. back to the authors. 
They were still making innumerable cor¬ 
rections. 

Originally conceived, in the attempt to 
convey realistically a real story of adventure 
recorded in a State Trial, as the thin tale of a 
very old man—and this before the question of 
collaboration arose—the book contains of its 
first version only the two opening sentences— 
and the single other sentence: “And, looking 
back, we see Romance!” In between lay to 
say the least of it almost unbelievable labours— 
a contest of attrition lasting over several years. 
For insofar as this collaboration was a contest 
of wills it was a very friendly one; yet it was 
the continual attempt on the part of the one 

96 



oAppendix 


collaborator to key up and of the other to key 
down. And so exhausting was the contest that 
in the course of the years two definite break¬ 
downs occurred. In the first the robuster 
writer let the book called “The Inheritors” 
just go and it remains a monument as it were 
of silverpoint, delicacies and allusiveness. The 
second breakdown is recorded in the Fourth 
Part of “Romance,” sketches for which were 
written over and over—and then over—again, 
until the weaker brother, in absolute ex¬ 
haustion, in turn let it go at that. So, to mark 
those, breaking points, you have the silver- 
point of “The Inheritors” set against the, let 
us say, oil-painting of this matchless Fourth 
Part. 

“The Nature of a Crime” should have be¬ 
come a novel treating of the eternal subject 
of the undetected criminal—a theme which 
every writer for once or twice in his life at least 
contemplates in a world in which the fortunate 
are so very often the merely not found out. 
The courage of few writers carries them even 
beyond the contemplation; in this case the joint 
courages of the authors went as far as what 
you may read. 

The passage from the Fifth Part of “Ro¬ 
mance” printed below contains the “famous 
sentence” as to which Mr. Conrad writes: 
“We both exclaimed: ‘This is genius’.”

Part One: Chapter One. 

To yesterday and to-day 1 say my polite vaya 
usted con dios.” What are these days to me? 
But that far-off day of my romance, when from 
between the blue and white bales in Don Ramon s 
darkened storeroom, at Kingston, I saw the door 
open before the figure of an old man with the 
tired, long, white face, that day I am not likely 
to forget. I remember the chilly smell of the 
typical West Indian store, the indescribable 
smell of damp gloom, of locos, of pimento, of olive 
oil, of new sugar, of new rum; the glassy double 
sheen of Ramon s great spectacles, the piercing 
eyes in the mahogany face, while the tap, tap, 
tap of a cane on the flags went on behind the 
inner door; the click of the latch; the stream of 
light. The door, petulantly thrust inwards, 
struck against some barrels. I remember the 
rattling of the bolts on that door, and the tall 
figure that appeared there, snuff-box in hand. 
In that land of white clothes that precise, ancient, 
Castilian in black was something to remember. 
The black cane that had made the tap, tap, tap 
dangled by a silken cord from the hand whose 
delicate blue-veined, wrinkled wrist ran back into 
a foam of lawn ruffles. The other hand paused 

98 




d/lppendix 


in the act of conveying a pinch of snuff to the 
nostrils of the hooked nose that had, on the skin 
stretched tight over the bridge, the polish of old 
ivory; the elbow pressing the black cocked hat 
against the side; the legs, one bent, the other bow¬ 
ing a little back —this was the attitude of Sera- 
phina’s father. 

Having imperiously thrust the door of the 
inner room open, he remained immovable, with 
no intention of entering, and called in a harsh, 
aged voice: “Senor Ramon! Senor Ramon!” 
and then twice: “Seraphina—Seraphina!” 
turning his head back. 

Then for the first time I saw Seraphina, looking 
over her father s shoulder. I remember her face 
of that day; her eyes were grey—the grey of 
black, not of blue. For a moment they looked me 
straight in the face, reflectively, unconcerned, and 
then travelled to the spectacles of old Ramon. 

This glance—remember I was young on that 
day—had been enough to set me wondering 
what they were thinking of me; what they 
could have seen of me. 

“But there he is your Senor Ramon,” she 
said to her father, as if she were chiding him for 
a petulance in calling; “ your sight is not very 
good, my poor little father—there he is, your 
Ramon.” 

The warm reflection of the light behind her, 
gilding the curve of her face from ear to chin, 

99

lost itself in the shadows of black lace falling from 
dark hair that was not quite black. She spoke 
as if the words clung to her lips; as if she had to 
put them forth delicately for fear of damaging the 
frail things. 


Part One: Chapter Five. 

Macdonald cleared his throat, with a sound 
resembling the coughing of a defective pump, and 
a mere trickle of a voice asked: 

“Hwhat evidence have ye of identitee?” 

I hadn't any at all and began to finger my 
buttonholes as shamefaced as a pauper before a 
Board. The certitude dawned upon me suddenly 
that Carlos, even if he would consent to swear to 
me, would prejudice my chances. 

I cannot help thinking that I came very near 
to being cast adrift upon the streets of Kingston. 
To my asseverations Macdonald returned nothing 
but a series of minute ’’fumphs." I don't 
know what overcame his scruples; he had shown 
no signs of yielding, but suddenly turning on his 
heel made a motion with one of his flabby white 
hands. I understood it to mean that I was to 
follow him aft. 

The decks were covered with a jabbering 
turmoil of negroes with muscular arms arid 
brawny shoulders. All their shining faces 
seemed to be momentarily gashed open to show 

100 




o/lppendix 


rows of white, and were spotted with inlaid 
eyeballs. The sounds coming from them were 
a bewildering noise. They were hauling bag¬ 
gage about aimlessly. A large soft bundle of 
bedding nearly took me off my legs. There 
wasn’t room for emotion. Macdonald laid 
about him with the handle of the umbrella a 
few inches from the deck; but the passage that 
he made for himself closed behind him. 

Suddenly^ in the -pushing and hurrying, 1 
came upon a little clear space beside a pile of 
boxes. Stooping over them was the angular 
figure of Nichols, the second mate. He looked 
up at me, screwing his yellow eyes together. 

“Going ashore,” he asked, “long of that Puffing 
Billy?” 

“ What business is it of yours ? ” I mumbled 
sulkily. 

Sudden and intense threatening came into his 
yellow eyes. 

“Pont you ever come to you know where,” 
he said; “/ don't want no spies on what I do. 
There's a man there'll crack your little backbone 
if he catches you. Pon't yeh come now. Never.” 


Part Four: Chapter One. 

In my anxiety to keep clear of the schooner 
which, for all I know to this day, may not have 
been there at all, I had come too close to the 


lOI 





o/lppendix 


sand, so close that I heard soft, rapid footfalls 
stop short in the fog. A voice seemed to be 
asking me in a whisper: 

“Where, oh, where?” 

Another cried out irresistibly, “I see it.” 

It was a subdued cry, as if hushed in awe. 

My arm swung to and fro; the turn of my 
wrist went on imparting the propelling motion 
of the oar. All the rest of my body was gripped 
helplessly in the dead expectation of the end, 
as if in the benumbing seconds of a fall from a 
towering height. And it was swift, too. I felt 
a draught at the back of my neck—a breath of 
wind. And instantly, as if a battering ram had 
been let swing past me at many layers of 
stretched gauze, I beheld, through a tattered 
deep hole in the fog, a roaring vision of flames, 
borne down and swimming up again; a dance of 
purple gleams on the strip of unveiled water, 
and three coal black flgures in the light. 

One of them stood high on lank black legs, 
with long black arms thrown up stiffly above 
the black shape of a hat. The two others 
crouched low on the very edge of the water, 
peering as if from an ambush. 

The clearness of this vision was contained 
by a thick and a fiery atmosphere, into which a 
soft white rush and swirl of fog fell like a sudden 
whirl of snow. It closed down and over¬ 
whelmed at once .the tall flutter of the flames, 

102 




oAppendix 


the black figures, the purple gleams playing 
round my oar. The hot glare had struck my 
eyeballs once, and that melted away again into 
the old, fiery stain on the mended fabric of the 
fog. But the attitudes of the crouching men 
left no room for doubt that we had been seen. 
I expected a sudden uplifting of voices on the 
shore, answered by cries from the sea, and I 
screamed excitedly at Castro to lay hold of his 
oar. 

He did not stir, and after my shouts, which 
must have fallen on the scared ears with a 
weird and unearthly note, a profound silence 
attended us—the silence of a superstitious 
fear: And, instead of howls, I heard, before the 
boat had travelled its own short length, a voice 
that seemed to be the voice of fear itself asking, 
“Did you hear that?” and a trembling mutter 
of an invocation to all the saints. Then a 
strangled throat trying to pronounce firmly, 
“The soul of the dead Inglez. Crying for 
pain.” 

Admiral Rowley’s seamen, so miserably 
thrown away in the ill-conceived attack on the 
bay, were making a ghostly escort to our escape. 
Those dead boats’-crews were supposed to 
haunt the fatal spot, after the manner of 
spectres that linger in remorse, regret, or 
revenge, about the gates of departure. I had 
blundered; the fog, breaking apart, had be- 

103 



^Appendix 


trayed us. But my obscure and vanquished 
country-men held possession of the outlet by 
memory of their courage. In this critical 
moment it was they, I may say, who stood by 
us. 

We, on our part, must have been disclosed, 
dark,indistinct,utterly inexplicable;completely 
unexpected; an apparition of stealthy shades. 
The painful voice in the fog said: 

“Let them be. Answer not. They shall 
pass on, for none of them died on the shore—all 
in the water. Yes, all in the water.” 


Part Five: Chapter One. 

“Why have I been brought here your wor¬ 
ship ? ” I asked with a great deal of firmness. 

There were two figures in black, the one beside, 
the other behind a large black table. I was placed 
in front of them between two dirty soldiers, in 
the centre of a large, gaunt room, with bare, dirty 
walls, and the arms of Spain above the judge’s 
seat. 

“You are before the fuez de la Primera 
Instancia,” said the man in black beside the 
table. He wore a large and shadowy tricorn. 
“Be silent, and respect the procedure.” 

It was, without doubt, excellent advice. 
He whispered some words in the ear of the Judge 
of the First Instance. It was plain enough to me

that the judge was quite an inferior official, who 
merely decided whether there was any case against 
the accused; he had, even to his clerk, an air of 
timidity, of doubt. 

I said: '’’’But I insist on knowing. . . 

The clerk said: In good time. . . 

And then, in the same tone of disinterested 
official routine, he spoke to the Lugareno, who, 
from beside the door, rolled very frightened eyes 
from the judges and the clerk to myself and the 
soldiers —“Advance.” 

The judge, in a hurried, perfunctory voice, put 
questions to the Lugareno; the clerk scratched 
with a large quill on a sheet of paper. 

''Where do you come from V' 

" The town of Rio Medio, excellency 

" Of what occupation ? ” 

"Excellency—a few goats. . . .” 

"Why are you here V' 

"My daughter, excellency, married Pepe of the 
posada in the Calle. . . .” 

The judge said, "Yes, yes,” with an un¬ 
sanguine impatience. The Lugareno’s dirty 
hands jumped nervously on the large rim of his 
limp hat. 

"You lodge a complaint against the senor 
there.” 

The clerk pointed the end of his quill towards 
me. 

"I? God forbid, excellency” the Lugareno

bleated. The Alguazil of the Criminal Court 
instructed me to be watchful. . . 

Part Five: The End. 

A long time after a harsh voice said: 

“ Your excellency, we retire, of course, from the 
prosecution.” 

A different one directed: 

“Gentlemen of the jury you will return a verdict 
of ‘Not Guilty^ . . .” 

Down below they were cheering uproariously 
because my life was saved. But it was I that 
had to face my saved life. 1 sat there, my head 
bowed into my hands. The old judge was speak¬ 
ing to me in a tone of lofty compassion: 

“You have suffered much, as it seems, but 
suffering is the lot of us men. Rejoice now that 
your character is cleared; that here in this public 
place you have received the verdict of your country¬ 
men that restores you to the liberties of our country 
and the affection of your kindred. I rejoice with 
you who am a very old man at the end of my 
life. ...” 

It was rather tremendous, his deep voice, his 
weighted words. Suffering is the lot of us men. 

. . . The formidable legal array, the great 

powers of a nation, had stood up to teach me that, 
and they had taught me that—suffering is the 
lot of us men I

It takes longenoughtorealisethatsomeone is dead 
at a distance. I had done that. But how long, how 
long it needs to know that the life of your heart has 
come back from the dead. For years afterwards 
I could not bear to have her out of my sight. 

Of our first meeting in London all I can 
remember is a speechlessness that was like the 
awed hesitation of our overtried souls before 
the greatness of a change from the verge of 
despair to the opening of a supreme joy. The 
whole world, the whole of life, with her return 
had changed all around me; it enveloped me, it 
enfolded me so lightly as not to be felt, so sud¬ 
denly as not to be believed in, so completely 
that that whole meeting was an embrace, so 
softly that at last it lapsed into a sense of rest 
that was like the fall of a beneficent and wel¬ 
come death. 

For suffering is the lot of man, but not inevit¬ 
able failure or worthless despair which is with¬ 
out end—suffering, the mark of manhood, 
which bears within its pain a hope of felicity 
like a jewel set in iron. . . . 

Her first words were: 

“You broke our compact. You went away 
from me whilst I was sleeping.” Only the 
deepness of her reproach revealed the depth 
of her love, and the suffering she too had en¬ 
dured to reach a union that was to be without 
end—and to forgive.

And, looking back, we see Romance—that 
subtle thing that is mirage—that is life. It is 
the goodness of the years we have lived through, 
of the old time when we did this or that, when we 
dwelt here or there. Looking back it seems a 
wonderful enough thing that I who am this and 
she who is that, commencing so far away a life that 
after such sufferings borne together and apart, 
ended so tranquilly there in a world so stable — 
that she and I should have passed through so 
much, good chance and evil chance, sad hours 
and joyful, all lived down and swept away into 
the little heap of dust that is life. That, too, is 
Romance.
