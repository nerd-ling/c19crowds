THE SIEGE OF MALTA 
Chapter One 
There on a hill his castle stood 
With halls and touris a height, 
And goodly chambers fair to see, 
Where lodged many a knight. 
Late, late yestreen I wein’d in peace 
To end my war-worn life, 
My age might well excuse my arm 
Fro manly feats of strife; 
But since fierce Norse doeth proudly boast 
Fair Scotland to enthral, 
It’s ne’er be said of Hardyknute, 
He feir’d to ficht or fall. 
Old Scots Ballad 
T  was setting on the broad waters of the straits of Gibraltar, and its western rays remained, adorning with the most brilliant col ours and the most beautiful shades the serrated mass, which was in its wild variety one of the most touching effects of mountain scenery in the world; and in the act of glancing against those hills, so wildly adorned with ridges of the sharded rock which their bosoms con tained, at once gave brilliancy to its sharp points, and to those that retired from the light a softness equally beautiful. This prospect, though beheld with delight every evening, had still increasing charms for the inhabitants of a coast, who were daily attracted to gaze upon it with new pleasure as spring advanced. 
The sun in its various colours was also reflected from the front of the Mediterranean, and, excepting the rare occasions when a sea so mild was necessarily turned stormy and tempestuous, it was seldom that the inhabitants had any occasion to look upon the gentle ele ment which they conversed with, with any other than the most placid feelings.

Occasionally it happened, that the general peace and friendly feel ing of concord, which was spread as a species of tabernacle around this province, was withdrawn from sheltering them, and both sides in turn were fiercely decided for war and plunder, the old occupation of this region, and their curse for two or three centuries. The Moors of Africa and the Christians of Europe, during five or six centuries, made war on each other with various success, killed, plundered, and took prisoners on both sides. A party of Spanish fishermen on such an occasion observed a small band of armed men, whom they sus pected to be Moors, from their weapons and martial appearance. The other party ran their vessel into a small creek, plunged it on shore without hesitation, and, approaching, gave their salutation and greeting with hardly any ceremony. 
“Vassal,” said one, with emphasis, “we would desire your guidance as far as the Commander of Vilheyna and of Aldea, well known by his services at sea and against the Moors as one of the most severe scourges, which he has often proved.” 
“You will excuse us, noble Sir, if we are somewhat afraid to halt upon our oars, lest you should be yourselves the infidels in disguise.” “It is news must be known, which I am come officially to commun icate to your master, involving nothing else than an order upon the Commander instantly to repair to Malta, where all the Knights are presently to assemble at the Convent of the Order. More I have in 
trust, as witness my blazon, to communicate to him in secret.” It may be necessary to say, that a Commander was one who, while it was the pleasure of the Order, held a benefice composed of its lands and rents; and, indeed, for all the receipts of his trust it was common, that in the general condition of the Order, the Commander was obliged to acquit himself by remitting regularly to the Receiver of the Knights a certain moderate sum, for which he was strictly responsible as a quit rent for the whole. But when war threatened the Order, the Commander lost the advantage, and remitted to the treasury the whole profits of this office, which was esteemed its property. A formal intimation was sent when such demands were made, and, in general, they were attended to by those who enjoyed extensive benefices and had the power of doing so. Among them was to be numbered the Commander Don Manuel of Vilheyna and Aldea Bella. He was highly esteemed by his brothers, who had natur ally agreed in assigning an important Commandery on the coast of Andalusia, the rather that it was chiefly enriched by the gifts of his ancestors, Knights of Malta like himself, whose piety or zeal had bequeathed the property to the Order. Remarkable for his skill in maritime affairs, his vicinity was felt by the Moors of Africa, and

especially the celebrated Dragut, Viceroy, (now called Dey,) of Algiers, and pretending to hold that possession, which the Emperor Charles V made more than one attempt to conquer, but was unable to keep in permanent subjection. A constant and mischievous species of warfare was carried on between the two sides of the straits. 
The Spaniard’s general advantage in this warfare had been so constant, that, especially as the scenes of battle lay within hearing most frequently of the Imperial court, he accordingly obtained high reputation both with the famous old Emperor and with his successors. He had received as a present from these sovereigns two fully equipped gallies, which he disposed of at his pleasure for protecting the coast of Andalusia or cruizing on the Moors, in both of which he was indefatigable. The monarch added to his power in a manner almost equally distinguished by no equivocal mark of favour. A considerable tract of country adjacent to the Commandery was erected into a royal government, and the Commander received the power and privileges attached to the office, which was a great augmentation of authority. 
He lived, like most grandees of Spain, a retired, though active, life. His family consisted of a boy and a girl, his nephew and niece. The former, who was not far from the regular age of chivalry, had gone to Malta, and in favour of his uncle’s merits had there received the honour of Knight, and with it a gift of broad lands, which would have been very satisfactory even if the young man, (which was far from being the case,) should have been strikingly inferior to the rest of his kindred. Excepting this acceptable expedition Don Manuel seldom permitted his nephew to stir from his side. There were of late years the most desirable and amusing lessons, which Don Fran cisco took in company with his pretty cousin under the tuition of a slave, or rather member of the family, called Morayma, captured in battle, and treated in every respect as if she had been really that respected person Donna Angelina’s duenna. Indeed, during the happy years when the children were children, and engaged in the mimic sports of infancy and youth, Francisco’s make-believe plays were always made up by the help of his cousin Angelina. Morayma was no mean performer on the harp, and they shared in chorus and triumphant hymns on occasion. 
The least horse-boy in the castle well knew, that, as Francisco was to subscribe himself and all his own feelings and property to the Order of Malta, so Donna Angelina was engaged at a certain time to enter Our Lady’s Nunnery, where her uncle had fixed her to be a professed nun, and expected great benefit from their prayers. He seemed in no haste to part with her to her pious calling. The children’s

company was peculiarly agreeable to the old man, nor was he in a hurry to deprive himself of such an indulgence. And the Abbess was certain, that it was her interest to give way to the Commander in the mode of introducing his niece to the house in which she presided. She remained, therefore, at the castle of Aldea Bella, and her entrance to the monastic state was spoken of, but no season exactly mentioned when she should begin her noviciate. 
Another person resided in the castle, also a servant of Saint John of Jerusalem, but not of a rank sufficient to entitle him to be numbered among the dignitaries of the Order, as he was that which is called a brother serving at arms, bearing pretty much the same relation in rank to a Knight of the Order that a squire bore to an ordinary knight. It often happened, that such esquires, like the individual in question, attached themselves to some one of influence, but above all of courage and conduct, among the principal Knights and Com manders. Those that did this, like Juan Romegas, at the same time distinguished themselves by their gallantry with unanimous applause upon all sides. But though Romegas had been both loved and favoured, yet at his patron’s retirement to Aldea Bella the door of preferment, so far as concerned the Order, was shut against him. The private estate of Don Manuel was what was principally left open to him, of which he held several of those properties which were peculiarly valuable; yet, being still dependent on one person’s pleasure, the pride of the man was somewhat touched. In the mean time, it was under Romegas that Francisco had been trained up in military accomplishments of every kind, and in those especially then taught to the sea service, so that he was universally stated to have made great progress, considering his years. 
In this situation was the principal castle of Aldea Bella, whither was bound the pursuivant, a college of whom the Grand Master maintained in emulation of other princes, and who carried their messages of peace and war, and all the other official business attend ing upon a herald’s office. 
As they proceeded, the oldest among the fishermen, as if he had bethought himself suddenly, said: “Senhor, bearing the warrant of the Order and the Grand Master, I would, according to my duty and your directions, convey you straight to Aldea Bella, which is situated scarcely a mile distant from our fishing village of the same name. But it strikes me, that we shall not at this hour find the Commander in the walls of the castle itself, but in the Observatory, where he generally resorts at this time of the evening, when the weather promises a fair view on the face of the Mediterranean. But it is right for me to state, and for you to be guided by my assurance, that Don Manuel is very

angry at all who interfere with him, or ask entrance into that place of employment without worthy and important business requires it.” “Spare fear on my account, vassall. My business is such as will excuse my intrusion, even were he in his very chapel.” The fisherman took a better view of the visitor, and muttered to his companion in a dialect which few strangers understood. The person of the acolyth of chivalry was clad in a dress of a cotton manufacture of his own island of Malta, a species of turban worn in some parts of the east preserving his head from the burning sun of the climate, if offensive. He wore a short sabre and a battle-axe, in his cap was a purple feather, and a thick chain of gold hung around his neck bearing the Maltese scutcheon, which was the credence of his office. 
“By Our Lady,” said the Spaniard, but under his breath lest he might give offence, “thou mayst be a Christian; but if ever there was one more like to a heathen Moor, I will incur myself the disgrace that I throw upon thee. But here are we before the Observatory. Methinks thy reception should be worth seeing.” 
While the Spaniard thus spoke, the herald gazed with surprize at the place called the Observatory. It was in fact a building deser ving a second look. At first it appeared only the remnant of a tall square tower, seen at a great distance, and impressing the mind with the hasty and sudden attack and defence which was the system of Spain and Arabia, and all the practices of fight and captivity which, elsewhere discharged even from civil war, still augmented its terrors. Its ruins stood full in the path which had lately conducted the strangers, since their parley had ended. This had led them over a chain of hills of various size, which run along the shore and rise to a considerable but varying and serrated succession of eminences above the sands, while the path itself varied according to the country it went through: now gently winding by the bases of the mountains; now ascending tall peaks and commanding strik ing views of the subject Mediterranean; and now embowering itself in woods which had already begun to assume their leaves, mingling the chequered and beautiful garment of the myrtle and the citrus with other plants which beautify the hills of Spain when summer is approaching. 
At length the path, having conducted the Maltese herald and his guides up a steep ascent of this kind, stopped short before the cliff on which the Commander’s watch tower was situated. It was a rock of some size, and, scarped with the hands so as to leave it apparently inaccessible, formed a mass which had been rendered the pedestal of a tower, of which it was the base. The walls of this edifice, which

in its lower form was square, rose straight on each side from the sides of the precipice. The windows were little, strongly barred with iron, and defended by projections of the building, which they appeared capable of protecting by missiles from within. The upper part of the tower changed from a square to a round form, extending over the angles of the first storey of the building, which the lower or square portion appeared to be. Around the upper storey was a sort of outer battlement, to communicate without or beneath, when those within should wish to hold intercourse, whether for the purpose of peace or war. Two or three windows were remarkable in the upper storey, of larger size than those in the first, furnished on different sides of the tower, both to enlighten the building, and to give the centinels or garrison the power of commanding the dazzling view of the Mediterranean which it presented. Tubes of brass, perhaps the arms of the defenders of the turret, which a small party of musquetry would render altogether impregnable, did not escape a wary examina tion on the part of its present visitants, when the fisherman asked the pursuivant whether he would intimate his arrival at the fortress by voice or by horn; “for,” he added, “the Commander will scarce approve of any one remaining in sight of this watch tower without his presence being made known to him.” 
The pursuivant answered somewhat more haughtily than his qual ity seemed to warrant: “When the Commander receives the orders of his master the Grand Master in council, he must attend the patience of the officer regularly intrusted with them.” 
The fisherman, aware that he would be asked how far he attended to his own orders, and scarce excused by the conduct of the pursuiv ant, prepared to act by his instructions on such occasions. Accord ingly, he wound a species of alarm upon a bugle horn, which echoed fearfully among the cliffs, and startled the wild swine in the neigh bourhood, and the fishing town which was about two miles off. This place had an excellent harbour for small craft where the Com mander’s gallies lay, which was a principal reason why the King presented him with them. Immediately this rude summons was answered by what was then called all along that coast by the name of tocsin, being the general alarm sounded whenever a party of Moors had landed.

T C of Aldea Bella started from a fit of abstracted musing at the rude summons of the horn. He went to a window of the upper storey, threw it open, and exhibited himself on the balcony, a tall grey old man, muscular even amid the vestiges of his age, and bearing the marks of “the hero born in other times”. The only sign distinguishing his rank, was the cross of Malta with its eight points, inscribed on his cloak in scarlet cloth upon black. Something there was of anger and surprise in his features, and the pursuivant, in particular, was in a moment sensible, that he would greatly exceed his commission by talking in a high tone to a person of such import ance in the Order as Don Manuel, and who had lived so many years in the exercise of uncontrouled and solitary authority. When the Commander, accordingly, appeared, the herald Dhulistan saw the propriety of shrinking back in his presence and leaving the task of explanation to the old fisherman, who, knowing the Commander’s admiration of brevity on all occasions, said with a low reverence, “This officer comes from Malta.” 
“With what tidings?” said the Commander, in a deep solemn voice. “Thou art in some sort a voice of the public, young man. Learn not to drown the tidings, which it is necessary that those whom they concern hear; but deliver them briefly and succinctly in as few words as they may be bravely and intelligibly spoken.” 
The pursuivant answered with a reverence, and even the fisherman was aware of the diminished importance of the herald in presence of the Commander of Aldea Bella and his authority, in which he fell so much into the background. His voice had a tremulous sound, and his bearing was highly deferential while he declared his errand: “I am grieved to announce to your Reverence, that an instant and furious invasion of Malta is threatened by the force of the whole Turkish empire, with the purpose of destroying the Convent and driving it from the island for ever.” 
“You have said enough, my friend, in informing me that the Moors are expected to come to attack Malta. We know sufficient of the tender mercies of the infidels to enable us to comprehend their intents. But their hand has been repeatedly restrained formerly. For

the rest, friend Herald, I presume you come to intimate the Grand Master’s pleasure, that I should, as usual, repair in person to the Convent, with such troops as I can supply by the revenue of this Commandery, and my own exertions among my friends.” 
The herald drew him into an attitude of solemnity—but the Com mander proceeded without giving him leave to make the speech which he had commenced, saying, “I will spare the brethren the trouble of telling to me my duty on this occasion, or you of repeating to me what, be it said without offence, is better known to me than to you, and even to the greater part of my young brethren. I entreat you to forgive me, Sir Herald. I am aware the Order, like other powers of Europe, have entrusted of late the management of the relations with private persons or foreign states to diplomatists of your charac ter. I do not approve entirely of this new fashion, and will transmit my forces instantly to Malta with my own list of them. The men who shall set sail to assist in the siege shall amount to every individual fit for service within my Commandery, whether with head or hand, the money to each sequin I can call my own. I hope also to lead a right royal succour from the hands of the King of Spain, who honours me with no common share of his friendship; I will throw myself at his feet and venture to recommend the affairs of the Order to his protec tion as the most powerful barrier against the Moors, who are such plagues to his Majesty’s dominions in the Mediterranean sea. My own House, one which, I may presume to say, is of no mean name, has only to consult its well-known reputation by acting as it has done upon former occasions. In short, the extent of my assistance will, according to my duty, be only bounded by my means, which will comprehend the whole of my capacity of every kind.” 
“My Lord,” replied the pursuivant humbly, “no one dependant on the Maltese Order could entertain a doubt, that your Lordship would upon this occasion, as on every other of the same kind, show a brilliant example to the body of whom you are a burning and shining light. The summons is, you know, a matter of routine, sent therefore to every one indifferently.” 
“It is not, however, for a gownsman such as thou art to measure forth my duties to the Order, in the first ranks of which I have the honour to sit, and the first duties of which I have been called upon to discharge.” 
“It is my duty, however, to mention,” said the pursuivant, taking care to depress his voice and manner, “that, besides my general commission, I have it in charge to hand a copy of certain intelligence received from a good friend to the Order, who was present at the council of the infidel Sultaun and ventured to make a copy of what

passed, to which the Grand Master wishes you to give your considera tion. He requires your attention to this paper, as containing the arguments which weigh with the present Sultaun and those advisers, whether in recommending them or dissuading them from their pre sent undertaking, which derives so little encouragement from their attempt upon Gozo and Malta.” 
“I will, doubtless,” said Don Manuel, “consider and reply to what ever comes from my venerable brother the Grand Master, and am no ways affronted at receiving the communication from you, young man, being aware of the trust now reposed in you and your brethren; though I must own the rank is something new in the Order, and the Knights were used to executing it themselves. Give me leave to observe to you, that you will keep silence on any thing which was recommended to my own ear until we attain your presence at the castle of Aldea Bella, whither I must now go myself and invite you to accompany me as a guest for the evening, and where I can hear you discourse at leisure.” 
As Don Manuel spoke, he vanished from the battlements of the tower where they had found him, and issued from a private door, closed on the inside with a portcullis, which rose or fell by the action of a windlass in the upper storey, and another door which was not visible from the exterior. 
A tall, dark, severe-looking man, who had something the aspect of Don Manuel himself, having a large silver chain around his neck, accompanied him from the tower in which he had borne him com pany. A menial shut the private doors of the turret when they had left it, and retired, apparently to tenant the building which its owner had forsaken. The party of Maltese sailors, and the pursuivant whom they had brought to the coast, with the fishermen who received such orders, followed at various distances, while the Commander walked first of the party, and his squire Juan Romegas close in company with the pursuivant, the latter occasionally replying to questions respecting the state of affairs at Malta—the advancement of the fortifications, many of which were new, and the various preparations for receiving the enemy; to all which he gave suitable answers. 
They now came in sight of the castle of Aldea Bella, which crowned a rocky mountain, and was defended with surrounding walls, which, after the custom of the middle ages, were garnished with round and square turrets. The gate of the castle, to which the road gave access, had the usual defences of a barbican and drawbridge, or outwork with a portcullis; the inmates had already, perhaps owing to the alarm bell, shut a principal part of its defences. As the strangers to whom we have introduced our readers approached the entrance of

the castle, across the verge of what might be called in modern phrase the glacis, or space left open to afford cover for the defences, another little party was seen, which had probably been engaged in the chase, for half a dozen of them were on horseback, and armed with firearms and lances, and the principal person was remarkably well mounted. Two servants bore forwards the spoil of the day, an immense wild boar of large size. The appearance of the youth, even at this first sight, was necessarily set down as distinguished, and especially— what could not escape notice—his features, covered by the half rustic cap worn by his countrymen, which shrouded the dark locks of his country, and shaded what his uncle’s acquaintances well knew to be as striking a resemblance as a young man can present to an old one. 
The Commander moderated his pace when he saw the hunting party. “There,” he said, “returns my nephew from the chace.” So saying, he slackened the rein of his horse, while Don Francisco at the same time put his steed into the active rapid motion of a rider of the Spanish jennet when, slightly urging his barb, he designs to prevent a superior from waiting him. As the young man fell into his train, the Commander said, “Nephew, I did not look for your being this day, of all others, late, during the time when the signal was ringing for intimating the arrival of these Moorish infidels.” 
“Believe me, noble Sir,” answered the cavalier, “this piece of game, (pointing to the boar,) has led us a dance as far as from the castle to the Morisco haven, and at that distance I was when we roused him out of the caves. I blush to say, that when he stood on his defence, I did not at first heed the tocsin, but the boar did not delay half an hour in consenting to accompany our retreat to the castle of Vilheyna, where I lost no time to satisfy the clamours of the alarm bell.” 
“I am happy that it is so,” said his uncle; “Morayma and the cooks will need you, for a brigantine from Malta has arrived with a messenger, one of those heralds whom the Knights of Malta have now taken into their service, and whom we must treat in complaisance to their new importance.” 
This young official’s ideas of good breeding urged him to say a sort of commonplace, about his waiving the idea of occasioning any alteration of entertainment on his account. Don Manuel replied in a dry tone, which showed how little the compliment was regarded, that his House would have fallen back in the world, when he should discern, that he had encountered a moment’s thought in order to provide entertainment for such as him, over and above other inmates of his family. The pursuivant blushed much at this rebuke, and pru dently resolved not to attempt any more on the acquaintance of this

haughty person, who had in no shape received him with that consid eration which the young man’s vanity expected. 
As they came forward, the walls of the castle appeared to be manned, and when they entered the gate they observed that, while that which gave access to the fort was locked and guarded, a number of workmen, sailors, and slaves were engaged in transmitting stores, ammunition, soldiers, and arms to the Commander’s gallies, which lay about a mile distant at the fishing town, where they were in the act of preparing instantly for sea. 
Through this busy scene they walked into the hall, and, the Com mander having taken his leave for a short space, the herald was committed to the squire Romegas while Don Manuel was engaged with various matters. Romegas appeared to understand it as his lord’s pleasure that he should occupy the pursuivant with conversation, as being a task which seemed rather too low for engaging himself. 
The discourse of the two—one a person bred up to war, and the other a man whose thoughts had been chiefly turned into the same channel—concentrated on the various improvements made upon the fortifications of Malta since the grand attack of the Moors under the leader called Piali, or the Capitan Pacha as he was known at the Porte; in which their best troops and commanders were employed, and came off with very little which approached the magnificent success anti cipated, hardly inferior to that which had altogether banished the Knights from the Island of Rhodes, once the seat of their power. 
In the course of this conversation, Romegas said to the Maltese: “Although the Commander is doubtless desirous accurately to recol lect what happened on the late occasion, it is yet well to take notice, that, providing it is conveyed with sufficient deference, he will be obliged to you for it; less as admonition, which we do not hold as becoming our relative situation in the Order, but with the manner of a dutiful servant, suggesting with humility an advice which I would hardly counsel you to be rash enough to prefer in the bolder character of a friend.” 
The herald listened attentively and said: “I might reply, Signor Romegas, that in other courts in Europe the heralds are honoured when they have taken their degrees in a college of eminence; but so great is my esteem for the Order of Malta, and so much am I obliged to defer to those who are in proper phrase my masters, that my mode of addressing them shall be dictated by their ideas of what is proper, nor will I allow myself to keep silent any intelligence.” 
“Take notice if I give you a hint to arise after the supper is with drawn, and it will serve as a signal to you to remain for an audience with the Commander, which would not have been so long delayed

if, at your first introduction, you had entirely suited his humour.” The sound of a bell was heard in the large hall where they were. Servants entered, bearing a plentiful supper, which they placed on a table capable of accommodating nearly fifty people. But it had separ ate marks of cadency, as heralds themselves termed them, which arranged the precedency. The guests of the lowest order were officers of low rank and other persons of inferior condition; the rest were considerable officers of the Commander’s domestic establishment; and the arrangement of the salt-cellar directed them in the place at the table which it was proper for each to assume. The Commander and his nephew and niece, the three chief dignitaries of the family, occupied by themselves a small cross table at the top of the room, of an elevation considerably raised. Those in general accounted as respectable formed the next group—the pursuivant with his domestics, and Romegas and Morayma, the principal domestics of Don Manuel’s household. The various ranks conversed together as they were placed at supper, so far as they could, with a certain degree of independence of the break, which was in general submitted to. At length, after the discussion had turned for some time upon the subject of the approaching descent of the Moors, and the con sequences which it threatened, Don Manuel, who mixed occasionally in the conversation, said, with a tone which left no difficulty to com prehend his inference: “Romegas—you who have been often con sulted in the affairs of the Order—I cannot dispense with taking your opinion on subjects whereon this pursuivant has spoken. The rest except thou and he will, therefore, leave the room, and each in his different sphere take care to prepare the gallies for Malta to launch with the break of day.” 
All arose, having first pledged the lord of the castle in a grace cup, as it was called, while they prepared, with as little noise or disturbance as possible, to leave the apartment. Morayma, during the meal, had paid immediate attention to her pupil Angelina, who with one or two young persons who might rank as her companions, escaped without occasioning much notice being attracted to a degree of distress, which she certainly sustained, but which remained unobserved among the crowd. 
“I ought myself to have fought,” said Don Manuel, “at the national conflict of the Moors and Christians, but for the Emperor ordering me to serve in his German Guards, which to my great sorrow detained me absent from that most famous engagement. I have indeed pos sessed myself of most that I have missed seeing with my own eyes, and shall hold you thanked if you can give me the history of that second attack upon Malta, and Gozo its sister island, in which, as I

The pursuivant glanced his look to Romegas, and, inferring from the answer that his time for speaking was come, he turned toward the Commander with an air of modest intelligence. 
“It would be unnecessary to examine the original quarrels between the Moors and Christians, founded as they are upon the communica tions which these infidels have made of the divine law revealed to themselves, in opposition to what is published to the Christians by that of Christ; the desire of conquest which each nation fulfilled at the expence of the other; and the permission to conquer and enslave those infidels who preferred sparing and ransoming Christians to slaughtering them and converting them, perhaps till the Christian Knights were expelled from that which they call the Holy Land. They made war upon a different principle from other nations, and with a view more strongly turned towards the religious creed of each other than in modern states. 
“The Sultaun, incensed at the principles assumed, declared those whom their assurance termed the believers his enemies, and he protested—nay swore—their utter destruction. With this view he assembled large forces. He formed the siege of Rhodes with two hundred thousand Moors and upwards of ninety-four mines, and, after many reverses, at length obliged the besieged to surrender the fortifications upon terms which, considering the great inequality, could not be considered as surprising; but the Knights were obliged to give up the island on conditions, and in this first step to his ven geance on the Order of Malta the Sultaun had great hope, that he already commenced his plan of wiping so peculiar a body from the face of the world. 
“The Emperor Charles V prepared to remedy their fortune, some say for the Knights themselves, and others that he found his own interest in the certainty of securing a defensible island nigh in the middle of his own dominions.” 
“Hold thy peace, Sirrah!” said Don Manuel, interrupting the orator. “It is not for such as thee to estimate the motives of the noble Emperor’s liberality, which it is your duty as a servant of the Order to assign to as firm a foundation as you conceive possible.” 
“I am contented that you will affirm what you think on the subject, and am myself willing to ascertain the motive after you have dictated.” “Silence, sir!” said the Commander. “Enough that, by the

Emperor’s gift, we have become lords of an island called Malta, and another called Gozo, bare rocks reaching the very surface, but cut with a number of complicated pieces of deep standing water. They enlarged these pieces of water, and adapted for the security of the shipping which belonged to the Order, and employed themselves in improving their naval force and checking the Turkish commerce in every quarter; in particular upon one occasion about a year ago, which we had reason to know highly offended the Grand Seignior.” 
“In their peculiar mode of engaging themselves to teach the Sul taun, that a great prince had also a risk in appearing to enter into trade, they captured a ship whose expences were reckoned at great sums affixed to the names of his favourites; to which persons’ names were added those of the Kislar Aga of the women, who was, of course, no small favourite. Neither was a vessel which went to sea so richly loaded, better cared for in point of safety. Five hundred selected Janizaries manned the higher of the main decks in case of assault, and the artillery with which the vessel was furnished amounted to the extent of two hundred brass cannon. A Rais, or Capitan of the sea, was named as her commander. Accordingly, the hopes of the Sultaun were in every particular raised. The ship and cargo was made prisoner, the Capitan was mortally wounded, the great part of the troops of Janizaries were killed, and the seamen consigned to the gallies of the Knights. The Odalisques, or beauties of the Seraglio, were extremely provoked and offended to find that they did it so in so simple a manner, without being for some time able to obtain the least redress from the imperial lover, whose power they imagined to reach everywhere; and, whatever was noticed by others, there is no doubt but their injury was in reality felt by the Sultaun as a severe personal affront, suffered, as he was ashamed to think, at the hands of the Knights of Malta—men who lived by a species of piracy, and without any of the more bold pretences for encroaching upon his own property—but he was unable to know how to prevent them from endangering it. 
“This adventure made a great deal of noise, and a clerk preached upon the same plundering of the Egyptians by the Israelites, which was approved as doing a service to the Deity and reducing the strength of his enemies.” 
“Go on,” said the Commander, in a tone something interested; “you talk well, it must be owned.” 
“My inferiority of station permits me to attempt nothing else.” The official’s modest reply had a good effect, suiting the proud Commander’s opinion of their different situations, and he proceeded thus: “Indeed, both these great nations, from the dissimilarity of

their climate and their government, have a perpetual fund of debates and discrepancies, which lead to their not understanding each other. For example, the Moor and his countrymen scarce offer, either by their law or religion, a check to the power of the Sultaun. His authority in the state is everything, for his will is a complete law, and all is of little consequence that has any other source than the Grand Seig nior’s will. The Easterns, therefore, remain in their power; only, as mere men, they begin at length to shake the cup which they ought, out of regard to their subjects and to themselves, to bear with a steady hand. There is a certain degree of mismanagement and oppression, which, in theory, many states and kingdoms affect to bear; but, in practice, open tyranny, far from being accepted without resistance by any people of the East, is in all their insurrections openly resisted as much so as in other countries, where a rebellion in defence of insulted rights is accounted on the part of the subject a just vindication of his prerogatives. 
“The consequence is, that the people, or the greater number of them, are inclined to be of the Sultaun’s opinion in this matter of the siege of Malta; which is, that he only vindicates his own honour, and punishes a hive of robbers, whom he has suffered to subsist too long in a part of his dominions where he is peculiarly liable to suffer by the attacks. Several experienced veterans and leaders of the Pacha’s forces, who enjoy in the provinces which they command a species of slaving independence, have been consulted by the Sul taun touching their willingness to undertake this task. 
“But the men of greatest talents, and who might think themselves most happy in so honourable and powerful a commonwealth, yet see, that if they consent, and should the siege proceed with so much slaughter as that of Rhodes, it would be liable to bring the army which they commanded upon themselves instead of the enemy, and make their peace with the Janizaries at the expence of their prince. Thus Mustapha Pacha, now ruler of Egypt, does not desire this perilous employment, and perhaps, sooner than accept it, would take the risk of starting into rebellion. Accordingly, I can show to your Lordship some of the arguments which he has used towards the Sultaun, urging him to postpone his attack upon the Order; for that is as far as he pretends to carry his opposition to Soliman’s personal inclination. 
“Your Lordship is aware, that the existence of so many Grecians in the Sultaun’s dominions, some of which have great importance in the empire, secures a wealthy Order like that of Malta with means of access to such information as those of that religion, or at least some of them, may possess; nor have we been less able to ascertain their

opinions, and the intrigues which we allude to as chancing in the invasion of this Sultaun Soliman’s forces, may, according to the opinion of some of his wisest counsellors, enable us to form an idea what we are to expect from its consequence when it is tried upon a still higher scale.” 
“It will be highly agreeable to me,” answered Don Manuel, “to find, that our most reverend Grand Master has the address of most of his forefathers in maintaining so political and perfect a corres pondence with those in or around our bitterest enemies’ counsels, whose purpose it now concerns us to understand—Proceed, Sir.” 
The herald pursued his account of the Turkish politics of which they had gained information: “During the spring of 15— we received intelligence, that the Sultaun, on various occasions, and in a different tone of feeling, talked over the expedition with those he wished to place at the head of it; and at length summoned those on whose opinions he most relied, to meet him in the open country near Con stantinople, with their hawks and other implements of sport, under pretence of a great consultation or council of their nation, which was always a custom of the Turks, although each exactly understood how far he was to think himself permitted to urge his personal advice upon the ear of Soliman. 
“The meeting had all the rich appearance of Turkish officers dressed in their gayest habits, and the eclat from the splendid appear ance of guards in their brilliant costume securing the hunt, and cutting down, without mercy or questions asked, such persons as presented themselves without having an invitation. But though the object was sport, yet, except some gazelles or antelopes which they started by accident, little attention seemed paid by the counsellors whose advice was most desired by their Sovereign. This chosen body stood in a woody valley, save such as the Sultaun desired to remain on horseback for the sake of keeping him company. When the opinion of one counsellor was delivered, Soliman called another to follow for a riding on the field, and seldom failed, by adroit questions, to endeavour to gain his sentiments of his colleagues’ opinions. In this way the counsellors delivered their different verdicts, while the Sul taun endeavoured, as well as he could, to make their advice recom mend war of extermination against the Maltese. Mustapha Pacha’s opinion, above all able, had also the remarkable circumstance of being directly contradictory of the favourite campaign of Soliman. The Christian Knights, he said, were the flower of their different families, and, from the mere blood which they had within their veins, were ashamed as much to yield before the enemies of their faith and country, as to commit any other act dishonourable to their reputation.

“The Capitan Pacha himself was next called to deliver his opinion. The Pacha Piali, much esteemed at the period, gained great attention to his opinion from the largeness of his size as a man, a circumstance to which a crowd, whether in a privy council or elsewhere, is seldom indifferent. Thinking, it was presumed, that he was secure of the Sultaun Soliman, he talked as if surprized that the Pacha of Egypt had expressed himself disrespectfully to Allah and his prophet in believing that, in a world guided by them, a preponderant weight should be willingly assigned to those Christians to whom it be as easy for these rulers of the religion to say, ‘Be ye second in the scale of conquest to those whose worship is agreeable to me.’ A speech to this purpose was received with applause; Soliman especially seemed, in fact, to approve an argument whose approach appeared to be comprehended by the good enthusiastic Moslemah, who found it difficult to allow, that the prophet and their deity would forsake the heir of the true believers, if he fought with an energy sufficient to merit victory from heaven. 
“The Sultaun looked at Mustapha of Egypt when Piali made the observation, which was plainly applied to the argument which he had made use of, and from which he was in no respect inclined to retreat. A placid and undisturbed smile hung on his features as he replied: ‘I am,’ he said ‘an old man; and though I believe most devoutly whatever is said in the blessed Koran, yet I have been so stupid as never to understand the constant interferences of moral evil, when for instance the true believer is not found equal in strength or courage, or at least in success in combat. Doubtless the Supreme Being could have so arranged the fate of battle, that it should always follow the banners of those who received his prophet whom he sent to Mecca. The fact is doubtless, however, that he hath not pleased to do so; and after the death of the prophet and his immediate followers, who fulfilled their mission by way of miracles, we do not find such an uninterrupted current of good as to fulfil our tide of conquest faster than might have been expected from the comparison of the two nations in life. The Greeks whom we first encountered in these plains, which then belonged to them, were a people plunged in luxury and its consequences, and no match for the Saracens, a hardy and valiant people, by whose arms they were subdued. These Christians came upon us out of the zeal which they professed for the holy places, as they called those of Palestine, and where they at immense loss finally erected a kingdom, which after various events succeeded for many years. There can be no doubt, that these eastern Christians quarrelled among themselves, and from being one of the bravest and most enthusiastic people who ever lived, became rather

unequal to the Turks, at least in their own possessions of the west. But their knowledge increased in the same proportion. It pleased heaven, that many of them made wonderful advances in the art of navigating vessels, others in chemistry, others in fortification and in various sciences; from which they have become a people so well informed as to entitle me to expect great things in any war which should be now waged against them.’ 
“‘The things which we hear from our father Mustapha,’ said the Sultaun, ‘are like to the harvest which cometh after many days when food is demanded. One thing I would wish to ask him, which I am too young to have seen with my own eyes. I am told of a great change having taken place among the Franks, subverting the very principles on which their ancestors acted, and which induced men to undertake these adventures from love of a lady, or, as they term her, a mistress, whom they held to rule as a queen over them, and to be the object of all the renown they could acquire, and worshipped and obeyed in every respect nigh to a goddess. Such was the system of Melec Ric and all the other champions mentioned among the Franks in our annals, with whose name the Arabian still threatens his horse as he starts in the desert.’ 
“‘May I speak before the King,’ said the old Pacha, ‘and yet live —Unquestionably the great change of principle has taken place among our enemies, and unquestionably they are now unequal to some of the gigantic achievements which were practised by their forefathers. But in other respects they press forwards in knowledge and discovery with the same eagerness and the same unyielding pas sion which their fathers fixed upon fame or beauty.’ 
“‘Tell me then, wise vizier—what motives do they now find for exerting their chivalry, as they call it, which formerly had for its object fair women and warlike renown?’ 
“‘Gold,” replied Mustapha, ‘is the most general acquisition sub stituted for those powerful impulses. The love of distinction also in his own profession or pursuit, often gives success to the studies of an attentive man. What should I say more? The Moslem forms to himself a lively picture of the prophet’s paradise, which, after all, is only compounded of objects affording pleasure to our senses, while the Franks, on the contrary, pursue knowledge both from the pleasure of acquiring it and the distinction which it gives, and the wealth with which their countrymen are willing to reward excellence of almost any description.’ 
“Here the Sultaun cracked his whip as a sign that the council was broken up, when two or three slaves came riding up, who announced that Dragut, called by the Sultaun the Viceroy of Algiers, had just

arrived. He came like a falcon with his prey in his clutch, for he had been delayed from the council by the necessity of defending Goletta and Tunis against an insurrection of the citizens commanded by Zamet, a son of Kayradin Barbarossa. This man, universally con sidered, the corsair caused to be impaled at the stern of his vessel. 
“‘That man,’ said the Sultaun, ‘owed me gratitude of a different kind, yet I should have pardoned him for the sake of his father.’ “‘I thought so,’ answered the Viceroy, ‘but I think I have secured him against again abusing your Highness’s clemency. Yet I reserved to you the privilege of examining him in private, if you so desired, for he asked the favour this morning to be turned from the broad sunshine.’ 
“‘Let two mutes presently dispatch the villain, and do you, most faithful Dragut, come by my rein. I never wasted your advice respect ing these Christians.’ 
“The Sultaun accordingly held a long conversation with Dragut, of whom he the more approved as he himself set the example of conquering the Christian Knights, in which he was the constant adviser. 
“After this important council, the Sultaun appointed Mustapha of Egypt his commander by land, as a favourite of the soldiers, and the Capitan Pacha as his equal. But, probably to insure the expedition being carried on with proper energy, they were commanded to take no measures in the siege without the consent of Dragut, whose fame in arms procured him this high preferment, although it was commonly ascribed to his zeal in behalf of the expedition. As he went to Algiers to make up his forces, he was not present at Malta when the other two generals rendezvoused there with the great fleet. 
“The Capitan Pacha Piali was the first to throw himself ashore to reconnoitre, and, using his galley to enter the lake which constitutes the principal harbour, he received a fire from an ambuscade, which did his men extreme damage, and gave him no opportunity of revenge. He was soon after joined by Mustapha, who landed with a body of troops to lay waste the country and join his observations to those of his colleague. They could discover a large lagoon, with deep water, which was traversed by various pieces of dry land like the fingers of the human hand when stretched out. These divided the harbour, which was called the Bourg, into several accommodations of the same sort for the different kinds of shipping. Besides various fortifica tions situated to protect this harbour, there was a species of citadel erected for its protection on the southern side, very powerfully mounted with cannon, and requiring a regular siege, which was ren dered extremely difficult by the soil not lying above the rock more

than two or three inches thick, nor consequently admitting of opening trenches against the citadel, or taking any other means of reducing it by the common rules of art. 
“Besides this fortified place, which had been erected since the Knights became masters of Malta, the islands of Malta and Gozo had a good many rude old-fashioned towers, and two small towns which were slightly fortified, and to which the inhabitants of the islands were withdrawn for protection while the Turks remained ashore on the islands, during which time they plundered the country unmercifully, and drove off the wives and families into captivity, a species of plunder of which these barbarians are extremely greedy. Villegagnon, a gallant French Knight, obtained permission to throw himself into La Citta Vecchia, and inspired so much spirit in them, that an officer of the Order, who resided in Sicily, forwarded a messenger with a letter which announced the speedy relief of the siege by the famous Doria, who was stated to have collected a great army with that purpose. 
“A council of war was held on Dragut’s arrival, to consult what was to be done. Mustapha Pacha and the Capitan Pacha, with Dragut and two or three others whom they had received instructions to add to their council of war, were here accordingly formally convened. 
“‘Methinks,’ said Mustapha, ‘I should like to know from someone who is able to tell me assuredly, of what material yonder strong bulwark is composed, which seems intended for protection of the citadel.’ 
“‘Well, I can tell you that,’ replied a general called Uluchialy, ‘since I myself, when a slave at Malta, laboured at piling together trunks of trees and huge rocks as materials of yonder bulwark, and this was my laborious engagement for more than twelve months.’ 
“‘Yes,’ said the Pacha of Egypt, ‘and winter will be come again before you pull it down in the same manner. Truly, I would be surprised if a work which is built with so much solidity were to be demolished sooner. The numbers of small pennons or flags mark the presence of the Knights, who have assembled to the Convent, as they call their present dwelling; and I think anyone who hath known them will agree, that a complete conquest over these proud men would be the chief object of the Grand Seignior. But who shall recommend it in the time which is left?’ 
“Piali looked eagerly at the fortifications, but the old Pacha was too securely grounded on what he saw; and Piali, though desirous of recommending a siege, was reduced to admit that such, in the circum stances, would be extremely perilous. 
“Their next subject of consideration was an intercepted letter con

cerning the relief said to be destined for Malta under command of Doria. ‘Can it be a moment doubted, that the armament will arrive to relieve the siege just when their resistance is weakening? The consequences I will not pretend to anticipate, but surely he will estimate them rightly who shall suppose us to be obliged to leave behind us whatever tents, provisions, and besieging artillery we have put ashore, and sacrifice them as lost; and well if we can purchase at that price the safety of the army.’ 
“Piali felt his opinion so strongly thwarted, that, in spite of the general veneration entertained for Mustapha by the Turkish army, his manner of speaking plainly intimated his displeasure with the old Pacha for giving up the siege to which he looked as a source of splendour for himself. 
“‘We have reason to think,’ said Mustapha in reply to him, ‘there is only one Knight of the Order within the walls of Gozo, and he an old Spaniard, distinguished at no time in arms, but perhaps rather by what is very uncommon among this institution, who are of different nations and noted for the eager emulation with which they enter on in defiance of each other. Far from doing so, he has even already sent terms on which he offers to surrender the town and all the inhabitants, that we ought to reserve carefully for the booty of our common soldier, who has suffered considerable hardships in this campaign without any recompence except these captives of Gozo; whom if we dismiss, it will be by our own mere pleasing to do so without anything this way constraining us.’ 
“The Pacha Mustapha, having had the captives and spoil and plunder of Gozo assigned to a part of the army which was under his own special command, was not willing to admit the load of any unpopularity by a private bargain which the besieged had by no means deserved by their military courage. The Spaniard who acted so unlike a Castilian, had desired that fifty of the first distinction in the town should be set free along with him. But the Turks, in contempt of his poltroonery, made him assist in carrying his own goods down from his house in the town to the vessel on which they lodged them. In the next place, instead of allowing the fifty notables selected out of the inhabitants to be chosen by any rule of the commandant, who understood the doing so as his privilege, the barbarians selected fifty of the old men, who were of course the least valuable captives. Alto gether the spoil amounted to about seven thousand slaves, male and female, out of that single island. 
“There are many poems and songs in which the dastardly conduct of the unworthy Spaniard is held up to execration. Another story is also recorded by some native poet. On learning that his wife and two

He seized a dagger, with which he poniarded his wife and children; then with two musquets marched out and shot two Turks of distinction; and, his heat of rage not yet passed, threw himself among the multitude of infidels and died fight ing bravely.” 
When the herald of the Order had made an end, the Commander spoke, after he had been silent for some time, as if reflecting upon what he had heard. “Young man,” he said, “although I am one of those who think that your duty could be better performed as usual by the young Knights themselves, yet I must allow, that, with one exception, you have delivered your message with simplicity and mod esty. Know, however, that you have taken too much liberty in passing your judgement on the honour of a noble Spanish cavalier in perform ance of his duty; and I will enquire at my ancient brethren what ground exists for the scandal which you have ventured to give birth to, as being likely an invention of some malicious enemy to the gener ous nation of whose actions you are not capable to be a just estimator; and but for the novelty of your office, I should hardly have thought myself entitled to have passed it over.” 
“Let me endure your indignation as a calumniator, if I have spoken a word which is not delivered to me for your information by the Grand Master himself, who is most desirous that you especially shall stand fully possessed of the views of the Turkish Captains on this important occasion.” 
“Proceed, sir pursuivant,” said the Commander, “if you have any thing further to state which appears to concern your mission;” and the pursuivant accordingly resumed his conversation. 
“Having gone,” he said, “through the particulars of the sacking, it becomes me to be silent, for it would be indecent to mention the drunken revels of the corsair Dragut, or to talk of his boasting of his exploits, either at Algiers or elsewhere, or the threats which he utters against the province of Spain which you inhabit, providing he does not meet with you at the siege of Malta.”

—whose earnest wish it obviously was to prosecute the destruction of Malta, as formerly of Rhodes—infested the whole extent of the Ottoman empire, and maintained the warmest feuds in every quarter, from the rude Janizary over his meal, to the unhappy galley slave when suffered for an instant to repose from his oar. The arguments of Piali or of Mustapha Pacha were revived, and it was urged on both sides of the dispute, that the campaign of Gozo was so conducted as to cost the Turkish commander, Sinan Pacha, the favour of the Sultaun, who by no means held his expectations answered, or the expence of his expedition repaid, by the plunder of a miserable fishing island. 
Still, however, a great prey had been carried off into captivity; and if Sinan had incurred the censure of the prince, the soldiery made songs in his praise, and anticipated his being put at the head of the next Maltese expedition. This was not quite consistent with his not being named in the preparations which were now making on a scale still more extensive than the former, and in which Mustapha Pacha, in spite of every excuse which he could allege, was forced to act as Commander in Chief; Dragut and Piali, and other leaders scarce less celebrated, being named under him as lieutenants general. Thus, the task of conquering Malta was finally entrusted to him whose judgement had formerly subdued Rhodes, which was what the soldiers had long desired to see. Soliman himself attended the expedition to take the command, if it should be necessary, and by his personal presence vindicate his own share of the honour to be acquired, and see that neither Mustapha, nor any of his other satraps, gathered a leaf of laurel or acquired any reputation which ought rightfully to fall to the share of their master. Such was the explanation placed by those who had best access to know upon the preparations made by Soliman for the Maltese campaign, and the provisions were upon a scale which argued how much the young prince had his heart on its ultimate success. 
We have detailed at some length the information which the Grand Master had communicated to the Order respecting the preparations made for overpowering it—details which were heard at leisure, and with a calm steadiness, by the veteran Commander Don Manuel de Vilheyna. 
“You have heard, my friends,” said he, “what an attempt the young infidel has cut out to himself, being nothing less than the same which so many years since they brought against Rhodes; and we defend ourselves in the power of the same blessed sign in which our fathers were believers and found their rescue. Touching earthly might, we are loth to compare ourselves to our fathers, who were great warriors;

but we have been sworn, as they were, to advance the cross, were it with the dearest blood in our body. We, therefore, stand as much entitled to hope a blessing from Providence as our fathers in their time; and in such hope, and not in the vain confidence of earthly glory or chivalry, we buckle on our armour in the name of Him whom these heathens have denied and set at defiance. 
“And touching the summons of the Grand Master to myself, his unworthy brother, the morning shall not sooner break than the two gallies, which, by the Emperor’s commission, I have quartered in the seaport of Aldea Bella, shall set sail with every creature on board over whom nature and fortune give me any authority, placed under the command of my cousin Francisco and my squire whom I have made known. To whatever of treasure I have collected, and to the riches of the Commandery, I renounce all personal claim. So soon as the Order needs it, its right revives in whatever a Knight of the Order possesses, and it shall be ceded without loss of time, overjoyed that these old eyes shall see what I have been able to save for this hour of need honourably brought to the service for which it is faith fully destined. Having dispatched without loss of time such vessels for transporting troops, stores, ammunition, and the like, I must yet absent myself for two or three days, till I throw myself at the Emperor’s feet, and implore him in this emergency to show himself the same friend to the Order of Malta which his predecessors of the House of Austria have ever proved themselves, to their own immortal fame, and to the inexpressible benefit of Christendom. 
“We will now,” he concluded, “break up our rude festival, for those who set sail to-morrow have but little time to prepare them selves. One word more: in answer to our neighbour Dragut, who calls himself Viceroy of Algiers, and is pleased to threaten me with his personal vengeance, I will take care he is reminded that there never was a Knight of the Order who either loved or feared him, and that the present Don Manuel wears still the same sword which cleft Dragut’s helm in the siege of Goletta so many years since; and, as he makes me the theme of his empty drunken valour, I hope at our next meeting to make him stoop like an abject. Carouse me one bumper, as befitting men who exchange their paternal seats to go where their duty calls them, and may arrive at the Cloister of Malta in time enough to show that the infidels lie, who pretend our chivalry is degenerated from that which astonished Europe and made Asia tremble during the time of our fathers; and here, my friends, is to the health of the Christian soldiers who shall cram the lie down the false throat of him who maintains it.”

which the Spaniards are in the habit of expressing their sentiments. The pursuivant and his attendants took their leave to prepare for their return to Malta with sunrise, in order to announce the ready zeal with which their summons had been received by Don Manuel, and the succours which he had advanced towards the Convent of Malta; with the assurance, that they would in the morning commence their journey, and offering the assistance of the galley in which they had come to Andalusia, for conveying to the island some part of the help which the Commander was about to render thither from his castle. This was accepted, and gave occasion to a few compliments between Don Manuel and the herald. 
There was another part of the company whose grief might have rendered the separation of the members of whom it consisted some what more clamorous, and whom, notwithstanding their apparent stoicism, we must not dismiss without some notice. One of these was the tall and fine-looking woman Morayma, a certain way advanced in life, who had for several years resided in the house of the Commander by way of housekeeper, but in fact whose principal charge there was, and had long been, paying some attention to the education of the elegant, dark-haired, bright-eyed young lady, daughter of the deceased brother of the Commander, with whom she resided. Don Manuel, when he first invited his niece Angelina to live in the castle of Aldea Bella, had no intention it should be the permanent place of her residence. But the child was beautiful and winning, and gradually got about her uncle’s heart, so that he post poned at least, if he did not alter, his original purpose concerning her. Don Manuel designed to have devoted the child to a religious life and placed her with a suitable dowry at a convent dedicated to the Virgin, of which her uncle’s family had in former times been the founders. It was accordingly agreed, that the Lady Angelina should enter the convent as soon as she had passed her tenth year; and in the meantime she remained under the charge of Morayma, who was a Morisco woman of great accomplishment, a native of Spain, but who in an insurrection of her countrymen had become the captive of Don Manuel and served him in a manner which seemed acceptable to all, having been remarkably capable of giving instructions in the female accomplishments of her time and country. Winter succeeded summer, and summer in its turn again clothed the shores of Andalusia in its variegated robe of leaves, and the castle of Vilheyna and Aldea Bella held the same inhabitants. Not one of them, more especially Angelina herself, talked of a period at which the castle was to be exchanged for the convent which was by all considered as her natural and certain destination.

Nor did the feelings of the little lady revolt against the lot which her destiny seemed to have assigned her, for she loved her uncle, and the more that the gravity and occasional sternness of his temper did not prevent her being a favourite with him, and his being willing to grant her any gratification in his power. She often employed this influence in behalf of such domestics and slaves as had incurred punishment, and occasionally subdued Don Manuel’s harsher deter mination respecting them. But the idea of mourning for a separation from her ancient relative never occurred to her imagination. They would follow their natural duties, and he in war, she in the convent, would find their separate and peculiar avocations. 
But there was another individual with whom parting was to be more painful, although Angelina had not anticipated the age when this feeling was to awaken in its strength. Her cousin Francisco had, from her earliest childhood, been the intimate companion of her studies and her amusements; and unless previous measures were taken for their ultimate separation—a precaution which their uncle never appears to have thought necessary—it must have been a cruel blow to both the children, but perhaps more particularly to Angelina. But Don Manuel was better acquainted with the winds, tides, and currents than with the caprices of the human heart, and had little apprehension that the intimacy of Francisco might have con sequences which should render either one or the other, or both, averse to the pious profession of a nun of Saint Clare or the chivalrous occupation of a Knight of Malta. 
The care of Morayma might have taken such a precaution, but it appears that this had not occurred to her. She was generally supposed to have been bred up a Christian; but her profession, like that of the old Moorish race, was not a very strict one, and if she really embraced the Christian law, it was certain that, when made prisoner by Don Manuel, she had taken shelter among a body of her own Moorish countrymen. Fulfilling, indeed, every ceremony, and avoiding with care the least suspicion of heresy, she carefully avoided interfering with the religious instructions given to her young charge by the old chaplain, once a member of the Order, and still a great favourite of Don Manuel, who was guided by his advice in all matters connected with his profession. 
Morayma, meanwhile, instructed the children in such arts of needlework, music, and even penmanship, as she possessed. She also instructed them both in the common elements of surgery, of which ladies were the depositaries, and in which they had great fame, many of the receipts being traditionary among the Moors. And she became one in their sports, in which, according to the tales

which were told them on every hand, Angelina and Morayma, as a wandering queen and princess, were discovered spellbound in some secluded glade of the forest by Don Francisco, a predestined knight errant, while the task of prolonging their confinement was entrusted to some strong faitour. This simple amusement, one of that numerous set known by the name of Make Believe, entertained the society in ten thousand different ways. It was only observed, that Morayma sometimes lost her complaisance when the play was made to turn on the defeat of the Moors, and was not disposed to take any part in the game representing those numerous defeats, which Francisco loved to represent that people as sustaining from the Cid and other Spanish champions. 
Such little disputes would often have broken their personifications; but Morayma saw the prudence of not insisting too much on her objection but gradually giving way to the entreaties of Angelina, who always took Francisco’s part, and those of Francisco himself, who conceived himself obliged by the institutes of the Order in which he had been educated, to give the Christians the upper hand, in right as well as in valour, in all encounters where they met together. 
Upon this occasion Angelina with her governess—for so I may call Morayma—were just returned to the castle, and expected the usual summons to their evening meal, when they observed that the preparations were made in the hall, and on the largest scale which were consistent with the habits of the Commander and the customs of his castle. [. . .] 
[Angelina exclaimed with] watery eyes and a tremulous voice, “Have the Moors landed, and are they in such force?” “Not here, Signora,” answered the veteran [Romegas]. “Their visits have of late been so warmly received, that, unless the infidels are delighted with bones and broken heads, it is not likely that such a welcome would encourage them to come here again in a hurry. But it seems they are presumptuous enough to think the young men of the Order of Malta are not brought up, as their fathers were, at the swordbelt of the man-at-arms, but at the apron string of the ladies, as is shown by their chivalry. What do you think, Senhora? No one ought to be a better judge.” 
“My opinion is only a woman’s,” answered the Duenna in a mild tone; for in the esquire Romegas she was wont to scent a species of enemy, on account of the aversion which the old soldier, who had so much interest with her master, entertained to her race, and which in private she returned, though aware that the discovery of such senti ments would occasion a dismission from the castle, where habit had rendered her residence and her superintendence occupations which

she would have been loth to part with. She recollected, also, the reception which such news was like to meet with from her ward Angelina, and by way of ascertaining its effect she said: “Do you hear, Lady Angelina? Our playfellow is summoned to leave us and go to Seville with his uncle.” 
“Not so, young Lady,” said Romegas; “Sir Francisco sets sail to morrow morning in command of one of our two gallies.” “But I trust under his uncle’s eye,” said Angelina, with an alarmed voice, as that of one who scarce knows the import of the intelligence she had had received. 
“His uncle,” answered the esquire, “goes to Seville alone, to trans act some business at the court of the Emperor, where the presence of Francisco would be somewhat superfluous. No, no, young Lady —Francisco must learn to keep company with men, and learn other amusement than to fancy plays. And you, my fair Senhora, must play both knight and lady in the romance. You will not have even me to act the false inchanter.” 
“Undoubtedly,” said Morayma, “you at least go with Don Manuel.” 
“No, no,—you have again guessed amiss: both our gallies go to Malta to meet the infidel invasion with Señor Francisco and myself, under my command as the older soldier, and I hope to discharge my duty.” 
“Certainly,” said Morayma; “nor is there the least danger but that, under your well known courage, Don Francisco will learn to approve his valour, without rashly endangering his life.” 
“Assuredly, Senhora. It must be my business to teach him to defend his honour, as far as is consistent with the safety of his life. Adieu, Senhora Morayma—I would leave you with regret, were it not that I trust to meet some of your complection long before I see you at Aldea Bella again. Send Francisco to me, should he come hither. We must both be ready to sail with peep of day to-morrow, and cannot spare time for leave taking.” So saying, he left the now empty apartment, and the deep tones of his voice summoning Fran cisco were soon heard, sounding along the vaulted roof of the ante room. 
Morayma failed not to observe this important person’s departure with a most ceremonious reverence, such as prudent matrons render to those whom they at the same time dislike and fear. When alone with her ward in the apartment, although the bustle and hurry in the castle was so great, and the demand of keys and articles under her charge by this hurried outfit was so incessant that she might reckon on constant interruption, she ventured to catch a glance of her charge,

who now comprehended enough of what was going on to believe that the separation was in progress which should, with respect to the objects for which they mutually hitherto existed, bring a perpetual change. A burst of hysterical passion was the consequence. The tears rose in fountains to her eyes, but without obtaining the usual relief of overflowing the natural vent in which they were deposited; the laces of her corsette became too tight for her bosom, in a manner which gave a lively idea that her sufferance at the moment nearly amounted to suffocation; the veins of her arms and forehead were swelled and blue, and the whole appearance that of a girl feeling for the first time an extremity of distress, though she scarcely could understand the cause. If there was any room for lamenting Francisco, would not he himself express sorrow, or gravity at least? But no horse boy in the castle rejoiced more than did her cousin, at the hopes of exchanging the dull hunting parties of Aldea Bella for the prospect of a serious war with the Turks, in defence of what he had been taught to consider as the dearest duty of his life, and which, considering his uncle’s influence, he was like to be placed in an honourable power to discharge. 
As Francisco hastily passed through the dining chamber, the clothes which indicated his rank partly assumed, his eye fell on Angel ina, and, reminded of a duty which he had till that moment forgotten, he advanced to her in haste, took her kindly into his arms, pressed her to his bosom, and kissed her as an affectionate brother would have, on a similar occasion, parted from his sister when he left for the wars. But, alas, poor Angelina, who had been born while the Spaniards possessed Goletta, was formed with the strong warmth of her countrywomen, and the touch of her lover’s lips brought to a species of syncopy the state of agony under which she suffered. The long eye-lashes no longer withheld the flood of tears by which Nature desired to express her feelings, and while she hung about Francisco’s neck and pressed her lips to his, her burst of repeated sobs, and the copious flow of tears, rendered her more like a person entirely out of her mind, than a maiden undergoing the influence of a sorrow, which she felt as the first and most engrossing that she had sustained in the course of her short life. Morayma became anxious lest her pupil should be surprized in the shadows of abandonment to her passion, which, to any person curious enough to give it a moment’s attention, might occasion its travelling to her uncle, with criticism as unpleasing to the Commander’s opinion of the duties incumbent on a young hospitaller, and those of a nun destined for the cloister, that the duenna trembled to think upon the consequence of such an abrupt communication.

She therefore interfered between the two lovers, and, bestowing a number of tender caresses upon Angelina, contrived in that manner, with an affectation of great sympathy, to interpose between her and Don Francisco, with whom she had already enjoyed a sufficiently long scene of parting, to which she earnestly desired a stop should be put, for the sake of the children themselves, to whom it might give serious pain. At first there was some difficulty in accomplishing this separation. Resigning herself to the blandishments with which her governess overwhelmed her, and in some degree ashamed at the extacy of passion, which she could not but judge likely to prejudice her in the opinion of the cousin, she yet resisted the efforts which he made to return the tokens of affection, with which she had over whelmed him. Yet it was not without submitting to a farewell kiss and embrace, that, withdrawing from the arms of the young man, she transferred herself to Morayma as a supporter, and left the cham ber in her company for their common bedroom. 
Here, also, the distress of the young lady for separating with the young cavalier, and for the dangers in which she supposed him involved, continued. Morayma endeavoured to comfort her by the common arguments, that what was put in peril was far from being lost, and that, not to go beyond her family for examples, Don Manuel had taken arms three times at least for the relief of Malta, and had returned home with victory and increased reputation each time. The poor girl listened to such comfort as Morayma had it in her power to bestow upon her; but tears and sobs were the only answers which the afflicted maiden was able to return while she endeavoured to anticipate the return of her cousin Francisco, until, exhausted by the feelings which chased each other through her mind, her sorrow at last gave way to sleep. 
Morayma, after a succession of heavy thoughts on her own side, soon followed the example of her pupil and referred to to-morrow its own evils. Caressing, therefore, the charge who slumbered by her side, she hoped that on the next morning, she would find her com posed in spirits and strengthened in mind, to encounter the affliction which it might be heaven’s pleasure to send with the dawning of the new day. 
The next morning, contrary to custom, the castle of Don Manuel was filled with a number of warlike sounds, the consequence of the orders which had been given to fit the gallies out for sea, which the evening before had lain quiet and silent in the Commander’s harbour at Aldea Bella. The tocsin was rung in many parishes, as well as in the little fishing town of Aldea Bella itself. The united chime of these hamlets was heard from spire to spire, carrying to the troops

of every kind, and wheresoever quartered, the news of the Moors being in motion, and warning them to form junctions in convenient places to prepare resistance where inroads might be expected. 
The lady Angelina rose from her bed even before the sun had illuminated the Andalusian mountains; and, gaining the top of the tower by a secret staircase, Morayma and she found the eastern horizon already edged with light, permitting them a view of the Mediterranean, and a sight of vessels which had, for various pur poses, taken arms at the summons of Don Manuel. The ships that most attracted the observation of the sorrowful young lady Angelina were the gallies which in some measure were her uncle Don Manuel’s own, in which, and their commanders, she was by far the most deeply interested. 
The vessels had now put to sea, deeply laded with their crews and with soldiers, and their cargo being chiefly timber beams and spars, destined for assisting the besieged in Malta. After quitting the har bour, they held the course to the eastward, taking, as could be easily ascertained, the route of Malta; to which they were helped on the way by the concern of Francisco and Signor Romegas the esquire, in obedience to the special order of their master, who was most anxious his own troops should be among the foremost in appearing before the island, as gallantly furnished as possible. 
Angelina’s walk on the battlement, and the eagerness with which she advanced a fresh spy glass, (in which branch of science Don Manuel was become a great connoisseur,) to mark their retreat, was observed and approved by her veteran relative. Having paced across the battlements and given his niece a civil good morning, he began to notice on her cheeks the traces of tears. As Morayma was not near enough to suggest any answer to his question, the little maiden responded by pronouncing her cousin’s name as the cause of her discomposure. 
Far from being disposed to blame his niece, Don Manuel answered her with perfect good temper: “Your concern in favour of your cousin, Angelina, is far from being blameable—on the contrary, I commend you for it. He has been our companion for many years, and now leaves us to encounter many dangers. Let us hope Our Lady will protect him, and do not forget him in thy prayers—the purity and piety of a creature at thy years finds access to the heavens, and the Virgin herself stoops to hear thee. Remember, then, to pray for the safety of thy cousin, and be confident in thy access to Our Lady of Grace; and forget not thy old uncle also, though he may at times seem little meriting thy prayers. But it is little I ask, Angelina, and that little is only a close befitting the life I have led for so many

years, under the influence of the blessed cross. Even Our Lady may be reminded of the services of the House of Vilheyna and Aldea Bella, and all I ask for myself is one good blow at my old enemy Dragut; and even should the infidel savage get the better, I will not lose more glory than a life of many victories can well afford to have deducted from its close.” 
Angelina exerted herself to maintain her composure against the varied and mournful recollections which her uncle’s speech to her called up. There was a stern, deep melancholy in Don Manuel’s tone of voice, which she had not observed on other occasions, and he exhibited a vein of pathetic feeling, which was not natural to his blunt and rugged temper. He recalled to her also the nature of her own destiny, which she regarded for the first moment as a farewell to all the pleasures, duties, and enjoyments of worldly exist ence that were the share of more fortunate females. There was no time to indulge in the strain of thought which would naturally have arisen on those recollections, and Morayma noted with pleas ure, that her charge saw the propriety of repressing them. She called upon Angelina that, instead of indulging in thoughts which could only be unavailing, she should see breakfast prepared for her uncle, who was about instantly to set forth for the Emperor’s present residence at Seville. 
The tramp of Don Manuel’s arm-gaunt steed brought the attend ants with the chocolate, which was now a general breakfast in such parts of Spain as were in the course of communication with the western world. Meantime, Morayma ventured to observe, that she hoped they would see him once more, as the return from thence to Cadiz to take shipping at the latter harbour for the island of Malta would not take him much out of his way. 
“It is a longer delay than I dare venture to excuse at the moment, since I must go to Malta as a thief in the night. From what I can discover, the infidels are already disembarked, and the service of every man whom we can command is peremptorily demanded. I will approach with a light craft the shores of Malta and Gozo, and my knowledge of both islets and all the fortifications, will enable me to add to the defenders an old remnant of arms, who has already sent before every man, whom the exigency enables him to com mand.” 
This answer was decisive. As the old man turned to commence his journey, the good brown horse, conscious of his approach, pawed proudly on the paved court. The Knight hastened to met this old companion of former labours.

I   to mention the splendid manner in which Don Manuel was received at the court of the King of Spain. The most magnificent promises were made of supports of all kinds to be presently sent by King Philip, and he was at length desired to sail to Malta with a Sicilian frigate. 
It was on the evening of the third day after he left the Spanish coast, that the Commander came in sight of the little island of Malta, touching the northern side of what is called the Maltese Channel, and taking the most anxious precautions to avoid meeting with Turk ish cruisers; a misfortune very likely to happen, as from the advices from Malta, as well as other information, all agreed that the various divisions of the national Turkish fleet were, according to their orders, to rendezvous upon the western side of that island, so that about this time they were to be looked out for in almost every direction. 
Don Manuel had taken every precaution in his power to escape what must have been a very mortifying capture. He had at sea six stout mariners, Maltese by birth, and who had long served on board the largest of his gallies called the Lynx, where, with higher pay than the rest of the crew, they were employed always on the most danger ous service, like those who in modern times are called captains of the top. When he approached the coast, he exchanged the frigate for a very small half-decked light boat, called a sparonaro. Sparonaros are manned with six oars, and, as the rowers always pull standing with their backs to the stern and faces to the prow, they do not pull the boat, which is the common fashion of the English and other nations, but push with the whole impulse of their bodies. These vessels, as well as the scampavias, another kind of sparonaros, are so flat and narrow that they cannot keep the sea, but in recompense can go extremely near the shore, and distance almost any pursuit among the rocky islands, where they navigate even in the most haz ardous squally weather. All signs were taken in by which the real character of the Commander’s boat might be recognised, reducing its appearance to that of vessels of the same construction, which the Turkish gallies, contrary to their express orders, often neglected to take the trouble of capturing, owing to the imagined petty profit of the prize, and the great trouble of securing men who were so well acquainted with the shoally and rocky coast which they traversed daily, and who were every way fitted to escape. 
The Commander, accordingly, sustained many which might be

termed narrow escapes, and one such in particular befell him towards the very conclusion of his journey. After changing their course, the sparonaro had opened the gulph or bay of Saint Paul on the north western side of the island, one of those indentures which rendered it so remarkably fitted for the marauding profession of the Knights. The supposed freedom from danger had so emboldened the boat men, that they entered the bay with little precaution, in the hope of running the vessel upon the sands and getting safe to the shore by swimming, when they perceived, to their horror, that they were run ning straight in the teeth of a flotilla of stout Algerian gallies, having, by way of ensign, a green turban above a drawn sabre displayed in a sable field, being the nearest thing approaching to a created object which the superstition of the Moslemah permitted them to use in that capacity: others they considered as a breach of the second com mandment. The crew of the sparonaro put about the vessel, whisper ing to each other that, by Saint Mary, they were Draguntines, as the dexterous and dangerous corsairs were called, who were fitted out at Algiers, and other ports where Dragut possessed his sway. The very recollection of his name stirred to action those mariners who had so often seen his sails sink before those of their master; but the speedy evolution did not more resemble the effort made by the hare when the hounds have surprized her on her solitary form, than the start, which instantly took place among the pursuers when they caught view of their unexpected prey, found no imperfect resemblance of the impatience of the hounds, when in full cry they open upon their timid enemy. The ropes by which they were secured at anchor, were heaved up, or slipped, or cut—whichever might fastest give their barks to the course of the winds and waves. The sparonaro had hardly stood across Saint Paul’s Bay, seeking such an opening as might enable them to clear the Cape of Salini and gain the outward sea, than they heard the pursuit following close behind them. There was the furious cry of the corsair calling upon his ciurma to use their utmost exertions, and the eager yell of the mariners, ready to dash from their boltsprit and yards upon the vessel that they expected to board, in all the hope of plunder and booty, which might be consider able from the prospect of its carrying a disguised Knight of the Order, and the acquiring which was the expectation and hope of their lives. There was the extorted cry of the galley-slave—half expressing a sense of pain, half a feeling of sorrow—that followed every sounding application of the terrible chabouk, which in a wild motley chorus of noises lent its peculiar force to the effect of the whole, and, heard as it was by those who considered it as an inevitable portent of death or endless captivity, was a shriek of an import the

most frightful which could assail the human ear. 
But the boatmen of Malta showed neither fear nor hesitation, or even a moment’s doubt in the luck of the Commander who had so often led them to victory. They gave way—stretched to their oars, that is—with an agility surprizing to their pursuers, although the latter had the advantage of being manned with seamen refreshed with rest and food, neither of which Don Manuel’s crew had been latterly able to indulge in. As they held on the course, still keeping ahead of their pursuers, and somewhat assisted by their knowledge of the navigation of the shelves of this rocky coast, with all its bays and promontories, they protracted their flight by every means in their power, that they might take the chance of finding the shore occupied by some Christian post, or protected by some Christian cruiser. But they began to experience from time to time, that the enemies’ superiority of sail gained them an opportunity of firing on the chase, with an effect which gradually increased. As one thick cloud of smoke after another, preceded by a rapid flash, accounted for the almost momentary pause which the rowers might make on their oars to favour the marksman’s aim, the ejaculation of some European intimated that the shot of the musqueteer had been suc cessful. 
At length a young man dropped, mortally wounded as it seemed; and it appeared the same bullet had also pierced his comrade, an old seaman hitherto one of the most active present, who on hearing the groan of his comrade as he was hit, relinquished for an instant the oar which he held, being one of the foremost rowers, and fell for wards. 
“Boniface,” said the Commander, “I have seen thee laugh at a whole hail storm of shots such as this.” 
“But those did not light in the heart of my son.” 
“And he has died by thy side, honest friend. Be comforted.” “Heaven is better than Earth; and the mercies of God are to trust to, rather than those of the infamous Dragut.” 
“Prove that you think so,” said the Commander, in a whispering tone. “When those infidels shall take this galley, fire our handful of powder—and God speed us all!” 
“May God say amen,” said Boniface, “and my poor unfortunate’s body shall go to the grave unmangled by the butchery of the infidel miscreants. Only one thing, my Lord—blame me not if I reserve this final sacrifice until the last moment, when it is the voice of the Deity himself who shall bid us strike.” 
“Take thy time, but be faithful.”

the little boat which still defies him, neither you nor I will survive to be termed his slaves.” 
“Be ready, then,” said Manuel, “and I will thank you in heaven.” The old sailor changed his place to the first oar, and, stretching his arm across, in a manner embraced the dead body of his son, holding in his hand a pistol pointed into the slender stock of ammuni tion to which the Commander’s charge had relation, and which was immediately in front of the little deck that covered what is called the poop. His sturdy arms, applied to the oar, renewed the impulse which his son’s mortal wound had for a short time interrupted, and the Christian bark once more sprang ahead of its pursuers, with repeated cries of hope and of despair, through the bays named Salines and Saint Magdalen, and at length sought refuge under two piece of cannon forming a battery for some temporary purpose in the Calle di Salin. Beneath those the sparonara displayed its colours to incite the succour of the Christian engineers, who immediately opened their fire upon the pursuers, and with a success by which one of them was sunk. 
Various batteries of different strength fenced the access of the shores of Malta at this period of national alarm, overlooking the dif ferent bays and landing places; either to defend them against the sudden and unexpected descents, by which the Turkish corsairs had landed to pillage them and carry their inhabitants into captivity, as on former occasions, or to afford shelter and protection to the sparon aras, scampavias, and other Maltese small craft which they permitted to reach the shore in safety. The most formidable parts of the contriv ances were very large mortars, hewn out of the free stone of the island, and placed upright. They were then covered with a tompion, or thick cover of wood, not rammed down after the form of a bullet, but detained in its place partly by its own weight, and partly by a quantity of cannonballs, large stones, bars of iron, or other deadly materials of the same kind. This military implement was employed upon the approach of an enemy’s fleet, the engineers having first provided for their own safety from a shower of the contents, which, after ascend ing, descended perpendicularly so as to destroy any vessel which chanced to be within reach. 
Just as the course of the sparonaro became obvious to the party at the battery, and the escape which she had so long protracted seemed to require but an instant to bring it to a close, the Capitan of the stoutest and best-armed of all the corsairs’ craft, had urged the whole of his crew to the utmost exertion, knowing it was probable from the display of colours on board that she was commanded by Don Manuel in person.

that of Don Manuel, taking his chance to escape on board of the rest of his flotilla, in spite of the fire from the battery; but as they rushed together, a voice from the shore called to discharge the mor tars, preferring that both parties should perish together, than that their Christian friends, with whose distinguishing cognisance they were not acquainted, should be made prisoners in their own sight. 
The head of the Moorish galley had scarce struck the sparonaro when the desolate father discharged his pistol; and at the same time a concussion like that of a thunder cloud ascended from the Bay of Saline, and shot to the heavens the contents of the fatal mortar, which, returning as we have described, overwhelmed both the vessels with a perpendicular shower of missiles thrown up to the sky, and descending again in a degree of fury, which resembled one of those volcanic eruptions that occur frequently in Sicily, Strombole, and neighbouring islands. 
Although the sparonaro, from the desperate action of Boniface, made a sudden explosion, yet that of the mortar was effected by means of a slow match. While those who were upon the shore availed themselves of this brief delay to seek shelter from the impending shower of shot and stones, others entered upon the scene, apparently with the premeditated wish to share its dangers. This was a stout galley which had not yet been seen, as concealed by the rocks to the left of the bay. The explosion of the sparonaro, followed by that of the stone-mortar, seemed to be the signal for the crew of this ship to urge her, with all the impulse that they could command, to the parted fragments of the vessels, which had met each other with so fatal collision; but though the galley lost several men by the shower of the content of the mortar, yet she was far from suffering the ruin which might have been expected. On the contrary, the exertions of her crew, particularly a young man who appeared to be her commander, recovered from the wreck of the sparonaro those men who had not suffered, while the Moorish cruizers bore off and escaped from the Christian galley in different directions. A boat, rowing swiftly, soon brought the survivors aboard the galley which last appeared in the warfare, and as he boarded a young soldier cried: “Noble my Lord, we have just saved your uncle by holding our shields over his head and defending him against the shower of stones. He has suffered nothing from some [. . .].” [. . .] 
“[. . .] Commander, had it not been for the ready help of my provident friends. But tell me, brother—you must remember I have been long a stranger at Malta. Would you wish to show me what preparation you have made for the reception of those unchristened villains?”

“I was going to propose to you, my brother, to take your road to the fortress of Saint Angelo, having with you your nephew and me. You will find it still in the same place, where it was long since built by our celebrated brother Villiers de L’Isle Adam at the time when, having been expelled from Rhodes, he began to fortify this island. But I fear the exercise will be rather unsuitable with the injuries you have sustained by this accident.” 
“Far from it,” returned the Commander; “I would have our young Knights know, that there is not an effect of a shower of stones, or of a fall, to which there is a more effective remedy than a ride on one’s war-horse.” 
“Thy steed is ready at thy command,” said the Grand Master; “and in riding to the Convent I will acquaint you with some things of which you cannot yet be informed.” 
The skiff of the galley was instantly set afloat, and presently con veyed to the shore the Grand Master, with the aged and juvenile companions of the Order. When they had arrived on the mainland, after the Grand Master had left some directions with the commander of the post they proceeded on horse-back.

Whether willing or not, I must needs make an attempt, which, from total want of the powers of the draughtsman, I feel somewhat dubious in its issue. 
The spectator, who necessarily unites the present with the past, far from missing the ancient boundaries of the city, is more astonished at the immense modern fortifications, which have been added since the fashion of war has called for them. From the position of the more ancient fortifications, it appears that the principal object of the Order in their first operations was the protection of their gallies, to the constant exercize of which they now in a general sense limited the war with the Turks, that, while they retained possessions in the Holy Land, they had carried on by land as actively as by sea.

being a huge rock so thinly covered with earth that it is allowed that part of it, for garden ground or other special purposes, is actually brought from the more fertile island of Sicily. What is very singular, the soil thus imported never feels the fertilizing qualities of rain, notwithstanding the scorching influence of a burning sun, and the shallowness of the soil, which in many places does not exceed five or six inches. This want, which must surprize a farmer, is amply supplied by the fall of copious dews during the spring and winter months, together with a certain coolness in the surface of the rock itself, which is greatly favourable to the roots, whether of the corn or the cotton, which they raise in peculiar abundance. Still, however, the number of the inhabitants is so great in proportion to the crops raised, that the whole island does not have corn to support them for more than six months, and the Order with its followers must have relied on their supplies from other countries. To assure themselves of the necessary provision, the stores of the Grand Masters’ granaries, which may yet be seen, were filled and hoarded with great care for the time of siege, when their contents were distributed to the gar risons and inhabitants of the island. 
As for the fortifications, Dragut and other Moorish captains must have found them pretty nearly the same which they had left, or rather from which they had been driven, and to which they now returned with stronger forces in 1565. There were two fortified cities, so termed, in the island of Malta. One of these, which now bears the name of the Victorious City, was situated on a lake, or bason, on the north-east of the island, a noble piece of water divided by ridges of rock and partial embankments into a number of small bays, which separated the lake into twelve separate and distinct harbours, capable of containing shipping of various descriptions, and so destined by the Knights. Besides the two cities the island is studded very thick with casales, or hamlets, having around them a variety of half-finished buildings of a stately appearance, some destined for the summer abode of the Knights, who only inhabited the Convent during the winter season. 
The excellence of the grand port, which is certainly one of the finest in the universe, and the ease of protecting its entrance, which is scarce a quarter of a mile broad, had long tempted the Knights to fortify it, as well as the art of the sixteenth century permitted, by a strong citadel bearing the name of Saint Angelo, after a place of the same name in Rhodes. The outside of this citadel, which was filled with buildings connected with the harbour, was called the Bourg, or Le Bourg des Anglais. This was fortified with special care. A small fortification defended this Bourg, to which several additions had

been made since the invasion of 15—. Another fortification, termed Saint Elmo, presenting itself on the opposite side to the citadel and the Bourg, must, if possible, be stormed before assaulting them. Although, on the one hand, the place was covered by very strong artillery, and could not be taken without loss, yet upon the other, the space inclosed within it was so small, that it could not contain above fifty men; and, considering the great numbers of the Moorish host, there would be little difficulty in outnumbering the defenders in such a manner as to render defence impossible, and by putting the garrison to the sword to strike terror into others, and teach the Knights in particular, that when they adventured their bodies in holding places that were untenable, they must not look to escape the stern rules of war, which in such cases render the defenders incapable of quarter. Another of these embankments which ran into and crossed the harbour, and which was fortified with care, received the title of Saint Michael. 
Such was the singular situation in which the Maltese Order now stood, and such the arrangements that were made for its defence. They had employed whatever shipping they had, in bringing to the island the Knights of the Order who were repairing thither in con sequence of the Grand Master’s summons, which was obeyed by all, followed by such troops as their revenues enabled them to provide. Many of the Knights who had impoverished themselves in making equipments for repelling this Sultaun’s grandfather when pressing the siege of Rhodes above forty years since, made no lighter exertions against his descendent, the reigning prince. 
The inhabitants of Malta, feudal subjects of the Knights, raised companies of four thousand good musqueteers, and the mercenary soldiers and volunteers amounted to two or three thousand more, a slender force to resist a land army of thirty thousand men, who came assisted by so very large a naval contingent. 
These things were explained by the Grand Master to the Com mander. He told him the line of defence which leisure had enabled them to adopt, and explained to Don Manuel, that he had been obliged to reinforce Saint Elmo with fifty Knights, with commands to defend it to the last extremity, at the risk of the severe penalty of the defenders being excluded from quarter, as having protracted by their useless valour the resistance of an untenable place. 
Coasting round Malta, and at length taking possession of a good harbour called Marza-Sirocco to the south of the Knights’ retreat— where the Order was confident in the presence of so many renowned members, whom the news of the siege had summoned to the Convent with the purpose of lending their assistance to the defence of the

island—the celebrated Pacha of Egypt, and the scarce less celebrated Piali, the Pacha of the Sea or Capitan Pacha, were the first in com mand of the expedition, which amounted to one hundred and fifty nine vessels, chiefly gallies and galleots, or other shipping which make use of oars. But the firman, or commission, not only charged them to act in friendship and good understanding with each other, but to be guided, as on a former occasion, by the advice and opinion of the Viceroy Dragut. An army of select infantry was chosen from among the Spahis and Janizaries, to which the various Lords, Beys, or petty princes added such retinues as their various wealth put it in their power to maintain at their own expence, as being an opportunity on which they were expected to vie with each other. 
The Pachas Mustapha and Piali, having thrown themselves on shore in the harbour where they had taken land, were about to hold a council of war, to determine how they might most speedily and safely accomplish the purposes of their expedition, but found they had not yet been joined by Dragut, whose assistance was, by their instruction, rendered indispensable to their councils. The other two generals suspended any decisive resolution concerning their operations till the arrival of the Viceroy of Algiers, whom they expected every day. In the meantime, by carefully and in person reconnoitring the castle of Saint Angelo, the Bourg, and fortress of Saint Elmo, they endeavoured to form a judgement with which part of their task they ought to commence. They resolved to disembark in the bay of Marza-Sirocco with so strong a force as would render it unsafe for the Knights, as on the former occasion, to hazard themselves by skirmishes with the invaders. A change of wind, however, induced the Pachas to prefer landing in the Bay of Saint Thomas, more to the eastward of the southern coast of the island. Here it was resolved to accomplish the landing, and the Capitan Pacha, disembarking in this place, soon covered the shores of Schebarras and others to the east of the town as it then stood, with the wild apparatus of an eastern encampment in all its splendour. 
The disembarkment was safely effected without anything remark able except the wounding and capture of La Riviere, a French Knight, who was brought before Piali. The Maltese prisoner was strictly interrogated of the state of preparation of the island, and especially concerning their determination as to defending it. La Riviere, without regarding, returned an answer as firm as he could, making himself responsible for the state of provision which the Knights possessed of all necessary for their defence, and the deter mined resolution which they had formed to avail themselves of their preparations to the uttermost. Lastly, the French Knight failed not

to enlarge upon their expectations of large supplies from the princes of Europe to relieve their island, either by compelling the Turkish army to give battle, or to set sail for their own country. Piali too well knew the duty of a brave warrior in La Riviere’s case to place credit in the answers he received in response to his numerous questions, and ordered a sharp torture to be administered to compel, if poss ible, a more exact account. Under this cruel application he again commanded the French gentleman to be examined, when La Rivi ere, as if exhausted by the tortures, suffered it to be as if extorted from him, that the post termed the redoubt of Castile was most incapable of defence, and subject therefore chiefly to their doubts and apprehensions. Piali, therefore, proposed to begin his siege on that quarter of the Bourg. But when, in the course of his reconnoit ring, he came in sight of the various fortresses, and beheld the post of Castile, represented as most feebly defended, on the contrary for tified with a very strong and large bulwark, a ravelin, and casemates in the ditch, inflamed and incensed at the trick attempted upon him by his prisoner, he himself discharged a blow of his cane upon the head of his wounded captive, and his officers despatched La Riviere in the same barbarous method. While this scene of cruelty passed, the Marechal Coppier with his subdivision, were busy upon such of the infidels as had straggled for the sake of plunder, and cut to pieces fifteen hundred while they were thus employed, without los ing in exchange more than about eighty of his own followers. 
Meantime the dying words of La Riviere, so basely murdered, and who met his cruel fate with unexampled firmness, erected a lingering vision before the eyes of the Pacha, from which he could not free himself. The combined navies of Europe, arriving upon the coast ere any precautions were made for protection of the fleet and army attacked by sea and land at once, threatened a disaster which would not certainly be more cheaply avenged by his master, than by taking the heads of those who chanced to be in command of the Moorish troops when this disaster befell them. Fear, and perhaps some degree of remorse, painted to his imagination the banners of united Christendom crossing each other on the western horizon, and marshalled on by the mutilated spectre of his late prisoner, who seemed as if he came from his grave commissioned to lead them to a bloody revenge for an unknightly death. At length it occurred to him, that the harbour of Marza-Sirocco did not admit of a debarca tion on account of the state of the wind, and yet there was a portion which branched off from the great harbour, keeping the side of the fort of Saint Elmo, and giving access to a fine sheet of water, on the eastern side of which is now an ancient palace applied to the purposes

of a quarantine station, but which was then pretty nearly in a state of nature. It struck the experienced Moorish leader, that if this harbour were rendered secure by silencing the battery of Saint Elmo, their fleet might remain there in comparative safety, placed under the protection of strong batteries erected on the northern shore, and defy all the forces which the states of Europe were like to send against them. But in order to accomplish this, it would first be neces sary to obtain possession of, and silence, the fortress of Saint Elmo, which, from its small size, was like to be no very difficult task. At the same time, the number of knightly banners displayed on the cavalier made it evident, that the fort was garrisoned by a large detachment of the Order in person, whose defence it was to be expected would be conducted most obstinately. 
What greatly recommended Piali’s proposal to Mustapha, and the other persons composing the council before whom he laid it, was the likelihood of its being agreeable to Dragut, by whose opinion they were required to direct themselves, and whose disposition to the Order of Malta was well known to be of the most vindictive descrip tion. They proposed, also, an attack from the northern shore, or inside of the island, so to speak, that must be carried on against the fort, and might interrupt the succours of every description with which it must be supplied from the citadel of Saint Angelo, and that would infallibly, from the zeal with which the Knights were accustomed to support each other, be maintained with the greatest obstinacy. It was, therefore, resolved, that the expedition should be commenced with the attack upon Saint Elmo, while for Dragut, as proud of the skill in artillery by which he was first distinguished, should be reserved the important task of pressing the attack from the northern shore of the lake, a mass of living rock. 
A plundering party, dispatched for the purpose, raised a great number of draught bullocks from the habitations of the poor island ers, with which they moved the very numerous and weighty artillery, that amounted to ten pieces of cannon discharging eighty pounds weight of balls, besides two culverins of sixty pounds each, and a tremendous cannon, the ball of which weighed one hundred and sixty pounds. 
When the Turkish flotilla set sail for the islands of Malta, Gozo, and the still smaller ones contained in the group, men could scarcely be conceived more jealous of each other than the Pachas whom Soliman had promoted to the first authority, Dragut, whose reputa tion was the envy of every Rais in the Turkish service, and others, who, with more slender reputation, promised to themselves to aug ment what they had by exerting themselves and rising in the present

war, where even to be named, though not called to action, was of itself accounted a matter of high distinction. 
Dragut was certainly among the most remarkable, and his temper was so loose, that, addicted as he was to the forbidden beverage of wine, in which he especially disgraced himself with the graver men of the Turkish religion, he often put himself to shame in their eyes, and used at such times to indulge himself in boastful threats. In his private chamber he was laughed at for swaggering about the revenge he would take on all his enemies—Giannettino Doria, Don Manuel de Vilheyna, and other persons who he intended should pay back old scores with interest for the time they had been due. Their exer tions for defence were, therefore, made upon the fullest scale which the danger of the attempt admitted. The use of artillery was now very generally understood, and in particular that of destroying by its means the most skilful fortifications. But the nature of the soil was in this respect peculiarly hurtful to besiegers. It was indeed almost impossible to open trenches before Malta’s fortifications as necessary to ruin them. This was prevented by the soil, which did not exceed in many cases a thin turf, spread at the depth of a very few inches upon a foundation which was in all cases a solid rock. There was, therefore, no possibility to raise against the fortifications a trench or battery, in which the besiegers should protect their cannon and themselves while they pushed the siege, as in ordinary cases. To remedy this great inconvenience, the Turkish engineers determined to protect their trenches with sacks of cotton or wool, and quantities of waste timber, old ship timber in particular, out of which they formed military screens called gabions, often used by engineers to shield their cannon from fire, when regular trenches could not be erected. Many of their slowest vessels were loaded with timber destined to be useful in that way; and thus, instead of digging their trenches in the usual method, they constructed them out of timber or anchors, beams, and such similar materials, capable of affording shelter against the advances of the enemy. 
The ground around the fortress of Saint Elmo being of the same quality with the rest of the island, it could only be attacked by means of wood-works so formed, or similar lines of artificial gabions; and in preparing such under the very fire of the batteries of the place, the Moorish engineers not only showed their skill, but the power of labour for which their troops were so generally renowned. Meantime, besides the unusual means of war adopted for the first time, all the other practices of battle were used, with all the active hatred which national enmity could inspire. 
To explain the nature and position of the fortress, the reader

must remember that it occupied, with a heavy train of artillery, the termination of one of those projections, from which it commanded the various entries to the harbours, and did considerable annoyance to every attack which the besiegers made upon it. As the projecting point of Saint Elmo only admitted of a small garrison, the Capitan Pacha, who had been the first to adopt the plan of commencing the siege by assaulting that particular place, resolved to set at defiance the defences by sea. He therefore determined to make his attack on the side of the land, where the defences were less strong, and the resistance, it was supposed, less obstinate. But the first part of his task was far more difficult than he expected. 
The principal defence of the garrison was a cavalier, or bulwark, of extreme height and thickness, that effectually preserved to the Christian soldiers an ascendancy over the Moors or Turks, and the means of pouring their shot upon them from this high and solid post of advantage, which they not only occupied advantageously with their musquetry, of whom they placed a number in the cavalier, but with soldiers who flung hand grenades, and a formidable missile first used on that occasion. 
The Christians had availed themselves of an implement of attack suggested by the advantageous situation which they defended, and by the national dress of the enemy, then, as now, a long loose gown of silk or cotton, peculiarly apt to be burned by being unexpectedly brought to contact with priming materials. A number of hoops, com posed of light wood, were prepared by being wrapped round with wool or flax, or similar inflammables. The defenders then took hold of these hoops with a species of tongs contrived for the purpose, and having whirled them twice or three times round their heads, till they were completely converted into circles of flame, threw them from the works as the Turkish assailants thronged to the assault. Two or three Turks being usually involved in these flaming circles, com municated the fire to their very inflammable dress, and it was seldom found extinguishable unless they possessed, which could rarely be attained, the means of plunging themselves into cold water. The screams of the wretches, who by these means were literally burned alive, were heard far above the tremendous noise of the fire on both sides, as well as the cries or groans of the combatants fighting or dying. 
But the Capitan Pacha did not lose his courage. His plan had uniformly been to avail himself of the power of overcoming all difficulties by the blood of his soldiers, of which he possessed such immensely superior numbers, and whom he urged to perseverance by rewards, punishments, personal exertions, and every mode accessible

to a soldier well nigh mad with the most desperate desire of obtaining the victory. 
Beginning his works beyond point blank shot of Saint Elmo upon the land side, the Moorish general partly constructed, and in places where the ground afforded a greater depth of soil, excavated, a trench, or hollow way, affording shelter to his people upon a height equal or superior to the cavalier which it was his intention to overpower. At an immense loss of time and blood, and with much discontent on the part of the soldiers employed, he was at length able to bring his men up to the cavalier upon somewhat an advantage with that first enjoyed by the defenders. Yet, considering his orders, and fearing lest Dragut should find on his arrival, that his advice had been impru dent because it had not been actually successful, he considered it as safest to postpone the final attempt to storm till the coming of the Viceroy, whose advice they were commanded so highly to respect, and whose arrival they expected every day. 
Meantime, it was not in nature to expect, that the continued effort with which the Knights persisted in the defence of a feeble post— only supplied by repeated reinforcements, who came successively to die in their turn at Saint Elmo, without the slightest hope of being ultimately successful in relieving it—should be ultimately persevered in; and it had reached the ears of the Capitan Pacha, that the garrison were already murmuring at the orders that condemned them to lay down their lives in a task which could not have an honourable or a successful issue. On this subject he spoke with Mustapha, who sel dom voluntarily entered upon state affairs, except in answer to the Sultaun’s personal enquiries, and had an especial jealousy of the Capitan Pacha, and not the less since he adopted the bold measure of commencing the siege without either Dragut’s express approbation or his own. 
“So, my father,” said the Capitan Piali, who, though an old man, was greatly younger than Mustapha, “this ground of Malta is as impassible to the pickaxe and shovel as the Knights have been thought invulnerable to the usual animal sensations of danger or of fear; yet believe me, father, the time is come when we shall at the same time mine the impenetrable rock of Malta, and impress fear upon the irrefragable courage of her Knights.” 
“The better for you, my Lord of the Sea,” answered the aged Mustapha, not wishing to commit himself by assenting to the plan of operations before the Viceroy of Algiers was arrived, which might be interpreted into an express disobedience of their instructions; and, according to the policy of the great favourites at the Porte, unwilling to hazard his own credit with the Sultaun by claiming to share the

merit of having been participant of an attempt, the consequence of which was yet uncertain. It will be observed, that he maintained the same policy during the whole discussion, preserving the means of having suggested the attack upon Saint Elmo thus early in the cam paign, when the daring attempt of Piali the Capitan Pacha had been crowned with the success for which that daring officer sought; in which case he had resolved to throw the blame upon the Viceroy, for not having come up to assist them with his advice at the very com mencement. “I feel myself with greater reason the infirmities of an old man, whose experience of former days prevents his counsel being ready to his memory as his duty would require, or his goodwill would demand of him. Most happy he is, to find himself yoked with a colleague, whose profound knowledge and military experience can remedy all the deficiencies, which are the necessary consequence of the fourscore years that have passed over this old head of mine, and have in many particulars diminished my power of revenging the hon our of my gracious master; which wish ought to operate as a powerful medicine, restoring our decayed faculties both of mind and body, when we are honoured with the approbation of our earlier services. Yet, alas! Even the Grand Seignior himself cannot restore to old age the promptitude and the experience of early youth, and certain it is, that he is too just to give the merit of a poor old veteran to a man like yourself, so far from having passed the time of action. Since, however, the result of your plans promises success, I should esteem myself honoured by your entrusting me with the grounds on which you found the joyous hopes, that the garrison of Saint Elmo is like to surrender, or to mutiny, since their grand vizier, to obey whose com mand they are sworn, has enjoined them by positive orders to con tinue their defence at all rates.” 
“The question,” answered Piali, “would seem strange from your Lordship, had I not heard in the council of our nation the most honoured tongue and eloquent lips who are called to the Turkish council, aver repeatedly, that our enemies are changed in their man ners, and no longer hold themselves bound to fight to the same extremity as they did in the ancient times of Melec Ric, and the other heroes of the days termed of chivalry. 
“At least,” said the Pacha of Egypt, with some of the petulance of one who finds his own favourite sentiments quoted against him, “I have said, that such a change is beginning among the Knights of the Order, but has not reached the superiors. Look around, my Lord, and think of the immense expences which have called such batteries and fortifications out of the barren rock that they are meant to defend.

your best forces have fallen before the meanest fort of the whole which it is our duty to make ourselves master of, and say if the Christians who have defended themselves desperately against such extreme odds, are in any respect changed from the countrymen of Melec Ric. Think if the Commanders and Knights, who are masters of the funds out of which these expences have been paid, can be said to prefer the accumulations of treasure to the laying it out in prepara tions for the defence of the Order.” 
“I can only answer to your Lordship,” replied Piali, “that gold is found as powerful among the Christian Knights and soldiers as in every other country.” 
“If you rely upon the slaves of gold, for such are seen everywhere, being so much alarmed as to shrink from the clang of your trumpets, and the clash of your sabres, send your summons before you, that the garrison of yon paltry islet may know at what risk they constitute themselves defenders of it till the last gasp. The laws of war every where forbid bestowing of quarter upon men who expose themselves in idle bravado to the defence of a post which cannot be termed tenable.” 
“Reverend my father,” answered Piali, “your counsel shall be obeyed, and many thanks to you for honouring us with the fruits of your sage experience. Our advance hath been much protracted by the small supplies, just enough to replace those who have fallen in every day’s action. Hitherto the Grand Master has been implicitly obeyed. But of late, the minds of the garrison have been opened to the ultimate consequence of their being thus exposed in detail to certain death. The Grand Master has sent a commission of three persons, from whom he hopes to procure an opinion to vindicate his desperate plan of still defending this feeble outpost. We will, should this be the opinion of your Lordship’s better wisdom, send into Elmo an embassy, which, arriving at the same time with those from their mufti or grand vizier, may instruct them at what risk they will attempt to execute his desperate pleasure, and incline them to a capitulation, of which, if such be your pleasure, we can afterwards modify the terms.” 
“I will not, certainly,” replied the Pacha of Egypt, “dissent from anything necessary in your opinion to the success of your undertaking, in which I take as much interest as I should in a device of my own or of the Viceroy’s. Dragut, I think, will be with us presently. Ought we not to wait a day for his arrival?”

endure a great addition to the loss of the faithful, the men being so dissatisfied with that which has already taken place?” “Nay, assuredly,” replied Mustafa, “the having determined on the siege of Malta without consulting the Viceroy, renders it unneces sary to suspend it from that ceremony. Be it said, though, among ourselves, that Dragut is peculiarly interested in those measures which embrace the safety of Algiers, an attempt upon which has been threatened by the Spanish Emperor, or a part of his forces; so, if he be again lucky, he may appear at our council with the appearance of a conquest, as a falcon never stoops so proudly to his master as when he has his prey in his clutch.” 
They exchanged a peculiar smile, which seemed to announce them as putting upon what Mustapha said a mystical and singular inter pretation understood by both. As they parted, Piali asked Mustafa, with the air of a person who suddenly recollects themselves: “The part of the Grand Seignior’s forces which are under my charge I have encamped on the eminence called Schebarras, whereas yours are disposed in the neighbourhood of the Grand Master’s country house called Saint Antonio, nearer to the place called Citta Vecchia. These Christians are sufficiently enterprizing. Save that the resid ence is by much the most healthy of the two, I would ask if we were safe in lying at so great a distance separate.” 
“Having lain thus since we landed, I do not imagine that we shall increase the hazard of attack if we delay joining till Dragut shall arrive to arrange our hosts, when he has taken order for that of Algiers.” 
Piali answered with a smile, as before when the arrival of Dragut had been mentioned. It was evident, that the confidence was not great on the part of his fellow in commission, either in the certainty of his speedy arrival, or his decisive ability when he should at length appear. If the opinion of Mustapha was the same, he took the greatest care not to intimate his entertaining such—so contradictory to that repeatedly evinced by his master Soliman.

much falsehood and rivalry, each having at heart his own advance ment, and the depreciation of his colleague in the opinion of their common master. But the conversation turned on the same topics, and the Commander acknowledged the information which he had from the Grand Master on the discussion which was about to take place in the Order of Malta, and among Christians in general, respecting the principles upon which they acted in many cases. 
“That we should have finally relinquished,” said La Valette, “or at least abandoned, the dictates of honour and chivalry, is a truth as sad as it is that these infidel miscreants should have had the acuteness to perceive it. We have had a well known instance of the opinions of our fathers, by which all abided in their days, being now held up to the ridicule of their descendants; and with such success, that he is a dull man who would not, when almost dying, listen and laugh at the history of Don Quixote. I have read part of that book, but the emer gency of these times, which leave a Grand Master of the Order little time for such studies, permits me little leisure to finish the narrative.” 
“I cannot but so much applaud the genius of the author, that when I was at the court I studied to find him and bring him out with me to this siege of Malta—that Miguel de Cervantes who has the merit of having written a work so incomparable. He has served against the Moors with good reputation, and would be capable.” 
“Of what would be useful to us at such a time,” said La Valette, “I cannot even guess, although I do not doubt it, since you, Don Manuel, hold that opinion—I am certainly willing to doubt my own judgement. But may I ask what interrupted your intention towards him? It is true, our business here is rather of a grave and melancholy cast; but a romancer like this, while a very small addition, would be a person who could turn our mourning into mirth. Why did you not bring him with you?” 
“Alas! La Valette,” answered the Commander, “Fortune deals her favours with strange partiality: she has afflicted with the iron gripe of poverty this same Cervantes, whom in other respects she has gifted so highly; and, what is worse, has given him a soul so delicate, that it would be difficult to persuade him to accept that bread as elemosinary which he would think he was incapable of toiling to earn. He is an accomplished cavalier, and one who has seen good service, and at the battle of Lepanto was rendered unfit for farther action by the loss of his left hand. He distinguished himself so much by his genius, that his master used to say, that he could defy all Christendom, provided he was free from the extraordinary stratagems of that one-handed man. It was not, therefore, in battle, that his assistance could have been of much consequence. But he is

a poet as well as a romancer, and, although his most celebrated work has turned upon ridiculing the extravagances of chivalry, yet no man in Spain is more capable of impelling his countrymen to the call of his country or of honour, and, like others of the same talents in Greece or other lands, urging them to sacrifice everything down to life itself, rather than our land endured the slightest loss which could be averted by his own personal suffering. It is true, that old history gives us knowledge of such patriots, whose songs have to their coun trymen sounded like the call of the trumpet to the war-horse, who says among the trumpets, Ha, Ha! yet, believe me, the place of such a person will be in court, and not in the tumults of a besieged castle. It is easy and would be graceful in our Sovereign, to extend his bounty to such a well-deserving gentleman; and he is not ignorant of his merit, for, observing a man walking near the palace making the most extravagant gesture and yielding to irresistible bursts of laughing, the King declared, that the man must be either mad or reading Don Quixote. Word being sent to the student, he was found actually engaged with the celebrated romance of Cervantes. I tell it with regret, for I am much bound to the King in gratitude.” 
“And I hear it with pain,” answered the Grand Master, “since, if such be King Philip’s disposition, there is, I fear, little chance of the succour from Spain speedily arriving to our relief.” 
“As to what you say of Cervantes having undermined the principles of chivalry in Don Quixote, he only points out the extravagancies to which they may be carried, and the infinite enjoyment which readers discover in the freaks of a madman, who takes everything for serious that he finds among the absurdities of romances of chivalry, which every sane person must regard as the most exaggerated extravagance, showing, (which was the object of Cervantes,) how indifferently time was employed either in writing or in reading them; while, on the contrary, all in Don Quixote’s temper that springs from his own sentiments and his own heart is brave, just, generous, and disinteres ted, which, (while our author’s wit must excite many a smile,) still makes clear to us, amid all his weaknesses, his being the real model of an accomplished gentleman. Do not therefore, my friend, do him the wrong to regard him as an enemy to chivalry, although he had taste enough to point out the extravagant mode of composition which was fashionable in setting it forth.” 
“I will believe it to be as you say,” answered the Grand Master; “yet I could wish the author had spared his satire, instead of striking at maxims and opinions which are not so common, according to the modern way of thinking, as to render it necessary to hold them up to ridicule. Something of the bad effects I see even now, and you shall

know how I suffer under them. I have told men of my desire to maintain as long as possible the defence of this fort Saint Elmo, which commands the inner harbour, and, while it defends it, excludes us from the danger of seeing it entered by the infidel fleet. Hitherto, it has been enough for the Grand Master to say to a Knight, wherever appointed, ‘This is your post, my brother: stand fast in its defence, and merit your share of paradise by obeying the command of your Superior, and fighting to the last in the part assigned you.’ I will not misrepresent the Knights of the Convent as it now exists: the mere fear of death will never cause one of them to waver, but it is not sufficient that they have the order of their Grand Master to discharge this piece of duty. It is not only necessary that I give my orders: I must also reason upon them, and prove to the satisfaction of those to whom I commit the task, that their executing my charge is absolutely necessary; and, unless I can show them, (which they may not find it easy to admit,) that their holding it out to the last is necessary to the defence of the island, I cannot be certain that they will not be tempted to deliver it up by capitulation, and reserve for some crisis their lives, which their own heads scorn to own inferior to that of the Grand Master. In this crisis we are to-morrow about to stand. Let me have your advice, my brother.” 
“Rely on it, my noble friend, that you shall not want my best support to endorse the obedience which we sware to grant, and sad must be the times which approach the Order, when the support of one individual shall be necessary to enforce a vow on the observation of which its very existence depends.” 
Arrived at the citadel of Saint Angelo, the Commander found a splendid lodging prepared for him in the mansion of the Grand Master himself, who solicited his company as a guest, expressing his hope they would be in society with each other as much as the duties of both would permit. Meantime the Grand Master led the way into a small apartment, graced, as is the custom of Malta, with a belvidere, or projecting balcony, from which they commanded the fortifications. He sounded a silver bell which was on the table, and a domestic attended them bearing two large silver goblets. Bowing with a grave and yet hospitable air to the Commander, the Grand Master took off his cup of liquor, then called for his sleeping drink, and Don Manuel followed his host’s example. 
“I ought here to bid thee good night, my brother,” said the Grand Master, “but I cannot commit thee to rest without imparting to you what most of all sits heavy on my soul concerning the event of to morrow. You have often heard of my nephew, who has risen high in the Order, perhaps the higher out of good will to me, as I recall

respecting a similar case in your family. I am sure you must rejoice in the advancement of the young Knight, and that it will grieve you to hear, that in picking on the supply to be sent to Saint Elmo, the fatal lot has been drawn by my own darling nephew. It was no doubt easy to have changed his destination, but with what face could I have urged others to send their children and nephews to a post from which I withdrew my own by authority?” 
The Commander pressed his friend’s hand. “I must see the young man to-morrow,” he said, “ere he goes upon this perilous duty.” “Yes,” said the Grand Master, firmly, “for it is even heaven to earth if you should after to-morrow have another opportunity to do his father’s relative such a courtesy.” 
With this brief intimation of what might be the fate of to-morrow, the two old men took a silent leave for the night, with tears such as heroes weep. Turning again with ceremony, they signed towards each other the blessed cross, and in that sign of hope and consolation wished goodnight to each other. 
Chapter Seven 
T  was a heavy one over all the defences of Malta, but especially upon the fort of Saint Elmo, which had been defended against so many desperate assaults. A skiff with a flag of truce, which the Christians had applied for, for the purpose of withdrawing the dead from the lines and trenches, put off from Saint Elmo and carried back to Saint Angelo the commissioners understood to bring their opinion concerning the attack on the fort. 
Meantime most of the Knights of Malta who had been sent to the relief of Saint Elmo, to the number of well nigh fifty of the youngest and stoutest of the Order, had considered the absolute certainty of their falling in defence of a place which was on the whole but unten able, and thus losing their lives without fame, excepting the con sciousness of having done their duty. The defence already offered against almost incredible odds, was such as could scarce be believed, and if it was to be continued on such terms, it could only end with the slaughter of the whole garrison. 
Moved by these considerations, and the ordinary value which men have to their own preservation, the defenders united in an approach to the Grand Master and the Order in council, expressive of the certainty of their failing in this last attempt of relieving Fort Saint Elmo; they would assuredly be, if taken, put to the sword without receiving any quarter from the fierce and barbarous enemy.

petition continued in a tone proffering the most absolute obedience to their Grand Master if, upon consideration, he should think it best to insist upon it. “Think not, most venerable Grand Master, that we neglect our oath of obedience, the solemn duty with which we are bound to obey you, as your submissive and obedient children. We are incapable of such meanness as seeking to evade our oaths, par ticularly at this moment when we are almost sure to exchange earth for paradise. Let us but know, that the defence of the island depends on our fighting to the last in Saint Elmo, and you shall find bold hearts and determined hands, who shall execute your commands with no less readiness than our predecessors at the command of Villiers de L’Isle Adam defended Rhodes for years, and at the expence of hundreds, and have left behind them a reputation for devoted courage and unhesitating obedience to a Grand Master, who bore a name not to be pronounced in the Order without eternal praises. Nor shall any further appeal to your matured judgement come from your faithful children, until the wild cries of the Moors shall announce to your Reverence the devoted inferiors have fulfilled their fate, and closed by their death the trial of their obedience.” There was another clause before the petition ended. “Although the natural love of life has drawn the subscription of many to this petition, courage and sense of duty on all occasions have long since put them far beyond any suspicion of evading their duty, in whatsoever circum stance; we have selected seven of those whose persons we respect, and who will add anything farther that may be necessary to explain the present petition, and we also refer to the excellent commissioners appointed by your reverend paternity, two of whom have thought it their duty to present a petition of the same purport as the present; praying your Lordship, that, unless you shall see it unnecessary that we lay down our lives like men of honour and Knights of our holy Order of Saint John, we shall offer no further resistance, but prepare to do so, recommending them to that heavenly master whose will, using your voice, is now pleased to call for them.” 
The Grand Master De la Valette saw the skiff set off from the little fort of Saint Elmo, and made no doubt of the purpose of an appeal from his decision which it bore to the council. Resolving, as is wisest with opposition of any kind, to meet it as boldly as he could, he appointed the great bell of the church of Saint John to be rung, as a signal that the Knights should meet directly in the council room, which, in memory of this and other memorable councils of which it was esteemed the scene, was renowned as a sort of vestry in which the Order held its general meetings when summoned by the bell. 
At present, it may supposed, the members of the Order felt the

utmost anxiety concerning the purpose of a public meeting, and various rumours were set on float, and excited corresponding anxiety. It was said, that the Knights ordered to reinforce Saint Elmo had refused to obey, and declared they would give it up to the enemy; a piece of treachery never heard of in the annals of the Order, and the very thought of which called forth tears from the old Knights, who avowed, that if such a scandalous dereliction of principle occurred, they would think every drop of life too little to wipe away the disgrace. Another report, equally unfounded, was averred as confidently, and, like the other, without one article of truth. Meantime the Knights put on their vestments: some, who expected to be soon ordered into action, in such parts of their armour as they continued to wear, and others still wearing their habits of peace, which, if we can judge from those which remain, were much like that of a justice of the present day, having a full periwig, and resembling a baron without his official robes. Entering into the body of the great church, (one of the finest in Europe, and dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, pro tector of the Order,) the Knights began to divide themselves into separate pelot0ns called their langues, or tongues, each of which held a particular rank in the Order. (The English Tongue was broken up in consequence of the heresy of Henry VIII, and was again disused on the accession of Queen Elizabeth, after which they had no longer a share in any of the triumphs recorded by the Chancellors of the Order of which they were once firm assistors.) Behind the church extended a train of funeral aisles, every grave having a tombstone of carved marble, with ornaments of lapis lazuli, malachite, and other precious stones. Out of this house of tombs the Knights, still formed in their several Languages, found their way by separate entrances into their Chapter House, or place of meeting, where, arranging themselves according to their rank in the Order, they held their general assemblies when cited to do so by the Grand Master. 
This high officer, the president, or rather the prince, of the Order, and who ranked as such among the princes of Europe—those even who were far more powerful and wealthy than himself—sate in an elevated seat in the midst of his living and the memorials of his dead brethren, bearing on their tombs the memory of their bold deeds, and of the faith and valour for which they had been renowned in their day. The roof of this magnificent Chapter House was also itself full of history of the past times of the Religion, as the Order was emphatically termed, and reminded the Knights who now occu pied it, that their predecessors, when summoned to make their choice between the world and their vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity, as they themselves were called upon to do, had chosen the better

part, and had their reward. The portraits of the fathers of the Order were delineated upon their memorials, dressed in no other garments than those which should accompany them to the grave. Their swords are gliding from their extenuated forms, their armour falls to earth as that for which they have no longer any use, and their faces are turned upwards with the expressions of those whose heavenly recom pence is about to be paid them. It is a fine illustration of the lines of Coleridge: 
The good knights are dust, 
And their bright swords are rust; 
Their souls are with the saints we trust. 
John de Valette, feeling the pressure of a charge at least as weighty as had oppressed any of those whose deeds he was called upon to emulate, sate looking upwards, so as to direct the gaze of the Knights in the same direction, and listened with a doubtful expression to the petition of the younger Knights, whose less firmness of temper he seemed to compare with that of their predecessors in the like circum stances. This was no sooner finished than the Grand Master, sensible of the benefit of decision in such cases, said: “My brethren, it is scarce necessary to say, that every proposal from our younger breth ren, especially if it differs from, and craves an alteration from, one which we have ourselves felt it our duty to adopt, must be heard by us with every indulgence as to meaning and motive. The subscribers to this petition are the youngest Knights, the whole hopes, as it were, of the Order; and, feeling and hoping them to be the portion on which its future fame must rest, we have thought it just and honourable to them to assign to them that part of the defence which, if left to themselves, would, in the idea we have of the increased opportunity of acquiring fame, have been their own choice. And notwithstanding the petition we have heard just communicated, we cannot, and will not, ascribe their remonstrances to any motive approaching to personal reluctance, or consideration of danger. Our brothers are highborn gentlemen, and incapable of so mean a thought —they are Christian Knights, and would have died before they gave it utterance—But we ourselves may have easily erred in this matter, in supposing that a course which would have been thought justifiable in the time of Villiers de Lisle Adam, may be also justified under a Grand Master of less experience and judgement. If it be so, I will at least hope that I am not considered as obstinate in my error, and I will presently show you how willing, nay eagerly desirous, I am to repair it. We had imposed upon you the dangerous task of defend ing to the very last the fort of Saint Elmo; but it seems, that in sending older brothers of the Order, we shed men less capable of

the bodily exertion necessary in such service, but perhaps more capable by length of years of discovering what mode of defence may be adopted with success, when the defenders are cut off. We there fore, my brethren, have resolved that the Grand Master himself, with a list of the brethren the most experienced in the Order, shall be sent upon their own proposal to the defence of Saint Elmo, in exchange of those who were last ordered; and, although perhaps we are older than is convenient for such active duty, we trust in our patron saint, that he will make supple and vigorous the joints which have grown stiff in his service, and we rejoice that we may look to have our place supplied, when the time shall come, by our brethren who now decline to occupy it in the first place. It is, therefore, the peremptory will of the reverend meeting, that instead of the Knights formerly named, the number of sixty, the highest official persons and of the longest service in the Order, shall take upon them the relief of the fort of Saint Elmo, which they shall defend to the last in the stead of those appointed by the most recent order of the venerable Convent. 
The fathers heard with great interest the speech of the Grand Master, and all of the petitioners felt, that in accepting his proposal, they should in plain terms make themselves guilty of the crime of breaking their vow of obedience, in which they stood so particularly bound. Their words were embarrassed, their looks were discom posed, their reply to the Grand Master was uncertain, as they endeav oured to retreat from their petition, wishing they had never presented it. “Father,” said one of the most general favourites who had sub scribed the paper, “we have erred; and who dare say, that he has not erred twenty times a-day, or who dare hope for pardon but through the mercy of our heavenly father, who has promised his forgiveness to all those who make confession of their errors in spirit and truth. We detest the selfishness which must have made us guilty of parricide by throwing upon our elders, our worthiers, and our betters a task of danger more justly destined to ourselves. Let, therefore, our names stand for service as they did formerly, and if I fight not as becomes one who expects heaven for his reward, let my name be blotted from the honoured roll of the Knights of the Order.” 
The exclamation of the young man was joined by the prayers and tears of the assembly, and those thick sobs both from old and young which on such occasions say more of wounded pride, conscious remorse, and sense of error than can in any other or less passionate manner be expressed. An officer now submissively advanced in name of the inhabitants of Malta and Gozo, praying of the kindness of the Grand Meeting to hear them, as they were wont to do in the crisis in

which those islands were placed; and they were now readily admitted by La Valette, as his attention to those vassals of the Order, in respect of defence of their families and distribution of provisions, had made such impression upon them as left him nothing to fear from anything which they might wish to communicate. He therefore desired them to be admitted so soon as the meeting should have done its proper business. “My children,” he then said, “but that I am conscious, that you might think it a mere boast on my part, and that no one will deem it a step necessary for cleansing a suspected character, I would entreat, that the order of service should still stand altered as far as concerns the Grand Master, and that he be permitted to take his fate with the brave men who are to defend Saint Elmo.” 
This proposal was received with a general cry of “No, no, no!” from every quarter, as it would in fact refuse those who had been guilty of a passing error the privilege of retreating from it, and encour age the idea, that they had supposed the original nomination was dictated by their father out of regard to his personal safety. 
“On the contrary,” said the young fiery Spaniard Ludovic de Garcia, “I propose, that Henry de la Valette, nephew and presumptive heir of our venerable Grand Master, be removed from the post of Saint Elmo, and transferred with his uncle’s permission to the citadel of Saint Angelo. If thereby we should save the Grand Master a moment of anxiety which affects his own honourable family, let us think it but a small part of the debt which we owe him, whose whole thoughts are given to the public.” 
A general applause was given to this proposal, to which the Grand Master replied, with the drops thickening in his aged eyes: “To refuse to accept what you intend as a mark of your regard, would seem to some dull, and ill accommodated to our circumstances; and yet I must remind you, dear brethren, that if it should be ordained, that my nephew shall die in his harness, it is neither your direction or mine can alter his destination. It is little merit to say with resigna tion ‘God’s will be done,’ since by God’s will it must be finally decided.” He wiped his watering eyes, adding in a more cheerful tone, “We must hear our vassals of Malta—this is no moment to affront any set of men, and I believe their intentions towards us to be most faithful. Admit them, officers, with that regard which vassals so faithful merit at the hand of the grateful master.” 
With this, a number of men entered who had grown old with the hardy exercises of the agriculturist, the fisher, and the vine-dresser, displaying sun-burned visages, dark curly hair, and a short dress of green. Carabines, daggers, and pistols, worn as a familiar part of their dress, plainly showed that, living in a warlike time, they were

constantly habituated with their weapons, and formed indeed a body of sharpshooters who, serving in regular practice, were incapable of being excelled. They presented themselves before the Knights with that appearance of awe and submissive respect with which feudal dependants at that period spoke to their superiors; especially if received, as in the present case, with a degree of urbanity not always extended to dependants of that description. 
After the most plain and reverential expressions in their native language, a species of Arabic, which was understood by those of the Order who resided in the island and many such as were present on this occasion, they declared themselves perfectly satisfied with the provision which had been made for the vassals of Malta, Comino, and Gozo, and expressed their full hopes, with the blessing from the Almighty, of a happy result. “One thing alone which prevails upon us to take the liberty of now intruding upon your councils, is a general report current among the defenders of the islands, that in this next defence of the fortress of Saint Elmo, the person of our mutual father, the Grand Master himself, is to be exposed like that of a common soldier, although it is well known, that the barbarity of the infidel Pacha Piali is such as to threaten no quarters upon the occa sion. Your vassals and petitioners do not pretend to instruct your Lordships in affairs of battle, which have been your profession; but you as well as they know the sacred authority which tells that, when God permits the sheep to be scattered, he scatters the shepherd as what must produce that natural consequence. Now no mariner ever enjoyed a prince or director to whom he was more attached than they are at this time to the present Grand Master; and they can only say that, if the risk of exposing his venerable person can be rendered unnecessary by hazarding those of any proportion of less con sequence, the Maltese regiments are desirous of having the honour of supplying whatever force may be necessary to defend the fort of Saint Elmo to the last, whether it be a company, or regiment, or a yet larger division of the inhabitants. Their wives and families join in the same request, willing as they are to expose their husbands and sons to death itself, rather than they should perish at once by a blow so irretrievable as the death of the Grand Master. Give your orders for the numbers wanted, and you shall see your vassals of Malta, Comino, and Gozo, every man of them, eager to have their share in a conflict so honourable as that which will protect our noble master’s safety in exchange for our own.” 
The address was ended, and the most cordial thanks were returned by the Grand Master to the armed petitioners for the animation for the public defence which dictated their application. A company or

two he would order to support Saint Elmo, where in the latter part of the last attack they had experienced considerable loss by the superi ority of the sharpshooters, who, being all Janizaries, picked men in great numbers, and well skilled in the weapon, scarcely suffered any opponent to show himself. “To these pagan dogs we will find an adequate opposition in a party of these vassals of Malta, than whom none meet the infidels better at their own weapon.” As touching the Grand Master, he trusted no reluctance on his own part should be found to expose himself, as became his honourable seat among his brethren; but the Convent had come to a general resolution that morning, that the defence of Saint Elmo was not sufficiently import ant to venture exposing the standard of the Religion and the person of the Grand Master. That point had not yet arrived when all must take an equal risk. When it came, if God’s pleasure were that come it should, he doubted not but to fight at the head of every brave man, Knight or vassal, whom heaven should so far honour as to reserve him to die in the last ditch of those defences. 
The Maltese retired with that gallant expression of countenance which brave men bear when they have uttered a vow of resolution, manhood, and every feeling which makes an honourable sentiment acceptable to those who form it. Meanwhile, the looks of the younger Knights were embarrassed, and still more so when they observed, that the eyes of the Commander Don Manuel were bent upon them with a frowning and severe expression of countenance. Nothing irrit ates a noble feeling more than the consequence of being twitted with an error by friends to whose better reasoning they have resigned a rash favour, and the Grand Master had no small alarm, lest the obstinate character of Don Manuel de Vilheyna, stubborn in all points of discipline, should renew a debate which had been so happily settled with assent on either side. As the meeting broke up, Don Manuel spoke with a deep firm voice: “It has been a huge advantage to our young brethren, that their petition was settled before the entrance of the peasants of Malta. A fine blot it would make in this page of our annals, to have read that the brethren of our Order, young Knights of the longest descent and best blood which their several countries produced, had refused a point of duty imposed on the part of the Grand Master, while the next page showed that our vassals, men whose wives and families depend upon their lives, crave permission to expose themselves freely, rather than their Master should be placed in danger.” 
Don Manuel would have proceeded in the same tone, but was interrupted by the Grand Master, who was afraid of the debate about the defence of Saint Elmo being again awakened into anger. “It is,”

said he, “an inconvenience which we are to find from the non-resid ence at the Convent of some of our wisest members, that they lose recollection of the rules of debate which our brethren have laid down for regulation of our councils. It grieves me, that as the business of the day is settled unanimously to the satisfaction of all present, I cannot suffer it to be again awakened, even by our respected friend the Commander of Vilheyna and Aldea Bella.” 
“If my memory be less perfect than it has been, it shall awake at the least sound of my respected friend’s voice, and I am silent as to what I intended to say.” 
“Speak, my Lord,” said Garcia; “I can only take it upon me to say, that our petition this day may have given the Commander an opportunity of judging, by his own experienced eyes, how far his honoured age is dishonoured by the young companions.” 
“Forgive me, noble youth,” said the Commander, taking him by the hand, “and hear me renounce all that my petulance may have let fall, tending to depreciate the gallant Don Garcia de Cordova and his friends.” 
The youth’s bold and hasty temper was mixed with a generous frankness of disposition, which induced him at once to admit the apology of the aged Commander, and clasp his offered hand with the utmost cordiality. 
“Dulce et jucundum,” said John de Valette. “It is pleasing to behold brethren to dwell together in unity, especially when the sword of the enemy hangs over them. Meantime, I would pray to speak a word concerning the honour of today’s battle.” 
The assent was given by a species of acclamation, and the Grand Master proceeded. “You all know, my friends, the opportunity used by some of our enemies. I am loth to charge treachery when I cannot prove it, but our promising pursuivant, who was said to be even created a herald at some College of Arms, appears to me, if not already corrupted by the Moors, to be on the point of becoming so.” 
“Accordingly,” said Don Manuel, looking intelligently, “I conceive you keep a watchful eye open.” 
“We only hold him as a security for the safety of our old friend, who has long surprised us with most curious and accurate intelli gence. The instant old Hadja Hassan pays for his treachery with his head, the young aspirant of chivalry is likely to find his head undertake a flight without his body. It is our business to maintain the deception while it can be carried on. However they came by it, certainly they have had information more or less accurate of what is designed for today’s action, and I propose to send a broad banner with the arms of Malta, to maintain in them the belief, that the Grand Master has

taken the field with his Knights, and that he will, as usual, be defended by them with the desperate chivalry always practized by the brethren of the Order when the Master is in the field. I have no doubt this mistake will cost them many men. You are also to know, that, after so much bragging, Dragut is come up at length.” 
“And what news brings he with him?” 
“Little of good, as you may suppose—little was to be expected. He himself leads a squadron of his best Algerian corsairs with fifteen hundred land forces at the least. Great things are expected from this blasphemous villain, who may be said to threaten both God and men; for the burthen of his song is the general slaughtering of the Knights of Malta, and the special object of his malice is the valorous Commander of Vilheyna, his neighbour on the other side of the strait of Gibraltar.” 
“I am honoured by his preference,” said Don Manuel. “Has he been seen as yet in the field?” 
“He has visited the various works, they say,” quoth the Grand Master, “but he only slightly approves of the conduct of things. How can it be otherwise, since this great Viceroy or King of Algiers did not arrange the siege himself; but the works have been approved by the Grand Seignior in person, and they are, therefore, to be criticized with caution.” 
“Terrible to think of,” said Don Manuel, with a sneer.

course, making a different appearance from each other as these var ied. The hired soldiers, whom the Knights themselves had engaged for a certain pay, armed as was the fashion of the period, generally carried musquets and swords, but no bayonets, that weapon not being yet invented or in general use among Europeans. They wore a headpiece of steel, with plates of the same metal. The trunk of the person was defended by a strong coat of iron which was welded of proof, and, with the headpiece and corslet, were all that was retained of the armour which formerly covered the soldier, (a man-at-arms at least,) from top to toe. The Knights retained in many instances the complete panoply of their rank, especially when they held com missions as officers among the hired soldiers; for at other times they indeed sometimes laid aside their complete armour, finding the use of it so ponderously heavy as to be oppressive, and so cumbrous as to counterbalance the advantages of the protection which it afforded. However, other superiors in command remained of the same opinion with Henry IV of France, who found that the protection afforded by the armour was the means of saving many of the men of rank who were entitled to wear it, and, observing that it always produced an effect upon the enemy, he used to say in his orders, that he should know which of his nobility loved him best by their obeying his com mands concerning wearing their armour in battle. But his entreaties were sometimes insufficient to induce the nobles to assume the cumbrous load of defensive armour at all points, which, besides its encumbrance, was supposed to render any wound mortal by carrying a fragment of the armour into the gash. 
The principle on which the combination of the Knights was united with the mercenary soldiers, was altered according to circumstances. Sometimes, they held the situations like those of modern officers, and did their duty in the same manner; sometimes, a certain number of Knights were nominated to a particular post, where they formed a third rank behind the hired soldiers, in order to support them during the assault. Each pitched his individual pennon before him, which struck terror into the enemies’ ranks. 
To be a little more particular respecting the circumstances of the singular warfare: those musqueteers who did not wear broadswords, were usually accoutred with swords for close combat, carrying in their hands, or within their reach, weapons capable of thrusting according to the various terms of war, and similar long-shafted weapons. Some of these were twisted round with combustibles, which could be set on fire in an instant, and created nearly the same confu sion among the Turks as the hoops or circles of fire which we have already mentioned. These were called halberds of fire, fiery darts,

and such like, according to the name of the original implement which formed their composition. 
The Grand Master and the Commander Vilheyna y Aldea sought an upper tower in the citadel, from which they could overlook every vicissitude of the attack upon the fortress of Saint Elmo, and direct from time to time succours as circumstances might render necessary. In this eminent situation, their splendid armour, and the magnifi cence of the plumes which waved over their helmets, summoned to them the attention of the Moorish artillerymen, who directed many guns against the tower where they observed such persons of import ance were stationed, conjecturing them naturally to be the principal leaders of the defenders, on whose fall the event of the siege must in a great measure depend. The trenches of the besiegers, and the posts into which they had forced their cannon for the purpose of battering the works they invested, were filled with Moors of every description, some celebrated for their skill in shot. 
That our readers may understand the manner in which the siege was pressed on the one part, and repelled on the other, we must resume some general account of the fortification principally attacked, which was, in one word, the outer fortress or exterior defence bearing the title of Saint Elmo. The northern outline of this was composed of a bank, which, as it doubled in upon the southward, shallowed towards the shore, and opposed to the effects of the enemy a battery, or outwork, plentifully mounted with cannon, and which was pro tected from any of the works, unless they were made so as to exceed the cavalier in height, and consequently to possess the power of commanding its fire. The Capitan Pacha had, in his zeal for the advancement of the work, forced the besieging troops forward in such multitudes, that the trenches were entirely packed full of Janiz aries brandishing their long fusils, and crying their exclamation of “Allah Illah Allah, Mahomet Resoul Allah”; that is, “There is no God but our God, and Mahomet is his prophet.” Yet, though thus exclaiming their war cry, the shout, whatever animation was in the sound, did not burst from them with the general enthusiasm by which it was characterized on such occasions. The reason was, that the Mahometans, in despite of the threats and blows of the leaders whom they most esteemed, were conscious of the serious danger which they must incur at engaging with Knights, grenadiers, and others, the elite of the Christians, whose fire must command their entrenchments, and by whom they must be exposed to be swept off, at least at the beginning of the engagement, almost without resistance. 
However, as the fatal shot of the marksmen became thicker and thicker, the cries on either side added their exultation to each success

ful discharge which came from their own side of the disputed barrier. Often a closer and yet more desperate warfare was waged, that could have been carried on by infantry alone. A desperate besieger feared not to expose himself in the trenches, that, at the risk of giving the enemy the opportunity of several aims at his own person, he might have the opportunity of bringing down some well approved Knight, or valiant Christian soldier, whose fall was remarked as a triumph by all those who had observed the progress of the combat, and the efforts of those who had distinguished themselves in it. 
It often happened, that a Mussulman and a Christian exchanged their shots, though at a short distance, without the hoped for success on either side, and wild shrieks and groans intimated the despair of the combatants, and the encouragement of their countrymen. The Knight wielded his halberd and long straight sword, his pike, or whatever weapon with which he meant to match the eastern scimitar. 
In the midst of an attack made on a small fortification, the Capitan Piali drove at least four or five thousand men up to the cavalier like a flock of sheep, and compelled them to labour in wrenching down palisades and pulling down mason-work of gigantic solidity—to dis tinguish themselves, in short, by that activity which occasioned their usual distinction of proverbial industry.* But, perceiving that, as often as he led the Turks forward and set them a most unsparing example of patience of toil and of facing death, so often was he driven back, in spite of his blows amongst them with his sabre or his chabouk, as well as the shower of sequins which he flung among his ranks; and that all his exertions ended by their giving place to the Christians, and being forced out of the trenches with only one third of the number with which they had entered at the point of the sabre; he became struck with the question, what he was to expect as the necessary conclusion of a contest which seemed so desperate and unyielding. The answer left him at first as far to seek as he had been hitherto. Yet there seemed to be an assurance, that if seventy or eighty cannon and seven or eight thousand men, which might on the whole be the number with which Saint Elmo was attacked, and thirty great guns and perhaps fifteen hundred musqueteers, evinced no success, notwithstanding their great superiority of numbers, how could he hope for more distinguished progress when he should come to attack with twenty thousand men the Maltese amounting in all probability to half the number, and maintaining their superiority in the same proportion as at present? His conscience replied to a question so important, that before he could hope for victory upon the same computation, he must manage to prepare for it with the * To work like a Turk: a praise universally considered as well applied.

comparatively small forces at present, and two or three devices were had recourse to in order to facilitate the siege of Saint Elmo. With the setting of the sun, the Capitan Pacha began to discontinue the fury of the assault which had raged the whole day, as if by dint of mere force and comparative strength of numbers he had hoped to exhaust the dauntless resolution of the besieged. The bloody and lasting attacks were, therefore, by degrees suspended, while the Moors commenced the labours at which they toiled incessantly, and with no small noise, preparing to renew the attack upon a different and more hopeful principle which might terminate better. With this purpose the Pacha of the Sea ransacked his experience to recall to memory the various ingenious stratagems which engineers —at a period when the science was by no means very precise, nor distinctly understood by those who pursued it, or endeavoured to extend its limits—had recourse to in such circumstances as he now found himself placed in upon this singular and important occasion. For although it could not be said that the island of Malta was fortified in the strongest manner possible, yet, considering the time employed on the task, and the comparatively small number of troops who were available for this defence, no species of work had been omitted, and the soldiers might be confidently looked to for the most desperate exertions of unshrinking courage and constancy. 
The Knights had the usual pride which annexed itself to high birth, great reputation, and long practice in arms, which made death, however painful, preferable an hundred times to the least slur on reputation. The effect of what might still be called their chivalrous courage, extended itself among the more ordinary soldiers, who felt the honour of sharing in their ranks and mounting to danger under their guidance, and resolutely adopted the same alternative of a suc cessful resistance or an honourable death, crowned with the praises of all Europe, and the blessing of the holy powers whom it worshipped through all its kingdoms. 
The very classes into which the defenders of Malta were divided tended also to animate the enthusiasm with which the whole were mutually infused. The Pacha, or Turkish commander, felt a grievous difficulty in ascending to the cavalier of the fortification out of the trench by which the besiegers made their approach to it, for the defence was so obstinate, that for a time he despaired of forcing his way. The very women of the garrison assisted in manning the cavalier, casting down heavy stones and artificial fireworks of different kinds, and supplying their own friends with food, medicine, and assistance to leave the works when so wounded as to be unable to continue their defence of them any longer. They were encouraged to continue

a species of resistance which seemed scarce natural to their sex by the enthusiasm of the moment, and especially by the pains which had been taken to raise the cavalier to a height which could not be easily commanded by the post of attack, so that for a long time the shot of the besiegers was not greatly injurious to those of either sex who maintained its defence. 
But on the cessation of the first day’s combat, Piali imagined he had devised a stratagem by which he should attain the desired superi ority over the defence from which parted so fatal a fire. He therefore summoned a strong body of skilful artizans who had not been active in the trenches on the day which had just closed, and, distributing the task among as many of them as could be well employed at the same time, he used them in constructing a certain carriage for a cannon, of so great size that it might be best compared to a double tower, the inner division of which could be raised out of that which was outward by means of screws and counterweights. He established its station where the Turkish battery advanced most near to the cavalier of the Knights, by the fire from which those who pretended to possess themselves of the approaches, suffered such extreme loss in the course of the day which was past, with so little fortune to the ambitious Piali. 
The present scheme gave him a glimpse of hope. At the com mencement of the attack the upper, or rising, portion of the tower stood lower than the embrasures of the cavalier, and its existence and position could not be observed. But it was the Pacha’s device when the attack began, to raise the upper or sliding portion of that gun carriage; by which the gun itself would be elevated to such a height, that the muzzle of the piece would clear the embrasures of the cavalier, and enable the artillerymen appointed for its service to point the missile, despite of all defences, at those who manned it, and deprive them of that security with which they had hitherto made a defence so fatal. The utmost care was taken to preserve the secret of this new mode of attack, and he was not a little pleased with the device and the applause which his engineers anticipated when it should be carried into practice; the labourers enjoyed a distribution of food and wine, which was made among them at their general’s command, and which he suffered them to enjoy in a brief state of repose, while he himself hastened to make ready for a fresh attack upon the fortification of Saint Elmo on a point that had not been yet assailed, and where he hoped to force his way, even if his attack on the cavalier should prove less successful than he was encouraged to hope.

which we do not pretend ourselves very fully to comprehend, we feel ourselves obliged to resume some particulars respecting what Malta was during this celebrated siege, though it has been greatly altered since that period. 
The port which the Knights chiefly availed themselves of for a haven to their gallies, and a defensible residence for themselves and a part of their retainers, was an inner inclosure, or bight, of a long straggling inland bay which is divided by several embankments. The principal of these harbours was that used for the gallies. For its defence was constructed upon its east side, situated on the dry bank of the lagoon, the species of citadel where we described the Grand Master La Valette and the Commander de Vilheyna as taking their stand to observe the progress of the first attack directed by the redoubted Piali, Capitan Pacha, or the Grand Seignior’s chief com mander by sea. I might describe the style of the fortifications, but it would only serve to embarrass my pages with hard names, which would rather hinder the reader than instruct him. It is sufficient to say, that they bore a strong resemblance to those used in the middle ages, when the method of defence against gunpower began to be adopted and improved upon. 
Close upon the eastern side of the citadel of Saint Angelo, and having, as it were, one side on the fortifications, and another upon the shores of the lake, the Knights had built a large village with buildings like warehouses of various kinds for accommodation of their naval stores and other precautions which they were under the necessity of regularly observing. Lest it should suffer from a sudden attack of the Moors, of whom they were always in danger, strong fortifications, laid out on the best plan which the period afforded, were supposed capable of protecting the Borgo, or town, from sudden insult, and bidding defiance to any attempt on the harbour or the shipping. These were, from their size and utility, the works which the Knights had prepared for their defence most capable of affording them protection. 
Beyond the Borgo extended from the western side of the lake another of those remarkable embankments of a large compass, and stretching considerably towards the northern shore of the harbour. Part of this bank was quite unfortified, that, namely, which was next to the land. The other termination of it served to afford foundation to the fortification which bore the name of Saint Elmo, and which was at present the subject of such violent contest; the Moors holding it for their opinion, that the Knights would not be able to make good the redoubt against them, as there were no defences directed against the land side, and an attack from that direction was like to overcome

the others without much resistance, as numbers could be poured in to an almost unlimited extent. The Christian Knights, inspired with the heroism of their Grand Master, were determined that Saint Elmo should be defended by the most obstinate resistance which the annals of the Order had yet exhibited. This waste space of ground was in some degree fortified at its extremity, which was surrounded by an enclosure of bastions screened on the southern or land side by the high massive cavalier, which during the whole of the day of which we are describing the evening was, with its commanding height, guilty of the greatest damage to the besiegers who had sustained immense loss by its fire. 
Piali now, taking a skiff with muffled oars, went round the promon tory of Saint Elmo by water to examine whether there was not a possibility of establishing an attack upon the redoubt, which had hitherto been attempted by the land side to such little purpose. He saw with pleasure, that the centinels, exhausted by the repeated attacks which they had sustained, and by the warm damp atmosphere of a Maltese night in the beginning of May, now slept heavily, and in case of an attack would hardly take the alarm even until the knife was at their throats. Exulting in finding matters so far at least accord ing to his wishes, by his orders a party of chosen Raises or sea captains, who looked to him for preferment, agreed to meet in com plete silence before daybreak; the suddenness of whose attack, com bined with the unexpected command of the cavalier obtained by the cannon which was made to bear over its utmost height, gave Piali great hope of overcoming the obstacles which he had hitherto found unsurmountable. His crew had hitherto been as silent and cautious in their motions as a spider who lays by a fly. But in his haste at quitting the coast of Saint Elmo, Piali gave some vent to the anticipa tions of his swelling bosom, commanding the helmsman of his boat to bear to the height of Schebarras, where the pavilion of the Musta pha Pacha was pitched. He imprudently gave a signal for more haste in the words “Give more way, men.” The boatmen, who had hitherto observed the mutest silence, on hearing these well-known sounds exploded into an involuntary shout, which in its turn called forth upon the waves the report of a burst of artillery, which sent their burthens across the waves in pursuit of the nightly wanderer, whose ill-timed urgency for haste was so improvidently expressed as to convince all within hearing, that a Moorish cruiser was just now within range of their post. 
The Capitan Pacha did not immediately recover the surprize occa sioned by his own rashness, and, commanding silence among the sailors, made the circuit of the armed promontory under a heavy fire

which spattered around him, though at no certain aim. This annoy ance ceased as he turned the point of Saint Elmo, for the defenders had directions so far to be sparing of their ammunition as to reserve their fire for a decisive aim, which the skiff of Piali did not on this occasion afford them. When he had cleared the northern side of Saint Elmo, he turned towards Schebarras, an uncouth eminence covered with large stones and with brush wood, and intersected by pools of water, on which the Pacha of Egypt, the aged Mustapha, had landed great part of his personal followers, and established the tents belonging to himself, his officers, and the principal persons of his household. Piali felt the necessity of consulting with a leader so eminent, lest he might incur the Sultaun’s displeasure; and though a messenger at the commencement of that morning’s attack had sent him, on the Pacha’s part, a complaint of his hereditary malady the gout as an apology for not making his appearance in the trenches, yet he resolved neither the unreasonableness of the hour, nor the illness of his colleague, should prevent his consulting him that night on the improved plan of attack for to-morrow. 
The immediate forces of the Pacha of Egypt were under arms— sleeping, indeed, but in military order, and with their weapons ready, it would seem, to assume them with a view to instant service if com manded at first peep of dawn. The light of a fire, conspicuous on an eminence, pointed out Mustapha’s tent, a present from the Sultaun to the husband of a near relation of the Ottoman royal family, which had been the commencement of his good fortune. 
In this connexion, Mustapha Pacha had proved more fortunate than most of those who, like him, had formed a matrimonial alliance with the royal family, such marriages being generally contracted under circumstances degrading to the husband, whom the Grand Seignior conferred as a slave. But Mustapha’s military powers were in the highest estimation, and, although he had rather incurred envy than applause by effecting the conquest of Rhodes, yet the Sultaun, if he did not love him, yet affected to venerate him, and would not, it was thought, attempt to meditate any evil against him while Malta remained unconquered, considering him, notwithstanding his advanced age, as the only person capable of performing the task which Soliman had most at heart in the world. 
The Pacha of Egypt had another uncommon advantage in the peculiar parts of his wife, so different from the females of the Ottoman family in general, who, like most eastern ladies, held their rank in the highest estimation and despised their husbands for their inferior ity in birth, and were engaged in perpetual quarrels, which sometimes terminated in the fall of their favourite, and the precipitation of their

destruction. The Sultana Zulma, on the other hand, was a person of such excellent parts, that she was capable of understanding her hus band’s line of politics, of comprehending the rules of his procedure; and possessing very principal interest with her nephew, employed it with great dexterity in supporting at the Porte the interest of her husband, which she truly considered as the same with her own, and suffered to be separated from it on no occasion whatever. 
Mustapha, on the other hand, observed towards his princely wife an appearance of obedience, which those of his rank were often ashamed of, and, contented with performing the office of a lieutenant to a general, resigned the charge of his household of almost every description, even including his harem, of which she was an exclusive governess. Notwithstanding his advanced age, his harem, as an east ern luxury of the most distinguished kind, was filled by the most beautiful women whom treasure could buy, and Zulma was praised for nothing so much as for her attention to her husband’s dignity, in this particular held so important in the east. This happy agreement betwixt a married couple, in a subject so open to contest, probably was on both sides occasioned by the advanced age which the spouses had by this time attained. 
When the skiff of Piali approached to the watch fire, which was maintained at the pavilion of Mustapha from the setting to the rising of the sun, the crew were immediately challenged in the usual military fashion under the presentment of thirteen men, who were instantly recovered on receiving the answer, that the boat contained the Capi tan of the Sea, come to enquire how the Pacha of Egypt had felt himself during the day, and to consult what was to be done to morrow, or rather to receive the noble Mustapha’s commands on that subject. The troops waded up to the knees in the water to bear the Capitan Pacha on shore in their arms, and, safely placed before the watch fire, he was requested by the principal officers there sta tioned, to take patience for a moment till they carried the news of his arrival to the Pacha Mustapha, who would not probably fail to order his instant admission to his presence. 
Six or seven minutes had hardly elapsed when two principal officers of Mustapha, richly dressed, arrived and, prostrating them selves at Piali’s feet, proceeded, after thus paying their homage, to arise and take him respectfully by both arms to conduct him up a little path which led from the fire on the beach where they landed, to the front of the splendid pavilion, pitched in eastern magnificence on the brow of a hill overlooking the lagoon, its brilliant colours of mingled crimson, purple, and yellow sparkling with gold, silver, and precious gems.

black Nubian slaves, Piali was given by the officers who marshalled his approach thus far, to the principal officer of the seraglio, who, with his mace of silver most curiously cut upon inlaid steel, showed him out of a council tent of considerable extent into the women’s apartments, to which Mustapha had retired for the evening. When the Capitan beheld himself before the door of partition from this peculiarly sacred part of a Moslemah’s tent, and saw at the same time from the slippers of the master placed at the threshold, the appropriate mark that he was there in person, he intimated, by the most respectful gestures, his unwillingness to proceed in a manner so uncommon to the fashions of his country. But the officer of the Seraglio, in a low tone, announced that he was sent on purpose to conduct the Capitan Pacha into the apartment before which he now stood; for neither gout or any other indisposition, should prevent him for a moment from seeing and consulting with his noble col league, who sought to discuss with him the business of His Royal Highness. To this dutiful message Piali intimated his respectful acquiescence, and was admitted through an outer room or two to an inner apartment, where he found the Pacha by the light of a lamp which spread a luxurious twilight through a small closet richly fitted up. His seat was a splendid carpet of silk and gold, and among his companions, all females, was a lady, apparently having attained an advanced stage in life, but whose features retained the appearance of much intelligence, and the remains of what had once been beauty. Two young and beautiful female slaves looked with profound respect both on Mustapha and Zulma, to serve whom with the most humble duty appeared to be the purpose of their attendance in the apartment. 
Whatever might have been the real feelings of Mustapha toward his maritime colleague, whom he suspected of a design to cut him out of the credit, which he had long enjoyed, of being supposed the only man capable of bringing to an end the siege of Malta, as he had on a former occasion compelled the same fraternity to evacuate the island of Rhodes, he addressed himself to Piali in the mildest and most flattering terms; and, while he used a kindness of address amounting almost to excess, he affected to regret extremely, that he had been able, from his malady, to secure to himself so little share in executing the commission of the Grand Seignior. “Of one thing,” he said, “I am peculiarly happy—that the conduct of my magnanim ous master plainly shows, that he desires that his old leader shall share some of the reputation to be acquired in this most important conquest; at the least, by combining his frozen age with the resolute and fiery manhood of the Capitan Pacha, to prevent his inevitable infirmities from occasioning the ruin of the work, which, if he could

have given two leaders such as Piali the whole charge, without embar rassing him with the trouble of consulting a poor, low-spirited, and decayed old man, would either this evening or to-morrow have at once sealed the feat of the besieged.” 
“By my beard,” said the Capitan Pacha, “far from regarding you as the superannuated person of whom you speak, I am sure that our princely master considers you as the same conquering hero to whom the renowned Villiers de L’Isle Adam surrendered the well fortified island of Rhodes, and I am convinced, that it is to your conquering skill he also trusts for the keys of this robbers’ nest which they call Malta. Believe me, most honourable Pacha, that if I am looked to, to assist the Grand Seignior, it is only that he may have the unanimous shout of his whole people to surrender power to merit, and place the truncheon of the grand vizier into those hands, where, by common consent, it ought long since to have been lodged.” 
“From common men,” answered Mustapha, “this flattery might have been expected. But it is time we should give up our exchange of compliments, and exchange our several sentiments upon the pro gress of the siege, that we may each of us have the honour of contrib uting all that occurs to us to the charge, which the royal Soliman has committed to us to carry into accomplishment.” 
“Your proposal delights me, noble Pacha,” answered Piali. “I need not bid you remember the measures which we adopted at the last council, where we resolved, as our first object, to expel the Nazarenes from this post, or redoubt, of Saint Elmo, and thereby to effect the safety of our fleet by making it secure in the Christians’ principal haven. I cannot consider anything which has since happened, as the least likely to be rendered desperate by the obstinate character of these unbelieving dogs’ resistance.” 
“It would ill become me,” said Zulma, who had hitherto retained her seat beside the two generals, “to suppose, that a female’s ear is fitted to entertain matters of such importance as pass between the Capitan Pacha and the Pacha of Egypt. Maidens, arise and follow me.” 
Thus spoke Mustapha’s wife, but although she arose and assumed the appearance of one about to withdraw, yet in earnest she had Mustapha’s orders to do no such thing, and it was without surprise that she heard her Pacha say “that the laws even of the Koran itself, were not made for the blood of Othman.” 
Piali bowed low to the Pacha of Egypt and his wife, the relation of the Emperor, intimating at the same time his acquiescence in holding his consultation upon the siege in any company which Mustapha judged politic or adviseable.

“I would,” said the aged Pacha, “that I could regard the issue of this attack upon the patch of fortification termed Saint Elmo as likely to be so effectual as it seems in your eyes, unless some increased strength of battery were employed upon the occasion.” 
“Such,” replied Piali, “I could rather hope might occur to a person of your Lordship’s experience in the science of defensive war, which has now sprung so wide. To show you I have not been deficient in considering the principles of the science to the utmost of my power, I have meditated whether mines could not be run beneath the cavalier so as to make the desired breach. Secondly, is it impossible to main tain a commanding fire by raising a cannon at the time of firing to a high point of aim, and making it so as to be out of aim from the guns on the cavalier the moment its discharge has had its effect? Lastly, I have contemplated an attack to be made on water as well as land by a large body of captains and mariners, who volunteered their services for that duty.” 
The astucious old Pacha remarked the three proposals of Piali, and, when he ceased, made answer in the following manner: “These counsels resemble the zeal and skilfulness of the valiant soldier who gave them birth, and if I have the least doubt of success, it is owing to circumstances which are uncontrollable, far less from the general rules of the science, than from peculiarities belonging to this accursed island, which Nature herself appears to have guarded against the preparations by which assaults are facilitated in other countries. Thus I should despair of perfecting mines in a soil where the flinty rock lies within two or three inches of the turf itself. Secondly, I fear that, however encouraging the device of the moveable cannon, it would be finally destroyed by the fire from the hostile battery. Thirdly, whatever be the bravery of the Moorish mariners, we must not forget, that the Christians have two regiments of Malteses, trained to swim and work in the waters almost during their whole lives, and who, I greatly suspect, will be found superior to your Raises and sailors in the very trade in which you trust to them.” 
He paused, and Piali therefore subjoined, with much mortifica tion: “The Pacha of Egypt, therefore, is of opinion, that my poor thoughts are unlikely to succeed.” 
“Far from it,” answered Mustapha; “but we have already sustained an immeasurable loss, and we ought not to expose ourselves to it again without being certain of obtaining a proportional advantage to balance our disadvantage. I should, nevertheless, be willing to incur a great risk to his Majesty’s forces, trusting to the zeal of our Janizaries and Spahis, were it not for the terms of our commission, which command us to act in conjunction with the Viceroy of Algiers, with

whom, owing to Dragut’s absence, we have no opportunity to con sult.” 
“So be it,” answered Piali, with a suppressed spirit of displeasure. “Unless I am much misinformed, Dragut arrived at Malta this even ing, and has had the unpleasing surprize to find his ancient enemy Don Manuel de Aldea Bella y Vilheyna arrive just a cannon shot before him, and escape him, though watching for him, by just the same distance of time. He will be cursing to the pit of darkness the small space of time by which he has lost so important a hazard.” 
The distant sound of trumpets was heard, with accompaniment of cymbals, such as usually announce the approach of oriental persons of regal rank. Mustapha held up his fingers as imposing silence. “’Tis this Viceking Dragut,” he said, “who comes at length to instruct on the subject of their duty the fools, whose rise in the wars of the sublime Porte rivals the entrance of that truly royal warrior into the marauding service which was the commencement of his career. He will soon give his assistance to those whom the Grand Seignior esteems to stand in so much need of it.” 
Piali, gladly catching at Mustapha’s tone of displeasure, observed, that the Viceroy Dragut did indeed, for a man of so much talent in battle, set rather too much store by what was, after all, only a substitute authority. 
“But, Capitan of the Sea,” replied the old vizier, “I am well assured, that you, a true believer of the prophet, are convinced that the com mander of the faithful is invested in the direction of his kingdom with the power of selecting those who are the fittest agents for his purpose—in which you, as well as I, are far from making an exception of the Renowned Dragut, to whom we are directed by our commission to submit our own judgement on this occasion—and whose choice of his leader-in-chief is doubtless inspired by immediate direction of that heaven which sends him to be our Sultaun.” 
“Unquestionably,” said Piali in reply, perceiving that the wily old vizier of Egypt was not disposed to make common cause with him against the Viceroy of Algiers, or indeed in any respect to throw aside that mask of profound dissimulation which he was considered as having worn during the greater part of his long life. 
The Capitan Pacha, therefore, rose to take his leave, saying, that as they could not know whether Dragut might approve of the altera tion of scheme which they had ventured to fix upon for to-morrow, he would retire to his quarters in order to see that all was in prepara tion; or, if the mode of attack should meet with Dragut’s disapproba tion, all should be held in readiness to make such alterations as his opinion might render necessary. He then mentioned where he would

be found at any hour that evening when Mustapha should again summon him to a council. Exchanging an adieu so respectful on both sides as to amount almost to prostration, the two generals parted for the present, with the agreement to keep themselves in readiness to hold a meeting again that night, as they were like to be summoned to such by Dragut, on whose opinion Soliman reposed such reliance. 
“Look at that man,” said Mustapha to his wife in the privacy of his matrimonial tent, and directing his meaning by his looking after his colleague, the Capitan Pacha. “He is but a youth in comparison, yet dreams of betraying me into a confidence, which might, were I dull enough to rush into it, cost me my pachalik and my life. Rely upon it, Zulma, he desires to represent me to thy most serene kinsman as having united with him in the hazardous and precarious attack which he proposes for to-morrow, whereas I knew nothing that such a plan was proposed, or that the Viceroy of Algiers was arrived, until the night-watch.” 
“I can bear witness to the reality of Piali’s conduct respecting the plan which he has just proposed; and, if my nephew applies to me for information, the sage Mustapha’s conduct on this occasion is not like to be falsely represented.” 
“Zulma,” replied the Pacha of Egypt, “thou art one of those excel lent women to whom heaven of old intrusted the direction of their husbands, when they intended to raise them to high achievements. We will be watchers to-night, Zulma, for I think Dragut will hardly venture to delay consulting with me; and it behoves me as soon as possible to discover the humour he is in, lest this seaman should make a friend and ally of the Viceroy, since the mariners are in general friends to a leader of their own profession.”

made acquainted with it; and they accepted it as a signal of attack, since they knew he had brought with him a considerable reinforce ment of select soldiers—both crews from his gallies, Janizaries, and others—and they were aware of the burning resentment which he nourished against the Christian men and the Knights of Malta as so celebrated a community of that religion. 
These ideas prevailed generally through the garrison of Malta to its least dependencies, and impressed the general belief of a desperate and pitiless battle to take place, which, in a war so particularly of a devotional origin, was considered as a step from earth to a better world. Other circumstances made a striking addition to this. The tall belfries were distinguished by their long shadows amidst those of the towers and trees, and were heard to resound in answer, not to any midnight sexton hand, but to the brushing of the wings of angels or of fiends, who gave them a degree of mute agitation, and, by tolling such as were esteemed most holy, gave the valiant champions who were to fall to-morrow, an imitation of those rites which there was little chance of their receiving after the bustle of the conflict had fairly commenced. The fiends who were supposed to imitate the angelic messengers, were imagined to mimic the warcries of the Moslemah, and announce their departure to their own place. Amidst the confused and half-seen landscape of the town and fortifications, in the middle of a cloudless southern summer night tempered by an occasional sirocco, these imperfect sounds were heard to resound by fits from the belfries. 
“If it needed a voice from heaven to tell us,” said the Commander of Vilheyna, “that this shall be a busy day to-morrow for both Chris tian and infidel, we have the ancient signal which it is said by the fathers of the Order presaged the bloody carnage of Roncesvalles and of Tiberias, and other great actions.” 
“So it is reported,” answered the Grand Master; “but we may be allowed to doubt, whether the evil spirits are permitted to celebrate over pagans and infidels something which looks like an imitation of the divine rites of Christians departing in the holy discharge of their duty.” 
“You may be right, most reverent,” replied the Commander; “yet I respect the traditions of our fathers, though believing them to be, as in fact they are, one great cause of controversy which has occa sioned the great northern revolt, which it would have been well for the Church if it had treated with less bitterness.” 
“Well, brother,” said the Grand Master, “far be it from me to dispute with you on the tradition of our fathers. I know the sincerity of your faith, and am willing to believe in the tradition of our sextons,

and that they perform after their own death that ghostly office of tolling the bells for their departing brethren. One thing I cannot help mention, which is, that, not in the least less believing in the thickness of the slaughter to-morrow, in which we may all share, I cannot but think that these sounds which we occasionally hear from different belfries scattered through the town, and, more distant, from the casales in the country, are not produced by the agency of heavenly spirits, but are the devout serving chaplains of the Order, bands of whom have divided themselves in parties who shall perform the holy service in the most sacred churches in the town, as well as in those to which most easy access can be obtained in the vicinity.” 
“And the wild cries of the Moors, so well known to all Knights of our Order as the tecbir, or war-cry, of the Saracens?” “It is indeed the war-cry of these infidels, extorted from them by injunctions and blows, for without some such wild means of keeping themselves awake, these barbarians, in spite of the impending danger, would betake themselves to rest before daybreak.—Hark, my dear brother, yonder”—— 
As the Grand Master concluded, his speech was broke off by a scattered report from the seaward batteries, both of artillery and musquetry, which they were speedily apprized was occasioned by the approach of a Moorish skiff, that had alarmed the Christian guards on the fort of Saint Elmo, but had been beat off, and, as was thought, with loss.” 
“This must be the consequence of Dragut’s arrival—but hark, the clamour of the bells is again renewed, accompanied with vocal music.” 
“I am now sure,” said the Grand Master, “that it is the serving chaplains of the Order; for this is a hymn which they composed for the express purpose of summoning the protection of the immortal shepherd for the sheepfold when beset by the wolf, to which the present bears too close a resemblance.” 
“True, my venerable brother,” said the Commander de Aldea Bella y Vilheyna; “but let us hope, that the mercy and loving kindness of the Great Being whom we serve, will, as heretofore, protect his servants who have combined for defence of his faithful people. Hark, the voices now come more plainly from the church of Saint John.” 
Upon listening, therefore, with attention, they could discern the anthem float round in solemn chorus from one quarter to another, till at length it resounded from the old church of Saint John, the patron of the Order. The Superiors of the Order heard this invoca tion with the devotional feeling, which it is the peculiar property of so many of the hymns of the Catholic Church to impart.

When the music had completely died away in the varied undula tions by which it was prolonged through the Gothic aisles and com plicated labyrinths of the church in which it seemed to have had its origin, the Knights once more looked abroad from the battlements and around the horizon, so far as visible, to mark whether any change had yet taken place in it announcing the arrival of day, that prom ised to give signal for a strife so dreadful, and conveyed such appre hension to the brave hearts who, with fear and anxiety, longed, yet trembled, at the thoughts of mingling in such contest for the last time. A very slight and faint touching of a dapple colour appeared in the eastern sky. 
“There is the first faint tinge of a sun, which the hearts of many shall throb to see arise, but few indeed shall survive to see set. It becomes me to ride, or pass by boat, round the several posts. Would you, my brother, choose to accompany me upon this important point of the Grand Master’s duty?” 
“Surely,” answered the Commander, “I will not this day leave thy side unless on receiving a personal signal, for which we must all hold ourselves liable.” 
The Grand Master made him no other answer save an expression of thanks, and a cordial squeeze by the hand, and they proceeded to investigate the points of defence which could be easily visited in succession, omitting those of Saint Elmo as what could not be easily accessible from the garrison, without considerable risk to those who should make the attempt. But though this was the case, Saint Elmo, whether visited or not, was not the less imagined by all to be the certain place which each party destined for the most efficient struggle of the day’s onset, projected and dreaded by both; and the Grand Master, with his companion the Commander by his side, took his post on the most advanced part of the fortifications of the Bourg, or Burgh. On this turret he displayed his own family pennon, and that of Don Manuel, as a signal that they overlooked the defenders of Saint Elmo, whose steadiness had been held a matter of such con sequence on the preceding day. 
When the garrison of Saint Elmo beheld the colours of the Grand Master and of the Commander, so renowned for their experience in war, raise their crests against the eastern dawning, they received it as an assurance that La Valette would not fail to send them proper succour, when they should reach the hour of need. 
Men of the most consummate bravery, when they are approaching a conflict so desperate as that of which we have endeavoured to describe the terrors, feel within them that which passes show. It is said, that a British officer, a man remarkable for his courage, being
