** I FEA& I am in love,'' said Gatty Bell, 
as she first awakened in her solitary bed in 
tbe garret room of her Other's &rm>*hou8& 
^ And what a business I am like to have 
of it ! I have had such a night dream dream- 
ing, and all about one perscm ; and now I 
sbaQ^have such a day thinking and think- 
ing, and all about the same person* But I

will not mention his tief&it ^m^ik bdr'mymU^ 
for it is a shame and a disgrace for one (tf 
my age to fall in lore, and of her own a^ 
cord too. I will set my face against it. -My 
resolution k taken. I will not fall in lo^ 
in any such way/' 

Catty sprung from herbed, as li^tiif is 
a kid leaping from its lair on the shelf <yf 
the rock. There was a little bright imt^ 
ror, fourteen inches by ten, that hung <m 
the wall at the side of her gable window, 
but Gatty ma4e a rule of never looking 
into this glass on a morning till once*%lie 
had said a short prayer, washed her hands 
and face, and put on her clothes ; then sh^ 
turned to her mirr(»r to put her exube- 
rant locks under some restraint for the day. 
But th^t morning, being newly awa&dbed 
out of a loycHclream, and angry with herself 
&r having indulged in sudi a dream^ ^ite 
sprung from her couch, and witiiout liikirk- 
ing what she was about, went straight tip, 
leaned both her spread hands dn the diiissfr- 
ing-^tible, and looked into the mirrar. Her 
pretty muslin night-cap had oome all romid 



tiH»iidrs>4e,'aii4 h«mg \mmght hec- redone 
d&Wfy* of fair hair aside with it, her left 
dbedc and eye w^e completely shaded with 
ihtfse ; while the right eheek, which was left 
hsffb and exppfied, was flushed, and nearly of 
the colour of the damask rose. At the same 
tvM^rhesi eyes, or at least the one that was 
^b]«> ware heavy and swollen, and but 
half awafce. '^ A pretty %are to be in 
los¥^ truly!" said she, and turned away 
&om the glass with a smile so lovely, that 
it was like a blink of the sun through the 
iHfwdiag clouds of the morning. 

Gatty drew on her worsted stockings* as 
white as 'the lamb from whose back they 
had been originally shorn, flung her snowy 
vefl ov^ her youthful and sylphrlike form, 
and wepjtaway, as it were mechanically, 40 
an old settee that stood in a comer, where 
die had.hf^P accustf(Hned for a number of 
yenr^ to .kneel every morning and say. her 
^yers* But that morning A^a^tha stood

thrust her hair up frrai her eye in ben^th 
her oblique cap, until her head appeared 
quite deformed ivith a great protubanoitie 
on the one side. ^ It is not yet my acMts-

herself. ** I will examine myself widi re-

fibackles of love, till she should arrive at^ldle 
years of discretion and experience ; tiH fihe 
could do so without being ashamedof ittd her 
own heart, or of disclosing it to her pare&ts, 
which was far from being the case at thajt 
present time. She trembled at the rery 
thoughts of it ; regarding it as somethiiig 
In itself sinful, and teiiduig to wean her 
from the thoughts and seirvices of hdr 
Maker. 

With a heart lightened of its load, and 
naturally frill of gaiety and joy, she dressed 
herself with neatness and dqgance ; and as 
she looked in her mirror for the last time 
before gobg dofvm stairs, she coidd not hdp

When Misi^ Gatty and ?her nutse reach- 
ed the little attic chambeif; the fimner eager^ 
ly inquired what Ae nurse conceived t6l)e 
the stripling's meaning in the insinuatibus 
he had advanced? The none could not 
tell. Brothers often heard things among 
their acquaintances, that were kept close 
from the ears of parents and nurses. He 
seemed to hint, as she thought, that Miss 
Gatty had exhibited symptoms of love fer 
some young gentleman. She could not tdl 
at all what was his meaning, but feared he 
had some foundation for what he said. 

** What !'* said Gatty, ** do you suppose 
1 would be so thoughtless, and so foolish, as 
to fall in love with any young man ? Would 
it not be a shame and a disgrace for one of 
my age to fall in love ?" 

" Certainly it would, Mifis,'' said the 
nurse. <^'Mt then! many have &lien in 
love at the same age, and even -earlier/'

*[ Dear nwse, how does one know if she

^^ Ah ! dearest child, it is too easy to

A great deal of desultory conversation 
about Edinburgh occurred every day until 
the 15th of May. Mrs Bell, besides many 
wholesome advices to her children, laid pri« 
vate injunctions on the nurse to look strict- 
ly after their morals, and to correspond with 
her privately, giving her an account of every 
thing that happened. The great, the im* 
portant day at length arrived, on which ^ 
the seats of the Pringleton fly were enga* 
ged for .a fortnight previous, and, after the 
usual routine of stage-coach delights, our 
party arrived safely in Prince's Street, in 
the afternoon. The next morning Daniel 
set out in search of lodgings, and the v^: 
first board that he saw out, he went up 
stairs to make inquiries, and view the pre- 
mises ; and, though he lost the reckoning of 
a story, and went into a different one from 
that he intended, he bargained with the 
landlady, Mrs M^Grinder, for the whole 
flat that he went first into, at twenty-five 
shillings the week, both parties free at the 



OF WOMAN. 3S 

enS of every fortnight. They took posses- 
sion that same day, for fear of the expenses 
of the hotel ; and then Daniel set busily 
about procuring the best niasters for his 
daughter. In these excursions; the most 
curious scenes imaginable occurred ; for he 
would not engage a singing-master till he 
heard them all sing whose names were men- 
tioned to him as professors of that art, nor 
yet a dancing-master, until he had seen 
ftem all dance. In the latter art, he chose 
a Mr Dunn,whose manners, he said, pleased 
him best, as well as his execution ; and as 
a singer, he chose Mr Templeton, because 
his songs came nearest to the simplicity of 
those sung by the south-country ewe-milk- 
ers of any he heard in Edinburgh. Mrs 
M*Grinder having recommended him to a 
super-excellent dress-maker, as one best fit- 
ted of any in town to give his daughter les- 
sons, Daniel went straight to her house, 
called, and, without acquainting her with 
his motive or design, asked to see some 
of her work. She handed him a sarsnet 
gown with which she was engaged, on which

md walked out at the door. 

The first fiiend that called on tbetn in 
their new lodgmgs was no other than the 
accomplished Diannid M^Ion of Borottend^ 
who welcomed them to Edinburgh with 
great affection, lamented that he could nsi 
have Joseph again as lus fdlow^lodger, but 
at the same time manifested his. resolution 
of taking up his wintar residence as near 
them as possible, that he mi^t have as 
much of his young friend's society as his 
ttudies would permit Old Daniel and 
Joseph were both alike delighted with thi^ 
proposal, for the latter had lived with 
M^Ion, at least in the same lodgings, for 
two seasons, and he had been more than a 
brother to him. He had also acconqianied 
Joseph to his father's house at Bellsbum- 
foot, and spent a mont^ with the family^ 
and in country sports, each year, and was a 
favourite with ey^y one about the mansion. 
As for Mrs Johnson, she was pofectly era- 



OF WOMAN. 811 

sed with joy at seeing such a kind, an ele- 
ganty and agreeable acquaintance, so far 
from home. From the very beginning, 
she had shewn a partiality for the youth, 
diat scarcely became a woman of her years 
and discretion to manifest, a partiality .that 
she Qould scarcely herself account for. But 
with Gatty matters seemed quite other- 
wise. She;, indeed, suffered him to take her 
hfind on his first entrance, but to all his 
IfifiA inqyineS; she made answer with mark- 
f4 indifl^enpe, if not rather with disdain.. 
She ret^e4 to a distant seat at the end of 
tli^^fa, leaned her rosy cheek on ;the points 
of h^ thumb and fingers, and assumed a 
lo(^ of cold abstraction, frequently fi^g 
bsir dark blue eyes on a wretched landscape 
that hung in a gilded frame above the 
ehimneyf-piece. He addressed her several 
tiiQ^, as with brotherly concesm and af- 
fection ; but she pretended not even to hear 
him, l^nd» after he had concluded, she would 
onlyjanswer with the chilling monosyllable, 
'' Sir ?" and pretend to waken from her re- 
verie. 



86 THE THREE PERILS 

The young gallant was terribly damped 
by this reception ; his manner altered even 
while he remained in the room, and the 
tones of his voice became so soft and hm 
that they were scarcely audible. Joseph 
alone observed his sister's behaviour to his 
friend, and was irritated at her beyond for- 
bearance, insomuch that he tried to pick a 
quarrel with her off-hand. But neither did 
she hear his bitter accusation. ^^ Is it the 
lilac that you would have me chuse, Mrs 
Johnson ?" said she; "I don't like it.— Bless 
me, what was that teazing boy saying ?" 

M*Ion at length took his leave, and went 
away, accompanied by his young friend Jo- 
seph, who, when they were by themselves, 
spoke full freely of Miss Bell's behaviour. 
She also retired to her chamber on the in-^ 
stant of their departure ; and the first thing 
that she did was to sit down and give vent to 
a flood of tears. " My brother has good right 
to be angry with me," said she to herself; 
" for I have behaved very ill, and made a 
most ungrateful and uncivil return for the 
mostdelicate and kind attentions. But little

aione that I am acting ; and from that I 
must act, cost me what it will. O, that I 
could bat regard him with the same indi£- 
ferenoe that I do other yoimg gentlemen, 
then could I enjoy his delightful society 
without alloy, and without weariness ! What 
a shame it is for me to be in love ! A board* 
ing-school girl's love ! The scorn and deri* 
mm of society." 

While she was going on with this pain- 
ful soliloquy, the nurse entered ; and, per- 
ceiving her repressed sobs, inquired anxious- 
ly what was the matter with her ; but, with 
a woman's natural ingenuity, she at length 
confessed, as if it had been wrung from her, 
that it was the thoughts of parting with her 
£ither to-morrow, accompanied with an im- 
pression that they were never to meet again. 
Mrs Johnson rebuked her, and observed, 
with great truth, that if people would make 
themselves unhappy by a contemplation on 
ike bare possibilities of nature, there was no 
more happiness to be enjoyed in this life ;

tint there were too many pamM realities, 
fbr whidi grief was not only natural, but 
commendable^ &r people to tpnnent tbem-* 
selves with the dread of fictitious ones ; and 
that it was both weak and sinful to conjure 
up ideal miseries to embitter the cup of bliss 
that Heaven had poured out for us. Gatty 
acquiesced in the reproof ; said» her feeling 
was one of those paii^ impressions thai; 
came unsought, and would n/ot be expelled 
for a time, and promised to think np more 
of it. 

The murse cpm^mended her resolution.; 
and, to draw her. thoughts to a m<»:e plqa-.

Boroland.

thought people unreasoni^ble, ^d alwajs

BQ^ntainiiig her point 

^ Nay, you must excuse me, dear nurse,

howtiiat young gentleman comes to be re- 
garded by you as the pink of all that is 
courteous and amiable, for to me he appeals 
very ^sagreeable— ^rery !" 

" I have not another wo^ ^ say after 
that," said the nurse. " I will not answer 
it^ ^because I know it is not spoken with your 
wonted sincerity. It is easy to know a:ifeot- 
ation from ^mple truth. Who is sa pur* 
bliiid as uot to see how differently you fed

apprehensions — Like him, I say, poor Gatty 
imagined that every body saw and knew she 
was in love, and that the nurse had in the 
present instance accused her of it to her 
face ; so, without deigning any further re-, 
ply, she arose and left the chamber, her 
lovely countenance slightly suffiised over 
with the blush of shame. 

'^ Ajstonishing !" said Mrs Johnson ; and 
putting her hands on her sides, she sat a

astonishment indeed/ " The nature of my 
dear child seems to have changed with the

countenance. She was at the schools of 
Hawick before, and at the boarding-school 
of Carlisle before; and she never wept at

what did I say to aflfront her ? Only that 
she thought not as she spake. I think so 
still ; and that it is impossible for any young 
lady to think unfavourably of M'lon. But 
it seems I must take care how I speak to:

On Friday the 19 th, old Daniel had se- 
cured himself a seat in, the Fringl^on fly, 
impatient to get back to his improved br^' 
of tups ; for he had nine of Duff's sons, six 
score of his daughters, and about three hun- 
dred of his grandchildren to look after, be-; 
sides some thousands of the lineal descei^-

of the beauties and qualities of Daniel's own 
offspring; nevertheless^ he paid an attentive 
eax to his fiiend's animated eulogies, as^d 
pretended to admire his pastoral proficien* 
^ ; so that before they parted, they wene 
greater friends than ever they had been 
before.

much to the satis&ction of all present ; and 
the two parted the best Mends in the world.

catnbating some mental distress, which her 
father 60on observed, and likewise sank 
dumb, for he disliked all complaints and 
whining, and avoided the slightest breath 
that had a tendency to kindle these. He 
^ke some words in an affected flippant 
manner to Joseph, sometimes about his lair, 
as he called it, sometimes about the Edin- 
burgh lasses. But it was apparent that he 
knew not what to say, for he knew not what 
was the matter with his darling, on whose 
account he had undertaken this expedition. 
He noted her suppressed grief, and the tear 
occasionally pouring, as it were, from her 
heart to her eye, at which Daniel was sore 
puzzled, and more distressed than she ; but, 
as he dreaded an explanation, he W99 going 
to take himself off in as careless and easy a 
manner as he was able. He got it nat 
effected; for his daughter addressed him 
through a flood of tears, and said, — "Are 
you just going away> my dear father, to 
leave me here ?" 

Daniel was thunderstruck. " What 
would you have me to do, daughter ?" re- 



OF WOMAN. 45 

turned he, answering, like a true Scotsman, 
one question with another. " Would you 
have me to stay here and be your gentle- 
man usher ? What is to become of a' at 
hame, or wha's to keep you here if I ne- 
glect my ewes and my lambs, my Cheviot 
woo, and my breed o' toops? What is to 
become b' the Duke's rent, and Lady Esfc- 
dale's, and auld Tam Beattie's, a' three,- if 
I stay here and turn an Edinburgh gossip ? 
An ye will speak to me afore I gang away, 
speak in reason, daughter, for that question 
wasna like yoursel'." 

" Yes, it is like myself," said she, still cry- 
ing and sobbing bitterly ; " it is like what 
I am now, though not what I was once. I 
m not what I was not long ago, my deat 
father, but an altered creature, all gone 
wrong ; and, as an instance of it, I beseech 
you not to go and leave me here, but to take 
me home again with you." 

" Astonishing !" said the nurse. 

*• I think the wench is gone crazy in the 
head,** said Joe ; " you are grown so capri-

** My dearest ehildy what ails you ?" said 
the old iBan, deeply affected. 

'^ Nothing ails me, sir, to speak of; o&ly 
I fed I cannot bear at this time to part 
with you. I would submit to any thing 
r«ther than be separated from you at pre-

" Say longer. It will bemudi longer tf 
I divine aright," said she. 

" I do not comprehend you, my dear

Gatty gave him her hand, but still k^ 
hoM of his till she* drew h^self close to his 
bosom, when she put her arm around his 
neck and kissed him. ^'Remember me to 
my mother," said she ; ^^ and remembeor me 
very partidilarly ; and, dearest father, if I 
die in Edinburgh, I beg, I entreat, that you 
wiH not bury me here." 

*' Gatty, I cannot stand this* Say but the 
word, and I will take y<m home again^ 
though we should both be laughed at $s 
long as we live. You cannot surely 'suppose 
that you fed any disease preying on you ;

for you never looked so bright^ or so healthy 
in your life." 

'' Yes, father, I do feel a disease preying 
on my vitals, which no one knows the na- 
ture <rf but myself, nor ever shall know, 
though it should carry me tp my grave.*' 

The old man stood gazing in doubtful 
concern on the face of his beloved Agatha, 
and was, without doubt, summoning a re- 
luctant resolution to take her home with 
him in the fly, when the nurse interposed 
with that strength of solid reasoning for 
which she was remarkable, and in a short 
time made both the father and daughter 
ashamed of the parts they were acting, so 
that they had not another word to say on 
the subject. Daniel went off in the fly, 
and left Joe to his Latin and Greek, and 
Gatty to her female studies ; but chiefly to 
ihe first and greatest of all female concenu 
to those that are involved in it, — ^he left h^ 
a prey to the most romantic and uncontrol- 
lable love. 

The very next day, M*Ion left his ele- 
gant lodgings in Duke Street, and toc^ the 



Oy WOMAN. 49 

flat above Mrs M*Grindert, the very one 
which Darnel meaiit to have surveyed when 
li^ hinded in the other, and bargained for 
it This was a joyful circumstance for Jo- 
seph and Mrs Johnson; and to Gatty!^ 
heart it gave likewise a thrill of pleasure, 
iiitennixed with shooting pains of the most 
poignant nature. He was now their daily 
vititor. Joseph and he were inseparable ; 
tb^ read together^ played at backgammon 
and drafts together, walked togeth^, and 
went out on country excursions together. 
But nowhere woiddGatty accompany tfaem^ 
not though her brother was of the party!; 
although M'lon essayed his most persuasive 
eloquence, and Mrs Johnson not only ac;- 
qivbseed, but lectured her young mistress, 
now her ward, on her proud and unsocial 
nature. All these things only made Gatty 
persist: the more stedfastly in her system of 
selfdenial. My heart is suffering too much 
already, thought she, more than it is able 
long to brook ; and were I to indulge in a 
free and delicious interchange of sentiments, 
wiut would become of me then ? I should 
VOL. I. c 



50 THE THREE PERILS 

soon^by word, look, or action, betray the true 
feelings of my heart towards one who has 
manifested no regard for me, farther than 
what common civility would dictate to any 
wellbred young man. And should I not 
thereby forfeit not only my own esteem, 
but his, and all theirs with whom I am con- 
nected ? 

Thus did the pure and delicate-minded 
Gatty struggle on against a growing pas- 
sion, that still continued to gain ground on 
her heart, in proportion with her efforts to 
overcome it. For whole nights together she 
tried to reason herself out of her affection, by 
endeavouring to represent it to her own mind 
as the most unreasonable thing in the wotld; 
but theGodof Lovemocked at her subtilties, 
and showed her that he was determined to 
carry his point, without listening either to 
rhyme or reason. Then would she strive Ibr 
whole nights again, endeavouring to repre- 
sent the object of her romantic attachmisnt 
as unamiable, and undeserving of a maiden's 
love ; but alas, every one of these sugges- 
tions turned out to the conqueror's advan- 



or WOMAN, 51 

tage, and he came off from them all» tri- 
Hinphant in his manly heauty and accom* 
]^shments. 

Now, the most distressing thing of all 
was, that M^Ion was as much in love as she ; 
but, from every part of her late behaviour, 
he judged that he had not only no share in 
her affections, but that he was become her 
utter aversion ; and from delicacy alone he 
had previously been prevented from me^i- 
tioning his love and honourable intentions 
either to. herself or her father. The first 
summer that he went to Bellsbun^foot, Gatty 
and he were inseparable. She walked with 
l^im ; she rode with him ; she sat beside 
him on the sofa, with his arm round her 
waist; and even in her mothers presence 
she sometimes sat on his knee. She ^img 
to him ; she laughed at him ; and walked 
ann-in-arm with him to church. But all 
Ih^t time he never mentioned lave, nor did 
.ifbe ^pect or desire that he should. She 
^yer onc^ thought of it« He once, indeed, 
had said, that he had never known so charm- 
^S ft gii^l in his life, and tl^at was the far- 



5S THE THBEE PERILS 

tbest he had gone ; for many a time had 
Oatty turned over the records of her me* 
mory in search of every kind word that be 
had uttered, and she could light on no do- 
cument more conclusive than this. 

But when he went away, then she felt the 
loss she had sustained, and that too surd;^ 
her heart was gone with Mm ; yet whiles 
with all her ingenuity, she ^ould not teaoe 
aught he had ever said to her beycmd th^ 
precincts of common gallantry, she was se» 
cretly persuaded that he loved her. Melon's 
sentiments towards her were in no degree 
short of her*s towards him. From their fir* 
meeting he had become every day more and 
more attached to her, and had resolved, be- 
fore leaving the country, to lay open thfe 
state of his affections; but, on second 
thoughts, he deemed, that, owing to her 
youth, as well as his own, such a declara* 
tion would be premature ; that it would be 
better to endeavour the securing of an in^ 
terest in her youthful heart, and as that and 
their experience ripened, gradually to dis^ 
close the other, as it came to be mutually 



OF WOMAN. 58 

understood* With these sentiments, betook 
kave of her liie first year, not knowing till 
after he went aa¥ay what, ravages love had 
adtoaUy wrought in his heart, or that his 
happiness was so totally wound up in that 
gid's count^ance and fellowship. He at- 
tired himself still more firmly to her hro- 
Iher, resdving to act towards him as a guard- 
ian» a inead, and a monitor; and went oui 
longing for the next year's vacation. 

The next year'svacation came ; hut Gatty 
hy that time had &lt what drinkers dree« as 
the old piKxverb runs, and determined no 
mcnre to risk the whole happiness of her life 
«n a die. She. had consulted her own rea-* 
son, her mother's and her nurse's sentiments, 
and those of every love^song and ballad of 
the country, and she could discover nothing 
relating td youthful love that wasnot fraught 
with danger ; and as to unrequited love, that 
was radcs, strangulation, and death ! The 
eonsequence of all this was, that when M^Ion 
urived at Bellsbumfoot the second year, he 
was jreceiT^ with kindness, but with far 
more coolness than he had expected, by the 



54 THE THREE PEEILS 

darHng of his heart, who had been to him the 
year before as his shadow, or rather as a part 
of himself. Gatty had her conduct padi^ 
cularly marked out and bounded before h^ 
came, and she kept strictly by the limits she 
had set to herself, which few girls of her age 
could have done in the same ffltuation. She 
flattered herself that he loved her, but was 
altogether uncertain, and trembled at being 
made the dupe of common gallantry. She 
felt likewise that she would have given all 
the world to have heard him declare his love^ 
that she might have some rational excuse to 
her own heart for that feeling towards him, 
which she could not subdue. In her line of 
cotiduct marked out, she had therefore al^ 
lowed M*lon two, and not above three fair 
opportunities of declaring his true senti^ 
ibents, which, if he declined, or failed doing 
to her satis&ction, th^n she had fairly de- 
termined, and sworn to herself, to *^ Itek h^ 
heart in a case of goud, and pin it wi' a sil^ 
kr pin ;" in short, never more to expose her- 
sdif to the blandishments of idle and um 
meaning love. 



OF WOMAN. o3 

Bui alas, these three grand opportunities 
nHiich Gatty allowed ha: lover to declare Jiis 
pa^on, soon came> past over^aiid were gone, 
and BO declaration of love was made ! In: 
^eir first sdlitary walk, she hardly gave him. 
time, for she had set out under a convictioa 
that it would he made, and though she long* 
ed for it above all things in the world, yet 
she fell a trembling from head to foot every 
minute that she expected the first word of 
the dear avowal to drop from his tongue. 
The consequence was, that she hurried him 
from one place to another, and from one sub- 
ject to another, till at length she popped 
into old Elen Scott's cottage, and left him to 
take out his walk by himself. Elen adored 
ber.young mistress, and the visit being quite 
unexpected, she *knew not how much to 
make of her, or what to say to please and 
amuse her. ** But, dear heart and hinney

^' Dear Elen, who says that the Highland 
gentleman is looking after me ? I assure you 
there is not a word of truth in that. He 
would not look to the side of the road I

nae the less true o' that, trow-an-a'-be. It's 
a great wonder he's no at your elbow this

In despite of all that Gatty could say; 
old Elen still sauntered on with her, till at 
length up started M*Ion out of a bush be- 
fore them^ and stood waiting their approa^; 
Elen let the skirt of her stuff gown fell down 
from about her shoulders, shook down her 
apron with both hands, and, looking with in^ 
4uiring astonishment in Catty's face, whose 
cheek burnt to the bone, she said, in a hui^ 
lied whisper, " Peace o' conscience ! who is

less. took iBae hmJt, as a protest against his 
further proposals ; and the two strolled on in 
rather awkward circumstances, till they met 
with Mrs Sell, which was a great relief to 
Gratty's oppressed and perturbed mind. 

That night, when she retired to her gar- 
ret-room by herself, her mind was iU at ease. 
She rq^ented her sore of having snubbed 
her lover's protestations in the very &»l 
opening of the desired bud, and. in pairti* 
Gular, of the ungenerous refleeticm cast upon 
his country, which looked like an intended 
afi&ont She coidd not but wonder at her 
own inconsistency, in diecking the words 
that she lotted most to hear, and deter- 
mined with herself to make it all up in cou-^ 
placenoy the next time. 

Anothiar opportunity soon arrived^ for 
ihey were to be had every day ; and though 
nothing save common-place observations 
passed between them, with some toying and 
tHtmg of words, yet it proved a happy and 
deUghtM afternoon to bd^ parties. fiut» 
like the other, it passed over without any

reeved them from the dilemma. 

There was now but one other time r&t 
ittaining, in which, if M^Ion did not dechue 
h&msdf^' he was narer to hare another chance 
flt the way that lorers like best. Long wad 
it ere Gatty durst risk that sole remaxaing 
^mce ; for abe hoped always to find msi^

ecmdesoended to gire himiier hand in tdie

wovks of nature^ and the beauties of the 
creation. They even went so £u: as to men-* 
tion the happiness of the little birds^ and 
the deMght they had in their youngs andini 
each other» and then M^Ion fixed his man-! 
ly eyes oa the &ce of his youtiiful and bloom- 
ing companion. It seemed overspread with 
a beam of pure and heavenly joy, a smile of 
benevolence and love played upcm it, and her 
Uqidd eye met his vnthout shrinking ; there 
was neither a blush on the cheek nor a shade 
of shame on the brow. Their eyes met and 
g^ed ioAo each other for a considerable 
^ace.-— O M'lon, where was thy better an? 
gpl, that thou didst not avail thyself of this 
ftvourable moment, and divulge the tru^ 
a£^tions of thine heart ? What ddight it 
would have giv^i to a tender and too lovii^ 
bi^fitst, and how kindly it would have beeft 
received ! But his evil destiny overcame the 
^c«r intent; and, instead of uttering the 
vmds of affection, he snatched up her hand 
%nd pressed it to his lips. Gatty turned 
away, her &ce, and the tear blinded her eye; 
This was not what she expe^ed, but .the

mere Aimes of common gallantly ; ** And h 
my heart to be made a wreck for this ?'* 
thought she ; ''No, it never shall. I must 
know better on what stay I am leaning be- 
fore I trust my happiness and my reputa- 
tion in the hands of mortal man, far less in 
those of a young and deluding stranger any 
more.'' 

During the rest of their walk, she kept 
olence, save by simply giving assent to some 
of his observations. She was busied in ma- 
king up her mind to abide, without shrink-* 
ingf by her former resolution. But as it 
was the last chance ever her lover was ta 
have, she determined to hear all that he had 
to say. She stood still five or six times to 
listen what he was saying, aud after he was 
&ne, she was standing and listening still: 
When they came to her fother's gate, she 
turned her bade on it, to breathe a little be- 
fore going in ; and while in that position 
she fixed on him a look so long, and so fill} 
of pathos, that he was abashed and con- 
founded. It was a farewell look, of which: 
he was little aware, for his constant aim had 



64 THE THREE PERILS 

been to gam b bold in her youthful affec- 
tions, and he flattered himself that he was 
succeeding to his heart's desire. But de- 
lays are dangerous ; at that moment was she 
endeavouring to eraze his image from her 
heart ; and the speaking look that she fixed 
on his face, was one of admiration, of re-^ 
proach, and of regret, each in its turn. She 
laid her hand on the latch, and pressed it 
dowly down, keeping it for a good while du 
the ^ring. " Would he but speak yet,'* 
thought she, '^ I would hear and forgive

slowly, and closed ^ain with a jerk behind 
them ; and with that closing knell, was the 
do(»: of her affections shut against the &r-^ 
t^er encroachments of a dangerous passion* 
So the maiden conceived, and made up her 
mind to abide by the consequences. 

From that day forth her deportment 
towards her lov^ underwent a thorough 
change. He lost her countenance, and no 
biandishment of his could recover it ; but 
for all that, love, in either heart, continued 
his silent ravages, and JVl^Ion retired from

Beilsbiimfoat tliat second year under grier 
vons astonuhment how he had offended his 
beloved mistress, but resolved, nevertheless^ 
to continue his assiduities, until he could, in 
the full assurance of her affections, ask and 
obtain her as his own. 

Gatty's mind continued in torment In 
the bosom of that maid there was a constant 
stni^le carried on for the superiority, by 
duty and prudence on the one part, and love 
on the other. The former, indeed, swayed 
the outward demeanour; but the latter con- 
tinued to keep the soul in thrall. She spent 
not a thought on the conqueror of which 
she did not disapprove, yet she continued to 
think and languish on. '^ I fear I am in 
love still," said Gatty ; " and what a busi- 
ness I am like to have of it !" And thus, 
by a retrograde motion round a small but 
complete circle, am I come again to the 
very beginning of my story. 

I like that way of telling a story exceed- 
ingly. Just to go always round and round 
my hero, in the same way as the moon keeps 
moving round the sun ; thus darkening my 



66 THE THE££ PERILS 

plot OB the one side of him, and enlighten- 
ing it on the other, thereby displaying both 
the Ughts and shadows of Scottish life. 
And verily I hold it as an incontrovertible 
truth, that the moon, descending the west- 
ern heaven on an evening in autumn, dis- 
plays these lights and shadows in a much 
more brilliant and delightful manner, than 
has ever been done by any of her brain- 
strieken votaries. There we see nature it*

sophisticated.

CIRCLE SECOND. 

** What were you saying about love last 
nigfat, cousin Gatty, when I fell asleep in 
y<mr bosom? Either you spoke a long 
time to me after I was more than half 
asleep, and told me an extraordinary story, 
else 1 dreamed a strange and unaccountable 
dream.'* 

^ Tell me your dream, cousin Cherry, 
and then I will tell you all that I said to 
you about love." 

" Ah ! you told me now, — did you not, 
Gatty ?— ^either you told me, or I thought 
you were gone to a lovely place fiu: above 
me, and I could not reach you, and neither 
would you return to me. And then I 
thought I saw hangings of gold and velvet, 
and a thousand chandeliers, all burning 
brighter than the sun ; and I saw you dress-

ed in gold, and diamonds, and bracelets of 
rubies ; and you had a garland of flowers on 
your head. And then I wept and called 
long, but you would pot answer me, for I 
was grieved at being left behind. And I 
saw a winding«^path through flowery shrubs, 
and ran alongst it, asking every one whom 
I saw, if that was the way ; and they all 
smd, ' Yes.' I asked my mother, and she 
siod, ' Yes ;' and I asked young Boroland, 
iiid belaid, * Yes ;' and so I ran on, till at 
length I saw you &r aboveme, farther than 
ever. And then you ealled out, ^Dear 
cousin Cherry, you shall never get hjece. hy 
^atpath. Do you not see that tremens 
dous precipice before you ?'— * Yes I do,' 
said I ; * but that is a delightful flowery 
biKuk^'aBd the path is so sweet to the senses ! 
O snxffer me to go by that road!' — * Nay, 
but when you come to that ste^, the path 
iaof glass,' said you; V and you will slide 
and fall down into an immeasurable void^ 
9&d you will be lost, and never see this 
^dbbde of beauty. Remember I have told 
yi»u» &x the imme of that rode is LoTE.' 



OF WOMAN, 69 

^ You then went away fixwn my sights 
and as soon as I saw you were gone, I took 
my own way, and followed the flowery path ; 
and ¥9hen I came to the rook, the walks 
were all of glass, and I missed my footing 
and hung, by some slender shrubs, callti^ 
oat for help. At length young Baroland^ 
cousin Joseph's fiiend, came to my assist* 
anoe ; but, instead of reliering me, he snapi- 
ped my feeble support, and down I fell 
among rocks, and precipices, and utter dark^ 
ness ; and I shrieked aloud, and behold I 
was lying puling in your bosom^ and you 
were qpeaking to me, and I cannot tell 
whether I was asleep or not. Did you not 
tell me any such story as that, cousin Gat- 
ty?" 

*' Not a sentence ci such matter did I 
t^ you. It is wholly the creation of your 
own Tain &ncy. But it is, nevertheless, a 
siogular dream. That part of it about the 
rock called Lave, and the walks of glass, 
astoumls me not a little. Did you indeed

do tb^ call him*— 4he young gentleman

it he that came to your relief ?" 

" Yes, and who pulled my hold up fey 
the roots, and let me ML ; but he was ex- 
ceedingly grieved, and I pitied him. And 
more than that, I had forgot that you told 
me you fell from that jodc yourself; aad 
if it had not been some one, whom you 
named, that saved you, you had perished." 

'^ I could almost incline to turn SibyU

I but underrtand this — How it came into 
your head that the name of this dangerous 
precipice was called Love ; fi>r, sure, at 
your age, you cannot so mnek as know what 
love is." 

'* O yes, but I do though. I am not so 
young, cousin, though I am little. In two 
years I will be as old as yourself. And do 
you t^nk that I have not yet learned to 
love my Maker, my father, and mother, 
and all good people ? At my age, tndy ! 
My age is not so mudb short of your own!" 

'.' How Ignorant you are of life, dear 
Cherry, not to know that there exists a love 



OF WOMAN. 71 

between individtials, superior to aught m 
this lower world for rapturous delight, and 
quite distinct from all these. If ever you 
axe really in love, you will find that you 
think about nothing in the world, save 
aJbont the beloved object ; that you would 
never be out of its sight, and would even 
long for an opportunity to suffer for its 
sake, and even to die in testification of yoor 
boundless esteem." 

*^ O, but I do know very well thon^. 
Do you think that I do not know that sort 
of love too? I assure you I have felt it in 
its ftdlest extremity." 

** Pray, who was it for, dear Cherry ?" 

^' It was for old Miss Richardson ; the 
best and the sweetest creature that eva: 
breathed. I just loved to look at her, and 
hear her speak ; and how willingly wouM I 
have died to oblige her !" 

^f Forgive me, sweet cousin, for I must 
laugh at your simplioity and ignorance. 
This love liiat I i^eak of can only exist be- 
tween two of different sexes. If a man is 
in love, it must be with a woman ; and if a

But as you are neither the one nor tbe 
other, but merely ^ little girl, if ev^ you 
have been la love^ it must. hare been mth

" Upon my word. Miss Bell, you vahie 
yicmrself rather too much on your two yeas

bom to be steeples, like some Tain friends 
that I could name. But go your way into.tibie

up in small parcels. Take you that, couam 
A^tha, for your superior laigth of shafts, 
and your two nicks on the horn beyond me. 
And, more than that, I have been in love 
that way too, which I am sure you nerer 
were ; for you have too hi^ a conceit of 
yourseli^ to fancy any other body. I havB 
had all these feelings that you mentioned

And who is most woman now ?*' 

** Pray, may I ask who this fortunate

your nose at with so much disdain. I never 
saw any creature so beautiM, so gentle, and 
so kind ! You have driven him from you, 
and he has been obliged to take up with me

I will do both, if I think proper. It is but

You have been in his arms often and often, 
and have been all impatience to be there 
again, missing no opportunity that came in 
your way. How often has he had his arm

more than I will teU you. So you are 
changing colour, are you? — Who is the 
child now ? — She that professes one thing,

Cherry Elliot, full of vivacity, and blithe 
as a lamb, whipped on her long-snouted 
Leghorn bonnet, and, taking her large 
black reticule, with three silk knots at the 
bottom, over her arm, she tripped away to 
the shop of Maclachlan and Stewart, in 
College-Street, purchased Larent's German 
Grammar, and asked if her cousin Joseph 
had called. The bibliopole answered, tiiat 
he had not, but he was sure he wouldnot 
be long, for his friend Boroland, with a 
number of other Highland gentlemen, were 
at present in the sale-room ; and, handing 
her a seat, without more ado, he went into 
the back apartment, and told M^Ion that 
a young lady wanted him. On the instant^ 
he had Cherry by both hands, sayings 
" Where, in the name of the spirit of the 
wind, has my sweet Border zephyr been 
wandering to-day ?'* 

'^ I came to look after you, sir, for fiw 
you had gone astray. — And there's poetr^

Madachlan ; " upon my word, I believe

"This, sir, is .the Deity of poetic fiction 
herself!" said M*Ion— " this is the Muse

his real sentiments, and smiled, thinking 
how far he might possibly be deceived. He 
went in with her, and found Mrs Johnson 
and Gatty engaged in serious conversation* 
He did not hear the subject, but was re^ 
ceived even with more kindness than usual 
on the worthy nurse's part, whose very id<d 
he was at all times ; and the cold and re- 
pulsive calm of Gatty's face, now assumed 
at all times in his presence, was lighted up 
with a transient and passing brightnessi 
like a sun-beam in a winter day, M^Ion,. 
though still scarcely sensible of it, lived only 
in her smiles ; that approving look of her's 
made him more than usually animated, and 
he left the ladies, old and young, in perfect 
raptures with him. But there was one who 
was forced, or deemed herself forced, to 
counterfeit her real sentiments, and to treat 
every thing he said with an indifference 
little short of contempt, though, at the same 
time, her heart thrilled with the most in- 
tense admiration. 

Cherry was all impatience to carry her 
grand scheme into execution, of sounding 



OF WOMAN. 81 

her cousin's feelings and affections to the 
very bottom ; so, no sooner was M^Ion gone, 
than she got her away by herself, and began 
in the following style, certainly not the 
most cunning or roundabout in theworld : — 

•* Well, my dear cousin ; do you were 
very angry with me to-day for telling you 
that I was in love? But it was you that 
put it in my h^d, for I did not know, till 
you told me its effects ; and I think it is a 
grand thing to be in love. I wish you may 
not be more angry with me now, for I have 
told young Boroland himself." 

" Good heavens, girl ! You are utterly 
ruined ! You are a mere child of nature, 
that knows not one thing from another ! 
Had you, in truth, the face to look in a 
gentleman's eyes, and tell him you were in 
love with him ?*' 

" Do you indeed think I would be so 
simple ? — Catch me there ! No, no ; I only 
told him that I told you I was in love with 
him." 

" And where was the mighty difference 
there, pray ? Believe me, the latter way

was a great deal worse than ihe islther, tot 
it manifested a sort t>f ehildii^ eoni^g, 
that was no cunning at all." 

** Well, well, never mind, cou^n — ^I am

But what think yon was his answer, when 
I let him know that I was in. love? I as<-

Were in love with him foo. Now, iny dear 
cousin Gatty, you must teH me posidvely

Gatty^ colour changed, ai^ her lip qui- 
vered with vexation, at this piece of intelli- 
gence from her downright cousin. It was 
the insinuation whidi, of all others, d^ 
dreaded ; to eschew which she had suffeiied 
so much, and done such violence to h^rtrue

attending it too, for the most part of wo* 
men, you know, must always be in hw 
with one, in the same way as you and I 
are, and it is a question how many more.'* 

Gatty could have listened to her cousin's 
innocent definition of love long enough, 
with the same zest as a diseased appetite 
ciings to its bane, but the allusion to her-^ 
self again roused the maiden delicacy of her 
too sensitive heart, and she answered, some- 
what tartly, — ^^ Neither you, nor your gay 
gallant, have any right to include me among 
the victims of love to this all-conquering 
hero ; he durst not, on the honour of a 
gentleman, say that I affected him in the 
smallest degree. Tell me seriously for 
once, — ^had he the impertinence to say that 
he knew I was in love with him ?" 

Cherry, instead of answering directly, as 
was her wont, sprung to her feet, aijd rai- 
sing her hands and eyes, paced the apart-

in, where she continued \mting until din-* 
ner-time, and after that, returned and con- 
tinued her epistle. Cherry was in great 
consternation at her cousin's behaviour, it 
had of late become so variable, and ap- 
parently so much swayed by caprice and 
whim. She ran to Mrs Johnson, and told 
her what a huff Miss Bell had got into 
about love; that she was so bad of it, 
she had run and shut herself up in her 
room, and she was a&aid might do herself 
a mischief. Mrs Johnson smiled at the 
&ce of hurry and importance that the imp 
had assumed, but that smile was mingled 
with a shade of melancholy, for the worthy 
nurse had not been at her ease for several 
weeks, on account of her beloved ward's de- 
meanour, which she saw had undergone a 
material change, to her quite unaccount- 
able. Her countenance exhibited the very 
highest blow of youth and beauty, there- 
fore she could entertain no fears relating to 
her health ; and, quietly, she was not far 
from embracing Cherry's sentiments, that 
some youthful passion preyed on her inex-

peii^nced heart. At first she suspeeted that 
M^Ion had made an impression on it. While 
the two were at Bellsbumfoot, she had plen- 
ty- of ground fiu: such suspicions ; but^ sinae 
they had come to town, she had wat<^hed 
ha: early and late, all her words, looks, and 
actions, and she could read nothing from 
t^m all, unless it was dislike. 

^< I am afraid she will put us all vnong 
togellier,'' said Cherry ; " she has ordered 
me to forbid M^Ion of Boroland the house, 
«rhich I have refused ; and now> I suppose, 
she is writing to h^ father of some imagi- 
nar^grievance, at least she ivas threatening 
as much. She is going to put all things to 
confusion with us, who are so happy. I 
wonder what can ail my cousin ? 1 suppose 
it will be necessary to humour her in every 
matter whatsoever, till this same caj^rioe 
goes off — to do every thing that she bids Ufi, 
and say as she says.*^ 

, " Nay, my dear child, that would be too 
much ; but it would be as good not to con- 
tradict her a great deal, until we see whether 
Ais fidgety humour continues or subsides.

After waiting an hour, Mrs Johteion 
went and tapped at the doOr.-^" Coming 
just now,'* said Gatty, and sat still, without 
opening. They waited until dinner was on 
^ table, and then sent for her twice be<^ 
fiire she came. She put <m a pleasant mood 
at dinner, but it was eaiy to observe that 
aS was not right within ; ther^ was^a shade 
of unhappiness that brooded over the sadle; 
Hke tibe mist that hangs on the brow of an 
April mom, betokening showers and clouds 
to mar the beauty of the day. She tided to 
ohat in her usual way, 1:)ut her voice wais 
feelAe, and her sentences short and uncon^ 
nected. Mrs Johnson assumed a command-* 
ing, and somewhat oflfended manner, but 
poor Cherry dung closer and closer to h^f 
eousin, while her large speaking eyes wer6 
eonstantly rolling from the one face to .tibe

cxma, manifesting the quickness of the sen- 
sations within ; and when dinner was over, 
she took Gatty's arm in her bosom^ and 
leaned her cheek on her shoulder. 

The latter soon, however, withdrew, and 
shut herself up in her room ; and when 
she came to tea, M^Ion was in the par- 
lour. As soon as she perceived this, she 
again shut the door, put on her bonnet, and 
walked away by herself as far as the Post- 
Offioe. When she returned, M*Ion was 
still sitting reading to the rest, on a new 
work of great interest, and continued with 
them till a late hour ; but all that time^ 
Cherry observed that her cousin never once 
spoke to him, although he addressed her 
several times. She took always care to ad- 
dress some other persoa present at. these 
times, as if her mind had been occupied by 
something else. 

We must now return for a little to the 
Border, and see what is become of our old 
fiiend Daniel, who, on the very day after 
this but one, was found by the Fringleton 
carrier standing without his coat, and with

a long hay-rake in both I»is hands, on pre-^ 
tence of dressing the ricks which his ser- 
rants were putting up, but in fa6t, so busy 
talking with his shepherds about tups, that 
he could scarce get a moment's time to put 
his hand to a turn. 

" Master, I tauld thee aye what swort 
o' chaps yon toop-lambs o* Selby's wad turn 
out to be — De'il hae them for a wheen

Daniel would not read his daught^s 
letter before his servants ; but as soon as 
he got out of their sight, he sat down, and 

VOL. I. E 



98 THE XHEBC F^EILS 

perused it over smd over a^am^ making x^- 
marks to himself on every sentence^ so <that 
by the time he reached Mrs Bell, he was 
quite prepared to speak on the subject, So> 
as fioon as he got her into the parlour by 
herseli^ he took out the letter^ and read as. 
follows: — 

" Dear Father, 

" I HAVE not been so happy here as J 
expected before leaving home, nor so happy 
as I am sure you wish me to be. I do not 
know what ails me, but I am somehow or 
other gone all wrong. My cousin, whom 
you sent to bear me company, teazes me to 
death with an overflow of spirits, which J 
cannot brook." 

" Heard ever ony body the like oV th^t, 
mistress ?" said Daniel, laying the letter pn 
his knee, and taking a pinch of snuff. ** The 
Wench is surely weazel blawn ! Her that 
used to baud the hale house in a gUrewige 
with an overflow o' spirits." 

** Folks are not always aKkOy MrB^, 
neither young lior <dd. If jpuftijft^litfr^ie

thyt squeamishness.*' 

* « j^y^ she*s very well in her health ; but 
ye haena heard the warst o' it yet," 

^' Joseph snibs and snaps at me the whde 
day, until I cry for anger. Mrs Johnson 
is a perfect bore, with her uprightness, and 
saws about religion and morality ; 'and then 
harping on one's behaviour for ever, as if no 
body knew how to behave to equals but she- 
But the worst thing of all is the intimacy 
between my broths and this M*Ion, which 
constitutes the latter, as it were, an iiitnate 
of our lodgings. Now, my dear father, this 
is what I cannot endure, and I do not think 
It becomes a girl of my age to be intruded 
on at all times by a young gentleman, par* 
tkiilarly by one who is apt to make a boast 
(flavours obtained from our sex, ^e there 
b& some who do not speak truth' of him. 
There is nothing I detest or dread so much 
as this, which compels me to be very chary 
in my favours, as well as my words ; and I 
dod't chuse to be always on my guard in

and expect that you will coisieand fetch me 
accordingly. I feel that if any other geii-> 
tieman, whether old or young, were to boast 
of being &youred by my countenance, I 
would not care a pin ; but I could not e^-*^ 
dure such an insinuation from him. Iwsdld 
&r rather die, if I knew what would beeome 
of me afterwards ; but tins is a matter^that 
puzzles me very much of late ; and though 
the thought is new to me, I think oftener 
about it than I am willing to tell you of.'' 

'^ This is a very queer lett^ of our dio^h*- 
ter- s," added Daniel again. ^' It atppewi to 
me that she's grown a wee nervish* The 
antipathy that she has taken at that excel- 
lent young man, is the worst thing of a% 
and a thing that she shall never be encou-

wad rather she fev^ured him wi' her eoun-

fetdied for Daniel, he proceeded with his

himself. ^^ I go every Sunday to church,

never can look up, for I feel ihy cheek bund-

shame. This is a mode which cannot go 
on, so I must leave Edinburgh, with your 
permission. Upon the whole, it will be no 
great loss, for my masters complain, and my 
mistress too, that I make no progress what- 
ever in my education. I feel myself inca- 
pable of it. There is a languor on my grpi*- 
rits. I eat little ; sleep less ; and think 
and think without any intermission; yfet 
nurse says I am well, and I confess I think 
I look as well as ever I was wont to do, a&d 
perhaps rather better. My de^r motbdr 
will perhaps know what is the matter with 
me ; for alack ! I feel that I am not what 
I was. I have some thoughts that I shall 
die in Edinburgh, but, no fears. It is an 
event that I rather long for, but I could not 
bear ^o think of being buried here. On the 
whole, father, I think that the sooner you 
come and take me away, the better.

Mrs JohnsoA and Mrs M'Grinder all about

Ye'U maybe get eneugh o' that when it

heart sair, Gatty^ by speaking sae lightly 
about leaving him. Ye*re his only daugh- 
ter^ and afore he lost you he wad rather 
lose the best toop that ever was in his 
possession, and that ye ken wad be a 
thing he wadna easy yield to do. But, Lord: 
help me, what am I speaking about toops ? 
If I judge o* my ain feelings at this mo- 
ment, when ye hae set me on thinking about 
the thing,' I find I wad rather lose every 
toop and every ewe in my possession. Tn-

This was so exceedingly impressive, that^ 
in reading it, Daniel's voice waxed still 
louder until he came to the hindmost words,, 
and then he shouted aloud, and then daj^pod 
his hand on his brow, and went out of the 
room sobbing bitterly. On the arrival of the 
next post in Edinburgh, however, Gatty 
got the above lettCT, with some additions^ 
together with the followmg one from her 
modier.

" My D^ABEST CmiD, 
' ^ lliere are so many eras in the lifi^ of 
wmnan that are critical^ and fraught ^th 
momentous consequence^, that she eali 
nevef" be enough on her guard during almost 
her whole life. Hers is a pilgrimage of 
painful circumspection, and all her effotts 
are often too few. These critical periods 
occur in maidhood, bridehood^ wifehood, 
motherhood, and widowhood ; and I shaH 
^define them all to you, with that care and 
j^ctuality that becomes an affectionate 
pai^nt to a kind and dutiful daughter. 

^ In the first place, the period of masd- 
hood is not the least dangerous of the whole, 
and the danger occurs most frequently 
dbdlit the time of life in which you now 
nfow. The mind being then too sanguine 
t^be always under the control of prudence 
or discretion, forms to itself great and high 
p^ettH of happiness and grandeur, which 
it soon discovers to be out of its reach. Tht 
^sappointed novice soon grows discontent- 
ed and fretful, and is too apt to keep all 



11 4 THE THKEE PEKILS 

those with whom she is connected in a state 
<if mental unhappiness. Her youthful mind 
)S top apt to form early attachments, which 
ars^ always violent in proportion as the mind 
wants experience ; then, when the indivi- 
dual who thus rashly gives up her heart io 
those vain and tumultuous passions, fi^jp 
herself baulked, and discovers that he^fiiy 
fections have been misplaced, or have nqt 
met with a return suitable to her ardent 
expectations^ then it is that every thing in 
this sublunary scene appears to her eyes to 
be vanity and of no value. It was on such 
occasions, and at such ages as yours, that 
in former days the vows of sanctitude were 
too often solemnly taken, and as miserably 
repented of ; but now, when such resources 
^e no more, it is at such an age, and such 
occasic)^, that resolutions are often formed, 
heaven knows how unwarrantably, that af- 
fect the reckless and unthinking creature 
life, leading her a joyless pi^rim- 



^^ .c^ unsocial and crabbed virginity. * If 
l^^m^qt, find j&vour in the eyes of such a 
le pents^Uy, ' If J cannot attain 



such and such a dear youth for my lov^ 
and husband^ farewell to all happiness and 
eomfort in this world !' . , ;; 

♦* Theobject of this passion probacy knows 
nothing of all this^ nor is he erer likely 
to know ought of it ; for, if he is a modest 
and deserving man, he will approach her 
with timidity and respect, proportionate to 
that esteem in which he holds her, and then, 
ta a certainty, he will be repulsed. A quak- 
ii^; indefinite terror affects the delicate fe^ 
male heart on such trials, inducing her to 
shun, of all things, the rery one that she 
most desires and longs for. This sort of 
innate modesty is so powerful, that, al- 
though it induces the possessor to do and 
say that which she sincerely repents, yet, 
the very next opportunity 'that she has of 
rectifying the mistake, and making some 
amends for a precipitate incivility, and the 
next ^gain, ^U she manifest the same an- 
. tipathy, even though she weeps over it each 
time, when left to herself. Is not this a 
dangerous period of life^ daughter? vski

When Gatty had perused the two 1^ 
ttts, she wepi judging it an extraordinary 
drcumstaace that her parents seemed both 
to know ao precisely the state of her aflhui 
tions, Itemed to see clearly tiie very se<»et 
which c£e flattered herself was concealed 
ftom the eyes of all the human race, whkh 
she bad never acknowledged, save to her 
fftm hearty and never then, but with j^ame 
and perturbation of spirit. She read part 
of bodi idi;ers ovier and over again, and 
wmidered not a Httb how her affectionate 
and Uundenng father should, in the mMat 
^Mtf more important coneems about tups, 
giiBilers, and crack ewes, have souaed 
plump on thfe very spring and current of 
her'f^ncealed distemper ; and that her sen- 



tatAaoB ssaA disereet mo&et should like* 
vmB appear to kaow it intnitiTOly. Thest 
HaagB added to tbe grief and isnpatieiiQK 
that already preyed on her miiid, eon vinciBg 
her that she hetrayed the aeereit which dmt 
dreaded hy every look, word, and action, 
all the while that she was endeavouring to 
coneeal it. To put an end to such 8ur« 
anses, and to show her parents, the world, 
and her lover, that she valued not his pre* 
aenoe or society, she wrote again to her fa^ 
^Kt, earnestly beseeching him to come i^nd 
setlUe her- accounts in Edinburgh, and tak^ 
hst home with Hm ; otherwise she would 
take a seat in the coach in a few days, a^d 
netorn by herself. Daniel was confoimded^ 
hul; her letter w^s all written in such a po^^

her word. How astcnisiied was^waithy^M^ 
Johnson one day» when Gatty said eafeleds- 
iy, that she had written to her father to 
eome and take her home, and that next 
week she should leave her and Cherry to 
the free choice of their associates. Mt» 
Jidhnson. looked on her with pity and re-^ 
gret, and, with the tear in her eye, said, 
f* It hut little hecomes you. Miss BeD, to 
speak in such a style to me. If I have ever 
made choice of wrong associates for you, it 
was unintentionally. I can take God and 
iny own heart to witness, and for other tes-^ 
timony I care not, that, since the day yim 
were first coi&mitted to my care, an infant, 
your good and your improvement have heen 
my sole concern.— ^Toward that were all 
my poor abilities exerted, and I had hopes 
that they were not exerted in vain ; but, 
within these few weeks, I have had but 
poor specimens of my success. The girl that 
cannot keep her temper under controul, but 
subjects herself to unreasonable and fodkh 
caprices, and then visits these on her best 
friends and most ardent admirers, is no

have been my kind benefectors,"but about 
your whimsies, miss, I shalltake no further

tb^.tenderest part, and perhaps you hav6 
been but too successful, which, I suppose, 
anSi.. add mudi to your satisfaction. — ^You 
shall not do it again." 

Gatty was fafarly huraWed, and exceed- 
ingly sorry for what she had said. She had 
no intentions of hurting her kind nurse's 
feelings, but she had been acting and speak- 
ing in the fever of disappointed love, and 
Mt that she was hardly accountable for her 
actions. Though this was an excuse to 
herself, it was none to any body else ; there* 
iote, she perceived it was necessary for hef 
to make some apology. She sat silent for 
some time, and her looks were pathos itself^ 
till at last she burst into tears, seized hef 
monitor's hand, and held it to her ^h€^^

CIKCLE THIRD, 

That very evening, who should arrive 
with the Pringleton coach, but our good 
£nend Daniel Bell, and with him his ne- 
phew-inJaw, that is, his wife's brother's 
gon, Richard Rickleton, Esq. of Burlhope, 
and farmer of seventeen thousand acres of 
land, on the two sides of the Border. He 
was a real clod-pole — ^a moss-jumper — a man 
of bones, thews, and sinews, with no more 
mind or ingenuity than an owl ; men nick- 
named him the heather -hhoter^ from hi6 
odd way of laughing, for that laugh could 
hare been heard for five miles all around, 
on a calm evenings by the Border fells,— 
and, for brevity's sake, it was often con* 
traeted into the blocter. But, with all these 
oddities, Richard Rickleton was as rich as 

VOL. li G

Croesus ; at least he was ridher, by hk own 
account, than Simon Dodd of Rainshope, 
and that seemed to be the ultimatum of 
his ambition. 

The cause of Richard's coming to Edin- 
burgh was no other than to commence an 
acquaintance and courtship with his cousin. 
Miss Bell, and that at the suggestion of 
both her parents. From the tenor of tfadir 
daughter's letters, they both agreed that 
something more thaii ordinary was the Inat- 
ter with her ; and, though none of them 
ventured to pronounce what that something 
was, they also agreed that the sooner they 
could get a husband for her the better, for 
they both suspected, what they dreaded to 
say, that there was some love disappoint- 
ment in the case« They were also aware, 
that a disappointed maiden is seldom hard 
to please in her next choice ; so they con- 
cluded that they might eaisily bring about 
a marriage with her cousin Dick, which 
would prove what is termed'^ gd^ bein 
doumnsittinff. At all events, M*s Bell had 
often hint^ at such a project long before. 



OF WOMAN. 147 

Imt Ihiniel always put it off the best way 
he could. Findmg now, however, that tiiere 
was like to be no hope of his darling M'lon,^ 
he yielded to his wife's project. Dickie was^ 
delighted beyond all bounds with the pro- 
posalf and many a bog-shaking laugh it 
afforded him, both before he set out, and by 
the way. — " Sutor me, uncle," said he, " if I 
has nae forgotten what the wonch'is like ! 
But I hopes that she stands gay and ti^t 
on her shank-beams, &nd has a right weel- 
plenished&ce— Hoo«hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo ! 
I's gang wi' thee, and see what she's like ; 
and, wod, if I likes her, I's gie her a fair 
bode. O how I wod like to suter Simey 
Dodd ! — Babbit him for a massy chit ! — 
He wad gar fo'ks trow that naebody has 
siller but the sel o' him— Hoo-hoo-hoo ! — 
^m do my thing but he^ — Hoo4w)o-hoo !" 
Well, to Edinburgh comes our new woo- 
er, escorted by no less a man than the fa« 
tber of his intended sweetheart. She was 
sittiqg.vOi^.the sofa, casting many a wist^ 
look tK)w,^^ the door, when, all of a suddep* 
she heard a noise, as if horses had been 



148 THE THREE PERILS 

c(»ning up the stair> and the next moment, 
hei- father and Richard Rickleton, Eisquire^ 
stood before lier. He was of a Herculean 
make, with red hair, immense whiskers of 
the same colour, his &ce all over freckled, 
and mostly overgrown with thin hairs, of 
the colour of new mahogany. He neither 
bowed, nor beckoned, nor opened his lips, 
but came striding in, rubbing his hands, 
and making for the fire-place. 

" Gatty, my dear bairn, what has been 
the matter with you ?" said Daniel, on en- 
tering, — ^* have you been ill?" 

Gatty was so overcome at the sight of 
her father, and so perplexed about the cause 
of his coming, that she could not answer 
him, farther than by giving him her hand, 
which was moist and warm. Mrs Johnson 
answered for her, and told him that she had 
been a little indisposed the foregoing even-r 
ing, but was quite recovered. 

" Wod, I likes the wendbi middling wed, 
uncle!" saidDickie ; " sutor me if I dis not!" 

** Gatty dear, this is your cousin, Mr 
Bickleton, come to see you," said Daniel ; 



OF WOMAN, 149 

" you Have met with Mrs Johnson, sir, be- 
fore this, as well as your other little lovely 
cousin here.** 

*^ Snuffs o' tobacco !'' said Dickie ; and 
coming close up to Gatty, he looked in her 
face, keeping his hands stUl below his coat 
and behind his back. ** Why, cousin Aggy, 
is tou married ?" said he. 

" What a question, sir !** returned she. 

" Why, because, d'ye see, cousin, that 
baith thee dress and thee cheek looks some- 
thing wife-like — ^Anda devilish bonny wifie 
thou wad be, too ! Sutoif me an I wadna 
gie a hunner punn that Simey Dodd saw 
thee sitting in the nook at Burlhdpe-hia', in 
that same style — ^Hoo-hoo-hoo !" 

The ladies looked all at one another, and 
every one joined in the laugh, although it 
was so obstreperous, that they were ashamed 
to hear such a sound in their dwelling; But 
a joining in his laugh being a compliment 
seldom paid to Dickie, he went on, in a 
voice louder than that of a drill-serjeant — 
** And, ower and aboon that, cousin Aggy, 
an thou he's, not a wife already, rabbit you ! 



150 THE THREE PERILS 

is it not a very easy thing to make thee 
one? — Hoo-faoo-hoo ! Eh? — Hoo-hoo-hoo i 
Eh— What says thee to that?— Oh, thou 
says naething at all — thou's hlate and mim- 
tnou'd, wi' thy tale ! Weel, weel, thoult 
soon get aboon that — Hoo-hoo-hoo !" 

Daniel asked for his son Joe, and for his 
young friend M'lon, and was told that 
they were together in the latter's room, and, 
as usual, seldom asunder. He instantly 
desired to see them, and sent Cherry up 
stairs with his compliments. M^Ion, how* 
ever, excused himself, but requested that 
his worthy friend Mr Bell, and his nephew, 
would join him at half past five to dinner, 
as he had a friend or two to be with him, 
whom he could not leave, to enjoy the com- 
pany of his Border friends in any other 
way. When the message came down stairs, 
Daniel looked his watch — " Half past five!'* 
exclaimed he ; *' I fancy the chiel means to 
make it dinner and supper baith, and save 
a meal ! But there's aye unco little scran 
gaun amang women — ^I daresay we maun 
take the hint. Laird, what say you to it ?** 



OF WOMAN. 151 

" SmiflEs o' tobacco, uncle !'' said Dickie; 
** what care I where I get my dinner ! I 
likes to get something worth the while o' 
eating and drinking, but I disna trouble my 
head in what place I gets it, or wha I gets 
it frae. M*Ion? — Is that the blade that 
sUghtit my cousin Aggy there, and maist 
gart her coup the creels for sake o' him?" 

AH the party stared at each other, with 
looks of consternation. This irreclaimable 
rudeness was too much for them, especially 
for the nerves of Miss Bell, not yet in a 
state of perfect repair ; and Mrs Johnson, 
seeing her begin to change colour, was 
alarmed, and tried to check the volubility

152 THE THREE PERILS 

Joseph, who had come into the room in 
the interim, hearing thid ad^ess, langhed 
at it with such violence, that he sunk on 
the floor, and, with a boyish knavery, anti* 
cipated some grand fun &om the arrival of 
his cousin Dick, for he knew him well, and 
always staid a week or two with him eacb 
summer. Joseph staid no longer than to 
salute his father, but hasted up stairs again 
to his £dend, and with a countenance beam- 
ing delight, annoimced the arrival of tisie 
redoubted laird of Burlhope, dating his 
hands meantime, ^d exdaimu^, '* Oh; 
what .glorious fun we shall have with him ! 
You never met with such a fellow in your 
life, sir ! If you will but fill him half drunks 
he will go out to any of the streets in £din-» 
burgh without his hat> and dare every man 
there to single battle !" 

^ I should be very sorry to see any friend 
of mine make such an exhibition, or of your 
pwn either, my dear Joseph. Pray, has he 
nothing else to recommend him save sadi 
extravagancies as these ?" ^.. 

^' O yes, sir ; he is a great natural philo- 



or WOMAN. 153 

riopher, equal, in some respects, to our Pro- 
fessor, and &r exceeding him in others.— 
F<Hr instance, if you should ask him about 
die bird called bjthe Borderers the heather- 
bhoter, what a striking and feeling descrip. 
tion he will give you of it ; or of the little 
wolf-dog; he is equally entertaining and 
intelligent about both these in particular, 
and many odier heavier matters. I am sure 
that, befinre you and he part, you sEall 
acknowledge him the most original fellow 
you have ever met with.*' 

M*Ion then went away, and engaged two 
of his friends to dine with him, beside the 
two Borderers ; for he had engaged none be- 
Ibre, that having been merely a pretence to 
excuse himself froin meeting with Gatty, 
at whose behaviour he had been much dis- 
pleased of late, and highly aflPtonted. But 
he knew there were always plenty of his 
countrymen ready to accept of an invitation 
to dinner, even on short notioe ; according- 
ly he procured two to join him, whom he

Peter M*Turk, both late officers of certain 
regiments no longer existing, two genuine 
Highland mountaineers ; and to their dinner 
all the four came at the appointed hour, as 
well as Joseph, who had joined his father 
and cousin. 

The remarks of the laird of Burlhope 
during dinner were such as to make the 
Highlanders stare ; for the former, valuing 
himself only onhis riches and bodily strength, 
not only neglected,but despised, all the little 
elegant rules of courtesy. He would at one 
time have broken any man's head who woultt 
have disputed his being richer than Simtij^ 
Dodd, but he now insisted on being twice 
as rich, at the peril of life and death. At 
this time, however, he ran no risk of siich a 
dispute, for these north-country gentlemen 
knew nothing of either him or the object of 
his jealousy. But by the time the doth was 
removed, the bluntness and homelineiss of 
his remarks caused them several times id 
break out into a roar of laughter. Old Da- 
niel rather felt uneasy at this, for he heard 



OF WOMANa 155 

that these were laughsof derision ; hiiilMek, 
observing no such symptoms, joined them 
vdthhisHoo-hoo-hoo,in its mosttremendous 
temiquaver. These vociferous notes still 
taised the laugh against him, though every 
one present felt for him, except Galium Gun 
and Joseph, who both enjoyed his boorish 
arrogance mightily, deeming that the more 
ridiculous he made himself, the sport was 
still the better ; therefore, at some of his 
rude and indehcate jokes, Galium clapped 
his hands^ and laughed even louder thaii 
the laird himself. The latter was so much 
pleased with this, that he turned to M'^Ion, 
who sat next him, and asked him what was 
the chap's name ? 

« Galium Gun," said Mlon. 

** Eh? do they really call him Gun?'' 
said Dick.—" By my faith, I wad break 
ony man's head that wad call me sic a daft- 
like name !" 

" It is his own name, sir," said M*Ion, 
" his father's name, and the name of his 
clan,"

M'lon looked at Mr Bdl with astonisrih* 
m^t, as if expecting some explanation, but 
the old man only blushed to the top of his 
nose, and then, to hide this confession of 
gliilt, he applied his handkerchief, and ut- 
tared a nasal sound louder than a post«hom» 
Joseph was like to &11 from his chair with 
laughing ; and Galium, rolling h^U eyes from 
one face to another, felt great inclination to 
join Josq^h, but the looks of his entertain-

Dick was no judge of countenances, and

imagined he had said something exceeding^ 
ly witty, and went on--* —

** Certainly,'' said M^Ion, not in the least 
understanding what Dick meant, or to what 
he alluded ; but, assured that he meant in«^ 
soloitly to some one, and anxious to turn 
his ideas into some other channel, he an«« 
swered — " Certainly ; I think to too, sir.

in that country. For instance, is there any 
remains of the Uttle wolf-ehg in your neigh- 
bourhood ?" 

Dick gave over eating, raised himself 
slowly up in his chair, turned his face to- 
ward M'lon, clenched his knife firmly in 
his hand, bit his lip, and, with a counte- 
nance altogether inexplicable, looked sted- 
&8tly in Melon's face, without uttering a 
word. M'lon had wished to improve on ond 
of the hints given him by his young friend 
Joseph, desiring to make the boor at least 
tolerable, by drawing him into some sub- 
ject that he liked, and that he understood 
something about ; and quite unconscious of 
having givien any offence, he met Richard's 
eye several times with the most mild and 
gentl^nanly demeanour possible. The lat- 
ter continued his threatening attitude with- 
out moving, fixed in the position of a dog 
that has taken up a dead point. All the 
party sat in silent alarm ; and even Joseph 
gave over laughing, for he perceived his sa- 
vage attitude^ which M'lon did not, he be^

in helping some of the party with his good 
cheer. Dick at length, seeing nobody like 
to take any notice of him, or to appear the 
least frightened, broke silence, and, in a 
stentorian voice, said—** I'll tell thee what 
it is, honest man ; bee the Lord, speer thott 
that question at me again, if thou dares^ 
for the life o' thee !" 

** Dares, sir !" said M*Ion, without any 
anger in his voice — " I hope you did not 
mean to apply that term to me by way of

** Ay, ay ! — ^gayan bauld chap, too !" ex- 
claimed Dick, and again fell to the viands

took, he uttered soirie term of bitter threat-

CaUum perceiving his savage humour, 
and likewise desirous of dravnng his atten* 
tion to something eke, and knowing of no- 
thing save that which he had been talking 
of before, it struck him that it would be 
better to lead his thoughts again to that, 
or any thing, rather than the little tvolf-dog, 
so he interrupted his smothered dedaixuu 
tions with a speech. 

^^ I beg your pardon, Mr M'lon,'' said he, 
^ but I think you interrupted this gentle-^ 
laian, Mr Rickleton, as he was procee^ng 
with some very interesting remarks about 
a gentleman that had abused the confidence 
of a &ir inamorata; and as I am always 
interested in every thing that relates to the 
other sex, may I b^ of him to let us heu 
that budness thoroughly explained. Fray, 
«r, wer^ you not hinting at some story 
about a fellow, that had whis^red in a girl's

Richard wanted to ^ow off before his 
uoele in courage and strength, and felt no 
disposition, at that present time, to go ta 
h^erheads with him, so he judged it pro- 
per to sueoumb, and he again sunk into the 
ffiUeni^ muttering ooeasioiiaUy to himself 
such words as these : ** Dammit, but TU 
wolf dog them yet! them! the heeland pi-*

through a part of the afternoon, and oon-*^ 
trived to render himself so disagreeable iu

Spite of all that could be done to please him* 
tibat at length^ when the wine began to 
operate a little, none of thethreenorth-coun* 
try gentlemen cared any Airther how much 
they offended him, for they all felt ofiFended 
with him already, but judged him below 
their notice, &rther than to make game <£ 

Accordingly, at a convenient time, M'- 
lon thought he would make an experiment 
of the other hint given him by his young 
fiiend Joseph, who, at his father's command^ 
had by that time gone down stairs to the 
ladies. To be sure the last had succeeded 
remarkably ill, but it was likely this would 
succeed better, and if not he did not care. 
^* Is there a creature on the Border fells that

carelessly, looking Dick in the face.

** I scart your buttons too, sir," said Dick, 
soratdiing the ensign's button with his nail. 
"I suppose thou understands that,dis thou?" 
« Nho— Tamn me if I dhoo!" said Peter, 
with great emphasis. 

** Then I suppose thou understands that, 
dis thou?" rejoined Dick ; and at the same 
time he lent Ensign M^Turk such a tre- 
mendous blow a little above the ear, that it 
knocked him £furly down, and he fell with 
a gfoan on the floor, like a bull from the 
stroke of a butdier's sst. 

" €rood God! what does the brute mean?* 
ened Galium, in a key of boundless rage. 



164 THE THREE PERILS 

^* Sir, this must be an&weted elsewhere, 
and in another manner,'' said M^Ion, open- 
ing the door ; *' you are not fit to sit in tbe 
company of civilized beings — ^I desire you to

" Sutor me if I stir from the spot till I 
have satisfaction/' roared Dick in his native 
.bellow. *^ I am a gentleman. My name is 
Richard Rickleton, Esquire. I am laird of

^* Thou force me ! Nay, coome ; thou's

M'lon in one moment had him by the 
shoulder, and ere Dick had time to get 
his brawny legs set fiirm, or so much as look 
about him, he was at the door, and that 
bolted behind him. But then there arose 
such a bellow of threatening, swearing, and 



OF WOMAN. 165 

heavy blows on the door, and the other door 
on the landing place, that the people within 
were taribly alarmed, and were calling £oac 
the police out at three windows at the s»ne 
time; among the rest, Joseph was callmg as 
loud as any ; such a fracas was marrow to 
his bones. The policemen soon andved, but 
before that time Dick had by main force 
split one of the doors in pieces, though not 
the one that he was turned so quickly out of; 
but they were so dose to one another that 
he Iqiew not which was which, and broke 
up the wrong one. The women of the 
house were crying out " murder" and " rob- 
bers ;" for he was^ cursing and threatening 
death and vengeance on some one they knew 
not who, and miming headlong into every 
room in search of the company he had left. 
The men instantly seized him, and desired 
him to come along ; but such a compliance 
was. the &rthest of any thing from Dick's 
mind. He asked no questions, made no 
excuses, but commencing the attack, laid on 
the policemen with all his might and main^ 
crying out at the same time, ^' a wheen mae

Dick was however &st seciired. haided 
down stairs, and away to the police-office, 
in the middle of an immense crowd of rag* 
gamuffians,among whom was his coudn, Jo- 
seph Bell, enjoying the whole scene in the 
most superb degree. Dick knew nothing 
about policemen, or a police-office, or 
what they were going to do with him, but 
still deemed that it behoved him to fight 
his way out of the scrape he had got into» 
otherwise it would fare the worse with him. 
He conceived himself to be in the same si-- 
tuation as he wont to be when engaged in a 
row at the Border fiiirs, and actually ex^ed 
himself in no ordinary way to overpower his 
adversaries the policemen, who again and 
again pronounced him to be possessed of tiie 
devil. Joseph had taken care by the way to 
spread the report among the mob that it was 
for h^usehreaking he was taken up, and this

piece of m£>nnatioii spread like fire, and was 
aetaally at the police-office before Dick. He 
was there thrust in among a few culprits as 
outrageous and unmanageable as himself, 
though not endowed with half the bodily 
fAxeiDgth ; and there he first learned the ex-* 
t^t of his crime, with the addition that it 
was thought he would strap for it. Dick 
at first denied, asserting that he had only 
broken a head, not a house ; but by degrees 
the truth dawned on his mind, that he had 
broken open a door, and made a bit of a dust 
inahouse; but he asserted, at the same time, 
that he had been most unwarrantably turn- 
ed out of the house by the neck, a thing he 
would never submit to. Joseph turned home 
Bt the door of the police-office, quite over- 
joyed at the scene that had taken place ; and 
k> light and buoyant were his spirits, that 
he. ran home as if treadiug the paths of the 
wind* He hasted up stairs with the news, 
but the party were otherwise engaged, and 
none of them thought proper to go and pro% 
eure the enlargement of the outrageous Bor- 
d^^, leaving him in the meantime to reap 
the fruits of his imprudence.

We ishoiild now return to the party whom 
we left so abruptly with the policemen ; but 
as every one will wish to learn how Dids 
came on in his new birth, we shall fotUow 
him into it, and recount how matters went 
Qiu liiere. At first he strode through and 
through the apartment, filming and m- 
vihg at the treatment he had receired on his 
first coming to Edinburgh; but at length he 
fixed upon a tall raw-boned fellow in a black 
coat, and in the course of a few minutes con- 
srer£^tion,they two were engaged in a quaird* 
Dick was as jealous of a strong man as of 
a rich one, and unless he could be acknow^ 
iedged the superior in eitJier case, he was 
never at ease. He asked the man wh^ he 
was put there fbt ? He answered, that it 
was not for housebreaking, and in a sullen 
mood withdrew. But Dick followed and 
harrassed him with questions and explana- 
ticHis about himself till the man in the black 
coat lost patience ; and, turning to him, he 
asked sternly, if he wanted a quarrel? 

" Why, master, I's ane thatleykes joost 
as wed to have a quorrel as to miss yean

tofold thee whae I is, and what I have, and 
a' the mischief that I has denne, that gart 
me be brought to this place ; and I think 
it's right unneighhonrly of thee no to tell 
me ae word in return. I fancy thou's some 
broken minister, wi' thy lang black thread^ 
Ittre coat? Or maybe thou's ane o' the

thee a bottle o' wine ; and if thpu winna^ 
I's resolved I'll fight thee. So here's outher 
an open fist or a closed ane for thee, ony o' 
them thou likes.'' 

The tall man with the black coat stared 
at him in surprise, measuring him &omr 
head, to foot ; but of all the sentences in 
Dick's ^eech, there was but one made a« 
dsep impression on his heart. It went even^ 
deeper than his beart, for it penetrated even

upward with a jerk — seized on the hand of 
his persecutor — and each of them lending 
their whole force to a brotherly squeeze^ they 
shook each others hands most heartily ; and 
the man in the long black coat leading Rich* 
ard apart to a form, the two sat down to- 
gether. The former then laying the one 
knee over the other, turned his face to Ilieh<* 
ard, and began a formal, and, as his fiiend 
thought, a most eloquent harangue. 

" Sir, that you did hint your suspicions

'' Yeeff, I thinks how I has,** said Dick;

176 THE THREE PERILS 

'' Now by two-headed Janu^ 
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time; 
Some that will evermore peep through their eyetf; 
And laugh like parrots at s bagjnper. 

I'll tell thee moreof this another time.'' 

Richard still continued as ignorant of the 
rank and profession of his fellow-prisoner as 
ever, but he had some obscure impressions 
that he was a notable fencing-master, and 
had a mind for some trial of strength or 
skill with him, before they parted. At this 
precise time, however, a lieutenant (or mas- 
ter of police, as Richard called him,) came to 
examine such aggressors as had been commit- 
ted ; and there being some witnesses in at- 
tendance who were impatient to be set at li- 
berty, Richard was first brought up to the 
bar between two constables. The judge was 
a pursy old man, with an exceeding large 
red nose, and considerably drunk. 
" WejU, sir, who are you ?" 
"Whoy, sur, I's Richard Rickleton, 
Esquire, the Laird of Burlhope, a fireehaud- 
ei: in the county of Northumberland,, a ,triis- 
tee on the turnpijcp roads, and ftiTOW;, of 
seventeen thousand acres of land."

** Ayh ! and how came you, sir, from all 
tlmse honours, to be kiddng up a riot in our 
streets here ?" 

^' I wos kicking up no riot on the streets, 
mull. Thou's telling a lee." 

^ Policemen, what is this fellow here 
charged with ?*• 

** With housebreaking, and putting the 
inhabitants in fear of their lives,*' was the 
answer. . ** We were sent for before we went 
to our stations. There were cries of mur- 
der issuing from the upper flat of No. — ; 
and when we went up stairs, we found he 
had split the main door to pieces, and was 
breaking up every apartment in the house, 
swearing and threatening destruction to all 
within." 

^ The man must be a fool, or mad," said 
the Judge. '^ Some drunken scoundrel from 
the country, I suppose." 

" Ney, ney, not so fast. Master Judge ; 
I's neither a scoundrel, nor the blood of 
ane," said Richard ; " and I'll nare be 
called soochan neames by^ any pbony reid- 
nosed capon in your dirty town."

^^ I take all here wotnesscis. Dom th^ 
reid-nosed piper, if 111 sit oGfnder soodian

he sprung from between his guards, seizcsd 
the Judge by the throat, back over with 
him, and began a mauling him most fuxi^ 
ously; The Judge reared out in the utmrafc 
horror, '' Seize the dog ! seize the dog^ >for 
God's sake ! choke him ! dboke him ! tako 
the breath from him !" 

The policemen tried to do so witili aU 
their might, but their effinrtis^ united with 
those of the Judge, could not master Didc, 
until they had to procure more assistance 
from without. He was then forced indig* 
nantly into the black-hole, or strong-^room^ 
without farther heating, and locked iq^ se* 
curely, with orders that he should not* be 
Uberated cm bail, till the morrow at the ju^

whose real name, it appeared, was WiB

mony of wliose intercourse had been so 
much marred. The moment that M*Ioii 
had turned Dick out of the door^ his atten^ 
tion was turned to his friend M'Tiirk, 
who, in spite of all they could do, remained 
for a long time insensible ; and at lengthy 
when he came to himself, he imagmedhe 
had been knocked down that moment, and 
set himself forthwith to answer Dick's last 
query to him. His mind found him again 
precisely where Dick left him, and at thid; 
same period we must take him up. "I 
scart your buttons, sir,** said Dick; " I 
suppose thou understands that, dis thou ?'V 

^' Nho ;. dhamm me if I dhoo," said Fe*

'VThen I suppose thou understands, that^

Peter ; and rising up staggering, he pulled 
ouihis dirk^ crying, '^ Fhaire is the dog, of

gamuJBSan, and can never be challenged as a 
gentleman." 

^' Fhat then is the trhue shentleman to

M^'Turk.

M*Ion would have gone on with his ek^ 
planation, but was interrupted by old Da* 
ni^l, who said, in a haughty tone, ** I have 
from the beginning seen how this matter 
would end, that the whole blame would b^ 
c^t on my shoulders ; and I must say at

wounds in every character, that it is rather 
unpleasant to have exposed too rudely. On 
these you fixed, in this instance, without 
mercy, driving him intentionally beyond 
forbearance. He has given broken heads 
for these jests before now, nor do I think he 
has acted so very far amiss at present, as £ql

took the responsibility on himself of reply*

he did not what he ought to have done, Mr 
BdL" 

^ Welli I say he did, sir; and if you 
have any thing further to say, you know 
where to find m^" said Daniel, and strode 



184 THE THEEE PERILS 

out at the doorj carrying his head particu* 
larly high. The three young gentlemen 
were^eft in a quandary, gazing at one ano- 
ther ; M*l6n testifying the' deepest grie^ 
and most poignant vexation, at the oflfence 
taken by his worthy and respected friend, 
Mr Bell, whom he said he had for a num- 
ber of years regarded more as a father than 
a common friend. This shut the mouths 
of the other two from uttering any reflec- 
tions on the old man's behaviour, but not 
from the most potent abuse of Kichard, 
whom they loaded with every opprobrious 
^ithet 

During this grand climax of the conver- 
sation, Joseph entered, out of breath, and 
hardly able to articulate with delight, as he 
gave them the history of his cousin Dick's 
adventures, how sturdily he fought, and 
with what difficulty he was got immured in 
limbo. He likewise informed them what 
grand sport he had formerly seen with 'Dick 
at .Otterburii races, when the heather- 
blooter, and the little wolf-dog were men- 
tioned to him — that the former was a nick-

name, which he deprecated/ and bragged 
that no man alive durst call him by it to 
his face ; the other, relating to sm unfortu- 
nate amour with a married girl, who had 
once been a servant of his ; in which affair 
he had nearly been both worried and drown- 
ed. M*Ion was quite angry with Joseph for 
leading him into such an error, but Joe 
thought the sport stillthe better, and de- 
clared his determination to have more fuii 
with his cousin before he left Edinburgh. 

The young gentlemen then went instant- 
ly out, and spoke to two householders of 
their acquaintance, to bail Richard out of 
confinement, for they were sorry at having 
been the aggressors, however rude he had 
been to them ; and most of all, for the o& 
fence taken by old Daniel on the part of 
his kinsman. They could not help acknow- 
ledging to their own hearts, that they had 
used both a little cavalierly ; so they acr 
companied the two citizens to the guard- 
house, where they heard all bail refused, the 
headlong Borderer having rendered himself 
liable to a criminal trial, on account of his

hsnng attacked the person g£ Ids Jnig&i 
Accordingly, tbey returned home to eam^oik 
what was ne^t best to be done; and Jo^ 
seph being of the party, heard all their eCNOb* 
sultations ; and concluding that, in the end, 
all wa^ like to end amicably, he took his 
measures accordingly, and went down stairs 
to his father and the ladies. 

Daniel had testified the utmo&t impa^ 
tiehoe from the time he had joined them^ 
as well as high displeasure at M'lon and 
his frieiids^ Catty's blood ran cold within 
lier, when she heard some of his expres- 
«H)ns, dreading that the last door of inter* 
eoiirse between her and her lover was now 
shut ; and if so, she felt the sole hope and 
support of her Hfe had perished. In the 
mean time, Joseph came with the news, and 
with feigned concern, related his cousin's 
mishap. Daniel lost no time in setting 
about his liberation, and by engaging a re- 
lation of his, of high repute in the law, soon 
accomplished that which had been refiined 
to the two grocers. But then, on Ridbard's 
return at a kte (or mther an early) hour. 



OF WOMAN- 187 

robh a dideussion entmed, so long, so loud, 
and so vehement, that Gatty soon left them, 
greatly Indispdsed ; i£nd at length they all 
I9tot to sleep, Riehard and Joseph in the 
same bed, as bad luck would have it. There 
the evil-disposed imp set himself, with all 
his art, to rouse up his cousin's violent hu- 
Inour, by representing to him how he had 
been insulted and abused as a low ru£San, 
bdbw the character of a gentleman. That 
M'Turk would have challenged him, had 
the others not persuaded him, that no man 
who valued his dbaract^r cbuld have any 
thing &rther to do with his antagotdfll;^ 
than kicking him out of doors ;— r^that his 
father had taken his part, and justified him 
in what he had done, leaving a challenge 
in effect on his nephew's b^alf, with any 
of the party that liked ±o take it up.. 

This hint of aU others roused Dick's va- 
l<wr the most, and he declared, that his oid 
unde Dan should have nothing to do in 
the matter, nether as pincipal nor second. 
" You are much more a man to my mind, 
ooudn Joe/' added he ; ** and if you will 



188 THE THEEE PERILS 

stand by me, rabbit me, but I will astonieh 
the dogs." 

Joseph promised faithftilly, and it was 
resolved between the two, ere ever they fell 
asleep, that next morning Richard was to 
challenge all the three, and then let them 
make the most of it they could. Accord- 
ingly, they were early astir, and at it ; and 
as Joseph refused all assistance in penning 
or inditing the challenges, these were left 
entirely to the genius of Richard. There 
was only one thing he was solicitous about, 
namely, whether the challenger, or the 
challenged, had the right of choosing the 
weapons. Joseph assured him, that the 
challenger had the right, a custom that had 
emanated from rules in use in the most 
chivalrous age of France ; at which our 
champion was not a little delighted, swear- 
ing he should then have some play with 
the fellows. Accordingly, after an hour's 
exercise at hard study and writing, he pro- 
duced the following three cards : — 

" I SCAET your buttons again. You in- 



OF WOMAN. 189 

suited me, and I repaid you, perhaps, a lit- 
tie too hard. I therefore give you another 
chance, and dare you to single comhat, 
either with cudgels, or broad-swords, at 
such time or place as our seconds shall ap- 
point. 

" Yours, 

" RiCHAED RiCKLETON. 

" To Mr Peter M'Turk." 



CHALLENGE SECOND. 

" I SCART your buttons. You mocked 
and disgraced me in your own house; and I 
dare you to single combat, with muskets, at 
regular battle distance, such as our seconds 
shall appoint. 

" Yours, &^ 

" To Richard M'lon, Esquire" 

challenge third. 

** Sir, 
" I iSCART your buttons ; and Asae you

to fair hxtile, with any weapons you diusey 
from a doubled fist to a munce-meg. 

'^ If one of these challenges are refused^ 
I will brand the whole fraternity of you for 
dogs> mongrels^ ragamuffins, aUd eowards I 

^^ Yours, &c. 

" To Lieutenant CaUum Gun." 

When these were finished, he called up 
Joseph, and read them over to him, one by 
(me, chuckling with delight. Joseph com- 
mended them highly, as masterpieces of 
spirit and good humour, and testified no 
small wonder at his cousin's powers of com- 
position, so much superior to his address. 

" Snuffs o' tobacco, cousin Joe ; what 
signifies address ?^ said he ; ** or how can 
a man hae address, that never s^ke to ^ny 
body #' the life o' him, foreby herds and 
drovers ? But I was five years at Jethart 
schools, and twae years at Durham ; five 
and twae make seven, a' the warld over. 
And gin a man whae had been seven years 
at the schools, couldna indite a challenge, 
it would be a disgrace. Sutar me, if I 



OF WOiaAN. 191 



dinaft thmk my learning wa$i/veel bestow- 
ed, were it o&ly for what 1 1^ done tfaig 
day." 

Joseph went to eac^ of the gend^nen 
apart, a^ delivered him his cousia's men^^ 
sage, begging, at the same time, that he 
would take no notice of the singularity of 
its manner, for he would find the challen* 
ger one that woidd not flinch a foot fran 
his purpose. He likewise requested of each 
gentleman to return the card into his hand, 
that whatever might be the consequence, it 
might not appear against his cousin or him- 
self in evidence ; for that he only produced 
it in testimony of his kinsman's resolution;, 
and with this request every one of the gen- 
tlemen instantly complied, iiji&rming Jo- 
s^h, that he should hear from him by the 
mouth <>f a friend immediately. 

When the three met, and the whole ab- 
surdity of the thing became manifest, the 
two young Celts burst out into a roar of 
laughter, and essayed to treat the matter 
as nothing, else than a piece of aboard buf- 
fopnery. In this they were not joined by 



198 THE.THEEE PjEEILS ^ 

M'lon^ who gnawed his Up in .utter ye^sh 
tion, assuring his friends that they would 
find it turn out a very disagreeable busi- 
ness, and one jiot to be got quit of with a 
good grace. ^' It would be an easy matter 
to prove him guilty of uqgentlemanly be- 
haviour," said he, " and refuse to meet him 
on these grounds. But I hate that last 
most miserable of all shifts, and would ra- 
ther meet the fellow at once, would he sub- 
scribe to the rules common among gentle- 
men." 

" I believe," said Gun, " the only waiy to 
get rid of such an animal, will be to meet 
him on his own terms." 

^' Hu ! Thamm me if I shall pe dhoing 
any such tings," said Peter M*Turk. " For 
Cot pe taking me tiss mhoment, if I ever 
lifted proad-sword or cudgel either, in te. 
mhatters of offhences or defhences, in all 
my phom Ihife." 

'' It is our countrymen's most celebrated 
weapon," said Galium Gun ; '^ and a noble, 
weapon it is ! It further appears to me, that 
this Border Hector brute, as. he. appears to.

UEf has made choice of that weapon to give

behaved towards you with rudeness. I must 
acknowledge, that I like the humour and

it possible for me to do."

" At all events," said M'lon, " we must 
each of us depute a friend to commune with 
this madcap boy ; and, moreover, none of 
us can chuse one another, but must apply 
to some new friends to act for us ; so that 
the whole ridiculous business will be di* 
Tulged to the world at our expense. Were 
the challenger like any other reasonaUe 
being, matters might easily be accommo^

dated ; but that Be is not, is quite appa* 
rent ; and besides, the frolicsome youth, his 
second, will urge him on to every extre- 
mity, the more extravagant the better, out 
of mere fun. For my part, I wish I were 
rid of it ; most of all, for the sake of those 
connected with him." 

Melon's friend was the first to wait on 
Joseph, and tried to persuade him that the 
thilig was all a joke — a good frolic — that it 
would be worse than madness to persist in. 
But he found Joseph quite of a different 
opinion^ and resolved, at all events, to in- 
sist on the most ample and public apol(^ 
being made to his cousin, or to abide by the 
result. The other adverted to the ridicu* 
lous choice made of the weapons, asserting, 
that such a thing was entirely unknown in 
the laws of duelling. Jo^seph denied this, 
and gave him two instances, on high au* 
thority, of the same mode having been 
chosen and acceded to. But he said he had 
no objections in the world what arms were 
used, only that he must persist in the chaU 
lengca: having the right of choice^ and pro-

Ms consent that muskets might he ex- 
Ranged for pistols in the decision of their 
quarrel. The other requested him to do 
SO9 assuring him he would jBnd his friend 
reasonahle in every thing. 

Joseph went to his cousin Dick, and 
found him sitting brooding over his coura- 
geous enterprize with the utmost satisfac- 
tion, and quite impatient for the glorious 
consummation. Joe mentioned the proper 
sed exchange to him, but he refused it in- 
dignantly, saying, " That he was deter*- 
mined to iight them all with different wea- 
pons, to shew them that he was their mas- 
ter in every thing; and as he knew he 
would be obliged to fight Galium Gun with 
pistols, which was a great pity, he insisted 
on fighting M'lon with muskets, or small 
fowling-pieces. But," added he, " gie my 
compliments to him, and tell him, if he be 
the least frighted, I'll allow him a tree." 

** A tree !" said Joseph ; " What do you 
mean by that ?" . 

' ^^ Whoy, I joost means this^** said Diek^ 



196 THE THKEE PERILS 

with the most perfect seriousness, " that 1^11 
allow him to stand hehind a tree. 1*11 tkeret 
olgect to that, and I'm sure, that's very 
fair."' 

^* Whys my dear cousin," said Joseph, 
laughing like to fell, " that gives you mr 
chance whatever." ' ' ^ 

" Never you fear that, man," returned 
Dick ; " when he srts by his head to take 
his aim at me. Ill hold you that I have hint 
first for a guinea " 

Such a proposal was the elixir of the soul 
to Joseph ; he went away and delivered ife 
straight. The message, as may well be 
supposed, put both the second and prin*i' 
cipal into a notorious rage, and they resol*^ 
ved, that they would no more be mocked 
by a fool, but meet him on his own terms, 
and be dme with it. Business accumu- 
lated on 'Dick's hand, as well as on that oi 
his second. The latter was left to the sole 
management d{ the duelling part, while hiis 
heroic cousin was obliged to go and appear 
in the Council Chamber, to save his bail, 
arid answer to the charges lodged a^idist 



OF WOMAN. 197 

^\m. His friend, the lawyer, undertook 
the management of every thing, else it 
would have heen the worse &r the aggres- 
sor. He spoke to the people into whose 
house Dick had forced his way — told th^sm 
the gentleman was in liquor, and mistook 
the door, hut was willing to make anyxea^ 
sonahle reparation ; consequently, that part 
of the business was soon got over, with a 
few slight fines. But the attack of the old 
lieutenant,- who sat as judge in the police- 
eourt, was Uke to prove a more serious mat- 
ter, and it required the young lawyer's ut- 
most cunning to get his client o£P. A 
judge, in every sentence he pronounces, 
keeps an eye to his own dignity* which was 
£^parent in this instance; for even the 
proof that the lieutenant had called him a 
scoundrel, proved no excuse for Richard^s 
ebullition of rage. Of this, the young.limh 
of the law was aware, and had been at pains 
to ferret out every word and action of this 
old nocturnal judge, from, twelve at fkoon 
till midnight ; and then, fully satisfied of 
jtbese, and finding that nothing else would 



198 THR.THK££ PERILS 

do, he charged the police judge with having 
been drunk, beastly drunk, at the time he 
mounted the bench to pronounce judgment 
on his client. The Sheriff-substitute, who 
sat as judge, asked the lieutenant of the 
truth of this. He denied it with indigna^ 
tion. The Sheriff next examined the po^ 
licemeu, who were present ; they denied it 
positively : on which the judge gave the 
young lawyer, (or writer, I do not recollect 
which,) a severe reprimand^ for thus at- 
tempting to calumniate a respectable and 
venerable public officer. He was just abput 
to fcdlow up this stricture with the pro- 
nouncing of a heavy judgment on our friend 
Dick, when the young lawyer got up an<J 
made a speech in arrest of judgment. I 
was present at this trial, as well as five or 
six friends, whom I could name, and to 
whom all the circumstances of the case mjust 
occur on the perusal of this ; in particular, 
that young man's speech, which drew forth 
peals of laughter and applause. The judge 
deprecated the interruption, but the f(»:mev 
insisted on giving an explanation so pe- 



OF WOMAN. Wgi 

Temptoirily, that he was pennif ted to do it, 
though not without reluctance on the part 
of the court. His speech was fraught with 
irony, hut any recapitulation that I can 
give of it, from memory, at this distance of ^ 
time, is nothing hut as the shadow to the 
substance. It was something to the follow* 
ing effect: — 

« My Lord, 

** Having been impeached here publicly; 
from the bench of justice, with a disgrace-^ 
ful and foul attempt to degrade a faithful 
and judicious public officer, and being sen-^^ 
sible, that, as matters now stand, I must 
appear in your eyes, and the eyes of all pre- 
sent, highly culpable, I beg leave to state 
the evidence on which my charge of drunk*', 
enness was founded, by which I hope not 
only to justify myself in part, but also to 
lessen the atrocity of my friend's offence. : 

** In the first place then, my Lord, I- 
will prove by the testimony of sufficient 
witnesses, whom I have here in comrt, that 
this same worthy officer went, at one oV^loek 



200 THE THREE PERILS 

yesterday^ with other two friends, (namitig 
the individuals and tavern keeper,) into a 
house at the foot of the Horse Wynd, on 
public duty no doubt, and drank each of 
them a gill of whisky as a forenoon canker^ 
or as one of the party expressed it, a hair 
of the dog that had bitten them. I will 
prove farther, that this same venerable pub* 
lie officer went with another person into a 
house in the Lawnmarket, at about ten 
minutes past three, and called for a sharp-- 
ing stone f which was brought, and which it 
appears they made good use of, for tliey 
swallowed it up totally, and were obliged 
to pay the landlady Is. 4d. by way of da- 
mages ; this sharping stone being neither 
more nor less than a half-mutehkin of strong 
ardent spirits. 

** I will likewise prove, to your Lord-^ 
ship's satisfaction, that the same faithful 
and judicious public officer dined with other 
four, at a place denominated by them, the 
Cheap Shop, in Candlemaker Row; and I 
have been at the pains to procure the indi^ 
vidUal bilk produced to the party at the

**The worthy officer was thus obliged to be 
absent for a short time^ still on public duty, 
which, it is to be supposed,he never once huet 
sight of all this while ; and pn his retcUim, 
fovat of the party, he being one, sat down to 
41 strenuous rubber at whist. Now, my Lord, 
you know this is a public duty that required 
a j^ood deal of mental operation, and one 
that no venerable man, grown grey in .the 
service, can support without a proper sti*- 
mulus. Accordingly, I find that each, of 
the party played his hand, with a smoking 
tumbler at his right elbow, which nerei: get 
tinne either to cool or stand empty. I mU 
prove, my Lord, that the party sat at that 
isevere and debilitating public duty, ^ the 
v^ .moment, thia venerable officer was call*

ed away to mount the tribunal df justice. 
It will appear farther, my Lord, from tMs 
other bill which was then produced at the 
cheap shop^ that the party had not been 
idle. Cast your eye over it, my Lord. It 
is shortly this. To 44 tumblers of tody, 
15s. 64. But it so happened, that this 
public officer and judge chanced to have a 
bad run of luck. He actually got hands 
which (as he expressed it again and agmti) 
the devil could not piay ; so that, though 
they only played at three-penny points^ the 
honest gentleman was pigeoned, and xedtt- 
ced so low that he could not pay his shot, 
which stands over undischarged at this boui»^ 
One can hardly help r^etting such a hard 
dispensation, nor wondering that the resist 
turned out no worse. For you will see, 
my Lord, by comparing rates, that fcl^^neh 
aerable officer, provided he drank hi9-6ir 
j)roportion, had swallowed no less than the 
contents of two bottles of whisky that'^ 
temoon, before he sat in judgment on my 
jriend here at the bar« exclusive of the pbiw 
.ter atod strong ate. Now, I appeal .to^y6i«t^

the bench of jivstice at all after such a r^ 
freshment ? Or provided that, from bpdily 
{ffowess, you could have effected the ascent, 
Aether or not you could have been a prp^ 
pa: judge of right or wrong in such a state ? 
I contend that the thing is not inhuman 
nature. It is impossible. And to autnen- 
tkate this, and shew 1k)w our judge beha-^ 
ved, I shall prove, that when ray friend 
here, a gentleman of property from the sis- 
ter kingdomy was brought before him tox 
having been guilty of a small mistake-r-rd

The judge made reply, that no bi^ieh 
of decorum in one person was warrant fiir 
any outrage committed by anoCher; but at 
the same time he dismissed the chai^ge^ ott 
account of the provocation given, and snb^ 
jeeted Dick only to two or Uiree smdll fines 
to the wounded policemen. 

The witnesses against Wagstaff were memi 
examined. The first of whom was the young 
lady of his most ardent and sublime affiee* 
tion. Her appearance had a wonderful eS^ 
feet on Richard, who, as he had antieqpai- 
ted, was quite overcome by her beauty and 
aqcompHshments. She was tall, blooming, 
and animated, and gave her evidence ta a 
manner so humorous, and witibal so good* 
natiitedly, that every one present was mo-

The history of this lady was shortly as 
fbflows : — She was the daughter of a sober 
citizeo, and was rather inclined to dress

ter was beeomiag every day more and more 
eqnivoeal, when an uncle of hers dying at 
Hittll^ left her a considerable fortune, inde^^ 
pendent of her parents^ or any other tras^

hdy who had so many followers and admi«- 
rers,. although her manner of life was nod- 
dling amended, but rather, at least with 
c^jard to one married gentleman, either 
worse, w less guarded* No matter ; wooers 
floeked from all quarters, and, among the 
test, our notable poet tried all the powers

and putting it into his, walked lightly along 
with her new adnurer. 

They got plenty of attendants all the 
way to her father's house, and, among the 
rest, some of the baffled lovers; but the. 
dangerous appearance and demeanour of 
Richard kept all at a due distance. When 
they reached the door, he k6pt hold of her 
hand, as with a determination to enter into 
some explanation; but she casting her eye 
on the number of their attendants, and afraid 
of a farther exposure, said, with a good na-

the redDubted Ridiard, after ingradatiug 
himself with the old dame prodigioutl;^, on 
account of his estate ^ his flocks of sheep, asid 
a twae . thoosan pooinds in Sir William's 
Bank, lying at a per centage, went off so 
much elated, that he ran along the street ; 
and hasting to the hotel where the Pringle- 
ton fly stopped, he th^e found his friend 
the poet standing on the steps. The great 
Shakespeare had been inquiring for Richard, 
but, on proffering to wait in the coffee-room 
till his arrival, was refused admittance, and 
had been compelled to take up his rest on 
the stone stair. Ridiard, in his full flow of 
spirits, shook him by the hand, and then 
led him by the shoulder, first into one room 
and then another, and afterwards a third, 
in all of which there was company. The 
son of Apollo was quite confounded at the 
original manner of his new acquaintance; be 
knew nothing about ringing a door-bel]^ or 
calling a waiter, but went, with unblushing 
fronts into every room that came in his way, 
always addressing the company in each as 
the people of the house, and never either 



oar woMAK. ms 

uncovering, or quitting hold of thei collar of 
his companion's coat. The poet objected 
going into the third room, and drew back ; 
but Ridhard pulled hhn in, Tociferating at 
the same time, '^ Cwome along, mun, cwoiiie 
along ! — What is thou hanging back for^ 
like a teyke in a tether ?-^— I say, sir, is thou 
the landlord of this house ?" The noble* 
man whom he accosted pointed to the door. 
" I beg thee pardon, sir,'* rejoined Di6k-^ 
'' I was only gaun to gie this chap here a 
bottle of port wine; and, in a public house» 
I fancy ae man^s money's as good's an- 
other's." Without more ado, he helped 
himself to a seat at the farther end of the 
room, after compelling the poet to sit down 
oil the one next it ; and, without quitting 
his hold, he thumped with his heel on the 
floor, as they do in country inns, to make 
the waiter attend. The nobleman rang the 
beU fariously, and a powdered waiter co- 
ming in, pointed to tlje intruders. The little 
spruce fellow came close up to Richard, 
and' with att inclination of his body, and a 
fiulMBequenticaper in a reverse dilrection, arti-

as Richard thought, in a very haughty 
manneri 

** Surr !** returned he^— ** Dis thou kfen 
"whae thou*s calling surr, with soochan a 
snooster as that ?" 

" What are yout commands, stir, if you 
please ?" rejoined the man of the towel, in 
the same authoritative style — a style that 
Dick could not brook. 
' *^ Why^ sur,'' said he, " my commands 
are, that thou take theeself off, clout and 
all, and bring us a bottle of thee best port 
wine, and some cauld water-^Thou under^ 
stands that, dis thou ?" 

" Please to walk this way, sur," said the 
waiter, bowing, and leading the way with 
an unconscionable strut. 

Richard held down the poet, and would 
not move. — " Whoy, where is thou gaun, 
with all them capers ?" cried he ; " thifi 
here place will do well enough." 

" I insist on my room being instantly 
cleared of such cattle !" cried his lordship, 
addressing the waiter. 



OF WOMAN. ail5 

" Whoy, what*s thou saying about cattle, 
muu ?" said Dick, rising up, and coming a 
few steps nearer his lordship ; " whae is it 
that thou's calling cattle, I would like to 
ken ? — I say, landlord, bring the wine here 
that I have ordered; and if thou disna 
clear this room for me, whoy, I kens of one 
that shall soon do it for thee, that's all !" 

The waiter was astounded. The poet 
tried to make his escape ; but Richard sei2ed 
him with a grasp that interrupted his flights 
The wily servant then, to save the credit of 
his master's house, brushed up, and whis-* 
pered something in Richard's ear, that at 
once overcame his pride and obstinacy, and 
he actually followed Princox out of the 
room, nodding to the nobleman, by way of 
begging his pardon ; and being conducted 
to a retired place down stairs, the poet and 
he had their wine, and their extravagant 
conversation together. It was all, for a time, 
about the lovely and adorable Miss Catherine 
M*Nab, whom the poet, declared he would 
follow till death ; and afterwards about the 
nine Muses, the mistresses of the lattar, 
whom Richard supposed to be the chandler 



S16 THE THREE PERILS 

of Kelso's beautiful daughters, the Moyses ; 
and being desirous of taking one 0t two of 
them off his friend Shakespeare's hand while 
he remained in town, Richard plied him 
with wine, and the most fulsome flattery 
about his personal appearance ; for of all 
mental qualifications our Borderer was to- 
tally ignorant, not being at all apprized of 
their nature, or what to say concerning them. 

But the outrageous adventures of this 
buUyquasher have led us too long away from 
the thread of our tale, and, owing to the 
way in which he came to be connected in it, 
must, it is to be feared, lead us farther still. 
In the mean time, we must return to the 
point where we broke off, in pursuit of his 
fortunes. 

There was nothing but bad humour, and 
a sort of half mystery, prevailed at the lodg- 
ings of the Bells. The ladies found out 
that there had been some sericms misunder- 
standing among the party, and that it had 
been on account of their kinsman Richard. 
They perceived that old Daniel, who was 
for the most part left with them, was in the

fij^s, and irritated at M'lon ; and this 
dbooNr^ry fedl cm poor lovelorn Gatty's heart 
l&e an untimely frost on a flower that bad 
omaeto its blossom too early, exposing its 
delicate bosom to the fervid ray, before the 
guardian leaves of experience had closed 
around it. Love was the fervid ray that 
made thi«i bud blossom too rathely, and dis^ 
appointment the chilling blast that made it 
Uench before its time« 

" Let simple maid the lesson read-^ 
The weird may be her ain." 

She saw as if the hand of fate was raised 
against her love, and felt as if some over- 
ruling power had compelled her to take of- 
fence where none was meant, and where no 
cause tould be rationally assigned why the 
oifence was taken. Now the parting with 
him who \was all the world to her, whom 
she felt she had injured, and dreaded also 
^t he had been insulted by her father and 
kinsman, melted her heart. What would 
she have given for oblivion of the past !—

and jealousy, and again to prove the atten^ 
tions and attachment of their early ac- 
quaintance ! As matters stood, however, 
she could form no line of conduct for her- 
self hut one, and that was, not to go and 
leave him,— even this she had not the ex- 
clusive power of fiilfilling ; she had hrought 
her father all the way from home, for the 
express purpose of taking her with him, and 
how was she now to evade compliance ? A 
maiden in love moves always in extremes, 
she is either all coyness, pride, and jealousy, 
or all tenderness and complacency. Gatty 
was quite overcome with conflicting feelings, 
and betook her to her bed a little past the 
hour of noon, expecting to find repose of 
spirit in the place where she daily found re» 
pose of body, and no sooner was she laidv 
down, than she desired Mrs John8on><and< 
Cherry to leave her, that she might sleep. 
But slumber was far distant from that 
couch, and would not be wooed to retum»v 
She was exceedingly unhappy, and soon 
sought relief of heart in a flood of scalding^

again to the country, now that the last hold

broken short by this misunderstanding be* 
twixt him and her father. And even if she 
remained, she could hardly see how matters 
could be again made up between M^Ion and 
W, without too much humiliation on her 
part, which, if yielded, might breed con-

Such were the thoughts that preyed on 
her mind, as she lay sobbing, and drowned 
in tears ; and just when her cogitations were 
at the bitterest, her father entered to in- 
quire how she was, and when she would be 
ready for taking her departure; — ^for he 
was just going to take out tickets for the 
fiy, he said, and would take them out for 
tOM-morrow, or next day, as she indined.-^^ 
Site was not very well, she said, and doubt*

able. She supposed her dear fiither would

'' Me lie on Dick Rickleton's breast !" 
exclaimed she ; ^* I would sooner lie on a

bnng that bear along with you ? We will 
be all affronted with him, every one of us,

During this speech, Gatty was lying 
hurning and shivering in restless indigna- 
tion, but the latter clause restrained for a 
moment what she was about to say, and set 
her a*thinking, instead of making any re- 
ply. Daniel went on — '* But as for leaving 
you here, daughter, never speak o' that, for 
ifs the thing I winna do. — I hae neither 
money nor time to spend to be coming 
touning a' the way to Edinburgh for a 
wehdi^s whimsies. Ye shall gang home to 
your mother at present — that baith she and 
I are determined on; and I'm gaun to 
teave your cousin Cherry and Joseph voider 
the care of the nurse." 
c Gatty was still silent^ for die foumd it 



822 THE THREE PERILS 

vain to reply ; and she had no one to blame 
hut herself for this resolution, of her father's, 
nor indeed, as she now felt, for all the 
griefs that belaid her. O love ! what in- 
consistent things canst thou not make a 
maiden to do ? And what gnawing pains 
canst thou not make her feel, by way of 
retribution ! 

** I shall take out the tickets for to-mor- 
row," said Daniel, as he left the room. 

*^ I wish I were dead !" said Gatty, and 
turned herself over in the bed. 

She had not lain long, before she heard 
the stentorian voice of her cousin in the 
dining-room, which added to her mental 
agony ; for her heart was so thoroughly 
softened down, that it was too much alive 
to every impression. He was elevated with 
love, wine, and warfare, — ^these had the ef- 
fect of exalting his voice, at the same time 
that they threw every idea in his addle pate 
into a chaos of utter confusion. With all 
this multiplicity of business on his hands, 
he was buoyed up with the hope, that, in 
and through his friend the poet's interest.

he was to have an assignment with one at 

least of the chandler's beautiful daughters 

that same evening. He asked carelessly 

for his cousin Aggy, and, though told that 

she was in bed, and much indisposed, he 

heard not the reply, but asked other twice 

in the same words, and always the next 

minute. He was now quite in the fidgets 

to meet Joseph, and, for all his undaunted 

courage, he was occasionally seized with a 

sort of anxiety, gripes that fastened on his 

loins and shoulder-blades, and held him 

yawning and racking himself on every short 

interval. Joseph at last came in, and the 

two retired to their sleeping-room ; and 

there our bully was informed that all the 

three challenges were accepted on his own 

terms, and all the meetings to take place 

early next morning, at different places on 

the shore of the Frith, a mile west from 

Newhaven, and each of them within twenty 

minutes of another. *' So that you see, 

cousin," added Joseph, " you will have hot 

work of it ; and the worst of it is, that if 



224 TH£ THREE PERILS 

you fall in the first encoimter, both the re* 
maining rascals will escape with impunity." 

" Punity or no punity," said Bichard* 
" I wish the combats had been the night ; 
for Ts no perfectly at hiy ease, and I would 
have liked to have been sae, for certain 
reasons. Rabbit me, if I dare venture on 
them Kelso lasses the night ! they may 
drive a body stupid.** 

" Ay, without driving him very far," said 
Joseph. " But if you have an appointment 
with any Border ladies, it is certainly pro- 
per that I escort you ; for, as your second 
in affairs of death and life, I must watch 
over all your actions to-night, that you may 
be in perfect and complete trim to-morrow 
morning, and that our country be not dis- 
graced." 

" Nay, nay, be thou nae feared, man/' 
said Dick, " I's no very ill for taking firight ; 
and as for either fencing or firing, I'll stand 
a match with any in the three kingdoms. 
What, mun ! does thou no ken that I fen* 
ced twelve weeks under Stewart the Highh 
landman ? Ill tak in hand to hit ony man

in the king's dominions, with sword or cnd^ 
gel; and for a vizzy, I winna yield to man 
living ! How far a distance does thou mean 
td allow us with muskets ?" 

" You said fait battle distance," said 
Joseph, ** and I was thinking of giving you 
a space between of sixty yards." 

^^ You may as well give us sixty feef^ 
TOUsin," said Richard. — ^" Whoy, man, I'll 
take a bet of forty guineas, that, at a hun<» 
dred and forty yards, I shall hit within an 
inch of any button on his coat. But I'll 
tell thee> Joseph ; change pistols or change 
swcKrds with the seconds as thou likes, but 
keep thou a grip of the musket I gies thee, 
for the de'il a ane I'll fire but that. Ax 
thou me nae questions, but do as I bid thee 
there, and do all the rest as thou likes die 
selo'thee." 

^^ Joseph promised that he would, obser- 
ving, that a gentleman had a right to use 
Ms own pistols, and why not his own gun. 

The rest of the day was spent in languor 
and restlesraess^ although they visited se- 
veral o£ the sights, as Daniel termed thc^,

226 THE THEEE PERILS 

which were then exhibiting in Edinburgh. 
At half past four they dined at an ordinary^ 
where they met with gentlemen from every 
quarter of the United Kingdom ; and as 
their dialect was the same as Greek to 
Richard, and his only a degree better un- 
derstood by them, their conversation was 
perfectly good-humoured, and as amusing 
and edifying as the greater part of conver- 
^sations that one generally hears. At seven 
they went to the theatre, where, by ap- 
pointment, they met the poet, he having a 
free ticket, for writing scraps of theatrical 
criticisms in the newspapers. At eleven 
they went to see the nine Moyses, the tal* 
low-chandler's beautiful daughters ; and, al* 
though they were not all at home, Richard 
was delighted beyond all bounds with those 
that were. But, he being obliged to treat 
the party, remarked that they kept an ex- 
pensive hoiise, them Kelso ladies, and seem- 
ed to ken very little either about thdr m^ 
tive place or their native tongue. 

Gatty contijQued in bed all that day and 
night ; and, as Richaird absolutely reftised 



OF WOMAN. 227 

to leave town for another day at least, the 
tickets were not taken out. 

The next morning Joseph and he were 
on the ground a little after the break of 
day. It had been always that mischievous 
boy's plan to turn the whole of the business 
of the challenge into a farce, to the detrir 
ment of his cousin Dick, to make him take 
fright, to have him fiUed drunk, or other- 
wise to make him miss his appointment ; 
and if all these failed, as they now had done, 
he had hopes of making it up with the 
friends to fire blunt shot, or to call a parley 
at some unfair motion with the swords, or 
otherwise, so as to put a stop to all violent 
proceedings. He had hinted this to hi^ 
friend M*Ion the evening before, but was 
confotmded at the sharp indignant answer 
he received. — ** You may make a fool of 
yourself, or iany of your relations, as far as 
you please for me, Joseph," said he ; ** but, 
in doing so, you ought not to have involved 
others, who do not choose to be mocked by 
dther you or them. You and he must now 
abide by the consequences of your foolii^h 



S9S THE THR££ PBBILS 

and aibfiurd measures ; and I haye cmly &r^ 
ther to inform yon, that if any otlier persoQ 
but yourself had proposed such a motion to 
me, I would have kicked lum down stairs." 
Joseph was» therefore^ exceedingly diih 
concerted and downhearted as th^y pio^ 
ceeded to the field next morning. He had 
meant only a practical joke, never think- 
ing, from the ludicrous manner in whidi 
the challenges were given and expressed^ 
that they could possibly be viewed in a se-* 
rious light. Besides, the loss of his fiiend 
M^Ion, by his own folly, was what he could 
not endure to think of. The meetu^ be- 
tween that gentleman and Richard having 
been appointed the first to take place, Jo» 
seph endeavoured all that was in his power 
to persuade his cousin to make some apo- 
1<^, assuring him^ that though M^Ion had 
insulted him, it Was altc^ether unintenlion*^ 
aUy-^that he knew nothing whatever (^ the 
bUj^ of the little wolf dog, but merely mien- 
tioned it at his instigation* BichaTd would 
make no apology ; nor did he even seem, 
muish in^dined to accept iji one* He^ bad

been insulted, he said, and turned out of a 
door, and he woidd fight twenty combats on. 
tihe same ground. He had done nothii^ 
that required an apology, and he would 
coinpel his antagonist to make one, or do 
wcarse. Joseph tried to intimidate him by ur« 
ging the necessity of his making a wiU, and 
of saying his prayars ; but Richard's com* 
prehension could not take in tbefse — he re^ 
mained immoveable. 

I chanced to meet with Mr Joseph Bell 
at C>aptain Rodger's lodgings, in Dnmi<>> 
m&nd Str^t, the day after this extraordi* 
nary r^icounta: but one ; and, though the 
CfEmversation, wto wholly about the dueb, 
there was ao much said about them that I 
am uncertain if I remember the story so as 
to relate all the circumstances according as 
they happened; and I entreat that the 
parties will excuse me if, in some small 
purticulars, I may be incorrect. It was 
ag£9ed between the seconds, on what 
grounds I have forgot, that the parties 
should fire altemat<^ly<, But I think it like- 
ly that it waa because they conceived there 



aSO THE THREE PERILS 

was no danger to either party at the dis-' 
tance agreed on. Melon's second at first 
proposed forty yards, hut Joseph would not 
listen to such an arrangement; and that 
he might have room for a fair mediocrity, 
proposed 160 yards. The gentleman laugh- 
ed at him, and said he would stand for a 
mark to any man at that distance for a shil- 
ling a time ; and, thinking Joseph's cau- 
tion proceeded from fear, he hecame the 
more ohstinate, seeming to value himself on 
the nearness to which he could hiing the 
combatants to each other ; so that in spite 
of all Joseph could say, 85 paces was the 
distance to which he was obliged to consent. 
They cast lots for the first fire, and M'lon 
got it ; and as the seconds, on presenting 
them with their muskets loaded, foolishly 
persisted in keeping their ground, quitei 
nigh to their several friends, Richard gal- 
lantly held up his hat, to direct the fire of 
his opponent to the right person. Joseph 
then fired a pistol as the signal, and in- 
stantly Melon's ball whistled by, apparent- 
ly at a good distance. Richard mocked the 



O^ WOMAN. 2«1 

piping sound tbat it made with a loud 
*• whew ! there he goes ! I wish all the 
fishwives ahout Newhaven be safe. D— n 
his blind eyne, if he's within a tether-length 
of his mark." M'lon held up his hat as it 
behoved him, for both his second and Dr 

L were within a few yards of him; 

Richard made himself ready. *^ I'll let him 
see how a man shoots," said he. The se^ 
cond fired his pistol, and ere the sound 
reached the Borderer's ear, his musket was 
discharged. He instantly set off, and was 
going to run to see the effect produced ; 
but Joseph made him return and keep his 
ground. He cursed the etiquette that 
would not suffer a man to go and see his 
shot ; and said to Joseph as he left him» 
** I etHed at the crown of his hat, but I 
could as easily have taken his right eye." 

Joseph laughed at the absurdity of his 
daft cousin, as he often styled him ; but 
what was his astonishment, on going up to 
the other second, to learn that the ball had 
actually gone neatly through the hat, in 
the very middle of the crown. Joseph said 



S32 TH£ THBKE PEBILS 

in my hiring, that hie behaved very iU on 
this occasion, by boasting that Melon's life 
had been fairly in his cousin's power, a&d 
iilsisting that no farther exchange of fires 
diould be allowed. The pride of the High- 
landers was moved by this. They would 
not submit to lie under any obligation. 
M^Ion was appealed to ; but all the satis- 
&etion that Joseph could get, was, that he 
was willing, as before, to accept of an apo- 
k^, but decUned offering any. Joseph 
was piqued at the obstinacy of his friend, 
and at his utter unreasonableness, and b^« 
ged of him to offer any thing that could h$ 
accepted, as he well knew his cousin was 
not the aggressor ; and as he himself, dut of 
mere firolic, had been the occasion of the 
migimderstanding, he entreated that he 
njight likewise be instrumental in m^ng 
up the difference. He likewise stated to 
him, with great simplicity, what he dread- 
ed would be the consequence; but there he 
touched on ticklish ground that instantly 
tooke off the negociation. M^Ion spoke 
kindly and respectfully to Joseph, but re^ 



OF WOMAN. SSfl 

mainedi obstinate. He felt that» as matten 
stoody he cauld not yidd an inch mthont 
being liable to the imputation of cowaidice; 
and, after much vain remonstrance, no other 
expedient could be found but a second fire^ 
on which the seconds retired and loaded 
the muskets and the signal pistols once 
more ; but Melon's second was not mock*' 
ing about the length of the distance that 
time. 

All this while no one; consulted honest 
Dick, who, conceiving himself in honour 
tied to the spot, and not at liberty to move 
an inch, stood in the most desperate state 
of impatience all the time this needless col- 
loquy was going on. He several times 
vra^yed his hat as a signal &r the conference 
to be broken off; and at length he put fca:th 
such a voice as made the travellers on the 
Fifan shore pause and listen, and all the 
boatmen on the Frith lean upon their oars : 
** Hilloa ! come out the gate here ! What 
are ye waiting on ?" This he shouted with 
atone that awaked an .hundred echoes along 
the wooded coast; but then, tramping 



8S4 THE THESE PEBILS 

iJirottgh impatience, he spoke to himsdl£ as 
£^ows : — ** Ye hae moockle to make work 
about. I could have laid all the three oop 
at ither's sides in the hoff o' th' time thou's 
taking consoolting of it. Sutor me, if I 
could not." 

'^ You must stand another fire, and re* 
turn it too, cousin," said Joseph, as he caime 
up and restored to him his piece. '^ And 
now that you have shewn the gentlemen 
what you can do, I entreat that you will 
fire in the air, or perhaps it would be better 
to decline firing altogether." 

Richard laughed with a loud ha, ha» 
when told that he had put the bail neatly 
in the centre of the hat's crown ; and add- 
ed, ^^ Whoy, the chap has no chance at all, 
that's undeniable. But we'll see how him 
coomes on this time." 

Joseph retired a small space and fired his 
pistol, while Richard waved his hat around 
his head, and immediately Melon's ball 
grazed the beach, within a foot of the place 
where Richard stood. The latter started, 
littered some words of approval, and made 



OF WOMAN. £S5 

Mmsdif ready for retumii^ the fire. Jiose^ 
held out both his hands, and implored Mm 
to refrain, but he answered, ** Be nae fear- 
ed, mun; be nae feared. He's not handing 
up his hat this time through pride, and it 
may be hard both to hit and miss. But I 
liave a kind of ill will at yon high-crowned 
liat. Be thou nae feared, mun." As he 
pronounced the last word, the signal pistol 
was fired. Richard merely raised the piece 
to his eye ; he did not take the aim of a 
moment before the shot went off, and M^Ion 
dropped. 

' ^' Confound your charging," cried Rich- 
alrd. '' If you have put in three grains too 
little of powder, the man's gone ! Confound- 
your charging, callant ! If it struck an inch 
a'er laigh, the man's brains are out ! Odd 
rabbit it, what will be done ?" 

As he said this, he ran toward the spot 
where the friend and surgeon were busily 
engaged with the body, leaving Joseph 
quite behind, whose knees were become 
powerless from grief and terror. Ere ever 
lUchard got near the heart-rending scenes 



286 THE THHEE PERILS 

he kept calling out, '* Has't hutten him ? 
Has't hutten him? Lord help us, has't 
gane through his head ?" 

No one deigned any reply, for they were 
both too busily engaged about their friend, 
to pay any regard to such a question put 
in such a way ; but Richard, unmindful of 
their disrespect, went on, " Who was't that 
charged her? Was't you. Master Second? 
Confound your stupidity ! I ettled through 
t^e crown o' his hat, but he disdained to 
lift it off his head* Thou hast naebody to 
blame but thysel.— Ho, ho ! is that all ^^ 
He's not a penny the worse* He has got- 
ten a c6n£)unded knap, though. Well done 
yet, little Blucher." That was the name 
of his gun. It had a patent*threaded barrel. 
Richard had practised with it for many 
years, and could almost infallibly hit to a 
hair's-breadth. He had by chance brought 
it along with him for some small repair. 
M'lon still shewed no signs of life ; but 
neither of his two friend^ had been able to 
discover the wound, until Richard arrived, 
who put his finger on it at the first instant^ 



OF WOMAN. 287 

knowing well belTorehand whereaboute it be^ 

boved to be. He bad levelled at the crowii 

of his bat, and hit it exaotly, but the ball^ 

IB passing through that, had grazed the top 

of the wearer's crown ; and, though th^ 

wound was hardly discernible, had stunned 

bim so completely, that he was a long time 

deprived of all motion. Richard, however, 

averred still, that ^^ he was not a penny the 

worse f and, taking Joseph by the shoul-^ 

d&, he drew him forcibly away from his 

Baotionless friei^, that they might go €mdl 

^fig^ the next one. 

At a short distance, in one of the lawni^ 
of Caroline Park, they found Ensign 
M^Turk, who, with his second, entered at 
the same time with them* These two noted 
Heltoideans had witnessed the duel on th^ 
iboie from a donceidment at a short dis*^ 
tance, and bad seen M^Ion &11, without 
knowing whether or not the wound was 
mortai. This had the effect of impressing 
thdm both with wonder, and a considerable 
degfee of tr^idation ; and though each of 
the thxee gentlemen, knew perfectly of the 



288 THE TUBES PJBIRILS 

engagements with the others, it appears 
that it was judged necessary to conduct 
every one of the meetings ostensibly as pri- 
vate, and ^unconnected with the rest, as if 
none such other existed ; consequently, not 
a hint passed on the ground with respect to 
the affair with M'lon ; but an experienced 
second might have discerned that an acoom- 
niodation would have been easily effected 
with M'Turk. He had been obliged to 
accept of a decision with, cut and thrust 
swords, and had never in his life had a les- 
son of sword exercise; therefore, having 
witnessed his antagonist's success in an en* 
counter so unfeasible, he began to suspeet 
what really was the case, that our Borderer^ 
with all his roughness of manner and rude- 
ness of speech, was a thorough adept in 
manly and warlike exercises. He percdved 
Richard alid Joseph entering the avenue 
without any oth^r arms than a single mus- 
ket, it having been settled before that 
M'Turk was to bring two swords to the 
field, and give the Borderer his choice; 
Therefore, hefone the parties came ia con-

taet, the Ensign stepped aside into the 
wood ; and his second, whose name I think 
was M'CoU, came up to Joseph, and, in the 
most swaggering manner imaginable, de- 
manded that his friend should straight make 
an apology to Captain M'Turk, (as he was 
pleased to term him,) '^ for te pig tamnation 
plow tat he had peen kiffing him on te side 
of te cl^-an-endainn, tat is te fore-faoe, 
which was te shaime, and te tisgrase hor- 
riple; and which no shentlemans on te 
whoule creation of te arthy wourld would

Joseph said he had no commission from 
1^ friend to treat, or to abate one jot of 
demanding frdl satisfaction; but that he 
had himself considerably altered his opi« 
nipn since he last had the honour of speak* 
ii^ with him on the subject, and was ready 
to use all his interest in bringing about an 
amicable adjustment between the gentle* 
men« 

*' Py Cot, sir," exclaimed MColl, whose 
energy was still exalted by this condescen- 
sion in Joseph, << your friend has pehaived

seph ; ^ and that on full fair parchments 
But if Mr M*Turk, as the first aggressor, 
ehuses to oSet an apology, it shall not be 
my blame if it is not accepted. Had we 
not better communicate with the parties?'' 
They accordingly went and consulted 
their several friends. Richard would listen 
to no accommK^tion, without first trying 
his antagonist's skill. The other two re* 
tired farther into the WQod^ la^ld consulted

toot a godd while in Gs^^ ; and at length 
fell upon an ingiBnious plan to bully their 
opponents off the Add. M^Turk hid his 
mrord in a bush^ and then the two returned 
boldly to the field, M*Coll, of all the four, 
being then only armed ; and the latter gen- 
tleman, going bddly and resolutely up to 
Joseph, assured him that his Mend the 
Captain undervalued all sort of accommo- 
dation, and insisted on the deseisian of 
"sworts. The parties at a tdgnal came up, 
met, and ware, desired by the seconds to 
shake hands. Kichard started, and hesita- 
ted, supposing this to be a final adjustment 
of all differences; and nodding his head, 
observed, as he thought full shrewdly> that 
he would keep his hand to himself for the 
present. « Well ten, sir," said M'GoU, 
'* since you will pe rhefnsing all shentleman 
descensions^ come on, mi. You shall find 
te Ghael ready to meet you on all places, 
and on all occhassions, whether as frient or

with iain ireful brandish, and put it into his 
Mend M'Turk's hand, at the same time

Richard and Joseph stared at one ano- 
ther. There was but one sword on the 
field. But M'CoU, conscious of the previ<p 
ous agreement, gave them not time either 
to ask or oiFer an eatplanation, but first pre- 
tending to burst out into a great fit of 
laughter, to keep down their speech entiK-

Matters, however, hardly turned out so 
ill as her nainsel divined. They both deem^ 
ed that Dick had perceived them armed at 
a distance, and had smelt a rat ; that he 
knew or suspected where the sword was hid- 
den, and was going straight to bring it to 
the encounter ; but instead of that, he went 
dway to a bush in a contrary direction, on 
which they laughed and spoke Earse to one 
another, convinced that Iboth heroes had fall- 
en upon the same expedient. While Rich- 
ard was absent looking for his sword, Jo- 
seph made up to M^Coll, and accosting him 
sternly, asked if he did not proffer, and 
fairly undertake to bring two good swords 
to the field, and to give Mr Rickleton the 
choice of them ? He denied it positively, 
with many curses and imprecations. ** Then, 
sir,'' said Joseph, " I give you the lie. Be- 
fore your friend the Captain^ as you are 
pleased to call him, I pronounce you a liar 
and a poltroon. I supposed I had to do

neither. You are, sir, if I may pe aBhow- 
ed to pe shudg^ment, a fery pase-pom, ful- 
gar, and muffianrag Ihaddie.'^ 

" Cousin Richard, come hither," cried 
Joe, beckoning him to make haste* IRich- 
ard came running with his weapon in his 
hand, which weapon was neither mcnre nor 
less than a large hazel sapling, that he had 
cut from the bush ; and as he came along 
he kept snedding the branches from it with 
his pocket gully. " What's the matter 
now, mun ?" cried he, addressing Joseph ; 
" is there any thing more wanting ?" 

" Yes there is, cousin Dick,"* said Jo- 
seph, slapping him on the shoulder ; ^ but 
not on your part. You are a man, every 
inch of you ; and one too at whose side 
I'll fight or fall any day in the year. But

Now, sir, make the most of thiit that you 
can, or that you dare." 

" Whoy, callant, that's excessively impu«- 
dent,"said Richard, not wholly comprehend* 
ing the extent of the Hebridean's blame, or 
father not aware of its enormity; " thou 
43ees the want o£ the sw<ar4 is no great mat- 
ter to qxiarrel about. A might mapti ^^v^ 
wants a weapon ;" and with that he Inran- 
dished his tree. ^^ But an thou likes to 
kick him, Til stand be thee." Joseph, who 
was as angry at M'CoU as it was possible 
to be, took his cousin's hint,^ sprui^ for- 
ward, and gave M'CoU a hearty kick in 
the rear. The latter made an effort to re- 
ctum it, but Joseph was too agile for him, 
and twice he spent his limb's sfrei^th in 
air. The indignity made the 1)lood rush to 
his cheeks and forehead, and he made as 
though he meditated a furious personal at- 



S48 THE THEEE PERILS 

tack on bis assailant ; h\it his eye chaneing 
ta rise to Richard's staff, the sight cut his 
sally short at once, and he contented him* 
self with turning round on his heel, and 
saying, with high and a£Sscted disdaiiit 
" Pid not I pe thelling her tat she was tc 
fery fiilgar poy, witout any of te preeding 
of te shentleman in hi^ whQule ppdy and

** Canny, mun ; canny a wee bit, an thou 
lykes," said Dick, brandishing his weapon. 
^^ No ftonily reflections here, or here's a bit 
of a rung will give thee thine answer/' 

That rung was as uncouth and danger- 
ous looking a weapon of the sort as could 
be conceived. It was jagged and crooked ; 
some of the stubs on it an inch and a half 
in length ; and with this stake he insisted 
on fighting the Ensign with his long sw(»d. 
To this, however, the acute and gented 
Highlander objected ; he shook his hea^ 
with a mild and forgiving accent, ^' Hu no^ 
sir ! You must pe taking my excuse. A 
Highland shentleman nefer takes the ad- 
vantage ; nefer, nefer ^'

** Whoy, mun, PU give thee all the ad-

affords, it is impossible thou can have any

^* Dhear, sir, te mhattev is peyond te

said the Ensign, bowing in manifest dis- 
may. 

" Draw out your sword," bellowed Rich- 
aid, in his most tremendous voice, and 
heaved his cudgel, as if about to fell an 
ox. The ireful sound actually made Peter 
M^Turk spring a yard from the ground, 
with a sort of backward leap, and when he 
alighted, it so chanced that his back was 
toward Richard, and his eye at the same 
moment catching a glance of one of the im«

Now aQ this^ though notoriously unlCKiky, 
as &r as it regarded the manhood of the g^

m^y of feelings so spontaneous audiffies 
sistible, that to have aeted otherWii^; was, 
without all douht, out of his powe^; he 
blamed for it hiiw he may. But the worst 
thing att^iding all these sudden sensati^ms 
of danger and dread is, that after a man 
llaa feirly turned his back, and fallen a run-i 
ning, it is all oTer with his courage for that 
time, and he thinks of nothing but spedl* 
iag his escape. Without some great inter- 
vention, such as the Hays with their oxen 
yokes, the warrior's character canrH)t be re- 
trieve at that bout It is, however, far 
ftom being a bad omen of a young hero;

resources ; therefore no man iviU look dcma 
on Ensign M^Turk for this, after he is in- 
formed, that the invincible Arthur Welles- 
ley, in one of the first battles ever he stood 
in India, fled in a night attack, and 1^ 
his re^ment to be cut up ; nor could he find 
a man of it again before day-light, although 
he disguised himself under a war doak, and 
went about inquiring for such and such a 
regiment. That gentleman has never again 
turned his back on his enemies from that 
day to this. 

But a still more pleasant instance of this 
inverted sort of courage was exhibited on 
bo^rd a British man-of-war, in an engage* 
ment in the mouth of the Channel. A good- 
looking young man, who was employed at 
one of the guns, got so frightened, that he 
actually went mad, and after uttering tw4) 
or three great roars, threw himseH'into the 
sea. An officer on deck, seeii^ his plaoe 
left vacant, seked a boat-hook, and in one 
minute had him again on board, gave him 
a kick, and ordered him to stand to his 
post, or he would blowiJiis brains out. The 



OF wmf AN. 8j(8 

man oontihued for a while quite uiEisettled 
and insensible; but at length, in the utr 
lOost desperation, he seized a paint-pot, 
dapped it on his head for a hehnet» and 
under this ideal safeguard, all fears vanish- 
ed in one moment. There was no man on 
board who behaved with more spirit durjo^ 
^e whole of the engagement ; foi he not 
only exerted himself to the utmost, but eu^ 
oouraged those about him to do th^ same. 
The paint ran in streams off at his heels, 
covering all his body with long stripes ; yet 
there was he flying about on the deck, like 
a hero, with his paint-pot on his head. 
That man afterwards rose to distinction 
ftir his undeviating course of steadiness and 
bravery. 

Let no man, therefore, flout at Peter 
MfTuik 5 for as the old proverb runs, " He 
may come to a pouchfu' peas before he dies, 
foriill that's come aod gone." Whoever 
had been obliged to encounter Richard 
Rickleton with such a tree over his shoul-

could hardly believe his eyes ; he gave a 
broad look at the second^ as much as to hmt 
that it was his duty to stop him. But by 
this time, Joseph^ for want of something 
better to do, had lifted one of the secondary 
hazel branches^ that his cousin Dick had cut 
from his tree.

the pursuit continued thrcmgh seir^ral in*^ 
closures ; but it was very uigh unavailing. 
Joseph, by dint of great exertion, got so 
near to M'CoU in leaping a fence, that he 
won him one hearty thwack, which failed 
in bringing him down ; and after that, nei- 
ther of the two could ever lay a turn on the 
fliers more. The gallant Ensign escaped 
altogether with whole bones, and hisse* 
ciHid^ it is supplied, was not much the 
inwBe. They did not, however, night in 
Edinburgh^ for they went both on boaTd ^ 
an Aberdeen smack that same day; and 
from that dty, M^CoU challenged Joseph, 
by post, to meet him on the North Inch of 
Perth, on the 24th of September n^t, and 
then and there give him the satisfaction of 
a gendeman. 

Unfeasible as this part of the story may 
seem, it is neither a fiction, nor in any de- 
gree sophisticated. I have seen the original 
letter myself, and can produce it, although, 
as I said before, I coidd not swear to the 
pilfer name ; but it was, doubtless, one of

When Richard found himself fairly out 
of breathy he stopd still and held his sides, 
crying, in broken sentences, "What think'st 
thou o' thy captain now, cousin Joe ? Rab- 
bit him, if he has not gat a fleg that wiU 
stick to his browJiead as lang as there's 
Highland hair on't. Dost thou think that 
blade is really a captain ?" 

*^ As much a captain as I am,^ or as thou 
art, laird," said Joseph; " some b^gaily 
ensign of local militia, or perhaps actually 
in views of the noble pension of 1*. lOd

ral of their titles, so much so^ that theSQ

any <^her people but then;kselves. I have

best of them, and one of the best ydnug 
men alive, (God grant that he be safe;) 
and I have found, that so eager aje they 
after a sort of grandeur, state, or title, that 
every one of the latter having a high sound, 
becomes so very common, as to be given 
without any discrimination. Every con^ 
missioned o£Sicer, every master of a trading 
vessely or even of a coal sloop, is certain. 
The title is not only gratuitously bestowr 
ed, but most cordially accepted of as a 
right ; and every student at the University 
of Aberdeen is styled doctor, when he re- 
turns to the Highlands in time of the va* 
cation. Your friend Peter, and his stibr 
Hme second, are just a^ near to the rank of 
captains, as they are to that of gentlemen ; 
for neither of them will either be the one 
or the other/' 

" Od rabbit it now, cousin Joe, thou*s 
leaking through ill nature," said Richard. 
*^ Now I never speaks ill of any one behind

Richard could not bear to have it sup- 
posed that he had only overcome the cou- 
rage of one with the sight of his staff, and 
ehaeed him from the field, who was no gen- 
tleman. 

*' There are many such gentlemen in the 
Highlands, as these you last saw, however,'^ 
said Joseph* " I speak only from hearsay^ 
and not from actual observation ; but am 
given to understand of these Highlanders, 
tbat such of them as are gentlemen of good 
&milies, are the completest gentlemen in 
the British dominions; polished, benevo- 
lent, and high spirited. But then, there is 
not one of these who has not a sort of sa- 
tellites, or better kind of gillies, that eount 
kin with their sup^ors, are sometimes out 
of courtesy admitted to their tablet^ afid on

that ground, though living in half beggary 
aad starvation, they set up for gentlemeB. 
These beings would lick the dust from the 
f^et of their superiors ; would follow and 
support them through danger, smd to death ; 
but left to act for themselves, they are no- 
thing, and no real Highland gentleman 
considers himself accountable for the beha- 
viour of such men. The cadets of a High- 
land chiefs or the immediate circle of his 
friends, are generally all gentlemen ; but 
there is not one of these who has not like- 
wise his circle of dependent gentlemen, 
which last have theirs again, in endless ra- 
mifications; so that no one knows where 
the genteel system ends. None of these 
latter have any individual character to sup- 
port ; they have only a family one, or the 
character of a chief, who generally now cares 
not a farthing about them. There lies the 
great difference between these people and 
our Borderers. With us, every man, from 
the peer to the meanest peasant, has an in- 
dividual character of his own to support ; 
and with all their bluntness of manner and

*^ Ay, shew me the man that will stand 
before us, cousin Joe," cried Richard ; *^ for, 
rabbit it ! we have seen those that can go 
before us already, and that by fair dint off 
running. But what dost thou think of the 
next chap that I have to fight ?" 

" If I divine aright," said Joie;eph, ** you 
will find his whole behaviour quite differ- 
ent, 1% is true the Guns were only gilliejs 
to another powerful name; but this is ^ 
man of education, and that always stamps 
tbe character with the sterling mark ; with- 
QUt it, whatever outward impression the 
man may bear, if he would pass himself for 
gqld, ring him, and inspect him well, for it 
is ten to one that he proves counterfeit^. 
— ^Begging your pardon, cousin Dick, for I 
understand, when you went to study the 
science of mathematics, that you stuck short

" Whoy, now, hold the tongue of thee,

willing to change the subjebt 

** No, it is not yet time, by a quarter of 
an hour/' answered Joseph ; " and therefore 
I have belBU trying to amuse you, to keep 
down your intolerant impatience. Come, 
now, give us the history of your progress in 
mathematics." 

" Whoy, thou kens, Joe, I was seven 
years at the schools, and that's what not 
many Highlanders can brag ; and* so, after 
I had gone through the geography, and the 
stronomy, the grammar, and the Latin ru- 
diments, my faither, he says to me, * Whoy^ 
Dickie, my man, thou hast been a very 
good lad, and a very good scholard, but 
thou hast never made any progress in the 
science of Matthew Mattocks, and oto 
rector tells me that there^s no man of them

in my own mind that I Could overcome my

my eye at him ; but my dbastisement grew

him over s^ form on his back, I held him m

thump. When I mastered him by throwing 
him over the bench, the whole school salu* 
ted me with a loud huzza ; and, of all other 
thjuigs, that went most to the tyger heart c^ 
him. I'll never forget his agotiy of coun- 
tenance when he yielded to me, and begged 
of me to let him up. * Wilt thou ever lift

there did I remain in my master's house^

wages for me, and I believe, after all, would 
have made it up. Yet I could not but pity 
him, for I saw he felt that he was no more 
master there, for all his lofty deportment i 
so I determined to be off the first fair op« 
portunity, rather than be the cause of throw-

. It was now necessary to take lodgings 
for Richard by himself ; and in these we 
shall leave him laid up, for the present, 
under the hands of the doctors ofpkysky 
and return to our unfortunate lovers, plun- 
ged still deeper in adversity by these unfor- 
tunate encounters. 

« The wound on Melon's head, slight as it 
appeared to bfe, had a very extraordinary 
effect ; and, though he was attended on the 
field by one of the ablest surgeons of his day, 
in spite of all that could be done for the re- 
storation of the patient, he continued quite 
insensible, and almost motionless, till a 
coach arrived, and conveyed him home to 
his lodgings. All that day he remained in 
a state of utter stupidityil to the amazement 
of the surgeons, who could discover no frac^ 
ture. Towards evening, he began to con- 
verse, and said he was quite .well ; he ap- 
peared likewise as if he had been; quite 
well ; his eye had all the vigour and intel- 
ligence that it was wont to have, and yet 



OF WOMAN. 269 

there was a wild incoherence at times in 
hi&jspeechy.that shewed his intellects to be 
only twinkling in a kind of will-o'-wisp state, 
without any fixed hold on the base of rea- 
son. He fell into immoderate fits of laugh- 
ter, without any apparent cause for such ri- 
ability, mentioned ofttimes his encounter 
with the heather-blooter, but always under 
an impression that some miscarriage had 
occurred ; he seemed to conceive that his 
piece had burnt in the pan, and that he 
was still on the shores of the Frith. In 
short, he appeared excited and happy to a 
boundless degree— felt no painful sensations 
—manifested no unpleasant regrets, but was 
all life and animation. At other times, he 
eould neither be brought to recollect where 
he was, nor what he was engaged in ; and, 
though he appeared delighted with all 
around him, if any person had asked him 
where he lived, or what was his name, he 
eotdd not have told him. The surgeons 
deemed the symptoms bad, and sever^ con- 
sultations were called on the case, at which 
many learned^bservations were offered on the

be safer it the country with him than in 
Edinburgh, and advised aeooi^diligly; add« 
itigji thdt they would now lose no time in 
returning home. When this resohition 
(Same to be known to Miss Bell^ it wrung 
her heart to the last degree. She under- 
stood that M'lon was lying in a dangerous 
state from a wound in the head ; that her 
brother had been instrumental in the affidr, 
and that it was from dread of the eomfe- 
quenees, th^rt he wasl now about to retire 
to 1^ eountiry for K spaoe« AU her inroud

the manx^ in which he had been used^ both 
by herself and her kindred ; and that they 
shw4d aXL turn th^ir batiks on him^ and 
leave him iu that st^te, was what ah^ could 
not brook ; so she determined not to go. Had 
the fiame goqd understanding still subsisted 
b^tw^en her loyer^ father^ and brother, a$ 
at the time when she wrote to her ^ther, 
to have parted with hiin whom she loved sp

only have been for a season. But as matters 
now stoodjt she perceived not the slightest 
probability that they two should ever meet 
again ; and how grievous was the reflection 
to a mind so sensitive ! 

All who have ever felt the an^eties of 
a first love^ will compassionate the sufferings

alas ! they have a deeper seat in thousands 
of young and ardent minds than the world 
is aware of, and sow the seeds of consump- 
tion in thousands of rathly, blooming, and 
delicate frames, where they were never sus- 
pected to have taken root, and never ac- 
knowledged to have sprung ; or wheife the 
suffera^ only acknowledged them to their 
own hearts. With how many amiable and 
manly qualifications did M^Ion appear now 
to Gatty's regretftil and distempered imagi- 
nation tobeinvestediAndtogoandleavehim 
for ever, was a trial to which she felt herself 
unable to give assent. She at first objected 
to accompany her father, on pretence of ill 
health, a pain in her side, and a dangerous 
disposition of late to fall into fainting fits. 
But all these excuses only rendered her father 
the more resolute on removing her. He said, 
that neither her mother nor himself could 
have any rest or comfort, knowing that she 
was indisposed, at such a distance from 
them ; and that they mmt have her in tbeiir

better of a hurl T the coach, for it wad gar 
her blood circulate through her veins, and 
gie her stomach sic a twinge, that, or she 
wan hame, she wad be as yaup as a yorlin/* 
Finding that this resource was going to 
be of no avail, she. was obliged, as a last 
remedy, to apply to Mrs Johnson, and lay 
open to her the state of her heart. This 
she did over night, when all the rest were 
sound asleep, for she requested her cousin 
Cherry to deep by herself that night, and 
suffer her to remain with her worthy nurses 
sd^ying, that she had something to impa]:t 
to her which she had long wished to tell, 
and she wished to take that opportunity, lest 
Tshe might never have it again. Ghdrry com- 
plied, and the nurse and her beloved foster- 
daughter lay down together. They felt at- 
tached as they had. been in former days; 
ceremony and: subordination were laid aside 
with the day clothes, and it was ^ now no 
more ^liss Bell and Mrs Johnson,' but th^

'with the ttoder confession, for there were 
no blush^ to hide; and there being no 
4oubt on the mind of t^e maidm of het 
tnirse'H affliction, so there was no equivocal 
lAdn on the part of the former. Every thing 
was made manifest — her lover's early «t* 
tachment— his kind offices — ^professions of 
love — and the tenderest esteem for her, ex- 
^rei^ed oil every suitable occasion, and in 
the most delicate way. Mrs Johnson was 
pettified, and scarcely fdt herself abte to 
:make one remark, while lie^ darling rail <m 
in the bdc^ed theme. All tilings were 
ihd reverse of what the form^ had conceit 
ved^ and she felt herself totally unable to

liave come so soon or so easily to lights hieid 
it not been for a very simple and natisnd

Like you, I loved early, and but too well ; 
but then I was beloved again with an af* 
fection that I deemed sincere. I was pri- 
vately married to my lover, a young soldier^ 
entirely dependant on his rich relatives, 
and lived several months with him in this 
city in the most perfect felicity. By what

was to keep her ward's love a strict and pro- 
fiound secret, both i&om the object of it, and 
her cousin Cherry,-^and, indeed, from all the 
world. Gatty made this important disclo- 
sure, for the purpose of soliciting the inte^ 
rest of the nurse with her father, that she 
might be suffered to remam where she wa% 
for she could not bear the thought of being 
separated fromhim she loved. But in place 
of that, the current of their discourse bore 
their conclusions to a different issue, and 
the young lady was persuaded to accompany 
her father and brother home, and trust to 
her faithful nurse for the elucidation of the 
mystery that hung over her lover's parent- 
age, and scrutinizing the state of his affeo- 
tions. To this Gatty yielded with rduc^ 
tance, and with many tears; for, though 
she could not tell why, the prospect of the 
future presented nothing to her ^ew but 
scenes of disa^ppointm^t and woe.

The moming at length arrived, whieh

their departiHre. Joseph waited both on 
M^Ion andh»3 cousin I>icld; theifinmerhe

difference in his^ mann^/iffrv dq^oi^tm^it. 
The latlier he found intent <^l^rr on one 
l^ing/ivMeh'had puzaded him &g<)od deal» 
It was what eould have beeome^el the two 
balls that Galium Gun and he had first fired 
at eadi other. They had proved- from the 
second fire, he said^ that they were not men 
likely to miss such good marks, and he was 
therefore full of a thecny that heseeoied to 
have been impatient to get eonnnunicated. 
" Whoy, it is my fixed opinion, cousin Joe,** 
said he, ** that the two bullets met each 
other full birr by the way, and smashed 
one another to pieces." Joseph laughed^ at 
the extravagance of the idea, but the laird 
persisted in it, and offered a bet, that if he 
were at the spot, he would find some atoms 
of the bdils lying right below where they 
struck each other. He made light of his 
wound, and seemed niuch more conc^med 



hm he ygfos to come on mth loa sweetheart. 
" Foe taHbii me» Joe»" aai4 het ^ if I has QQt 
promised to your father to marry my cousin 
Aggy ! But I have some douhts that she's 
ri&ther sleuder-waisted for me; and what

GviTod's truth, I hae promised to a lovely 
lass, a Miss Keatie M'Nab, that I will 
marry her ; and I promised to two of you 
Miss Moys, the chandler's daughters, you 
know, that we drank the toasted wine with, 
to marry them. Now, whidi of all these 
promises is the one that is to staled good,

Joseph kughed abundimtly at the ex* 
traoidiuary progress his cousin had made 
towards matrlinony in a time so short, and 
r^etted wceedingly that he was obliged 
to leave him, in conformity to his &th^s 
mandate ; for he added, that he did m% 
think there was any danger of the law ta*>

Mmself with any fears about the foture*

Catty's aonl yearned for a meeting with

She thought if she eould but exehan^ 
looks or words with him before leaving town^ 
it would give some ease to her heart. But 
the nurse was cautious^ a&aid of exposing 
the youthful enthusiast^ and in her eaatioti 
she missed the effeet desired. She found 
M'lon much indisposed^ gloomy, and oast 
down ; for he still believed that Miss Bell 
was leaving town on account of a settled 
aversion that she entertained towards him»

turned round, and, lifting up her beautiful 
face, fixed an earnest look on Melon's win- 
dows, until the tears blinded both eyes. Mrs 
Johnson seized her arm, led her to the coach, 
and seating her beside her father, took 
a kind adieu; and that night the family 
supped together at Bellsbumfoot. The 
mistress received her daughter rather cold- 
ly, hinting to her that she deemed she had 
pkyed thd truant; and likewise, that she 
tiever saw her look so well. Her first in- 
quiries were about her nephew Richard; 
for, since Mr Bell and he had set out toge- 
ther to Edinburgh, she had dreamed of no- 
thing but the match between him and her 
daughter, and greatly was she shocked at 
the dangers he had run with his foolish 
duelling. Her husband and son both spoke 
of her favourite in terms of approbation^ 
but all that she could get her daugh« 
ter to say about him was, ** Oh — Oh !" 
which threw a sore damp on her visions of 
affinity. 



OP WOMAN. 285 

In the meantime, the wounded duelli^ 
continued to get better^ but M'lon most 
slowly of either ; he had days and nights of 
utter oblivion ; indeed^ he seemed scarcely 
to retain any distinct recollection of late 
events on these occasions, although he was 
then most elevated in his spirits. Mrs John* 
son and Cherry were his daily visitors. Since 
the departure of Joseph and Gatty, they 
stood on no ceremony with him, but spent 
a part of every day and every evening in 
his room ; and he grew that he enjoyed no 
happiness without them. Cherry was de- 
lighted to do every little kind office for 
him that lay in her power; and, perceiving 
her obliging readiness, he employed her very 
often. Mrs Johnson sat with him for a 
while every day, when Cherry was out at- 
tending her masters; and during these 
friendly visits, she tried all her art to find 
out who were his parents and connexions; 
but with what effect, we must leave it to 
herself to describe. In the meantime, I

but am no more interested in them, than if 
I looked on vacancy. Then, of course, I 
come to many spots where he and I have 
sat together, when love was in the bud, and 
hope blossomed without any alloy. In these 
places I sit down and weep; and then I 
feel that I have no hope remaining, save 
what is placed in your kind heart and in- 
genious nature. Oh ! my dear friend, do 
not forget me ; for now that I haye dis- 
closed my weakness to you, I will hide no- 
thing ; the sole happiness of my life, and 
my Ufe itself, depend on the attainment of 
one object, and of course they now depend 
upon you. But if you can give me hope^ it 
is enough. I can live and luxuriate in that,

her mother from the kitchen, who rushed 
in, scarcely in time to catch her in hef arms

laid W on a bed that was off the parlour. 
It was her husband's and her own; and 
with the most perfect composure of mind, 
bolted the parlour door, that she might not 
expose her child to the eyes of servants-; 
and with all assiduity set about revivii^ 
her herself. She had in her own youth been 
subject to such fits, and did not account 
much of them. It was not very long till 
she began to manifest signs of recovery, 
but she spoke in a manner so extravagant, 
about marriage, and death, and heaven, and 
dead*clothes, and a thousand things jum- 
bled t(^ether, that her mother still thought 
proper to keep all others at.a distance fir(»a. 
her. 

- In the meanwhile, Daniel had been bu-

very much fatigued, he left the fold, and 
went into the house to get a drink of whisky 
and water. This beverage, of every-day use 
^tiood snugly in a wall-press in the parlour, 
to which Daniel knew the road so well, 
that he dbuld actually have gone straight 
to it at midnight, when the house was as 
dark as a pit ; and at all times, and all 
seasons, he had free access to it. But to 
Daniel's great consternation, he found that, 
for once, the circumstances of the case were 
altered. The parlour door was fast bolted, 
and no access for the thirsty goodman ! He 
knocked at it repeatedly, and called his 
wife and daughter's names ; but behold, 
there was no voice from within, and none 
that answered or regarded ! He next ap- 
plied to the housemaid, and that in a loud 
and agitated voice.— "Griz?sy ! hilloa, Griz- 
{By ! What's come o' your mistress, dame ?** 
" Aw fancy she's ben the house, sir."

Whoever has seen Henry Fuzeli's pic- 
ture of Satan from the first hook of Mil- 
ton, can conceive at once the manner in 
which old Daniel Bell drew himself up& 
His hands sprung upward at his whole anns^ 
length ahove his head, and his face lengths 
ened in proportion to the height of his 
frame. He then clasped his hands toge- 
ther, squeezing them down on his crown^ 
and puffing out his cheeks, like two great 
hlown crimson bladders ; he sought relief 
by blowing out his breath like a porpoise^ 
with a loud pougb ! One of the most un^ 
feasible ideas in the world had in a moment 
taken possession of honest Daniel's obtuse 
intellect. He conceived that his wife and 
daughter were at that very time engaged 
in making him a grandfather ; and turning 
round,, he made for the door, clapping hia 
hands with great force on the outdde of 
each thigh ; but as he passed the parlour 
door, he was arrested by his wife's voice, that

said to him^ in an angry whisper through 
the door, " What noise is all that, Mr 
Bell ?— What is it you want ?" 
* " What is it I want ? — ^Why, I wanted 
a drink, mistress, that was all. And when 
you and your daughter hae ony unseen

^ Daniel would have taken to his bed tooj 
out of grief and vexation, could be have 
got to it, but that indulgence was denied 
him ; so he walked away mechanically to- 
ward the sheepfold again. When there^ he 
could transact no business, or went about 
it in a manner so singular, that his shqp- 
faerds thought him gone out of his right 
mind. . .

coming hopping off at each sid^ of his 
nose. But he pretended to be laughing at

Daj^ went to a little lonely crook on 
BeUdbfiirn-side, whiere he sat down and con^ 
rened with himself. He first cursed ftU 
Highlandmen^ then M'lon in particular ; 
and then he consulted with himself yih^t 
was to he his behaviour to his daughter. 
•* But what can I do ?" said he. ** What

As Daniel said this, he continued boring a 
hole HI the fiMss with his staff, in a s^w 
and melancholy manner ; but by degreea 
he began to strike his stiok into the moisji

And as he said this, he stabbed the air* 
with great violence, and ran forward, as if 
pursuing a Highlandman, and sticking him 
through the heart. He went straight home 
in perfect peace with his daughter. What 
more could Daniel have effected at the very 
first trial? 

By that time J)^. mother had administer- 
ed some composing draughts to her^ which 
had the effect of calming her spirits^ so 
that she listened to reaison, and ceased her

padour door, so he went straight into the 
kitchen ; and when there, he durst not so 
much as ask for his daughter, therefore he 
began to seold the maid for having put too

Daniel pursed up his mouth, and looked 
her fiill in the &ce* He was not sure how 
it would become him to accept of the invi- 
tation. He felt a powerful delicacy in the 
matter; and after exhibiting a ludicrous 
countoianee for a fall minute, without stir- 
nng, he put the following unfatherly and 
home question : — ** Is the woman better?'' 

^ Come and see," stid Mrs Bell, and led 
the way with a proud and stately demea- 
nour. Danid followed, grumbling some 
words half into himself, and was going to 
take up his birth at the parlour fire, when 
the dame going into the little bed-room, 
turned back and beckoned to him, saying, 
*' Are you not coming in to c^peak to her,

and most eloquent exclamation, without 
opening his mouth—- *^^ H'mph ! Lost nae

words, Daniel strode into the chamber with 
his jaws fallen down, and his mouth form- 
ed into a round hole, as if it had been bored 
with a wimble; he was breathing short, 
and his eyes were rolling in his head. His 
spouse accosted him with some common, 
place observation, but these were not^the 
Mrt of words that Daniel expected, and be 
heard them not. There was a pillow lying 
on the bed-stock, on which Gatty had been 
leaning, and this honest Daniel took for a

his arms still clung to his sides, while Ms 
big jolly frame was all moving with agi- 
tation. Gatty chanced to utter a slight 
tremulous sound in clearing her Yoiee to 
speak. Daniel started so sore, that he al- 
most jumped to the c^ling of the room, 
thinking it was the bantling, setting u^a 
cry. 

" What's here?" said the dame. " I 
think the family is all grown nervish at

cannot be undone ; therefore, come to my

The women were petrified. Gatty scream-

taking his shoulder, and turuing him about 
to the light, she said, *^ I say, what has pos- 
sessed you, Mr Bell ? Have yon been drink-

to consult you about our daughter's case,

Daniel. ^^ Suffering unda: the effects of a

Daniel. 'Mt signifies nought QonceaHag

her, ^' is my Gatty really an unblemishad

the lady, proudly, ** or the profane tongue

never seen him affected in the same man- 
nlBT H^fore, and they were both petrified with 
astonishment. 

** What has come over you, Mr Bell ?"

Davie ; " if he be nae better tuned than he

But Daniel had no sooner opened his

his master returned, and the two went on

The sheep-fold husiness then went onvi^ 
well, till its conclusion. 
. When Daniel returned home, a different 
^d more interesting scene was going on 
m the parlour. Jaggs had hrought two 
letters from the post-office, beside the one 
from Cherry, which had affected her in- 
t«ded bride-maid so deeply. One of tb^ie 
was to Joseph, requesting his immediate 
attendance in Edinburgh^ and was couched 
in these words; — 

^ Cousin Joe, 
^^ Things are coming to a point with me, 
i?o you must come here, or else they will 
come to thee* As I told you, I hare rashly 
made three promises of marriage, (foreby 
that to your sister, which was four, and two 
others at home, that are not claimed.) But 
here the people look sharply about them, 
and words will not pass for wind, although 
they are little else ; — ^therefore the beauti* 
fid Kate M*Nab, and the two Miss Moys, 



OF WOMAlff. 321 

all claim me for tbeir man, and threaten the 
law. I have some strong proofis against the 
iatterof extraordinary freedom of behaviour, 
going even the length of drinking and sleep- 
ing with sundry gentlemen. I never pre- 
tend to like a woman much the worse of 
this last, for I think it a quality bespeak- 
ing much kindness of heart, and I count 
tibem the best judges of such things them- 
selver; but I do not like women that%ll 
lliemselves drunk with plotty wine, and take 
one name to one man, and another name to 
another ; so I'll not have any of them, if I 
can help it, and I do not see bow the law 
can oblige me to marry three. I am not 
afraid of cousin Aggy claiming, but terrified 
for my uncle and aunt ; so, dear Joe, you 
must bring me off there ^ for I am deter- 
mined to marry the lovely and loving Miss 
M*Nab. For all the money and all the 
beauty that she has, she needs no courting, 
and has never needed any, but jeers me with 
a kind of melancholy good humour every 
day for not marrying her. Now, this cast 
of melancholy about her, that she is con-

love, — and how can I but adore her ? She 
has made me deed myself anew, and she 
walks the Prince's Street every day with me, 
and my wounded arm in a sling, which is 
quite the fashion here, and has more effect 
with the ladies than all things else ih tfad 
world. I think she makes rather too great 
a show of her affection for me, but> as it i# 
alFout of true love, I like her the better — • 
what can I do ? In truth, I shall soon^bc^

me, I shall to a certainty be getting into

der some restraint with me ; and yesterday, 
being confined to his bed by a giddiness, 
proceeding firom the effects of the wound he 
received in the head, I thought proper to 
attend him almost the whole day; and 
Cherryibeing out in the evening, I made 
tea for him. I can never since remember 
what I was saying to him at the time— -it 
might be something about his kindred, but 
I do not think it was ; however, I know it 
was something in which I felt interested ; 
it, however, vanished from my memory, ne- 
ver to be recalled, as he took my h^id in 
his, and said*^ 

" * My dear Mrs Johnson, you have ta- 
ken such an interest in me from the day 
that we were first acquainted, and have h&m 
m kind to me, that I. feel I owe you more 
than any common acknowledgment can le- 
pay. You have ao often made inquiries at 



or WOMAN. 325 

xx^ about my parents^ I am ashamed that I 
have never let you know all about them 
that I know myself, which is but very little. 
My mother I never beheld, and dl that 
ever I heard of her was from my nurse, who 
was devoted to my father's house, and of 
eourse my mother's enemy. My father, it 
seems, made some improper connexion in 
Ms youth, while attending the university 
and the courts of law in this city. Impro- 
per it must have been, as it displeased his 
parents, and was the cause of many heart- 
burnings and grievous misfortunes. Ac- 
cording to my nurse's edition of the stoiy, 
he seduced the daughter of a decayed gen- 
tleman by a sham marriage, and of that 
marriage I was the fruit. My grandfather, 
being the head of an old family, and chief 
of a once powerful clan, was highly iiadig- 
nant at this connexion. He recalled his 
son instantly from Edinburgh, and, in a 
ctxcle of his proud relations, stated the dis- 
grace that he had brought on his &mily and 
dan, and commanded him peremptorily to 
renounce his leman, on pain of being disin-*

herited of two properties, his father's own, 
and his father's brother's, to bodi of whom 
my father was the heir. Ere ever they gav€ 
him time to answer for himself, my grand* 
&ther farther stated to him, that he had 
pocured him a high commission in the 
army, near the person of the British com* 
mander himself, and that his services were 
required without any delay. This was what 
my father had all his life desired ; and, on 
his father promising to provide &r his mis* 
tress till hi» return, which he did with great 
readiness, my father went on board, and 
joined the army on a foreign station. 

*^ ^ I suspect there was some foul play 
going about this time ; for, three years after 
that, my father returned on a furlough, and 
there was a fierce quarrel between the old 
chief and him about his mistress. It was 
reported to him that she had deserted bar 
colours, and gone off with another lover, but 
he received the report with disdain ; how^ 
ever, all his art had been unable to discover 
her retreat. I remember of seeing my &* 
ther at that time, and of being delighted

with the grand plumes oa his boimet, and 
also something of his kissing me, and weep* 
ing over me, when he took his leave. My 
mirse said he left me his most fervent bless* 
ing, and hoped I would live to atone for his 
compelled unkindness to my mother. He 
went away the second time, and perished in 
that cursed expedition, in which so many 
gallant British lives were sacrificed to no 
purpose. Often have I shed tears over the 
list of the dead in which his dear name oc* 
curs ; — and that is all that I know, or ever 
knew, about my parents. 

" * My grandfather's second son was then 
declared the heir of the family inheritance ; 
Imt my father had seen and conversed with 
his uncle during the time of his furlough in 
the Highlands, and nothing could move 
that worthy man to join his estate with that 
of my grandfather. — He settled it on me, 
and declared me the rightful heir of thewhole 
of both properties, and the chief of the clan.

** At this piece of information, my dear 
Gatty, my head fell a-swimming, my heart 
beat as if it would have broken through its 
frail tenement, and every part of my whole 
body quivered and creptwith a nameless sen^ 
sation. Oh, my dear child, I can never ex- 
press to you the feelings of that moment, nei- 
ther by word nor writing, were I to aim at 
nothing further all my life ; but resolving to 
contain ihyself, and act like a rational crea- 
ture, I brought all my powers to the test, 
and for that moment succeeded. 

*^ ^ Was M*Ion not your father's name ?' 
said I, with a voice so faltering, that it 
amazed him, and he looked in my face^ as 
if afraid I was taken ill. 

" * No, indeed, it was not,' said he ; * my 
name is a patronymic taken from the names 
of both my father and mother.' 

" This answer threw a chillness over my 
whole frame ; it was; the diillness of death

for woman's frame is scarcely equal to the 
task. 

" * What is the matter with you, Mrs

the meaning of that name, sir ?' I asked 
the question in this way, and much worse, 
for I durst not let the question run to an 
end, for fear of hearing the answer. 

" He answered, with the greatest com- 
posure, * It signifies the son ofJohny ma'am,

and that moment I had him in my arms, 
weeping over him with inexpressible joy, and 
repeating two short words, which I did an 
hundred times. These were, /My son! my 
SON !' 

*^ Oh, dearest, dearest Gatty ! rejoice and 
exult with me, and think if ever there was 
so happy a mother. I have indeed found 
my son ! — my kind, my grateful, my beau-

much of all I could wish a man, and a high-

in possession of all the documents and proo&

regular in every respect. 

'^ ^ Then am I the chief o£ my family 
and kinsfolk/ said he; ^ and I would not 
change birthrights with the first noUemaa

this to my. mother — and to such a mother !*

I cannot tell you all the kind and filial ex- 
pressions that he used toward me ; but I 
am the happiest woman in this state of 
^cistence. I am actually overpowered and 
drunken with joy. It is too transcendent 
to last ; but the will of Heaven be done. 
The great controller of human actions, who 
brought a deserted and disowned wife and 
mother, and her only son together, in a 
way so singular, and dependent on so many 
casualties, will order all things aright in 
our future destinies, and to his mighty 
hand I leave the events that are wisely hid

" It's nae docks ava, mistress," said Da-

though I say't mysel, I'm the only man 
that could double sic a gentleman's income. 
I'll no even except Mat Culley himsel." 

This dissertation on, the breeds of sheep 
proving a great bore to the two ladies, as 
it is indeed to eveiry body beside, they took 
an opportunity of slipping up stairs to con-

suit on matters more congenial to their san- 
guine minds. In the meantime, old Da* 
niel put hoth his hands in his waistcoat 
pockets, set his hat up upon his crown be- 
hind, with the fore part of the rim drawn over 
his eyes, and went out to the large field 
behind the house, to look at his tups, and 
select those he meant to send to the High-- 
lands. There is no life so easy as that of a 
sheep farmer, but there is none so mono- 
tonous. No stirring, no animation ; but the 
same routine from day to day, and from 
year to year ; looking at tups ; taking a 
glass of toddy ; talking of rents, dogs, an^, 
shepherds; buttoning and unbuttoning; 
lying down in bed, and rismg up again, 
from generation to generation. There is 
more interest excited by farming seven acres 
of arable land, sown with various crops of 
grain, than seventeen hundred of pasture 
land on both sides of the Border.
