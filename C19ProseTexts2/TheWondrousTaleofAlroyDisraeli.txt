Sweet Sister ! as 1 wandered on the 
mountains of Sion, behold ! a gazelle 
came bounding o'er the hills ! It per- 
ceived me, it started back, it gazed at me 
with trembling surprise. Ah ! fear not ! 
fair creature, I fondly exclaimed, fear 
not, and flee not away ! I too have a 
gazelle in a distant land ; not less beau- 
tiful her airy form than thine, and her 
dark eye not less tremulously bright ! 

Ah ! little did I deem, my sweetest 



VI DEDICATION. 

friend, that ere I pressed that beauteous 
form again, Sorrow should dim the 
radiance of thy smile, and charge that 
brilliant eye with many a tear ! Yet trust 
thee, dearest, in a brother's love, the purest 
sympathy of our fallen state ! If I recall 
one gleam of rapture to thy pensive 
cheek, not in vain I strike my lonely 
lyre, or throw these laurels at thy fairy 
feet! 



PREFACE. 



The time of this Romance is the twelfth 
century. 

At that period, this was the political 
condition of the East. 

The Caliphate was in a state of rapid 
decay. The Seljukian Sultans, who had 
been called to the assistance of the Com- 
manders of the Faithful, had become 
like the Mayors of the palace in France, 
the real sovereigns of the Empire. They 
had carved four kingdoms out of the 



yiii PREFACE. 

dominions of the successors of the Pro- 
phet, which conferred titles on four Sel- 
jukian Princes, to wit, the Sultan of 
Bagdad, the Sultan of Persia, the Sultan 
of Syria, and the Sultan of Roum, or 
Asia Minor. 

But these warlike princes, in the re- 
laxed discipline and doubtful conduct of 
their armies, began themselves to evince 
the natural effects of luxury and indul- 
gence. They were no longer the same 
invincible and irresistible warriors who 
had poured forth from the shores of the 
Caspian over the fairest regions of the 
East, and although they still contrived 
to preserve order in their dominions, 
they witnessed with ill-concealed appre- 



PREFACE. ix 

hension the rising power of the Kings of 
Karasme, whose conquests daily made 
their territories more contiguous. 

With regard to the Hebrew people, 
it should be known that after the de- 
struction of Jerusalem, the Eastern Jews, 
while they acknowledged the supremacy 
of their conquerors, gathered themselves 
together for all purposes of jurisdiction, 
under the controul of a native ruler, an 
asserted descendant of David, whom 
they dignified with the title of " The 
Prince of the Captivity." If we are to 
credit the enthusiastic annalists of this 
imaginative people, there were periods of 
prosperity when " the Princes of the 
Captivity" assumed scarcely less state, 

a 5 



X PREFACE. 

and enjoyed scarcely less power than the 
ancient Kings of Judah themselves. Cer- 
tain it is that their power increased 
always in an exact proportion with the 
weakness of the Caliphate, and without 
doubt in some of the most distracted 
periods of the Arabian rule, the He- 
brew Princes rose into some degree of lo- 
cal and temporary importance. Their 
chief residence was Bagdad, where they 
remained until the eleventh century, 
an age fatal in Oriental history, and 
from the disasters of which " the Princes 
of the Captivity" were not exempt. They 
are heard of even in the twelfth century. 
I have ventured to place one at Hama- 
dan, a favourite residence of the He- 



PREFACE. XI 

brews, from being- the burial-place of 
Esther and Mordecai. 

In this state of affairs arose Alroy, a 
name perhaps unknown to the vast ma- 
jority of my readers ; yet, if I mistake 
not, a memorable being, and the dry 
record of whose marvellous career I have 
long considered as enveloping the richest 
materials of poetic fiction. 

With regard to the supernatural ma- 
chinery of this romance, it is Cabalis- 
tical and correct. From the Spirits of 
the Tombs to the sceptre of Solomon, 
authority may be found in the traditions 
of the Hebrews for all these spiritual 
introductions. 

I believe that the character of Ori- 



xii PREFACE. 

ental life is not unfaithfully pourtrayed 
in these pages. It has undergone less 
changes than the genius of the Occident. 
I have had the advantage of studying the 
Asiatics in their most celebrated coun- 
tries and capitals. An existence of 
blended splendour and repose, varied 
only by fitful starts of extravagant and 
overwhelming action, and marvellous 
vicissitudes of fortune, a strong influ- 
ence of individual character, a blind 
submission to destiny, imagination, pas- 
sion, credulity : these are some of the 
principal features of society in the most 
favoured regions of the globe. 

And now for my style. I must 
frankly confess that I have invented a 



PREFACE. xiii 

new one. I am conscious of the hazard 
of such innovation, but I have not 
adopted my system without long medi- 
tation, and a severe examination of its 
qualities. I have in another work al- 
ready ventured to express my opinion 
that the age of Versification has past. I 
have there observed, " The mode of 
composition must ever be greatly deter- 
mined by the manner in which the com- 
position can be made public. In an- 
cient days, the voice was the medium 
by which we became acquainted with 
the inventions of a poet. In such a 
method, where those who listened had 
no time to pause, and no opportunity to 
think, it was necessary that everything 

a 7 



xiv PREFACE. 

should be obvious. The audience who 
were perplexed w r ould soon become wea- 
ried. The spirit of ancient poetry, 
therefore, is rather material than meta- 
physical. Superficial, not internal ; there 
is much simplicity and much nature, 
but little passion, and less philosophy. 
To obviate the baldness, which is the 
consequence of a style where the subject 
and the sentiments are rather intimated 
than developed, the poem w T as enriched 
by music, and enforced by action. Oc- 
casionally, were added the enchantment 
of scenery, and the fascination of the 
dance. But the poet did not depend 
merely upon these brilliant accessaries. 
He resolved that his thoughts should be 



PREFACE. XV 

expressed in a manner different from 
other modes of communicating ideas. 
He caught a suggestion from his sister 
art, and invented metre. And in this 
modulation, he introduced a new system 
of phraseology, which marked him out 
from the crowd, and which has obtained 
the title of ' poetic diction/ 

" His object in this system of words 
was to heighten his meaning by strange 
phrases, and unusual constructions. In- 
version was invented to clothe a com- 
mon-place with an air of novelty ; vague 
epithets were introduced to prop up a 
monotonous modulation; were his mean- 
ing to be enforced, he shrank from weari- 
some ratiocination and the agony of pre- 



XVI PREFACE. 

cise conceptions, and sought refuge in 
a bold personification, or a beautiful 
similitude. The art of Poetry was to 
express natural feelings in unnatural 
language. 

" Institutions ever survive their pur- 
pose, and customs govern us when their 
cause is extinct. And this mode of com- 
municating poetic invention still re- 
mained, when the advanced civilization 
of man, in multiplying manuscripts, 
might have made many suspect that the 
time had arrived when the poet was to 
cease to sing, and to learn to write. Had 
the splendid refinement of Imperial Rome 
not been doomed to such rapid decay, 
and such mortifying and degrading vicis- 



PREFACE. xvii 

situdes, I believe that Versification would 
have worn out. Unquestionably that 
empire, in its multifarious population, 
scenery, creeds, and customs, offered the 
richest materials for emancipated Fiction, 
materials, however, far too vast and va- 
rious for the limited capacity of metrical 
celebration. 

" That beneficent Omnipotence, before 
which we must bow down, has so or- 
dered it, that Imitation should be the 
mental feature of Modern Europe ; and 
has ordained that we should adopt a 
Syrian religion, a Grecian literature, and 
a Roman law. At the revival of letters, 
we behold the portentous spectacle of 
national poets communicating their in- 



xviii PREFACE. 

ventions in an exotic form. Conscious 
of the confined nature of their method, 
yet unable to extricate themselves from 
its fatal ties, they sought variety in in- 
creased artifice of diction, and substi- 
tuted for the melody of the lyre, the bar- 
baric clash of rhyme. 

" A revolution took place in the mode 
of communicating Thought. Now, at 
least, it was full time that we should have 
emancipated ourselves for ever from 
sterile metre. One would have supposed 
that the Poet who could not only write, 
but even print his inventions, would have 
felt that it was both useless and unfit that 
they should be communicated by a pro- 
cess invented when his only medium 



PREFACE. xix 

was simple recitation. One would have 
supposed, that the Poet would have 
rushed with desire to the new world be- 
fore him, that he would have seized the 
new means that permitted him to revel 
in an universe of boundless invention ; 
to combine the highest ideal creation 
with the infinite delineation of teeming* 
Nature ; to unravel all the dark myste- 
ries of our bosoms, and all the bright 
purposes of our being ; to become the 
great instructor and champion of his 
species ; and not only delight their fancy, 
and charm their senses, and command 
their will, but demonstrate their rights, 
illustrate their necessities, and expound 
the object of their existence ; and all this 



XX PREFACE. 

too in a style charming* and changing 
with its universal theme, now tender, 
now sportive; now earnest, now profound ; 
now sublime, now pathetic ; and substi- 
tuting for the dull monotony of metre, 
the most various, and exquisite, and in- 
exhaustible melody/'* 

While I have endeavoured to effect 
my own emancipation from the trammels 
of the old style, I do not for a moment 
flatter myself that the new one, which I 
offer, combines those rare qualities which 
I anticipate may be the ultimate result 
of this revolution. But such as it is, it 
stands upon its own merits, and may lead 
abler men to achieve abler consequences. 

It has been urged by a very ingenious 

* Contarini Fleming, vol. iii. 



PREFACE. xxi 

and elegant critic, when commenting, 
perhaps with the apprehensive indig- 
nation of a versifier, upon the passage 
which I have quoted, '.* that the melodies 
of language are the echoes of the melodies 
of thought : as in hearing martial music, 
the step involuntarily takes a statelier 
tread, as to gayer airs, a lighter and 
more buoyant one ; so does the elevated 
idea take a more noble, or the feelings of 
tenderness a sweeter tone, than those of 
ordinary discourse." 

I perfectly assent to this remark, 
which was intended to show " the fal- 
lacies" of my system. I do not oppose 
Melody because I oppose Verse. Thoughts 
are not always melodious, ideas always

the conduct of the story. He has 
not considered it his duty to step in 
between the reader and the beings of his 
imagination, to develope and dwell upon 
their feelings, or to account for their cha- 
racters and actions. He leaves them in 
general to explain every thing for them- 
selves, substituting on his part Descrip- 
tion for Scenery, and occasional bursts of 
lyric melody for that illustrative music, 
without which all dramatic representa- 
tions are imperfect, and which renders 
the serious Opera of the Italians the most 
effective performance of modern times, 
and most nearly approaching the exqui- 
site drama of the ancient Greeks. 

To the Tale of Alroy I have added 



PREFACE. XXV 

the history of a Christian hero placed 
in a somewhat similar position, but 
achieving a very different end; and I 
hope the reader will experience the 
pleasure of an agreeable contrast in the 
Rise of the great Iskander. 



THE WONDROUS 



TALE OF ALROY, 



PART I. 



I. 

The cornets sounded a final flourish as 
the Prince of the Captivity dismounted 
from his white mule, his train shouted as 
if they were once more a people, and 
had it not been for the contemptuous 
leer which played upon the countenances 
of the Moslemin bystanders, it might

have been taken for a day of triumph 
rather than of tribute. 

" The glory has not departed !" ex- 
claimed the venerable Bostenay, as he 
entered the hall of his mansion. " It is 
not as the visit of Sheba unto Solomon ; 
nevertheless the glory has not yet de- 
parted. You have done well, faithful 
Caleb." The old man's courage waxed 
more vigorous as each step within his 
own walls the more assured him against 
the recent causes of his fear — the audible 
curses and the threatened missiles of the 
unbelieving mob. 

" It shall be a day of rejoicing and 
thanksgiving !" continued the Prince ; 
" and look, my faithful Caleb, that the 
trumpeters be well served. That last 
flourish was bravely done. It was not as 
the blast before Jericho; nevertheless it 



OF ALROY. 8 

told that the Lord of Hosts was for us. 
How the accursed Ishmaelites started ! 
Did you mark, Caleb, that tall Turk in 
green upon my left ? By the sceptre of 
Jacob he turned pale ! Oh ! it shall be a 
day of rejoicing and thanksgiving ! And 
spare not the wine, nor the flesh-pots for 
the people. Look you to this, my child, 
for the people shouted bravely, and with 
a stout voice. It was not as the great 
shout in the camp when the ark returned, 
but nevertheless, it was boldly done, and 
showed that the glory had not yet de- 
parted. So spare not the wine, my son, 
and drink to the desolation of Ishmael in 
the juic which he dare not quaff." 

" It has indeed been a great day for 
Israel !" exclaimed Caleb, echoing his 
masters exultation. 

" Had the procession been forbidden/' 

B 2 



4 THE WONDROUS TALE 

continued Bostenay, " had it been re- 
served for me of all the princes to have 
dragged the accursed tribute upon foot, 
without trumpets and without guards, 
by this sceptre, my good Caleb, I really 
think, that sluggishly as this old blood 

now runs, I would but it is needless 

now to talk — the God of our Fathers 
hath been our refuge." 

" Verily, my lord, we were as David 
in the wilderness of Ziph ; but now we 
are as the Lord's anointed in the strong- 
hold of Engedi ! ,J 

" The glory truly has not yet utterly 
departed," resumed the Prince in a more 
subdued tone ; " yet if — I tell you w T hat, 
Caleb — praise the Lord that you are 
young." 

" My Prince too may yet live to see 
the good day." 



OF ALROY. 



" Nay, my child, you misinterpret me. 
Your Prince has lived to see the evil day. 
'fwas not of the coming that I thought 
when I bid you praise the Lord because 
you were young — the more my sin. I 
was thinking, Caleb, that if your hairs 
were as mine, if you could call back like 
me the days that are gone by— the days 
when it needed no bribe to prove we 
were princes — the glorious days when we 
led captivity captive— I was thinking, I 
say, my son, what a gainful heritage it is 
to be born after the joys that have passed 
away." 

" My father lived at Babylon," said 
Caleb. 

"Oh! name it not ! — name it not!" ex- 
claimed the old chieftain. " Dark was 
the day that we lost that second Sion ! 
We were then also slaves to the Egyp- 



6 THE WONDROUS TALE 

tian ; but verily we ruled over the realm 
of Pharaoh. Why Caleb, Caleb, you 
who know all— the days of toil — the nights 
restless as a love-sick boy's, which it has 
cost your Prince to gain permission to 
grace our tribute day with the paltry 
presence of half a dozen guards — you who 
know all my difficulties, who have wit- 
nessed all my mortification, what would 
you say to the purse of dirhems, sur- 
rounded by seven thousand scimetars ?" 
" Seven thousand scimetars !" 
" Not one less ; my father flourished 
one." 

" It was indeed a great day for Israel !" 

" Nay, that is nothing. When old 

Alroy was prince— old David Alroy — for 

thirty years, good Caleb — thirty long 

years we paid no tribute to the Caliph." 

" No tribute ! no tribute for thirty 



OF ALROY. 7 

years ! What marvel then, my Prince, 
that the Philistines have of late exacted 
interest ?" 

" Nay, that is nothing," continued old 
Bostenay, unmindful of his servant's 
ejaculations. " When Moctador was Ca- 
liph, he sent to the same Prince David, 
to know why the dirhems were not 
brought up, and David immediately 
called to horse, and attended by all the 
chief people rode to the palace, and told 
the Caliph that tribute was an acknow- 
ledgment made from the weak to the 
strong to insure protection and support, 
and inasmuch as he and his people had 
garrisoned the city for ten years against 
the Seljuks, he held the Caliph in arrear." 

" We shall yet see an ass mount a lad- 
der," 1 exclaimed Caleb with uplifted eyes 
of wonder. 



8 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" It is true though," continued the 
Prince ; " often have I heard my father 
tell the tale. He was then a child, and 
his mother held him up to see the pro- 
cession return, and all the people shouted, 
" The sceptre has not gone out of Jacob !" 

c ' It was indeed a great day for Israel." 

" Nay, that is nothing. I could tell you 
such things ! But we prattle ; our busi- 
ness is not yet done. You to the people ; 
the widow and the orphan are waiting. 
Give freely, good Caleb, give freely ; the 
spoils of the Canaanite are no longer ours ; 
nevertheless the Lord is still our God, and 
after all, even this is a great day for 
Israel. And, Caleb, Caleb, bid my ne- 
phew, David Alroy, know that I would 
speak with him." 

" I will do all promptly, good master ! 
We wondered that our honoured lord, 



OF ALROY. Q 

your nephew, went not up with the dona- 
tion this day." 

" Who bid you wonder ? Begone, sir! 
How long- are you to idle here? --Away !" 

" They wonder he went not up with the 
tribute to-day. Ay ! surely— a common 
talk. This boy will be our ruin : a pru- 
dent hand to wield our shattered sceptre. 
I have observed him from his infancy ; 
he should have lived in Babylon. The 
old Alroy blood flows in his veins, a 
stiff-necked race. When I was a youth 
his grandsire was my friend ; I had some 
fancies then myself. Dreams, dreams ! 
we have fallen on evil days, and yet we 
prosper I have lived long enough to 
feel a rich caravan, laden with the shawls 
of India, and the stuffs of Samarcand, if 
not exactly like dancing before the ark, 
is still a goodly sight. And our hard- 

B 5 



10 THE WONDROUS TALE 

hearted rulers, with all their pride, can 
they subsist without us ? Still we wax 
rich. I have lived to see the haughty 
Caliph sink into a slave viler far than 
Israel. And the victorious and volup- 
tuous Seljuks, even now they tremble at 
the dim mention of the distant name of 
Arslan. Yet I, Bostenay, and the frail 
remnant of our scattered tribes, still we 
exist, and still, thanks to our God, we 
prosper. But the age of power has past ; 
it is by prudence now that we must 
flourish. The gibe and jest, the curse, 
perchance the blow, Israel now must 
bear, and with a calm, or even smiling 
visage. What then ? For every gibe 
and jest, for every curse, I'll have a dir- 
hem ; and for every blow — let him look 
to it who is my creditor, or wills to 
be so. But see, he comes, my nephew ! 



OF ALROY. 11 

His grandsire was my friend. Methinks 
I look upon him now; the same Alroy 
that was the partner of my boyish hours. 
And yet that fragile form, and girlish 
face but ill consort with the dark passions, 
and the dangerous fancies, I fear lie hid- 
den in that tender breast. Well, sir ?" 

66 You want me, uncle ?" 

" What then ? Uncles often want what 
nephews seldom offer." 

" I at least can refuse nothing ; for I 
have nought to give." 

" You have a jewel which I greatly 
covet." 

" A jewel ! See my chaplet ! You 
gave it me, my uncle ; it is yours." 

" I thank you. Many a blazing ruby, 
many a soft and shadowy pearl, and 
many an emerald glowing like a star in 
the far desart, I behold, my child. They 



12 THE WONDROUS TALE 

are choice stones, and yet I miss a jewel 
far more precious, which, when I gave 
you this rich chaplet, David, I deemed 
you did possess." 

" How do you call it, sir ?" 

" Obedience." 

"Tis a word of doubtful import, sir; 
for to obey, when duty is disgrace, is not 
a virtue." 

" I see you read my thought. In] a 
word, I sent for you to know, wherefore 
you joined me not to-day in offering 
our—" 

" Tribute." 

V Be it so: tribute. Why were you 
absent ?" 

" Because it was a tribute : I pay 
none." 

" But that the dreary course of seventy 
winters has not erased the memory of my 



OF ALROY. 13 

boyish follies, David, I should esteem you 
mad. Think you, because I am old, I 
am enamoured of disgrace, and love a 
house of bondage. If life were a mere 
question between freedom and slavery, 
glory and dishonor, all could decide. 
Trust me, there needs but little spirit to 
be a moody patriot in a sullen home, and 
vent your heroic spleen upon your fellow- 
sufferers, whose sufferings you cannot 
remedy. But of such stuff your race 
were ever made. Such deliverers ever 
abounded in the house of Alroy. And 
what has been the result ? 1 found you, 
and your sister, orphan infants, your 
sceptre broken, and your tribes dispersed. 
The tribute, which now at least we pay 
like princes, was then exacted with the 
scourge, and offered in chains. I col- 
lected our scattered people, I re-esta- 



14 THE WONDROUS TALE 

blished our ancient throne, and this day, 
which you look upon as a day of hu- 
miliation, and of mourning, is rightly 
considered by all a day of triumph, and 
of feasting; for has it not proved, in the 
very teeth of the Ishmaelites, that the 
sceptre has not yet departed from Ja- 
cob r 

" I pray you, uncle, speak not of these 
things. I would not willingly forget you 
are my kinsman, and a kind one. Let 
there not be strife between us. What 
my feelings are is nothing. They are my 
own : I cannot change them. And for 
my ancestors, if they pondered much, 
and achieved little, why then 'twould 
seem our pedigree is pure, and I am their 
true son. At least one was a hero." 

" Ah ! the great Alroy ; you may well 
be proud of such an ancestor. ,, 



OF ALROY. 15 

" I am ashamed, uncle, — ashamed, 
ashamed." 

" His sceptre still exists. At least, I 
have not betrayed him. And this brings 
me to the real purport of our interview. 
That sceptre I would return." 

" To whom ?" 

" To its right owner, to yourself." 

" Oh ! no, no, no — I pray you, pray 
you, uncle, I pray you not. I do en- 
treat you, Sir, upon my knees, forget I 
have a right as utterly as I myself dis- 
claim it. That sceptre — you have wielded 
it wisely and well ; I do beseech you 
keep it. Indeed, good uncle, I have no 
sort of talent for all the busy duties of 
this post." 

" You sigh for glory, yet you fly from 
toil." 

" Toil without glory is a menials lot." 



16 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" You are a boy ; you may yet live to 
learn that the sweetest lot of life consists 
in tranquil duties and well-earned re- 
pose." 

" If my lot be repose, I'll find it in a 
lair." 

" Ah ! David, David, there is a wild- 
ness in your temper, boy, that makes me 
often tremble. You are already too 
much alone, child. And for this, as well 
as weightier reasons, I am desirous that 
you should at length assume the office 
you inherit. What my poor experience 
can afford to aid you, as your counsellor, 
I shall ever proffer; and for the rest, 
our God will not desert you, an orphan 
child, and born of royal blood." 

" Pr'ythee, no more, kind uncle. I 
have but little heart to mount a throne, 
which only ranks me as the first of 
slaves." 



OF ALROY. 17 

" Pooh, pooh, you are young. Live 
we like slaves ? Is this hall a servile 
chamber ? These costly carpets, and 
these rich divans, in what proud harem 
shall we find their match ? I feel not 
like a slave. My coffers are full of dir- 
hems. Is that slavish ? The wealthiest 
company of the caravan is ever Boste- 
nay's. Is that to be a slave ? Walk the 
bazaar of Bagdad, and you will find my 
name more potent than the Caliph's. Is 
that a badge of slavery ?" 

" Uncle, you toil for others." 

" So do we all, so does the bee, yet he 
is free and happy." 

" At least he has a sting." 

" Which he can use but once ; and 
when he stings " 

" He dies, and like a hero. Such a 
death is sweeter than his honey." 



18 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" Well, well, you are young, you are 
young. I once, too, had fancies. Dreams 
all, dreams all. I willingly would see 
you happy, child. Come, let that face 
brighten ; after all, to-day is a great day. 
If you had seen what I have seen, David, 
you too would feel grateful. Come, let us 
feast, let us feast. The Ishmaelite, the ac- 
cursed child of Hagar, he does confess 
to-day you are a prince : this day also 
you complete your eighteenth year. The 
custom of our people now requires you 
should assume the attributes of manhood. 
To-day, then, your reign commences ; 
and at our festival I will present the 
elders to their prince. For a while fare- 
well, my child. Array that face in 
smiles. I shall most anxiously await 
your presence." 

" Farewell, Sir." 



OF ALROY. 19 

He turned his head and watched his 
uncle as he departed ; the bitter expres- 
sion of his countenance gradually melted 
away as Bostenay disappeared ; dejection 
succeeded to sarcasm ; he sighed, he threw 
himself upon a couch, and buried his 
face in his hands. 

Suddenly he arose, and paced the 
chamber with an irregular and moody 
step. He stopped, he leant against a 
column. He spoke in a tremulous and 
smothered voice. 

" Oh ! my heart is full of care, and my 
soul is dark with sorrow ! What am I ? 
What is all this ? A cloud hangs heavy 
o'er my life. God of my fathers ! let it 
burst. 

" I know not what I feel — yet what I 
feel is madness. Thus to be, is not to 
live, if life be what I sometimes dream,

and dare to think it might be. To 
breathe, to feed, to sleep, to wake and 
breathe again — again to feel existence 
without hope ; if this be life, why then 
these brooding thoughts that whisper 
death were better ? 

" Away ! away ! The demon tempts 
me. But to what, to what ? What name- 
less deed shall desecrate this hand ? No, 
no, it must not be : the royal blood of 
twice two thousand years it must not 
die — die like a dream. Oh! my heart is 
full of care, and my soul is dark with 
sorrow ! 

" Hark ! the trumpets that sound our 
dishonor. Oh ! but that they sounded 
to battle ! Lord of Hosts ! Let me con- 
quer or die ! Let me conquer like David, 
or die, Lord, like Saul. 

if Ah ! were I in the woods once more,

a melancholy child ! Each flower, that 
raised its haughty head, should be the 
turbaned enemy, and I would wave some 
sword of straw, and find revenge in 
every blow, that quelled their painted 
pride. 

" Tis over now ; that sweet, sweet 
prime, when fancy solaced solitude. Yet 
I am still alone. But how alone ? The 
madness of the past and the despair of 
the future — are not these the choice com- 
panions of my pleasant life ? 

" I once remember, when a child, I 
cried to be a man — and now, methinks, 
I'll sit me down and cry to be a child. 
Ah ! tears of bliss, though shed in sad- 
ness, unutterable joys ! No more the 
sunshine of the breast succeeds those 
freshening showers of grief; light season 
of my boyish spring, when Care was but 



22 THE WONDROUS TALE 

a mimic game, and Woe a wild delu- 
sion ! 

6 ' Behold this chaplet rich and rare ; 
its stones might deck a soldan's brow ! 
Could 1 but weep, for each bright tear I'd 
give a flaming gem ; could I but weep 
for each soft sob, Fd yield a lustrous 
pearl. Alas ! the age of tears is o'er, and 
yet — my heart is full of care, and my soul 
is dark with sorrow. 

" Why do I live ? Ah ! could the 
thought that lurks within my secret 
heart but answer — not the trumpet's blast 
when echoing on the noisy hills, could 
speak as loud or clear. The votary of a 
false idea, I linger in this shadowy life, 
and feed on silent images which no eye but 
mine can gaze on, until, at length, they 
are invested with all the terrible circum- 
stance of life, and breathe, and act, and 



OF ALROY. 23 

form a stirring- world of fate and beauty, 
time, and death, and glory. And then 
from out this dazzling wilderness of deeds 
I wander forth and wake, and find myself 
in this dull house of bondage, even as I 
do now. Horrible ! horrible ! 

" God of my fathers ! — for indeed I 
dare not style thee God of their wretched 
sons — yet by the memory of Sinai let 
me tell thee that some of the antique 
blood yet beats within these pulses, and 
there yet is one who fain would com- 
mune with thee face to face — commune 
and conquer. 

" And if the promise unto which we 
cling be not a cheat, why let him come, 
come, and come quickly, for thy servant 
Israel, Lord, is now a slave so infamous, 
so woe-begone, and so contemned, that 
even when our fathers hung their harps 



24 THE WONDROUS TALE 

by the sad waters of the Babylonian 
stream, why, it were Paradise again to 
what we suffer. 

" Alas ! they do not suffer ; they en- 
dure and do not feel. Or by this time 
our shadowy cherubim would guard again 
the ark. It is the will that is the father 
to the deed, and he who broods over some 
long idea, however wild, will find his 
dream was but the prophecy of coming 
fate. 

" And even now a vivid flash darts 
through the darkness of my mind — me- 
thinks, methinks— Ah ! worst of woes to 
dream of glory in despair. No, no, I 
live and die a most ignoble thing ; beauty 
and love, and fame and mighty deeds, 
the smile of women and the gaze of men, 
and the ennobling consciousness of worth, 
and all the fiery course of the creative

passions — these are not for me — and I, 
Alroy, the long posterity of sacred kings, 
and with a soul that pants for empire, I 
stand here extending my vain arm for 
my lost sceptre, a most dishonoured slave ! 
And do I still exist ? Exist ! ay, merrily. 
Hark ! Festivity holds her fair revel in 
these light-hearted walls. We are gay 
to-day ; and yet ere yon proud Sun, 
whose mighty course was stayed before 
our swords that now he even does not 
deign to shine upon : ere yon proud Sun 
shall, like a hero from a glorious field, 
enter the bright pavilion of his rest ; there 
shall a deed be done.

feeble arm cannot redeem thy heritage,

house of David is no more : no more our 
sacred seed shall lurk and linger, like a 
blighted thing, in this degenerate earth. 
If we cannot flourish, why then well 

die !" 

" Oh ! say not so, my brother !" 
A voice broke on the air, so soft, so 
sweet, so wildly musical — it sounded like 
a holy bell upon a summer day, a holy 
bell that calls to prayer, and stills each 
fierce emotion. 

And softly kneeling at his side behold 
a female form ! Her face is hid, her lips 
are pressed against the hand she gently 
steals. And now she raises up her head, 
and waits with tender patience for a 
glance from one who seldom smiles. 
M Oh ! say not so, my brother !" 
He turns, he gazes on a face beauteous 
as a starry night, — a starry night in those 



OF ALROY. 27 

far climes where not a cloud is marked in 
heaven, when all below on earth 's so 
sweet, and all above in air so still, that 
every passion melts away, and life seems 
but a fragrant dream. 

I too have wandered in those lands, 
and roamed mid Jordan's vocal bowers. 
Ah ! could the nightingale that sang to 
Syria's rose now sing to me, I'd give the 
fame of coming years to listen to that 
lay! 

He turns, he gazes, and he bends ; his 
heart is full, his voice is low. 

" Ah, Miriam: thou queller of dark 
spirits ! is it thou ? Why art thou 
here ?" 

u Why am I here ? Are you not here ? 
and need I urge a stronger plea ? Oh ! 
brother dear, I pray you come, and min- 
gle in our festival ! Our walls are hung 

c 2

with flowers you love ; 2 I culled them by 
the fountain's side ; the holy lamps are 
trimmed and set, and you must raise their 
earliest flame. Without the gate, my 
maidens wait, to offer you a robe of state. 
Then, brother dear, I pray you come and 
mingle in our festival." 

" Why should we feast ?" 

" Ah ! is it not in thy dear name these 
lamps are lit, these garlands hung ? To- 
day to us a prince is given, to-day — " 

" A prince without a kingdom." 

" But not without that which makes 
kingdoms precious, and which full many 
a royal heart has sighed for — willing sub- 
jects, David." 

" Slaves, Miriam, fellow-slaves." 

" What we are, my brother, our God 
has willed ; and let us bow and tremble." 

" I will not bow, I cannot tremble." 



OF ALROY. 29 

" Hush, David, hush ! It was this 
haughty spirit that called the vengeance 
of the Lord upon us." 

* It was this haughty spirit that con- 
quered Canaan/' 

"Oh ! my brother, my dear, dear bro- 
ther ! they told me the dark spirit had 
fallen on thee, and I came, and hoped thy 
Miriam might have charmed it. What 
we have been, Alroy, is a bright dream ; 
and what we may be, at least as bright a 
hope ; and for what we are, thou art my 
brother. In thy love I find present feli- 
city, and value more thy chance embraces 
and thy scanty smiles, than all the va- 
nished splendour of our race, our gorgeous 
gardens, and our glittering halls." 

M Who waits without there ?"

" Caleb ?" 

" My Lord."

" Go tell my uncle, I presently will 
join the banquet. Leave me a moment, 
clearest. I'll soon be with thee. Nay, 
dry those tears, my life, or let me stop 
them with a soft kiss." 

" Oh, Alroy, they are not tears of sor- 
row !" 

" God be with, thee, angel ; fare thee 
well, though but for a moment. Thou 
art the charm and consolation of my 
life. Farewell, farewell. 

" I do observe the influence of women 
very potent over me. 'Tis not of such 
stuff that they make heroes. I know not 
love, save that pure affection that does 
subsist between me and this girl : an or- 
phan and my sister. We are so alike, 
that when, last Passover, in mimickry, 
she twined my turban round her graceful 
head, our uncle called her David. 

" The daughters of my tribe, they

please me not, though they are passing 
fair. Were our sons as brave as they are 
beautiful, we still might dance on Sion. 
Yet have I often thought, that could I 
pillow this moody brow upon some snowy 
bosom that were my own, and dwell in 
the wilderness, far from the sight and ken 
of man, and all the care and toil and 
wretchedness, that groan and sweat and 
sigh about me, I might haply lose this 
deep sensation of o'erwhelming woe, that 
broods upon my being. No matter : Life 
is but a dream, and mine must be a dull 
one/' 



II. 



Without the gates of Hamadan, a very 
short distance from the citv, was an en- 



32 THE WONDROUS TALE 

closed piece of elevated ground, in the 
centre of which rose an ancient sepulchre, 
the traditionary tomb of Esther and Mor- 
decai. 3 This solemn and solitary spot was 
an accustomed haunt of Alroy, and thi- 
ther escaping from the banquet, about an 
hour before sunset, he this day repaired. 

As he unlocked the massy gate of the 
burial-place, he heard behind him the 
trampling of a horse ; and before he had 
again secured the entrance, some one 
shouted to him. 

He looked up, and recognized the 
youthful and voluptuous Alschiroch, the 
governor of the city, and brother of the 
Sultan of the Seljuks. He was attended 
only by a single running footman, an 
Arab, a detested favourite, and notorious 
minister of his pleasures. 

"Dog!" exclaimed the irritated Al- 



OF ALROY. 33 

schiroch, " art thou deaf, or obstinate ? or 
both ? Are we to call twice to our slaves ? 
Unlock that gate!" 

u Wherefore ?" inquired Alroy. 

" Wherefore! By the holy prophet, 
he bandies questions with us. Unlock 
that gate, or thy head shall answer for it !" 

" Who art thou," inquired Alroy, 
" whose voice is so loud ? Art thou some 
holiday Turk, who hath transgressed the 
orders of thy prophet and drunken aught 
but water ? Go to, or I will summon thee 
before thy Cadi ;" and so saying, he 
turned towards the tomb. 

" By the eyes of my mother, the dog 
jeers us. But that we are already late, 
and this horse is like an untamed tiger, 
I would impale him on the spot. Speak 
to the dog, Mustapha ! manage him ! " 

" Worthy Hebrew/' said the silky 

c 5 



34f THE WONDROUS TALE 

Mustapha, advancing, " apparently you 
are not aware that this is our Lord Al- 
schiroch. His Highness would fain walk 
his horse through the burial-ground of 
thy excellent people, as he is obliged to 
repair, on urgent matters, to a holy San- 
ton, who sojourns on the other side of the 
hill, and time presses." 

" If this be our Lord Alschiroch, thou 
doubtless art his faithful slave, Mustapha." 

" I am, indeed, his poor slave. What 
then, young master ?" 

" Deem thyself lucky that the gate is 
closed. It was but yesterday thou didst 
insult the sister of a servant of my house. 
I would not willingly sully my hands 
with such miserable blood as thine — but 
away, wretch, away ! " 

" Holy Prophet ! who is this dog ?" ex- 
claimed the astonished governor. 

" Tis the young Alroy," whispered 



OF ALROY 35 

Mustapha, who had not at first recognized 
him, " he they call their prince : a most 
headstrong youth. My Lord, we had 
better proceed." 

" The young Alroy ! I mark him. 
They must have a prince too ! The young 
Alroy ! Well, let us away, — and, dog !" 
shouted Alschiroch, rising in his stirrups 
and shaking his hand with a threatening 
air, " dog ! remember thy tribute !" 

Alroy rushed to the gate, but the massy 
lock was slow to open ; and ere he could 
succeed, the fiery steed had borne Alschi- 
roch beyond pursuit. 

An expression of baffled rage remained 
for a moment on his countenance ; for a 
moment he remained with his eager eye 
fixed on the route of his vanished enemy, 
and then he walked slowly towards the 
tomb ; but his excited temper was now 



36 THE WONDROUS TALE 

little in unison with the still reverie in 
which he had repaired to the sepulchre 
to indulge. He was restless and dis- 
quieted, and at length he wandered into 
the woods, which rose on the summit of 
the burial-place. 

He found himself at length upon a 
brow, crested with young pine-trees, in 
the midst of which rose a mighty cedar. 
He threw himself underneath its thick 
and shadowy branches, and looked upon 
a valley small and green ; in the midst of 
which was a marble fountain, the richly 
carved cupola, 4 supported by twisted co- 
lumns, and banded by a broad inscription 
in Hebrew characters. The bases of the 
white pillars were covered with wild 
flowers, or hidden by beds of variegated 
gourds. The transparent sunset flung 
over the whole scene a soft, but brilliant 
light. 



OF ALROY. 37 

The tranquil hour, the beauteous scene, 
the sweetness and the stillness blending 
their odour and serenity, the gentle 
breeze that softly rose, and summoned 
forth the languid birds, to cool their 
plumage in the twilight air, and waive 

their radiant wings in skies as bright 

Ah ! what stern spirit will not yield to 
the soft genius of subduing Eve ! 

And Alroy gazed upon the beauteous 
loneliness of earth, and a tear stole down 
his haughty cheek. 

" Tis singular ! but when I am thus 
alone at this still hour, I ever fancy I 
gaze upon the Land of Promise. And 
often in my dreams, some sunny spot, the 
bright memorial of a roving hour, will 
rise upon my sight, and when I wake, I 
feel as if I had been in Canaan. Why 
am I not ? The caravan that bears my 
uncle's goods across the desart would bear 



38 THE WONDROUS TALE 

me too. But I rest here, my miserable 
life running to seed in the dull misery of 
this wretched city, and do nothing. 
Why ! the old captivity was empire to 
our inglorious bondage. We have no 
Esther now to share their thrones, no po- 
litic Mordecai, no purple-vested Daniel. 
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem ! I do believe 
one sight of thee would nerve me to the 
sticking point. And yet to gaze upon 
thy fallen state — my uncle tells me that 
of the Temple not a stone remains. Tis 
horrible. Is there no hope ?" 

" The bricks are fallen, but we 
will rebtiild with marble ; the sy- 
camores are cut down, but we will 
replace them with cedars" 
" The chorus of our maidens, as they 
pay their evening visit to the fountain's 
side. 5 The burthen is prophetic. 

" Hark again ! How beautifully, upon 



OF ALROY. 39 

the soft and flowing air, their sweet and 
mingled voices blend and float I" 

" Yet again I will build thee, 
and thou shalt be built, O Virgin 
of Israel ! Yet again shalt thou 
deck thyself with thy tabrets, and 
go forth in the dance of those that 
make merry. Yet again shalt 
thou plant vineyards on the moun- 
tains of Satnaria." 
" See ! their white forms break through 
the sparkling foliage of the sunny shrubs 
as they descend, with measured step, that 
mild acclivity. A fair society in bright 
procession : each one clothed in solemn 
drapery, veiling her shadowy face with 
modest hand, and bearing on her grace- 
ful head a graceful vase. Their leader is 
my sister. 

" And now they reach the fountain 



40 THE WONDROUS. TALE 

side, and dip their vases in the water, 
pure and beauteous as themselves. Some 
repose beneath the marble pillars ; some, 
seated 'mid the flowers, gather sweets, 
and twine them into garlands ; and that 
wild girl, now that the order *s broke, 
touches with light fingers her moist vase, 
and showers startling drops of glittering 
light on her serener sisters. Hark! again 
they sing." 

" O vine of Sibmah ! upon 
thy summer fruits, and upon thy 
vintage, a spoiler hath fallen ! 

A scream, a shriek, a long wild shriek, 
confusion, flight, despair ! Behold ! from 
out the woods a turbaned man rushes, 
and seizes the leader of the chorus. Her 
companions fly on all sides, Miriam alone 
is left in the arms of Alschiroch. 

The water column wildly rising, from 



OF ALROY. 41 

the breast of summer ocean, in some warm 
tropic clime, when the sudden clouds too 
well discover, the holiday of heaven is 
over, and the shrieking sea-birds tell a 
time of fierce commotion, the column 
rising* from the sea, it was not as wild as 
he — the young Alroy. 

Pallid and mad, he swift upsprang, 
and he tore up a tree by its lusty roots, 
and down the declivity, dashing with 
rapid leaps, panting and wild, he struck 
the ravisher on the temple with the 
mighty pine. Alschiroch fell lifeless on 
the sod, and Miriam fainting into her 
brother's arms. 

And there he stood, fixed and immov- 
able, gazing upon his sister's deathly face, 
and himself exhausted by passion and his 
exploit, supporting her cherished, but 
senseless, body. 



42 THE WONDROUS TALE 

One of the fugitive maidens appeared 
reconnoitering in the distance. When 
she observed her mistress in the arms of 
one of her own people, her courage re- 
vived, and desirous of rallying her scat- 
tered companions, she raised her voice, 
and sang : 

" Haste, daughters of Jerusa- 
lem, O ! haste, for the Lord has 
avenged us, and the spoiler is 
spoiled" 
And soon the verse was responded to 
from various quarters of the woods., and 
soon the virgins re-assembled, singing, 
" We come, O ! daughter of 
Jerusalem, we come; for the Lord 
has avenged us, and the spoiler is 
spoiled" 
They gathered round their mistress, 
and one loosened her veil, and another 



OF ALROY. 43 

brought water from the fountain, and 
sprinkled her reviving countenance. And 
Miriam opened her eyes, and said, " My 
brother !" And he answered, " I am 
here." And she replied, in a low voice, 
" Fly, David, fly, for the man you have 
stricken is a prince among the people." 

" He will be merciful, my sister ; and, 
doubtless, since he first erred, by this 
time he has forgotten my offence." 

" Justice and mercy ; Oh, my brother, 
what can these foul tyrants know of 
either ! Already he has perhaps doomed 
you to some refined and procrastinated 
torture, already — Ah ! what unutterable 
woe is mine — fly, my brother, fly !" 
" Fly, fly, fly /" 

" There is no fear, my Miriam ; would 
all his accursed race could trouble us as 
little as their sometime ruler. See, he

sleeps soundly. But his carcass shall not 
defile our fresh fountain, and our fragrant 
flowers. Ill stow it in the woods, and 
stroll here at night to listen to the jackals 
at their banquet. " 

" You speak wildly, David. What ! 
No ! It is impossible ! He is not dead ! 
You have not slain him ! He sleeps — 
he is afraid. He mimics death, that we 
may leave his side and he may rise again 
in safety. Girls, look to him. David, you 
do not answer. Brother, dear, dear bro- 
ther : surely he has swooned. I thought 
he had fled. Bear water, maidens, to 
that terrible man. I dare not look upon 
him." 

" Away ! I'll look upon him, and I'll 
triumph. Dead ! Alschiroch dead ! Why ! 
but a moment since, this clotted carcass 
was a Prince, my tyrant. So we can rid

ourselves of them, eh ? If the Prince 
fall, why not the people ? Dead, abso- 
lutely dead, and I his slayer. Hah ! at 
length I am a man. This, this indeed is 
life. Let me live slaying !" 

" Woe ! woe ! our house is fallen ! 
The wiidness of his gestures frightens 
me. David, David, I pray thee cease. 
He hears me not, my voice, perchance, is 
thin. I'm very faint. Maidens, kneel 
to vour Prince, and soothe the madness 
of his passion." 

" Sweet is the voice of a sister 
in the season of sorrow, and wise 
is the counsel of those who love us." 
" Why, this is my Goliath ! a pebble 
or a stick, it is the same. The Lord of 
Hosts is for us. Ri^htlv am I called 
David." 

" Deliver us from our enemies,

O Lord ! from those who rise up 
against us, and those who lie in 
wait for us" 

" Were but this blow multiplied, were 
but the servants of my uncle's house to 
do the same, why we should see again the 
days of Elah ! The Philistine, the foul, 
lascivious, damnable, Philistine ; and he 
must touch my sister. Oh that all his 
tribe were here, all, all ! I'd tie such 
firebrands to their foxes tails, the blaze 
should light to freedom !" 

While he spoke, a maiden, who had 
not yet rejoined the company, came run- 
ning towards them very swiftly with an 
agitated countenance. 

" Fly, fly," she exclaimed ; " they 
come, they come/' 

Miriam was reclining in an attendant's 
arms, feeble and faint, but the moment

her quick ear caught these words, she 
sprang* up, and seized her brother's arm. 

"Alroy ! David, David, brother, sweet, 
sweet brother. I beseech thee, listen — I 
am thy sister, thy Miriam, thy fond be- 
loved Miriam; — they come, they come, 
the hard-hearted, wicked men, they come, 
they come, to kill, perhaps to torture 
thee, my tender brother. Eouse thyself, 
David, rouse thyself from this wild, fierce 
dream : save thyself — fly !" 

" Ah ! is it thou, Miriam ? Be easy, 
love, thou seest he sleepeth soundly. I 
will collect my senses. I was dreaming 
of noble purposes and mighty hopes. 
'Tis over now. I am myself again. 
What would'st thou, my sweet treasure ?" 

" They come, the fierce retainers of 
this fallen man : they come to seize thee. 
Fly, David."

" And leave thee ?" 

" I and my maidens, we have yet time 
to escape by the private way we entered, 
our uncle's garden. When in his house, 
we are for a moment safe — as safe as our 
poor race can ever be. Bostenay is so 
rich, so wise, so prudent, so learned in 
man's ways, and knows so well the cha- 
racter and spirit of these men, all will 
go right : I fear nothing, nothing, nothing. 
But thou, if thou art here, or to be found, 
thy blood alone will satiate them. If 
they be persuaded that thou hast escaped, 
as I yet pray thou mayest, their late 
master here, whom they could scarcely 
love, why give me thy arm an in- 
stant, sweet Beruna, I am rather faint. 
So, that's well. I was saying, if well 
bribed, and they may have all my jewels, 
why, very soon, he will be as little in

their memories, as he is now in life. I 
can scarcely speak — I feel my words 
wander, or seem to wander ; I could 
swoon, but will not — nay ! do not fear, 
my love, I will reach home. These 
maidens are my charge. Tis in these 
crises we should show the worth of 
royal blood. Ill see them safe — or die 
with them." 

" Oh ! my sister, methinks I never 
knew I was a brother until this hour. 
My precious Miriam, what is life ? what 
is revenge, or even fame and freedom, 
without thee ? I '11 stay." 

" Sweet is the voice of a sister

" Fly, David, fly." 

" Fly ! whither, and how ?"

The neigh of a horse sounded from the 
thicket. 

" Ah ! they come, they come !" ex- 
claimed the distracted Miriam. 

"All this has come upon us,0 
Lord, yet have we not forgotten 
thee, neither have we dealt falsely 
in thy covenant." 
" Hark ! again it neighs ! It is a 
horse that calleth to its rider. I see it, 
I see it. Courage, Miriam ! it is no 
enemy, but a very present friend in time 
of trouble. It is Alschiroch's courser. 
He passed me on it by the tomb ere sun- 
set. I marked it well — a very princely 
steed." 

" Behold, behold, a ram is 
caught in the thicket by his horns" 
" Our God hath not forgotten us ! 
Quick, maidens, bring forth the goodly

steed. What ! do you tremble ? I'll be 
his groom." 

" Nay ! Miriam, beware, beware. It 
is an untamed beast, wild as the whirl- 
wind. Let me deal with him." 

He ran after her, kissed her as he 
passed, dashed into the thicket, and 
brought forth the horse. 

Short time I ween that stately steed 
had parted from his desart home ; his 
haughty crest, his eye of fire, the glory 
of his snorting nostril, betokened well his 
conscious pride, and pure nobility of race. 
His colour was like the sable night shin- 
ing with a thousand stars, and he pawed 
the ground with his delicate hoof, like an 
eagle flapping its wing. 

Alroy vaulted on his back, and reined 
him with a master's hand. 

" Hah !" he exclaimed, " I feel more

bent down and whispered, " Tell the

year shall roll its heavy course, I shall 
return, and make our masters here pay 
for this hurried ride and bitter parting. 
Now for the desart !" 



OF ALROY. 53 



PART II. 

I. 

Speed, fleetly speed, thou courser bold, 
and track the desart's trackless way. 
Beneath thee is the boundless earth, 
above thee is the boundless heaven, an 
iron soil and brazen sky. Speed, swiftly 
speed, thou courser bold, and track the 
desart's trackless way ! 

Ah ! dost thou deem these salty plains 6 
lead to thy Yemen's happy groves, and 
dost thou scent, on the hot breeze, the 
spicy breath of Araby ? A sweet delu- 
sion, noble steed, for this briny wilder- 






54 THE WONDROUS TALE 

ness leads not to the happy groves of 
Yemen, and the breath thou scentest on 
the coming breeze is not the spicy breath 
of Araby. 

The day has died, the stars have risen, 
with all the splendour of a desart sky, 
and now the Night descending brings, 
solace on her dewy wings, to the fainting 
form and pallid cheek of the youthful 
Hebrew Prince. 

Still the courser onward rushes, still 
his mighty heart supports him. Season 
and space, the glowing soil, the burning 
ray, yield to the tempest of his frame ; 
the thunder of his nerves, and lightning 
of his veins. 

Food or water they have none. No 
genial fount, no grateful tree, rise with 
their pleasant company. Never a beast 
or bird is there, in that hoary desart 



OF ALROY. 55 

bare. Nothing breaks the almighty still- 
ness. Even the jackal's felon cry might 
seem a soothing melody. A grey wild 
rat, with snowy whiskers, out of a 
withered bramble stealing, with a youth- 
ful snake in its ivory teeth, in the moon- 
light grins with glee. This is their sole 
society. 

Morn comes, the fresh and fragrant 
morn, for which even the guilty sigh. 
Morn comes, and all is visible. And 
light falls like a signet on the earth, and 
its face is turned like wax with a seal. 
Before them, and also on their right, was 
the sandy desart ; but in the night they 
had approached much nearer to the 
mountainous chain, which bounded the 
desart on the left, and whither Alroy had 
at first guided the steed. 

The mountains were a chain of the 



56 THE WONDROUS TALE 

mighty Elburz ; and as the sun rose from 
behind a lofty peak, the horse suddenly 
stopped, and neighed, as if asking for 
water. But Alroy, himself exhausted, 
could only soothe him with caresses. 
And the horse, full of courage, under- 
stood his master, and neighed again more 
cheerfully. 

For an hour or two the Prince and his 
faithful companion proceeded slowly, but 
as the day grew on, the heat became so 
oppressive, and the desire to drink so 
overwhelming, that Alroy again urged 
on the steed towards the mountains, 
where he knew that he should find a 
well. The courser dashed willingly for- 
ward, and seemed to share his master's 
desire to quit the arid and exhausting 
wilderness. 

More than once the unhappy fugitive 



OF ALROY. 57 

debated whether he should not allow him- 
self to drop from his seat and die ; no 
torture that awaited him at Hamadan, 
that did not seem preferable to the pro- 
longed and inexpressible anguish that he 
now endured. As he rushed along, lean- 
ing on his bearer's neck, he perceived a 
patch of the desart that seemed of a 
darker colour than the surrounding sand. 
Here, he believed, might perhaps be 
found water. He tried to check the 
steed, but with difficulty he succeeded, and 
with still greater difficulty dismounted. 
He knelt down, and feebly raked up the 
sand with his hands. It was very moist. 
He nearly fainted over his fruitless 
labour. At length, when he had dug 
about a foot deep, there bubbled up some 
water. He dashed in his hand, but it 
was salt as the ocean. When the horse 

D 5 



58 THE WONDROUS TALE 

saw the water his ears rose, but when he 
smelt it, he turned away his head and 
neighed most piteously. 

" Alas, poor beast !" exclaimed Alroy ; 
" I am the occasion of thy suffering, who 
would be a kind master to thee, if the 
world would let me. Oh that we were 
once more by my own fair fountain ! The 
thought is madness. And Miriam too ! 
I fear I am sadly tender-hearted/' He 
leant against his horse's back, with a feel- 
ing of utter exhaustion, and burst into 
hysteric sobs. 

And the steed softly moaned, and 
turned its head, and gently rubbed its 
face against his arm, as if to solace 
him in his suffering. And strange, but 
Alroy was relieved by having given way 
to his emotion, and charmed with the 
fondness of the faithful horse, he leant 



OF ALROY. ,59 

down and took water, and threw it over 
its feet to cool them, and wiped the foam 
from its face, and washed it, and the 
horse again neighed. 

And now Alroy tried to remount, but 
his strength failed him, and the horse im- 
mediately knelt down and received him. 
And the moment that the Prince was in 
his seat, the horse rose, and again pro- 
ceeded at a rapid pace in their old direc- 
tion. Towards sunset they were within 
a few miles of the broken and rocky 
ground into which the mountains de- 
scended ; and afar off Alroy recognized 
the cupola of the long-expected well. 
With reanimated courage and rallied 
energies, he patted his courser's neck, 
and pointed in the direction of the cu- 
pola, and the horse pricked up its ears, 
and increased its pace. 



60 THE WONDROUS TALE 

Just as the Sun set, they reached the 
well. Alroy jumped off the horse, and 
would have led it to the fountain, but the 
animal would not advance. It stood 
dreadfully shivering with a glassy eye, 
and then it bowed its head, and with a 
groan fell down and died. 



II. 



Night brings rest ; night brings solace ; 
rest to the weary ; solace to the sad . 
And to the desperate night brings despair. 

The moon has sunk to early rest ; but 
a thousand stars are in the sky. The 
mighty mountains rise severe in the clear 
and silent air. In the forest all is still. 
The tired wind no longer roams, but has 
lightly dropped on its leafy couch, and 



OF ALROY. 61 

sleeps like man. Silent all but the foun- 
tain's drip. And by the fountain's side 
a youth is lying. 

Suddenly a creature steals through the 
black and broken rocks. Ha, ha ! the 
jackal smells from afar the rich corrup- 
tion of the courser's clay. Suddenly and 
silently it steals, and stops, and smells. 
Brave banquetting I ween to-night for all 
that goodly company. Jackal, and fox, 
and marten cat, haste ye now ere morn- 
ing's break shall call the vulture to his 
feast, and rob ye of your prey. 

The jackal lapped the courser's blood, 
and moaned with exquisite delight. And 
in a moment, a faint bark was heard 
in the distance. And the jackal peeled 
the ftesh from one of the ribs, and again 
burst into a shriek of mournful extasy. 

Hark, their quick tramp ! First six, 



62 THE WONDROUS TALE 

and then three, galloping with ungodly 
glee. And a marten cat came rushing 
down from the woods ; but the jackals, 
fierce in their number, drove her away, 
and there she stood without the circle, 
panting, beautiful, and baffled, with her 
white teeth and glossy skin, and sparkling 
eyes of rabid rage. 7 

Suddenly, as one of the half-gorged 
jackals retired from the main corpse, 
dragging along a stray member by some 
still palpitating nerves, the marten cat 
made a spring at her enemy, carried off 
his prey, and rushed into the woods. 

Her wild scream of triumph woke a 
lion from his lair. His mighty form, 
black as ebony, moved on a distant emi- 
nence, his tail flowed like a serpent. He 
roared, and the jackals trembled, and 
immediately ceased from their banquet, 



OF ALROY. 68 

turning their heads in the direction of 
their sovereign's voice. He advanced ; 
he stalked towards them. They retired ; 
he bent his head, examined the carcass 
with condescending curiosity, and in- 
stantly quitted it with royal disdain. 
The jackals again collected around their 
garbage. The lion advanced to the foun- 
tain to drink. He beheld a man. His 
mane rose, his tail was wildly agitated, he 
bent over the sleeping Prince, he uttered 
an awful roar, which woke Alroy. 



III. 



He awoke ; his gaze met the flaming 
eyes of the enormous beast fixed upon 
him with a blended feeling of desire and 
surprise. He awoke, and from a swoon ; 



64 THE WONDROUS TALE 

but the dreamless trance had refreshed 
the exhausted energies of the desolate 
wanderer ; in an instant he collected his 
senses, remembered all that had past, and 
comprehended his present situation. He 
returned the lion a glance as imperious, 
and fierce, and scrutinizing as his own. 
For a moment their flashing orbs vied in 
regal rivalry ; but at length the spirit of 
the mere animal yielded to the genius of 
the man. The lion cowed, slunk away, 
stalked with haughty timidity through 
the rocks, and then sprang into the 
forest. 



IV. 



Morn breaks; a silver light is shed 
over the blue and starry sky. Pleasant 



OF ALROY. 65 

to feel is the breath of dawn. Night 
brings repose, but day brings joy. 

The carol of a lonely bird singing in 
the wilderness ! A lonely bird that sings 
with glee ! Sunny and sweet, and light 
and clear, its airy notes float through the 
sky, and trill with innocent revelry. 

The lonely youth on the lonely bird 
upgazes from the fountain side. High in 
the air it proudly floats, balancing its 
crimson wings, and its snowy tail, long, 
delicate, and thin, shines like a sparkling 
meteor in the sun. 

The carol of a lonely bird singing in 
the wilderness ! Suddenly it downward 
dashes, and thrice with circling grace 
it flies around the head of the Hebrew 
Prince. Then by his side it gently drops 
a bunch of fresh and fragrant dates. 

'Tis gone, 'tis gone ! that cheerful 



66 THE WONDROUS TALE 

stranger, gone to the palmy land it loves ; 
gone like a bright and pleasant dream. 
A moment since and it was there, glanc- 
ing in the sunny air, and now the sky is 
without a guest. Alas, alas ! no more is 
heard, the carol of that lonely bird sing- 
ing in the wilderness. 



" As thou didst feed Elisha, so also 
hast thou fed me, God of my fathers !" 
And Alroy arose, and he took his tur- 
ban and unfolded it, and knelt and 
prayed. And then he eat of the dates, 
and drank of the fountain, and full of 
confidence in the God of Israel, the de- 
scendant of David pursued his flight. 

He now commenced the ascent of the 



OF ALROY. 67 

mountainous chain, a wearisome and 
painful toil. Two hours past noon he 
reached the summit of the first ridge, and 
looked over a wild and chaotic waste full 
of precipices and ravines, and dark un- 
fathomable gorges. The surrounding hills 
were ploughed in all directions by the 
courses of dried up cataracts, and here and 
there a few savage goats browsed on an 
occasional patch of lean and sour pas- 
ture. This waste extended for many 
miles : the distance formed by a more 
elevated range of mountains, and beyond 
these, high in the blue sky, rose the 
loftiest peaks of Elburz, 8 shining with 
sharp glaciers of eternal snow. 

It was apparent that Alroy was no 
stranger in the scene of his flight. He 
had never hesitated as to his course, and 
now, after having rested for a short time 



68 THE WONDROUS TALE 

on the summit, he descended towards the 
left by a natural but intricate path, until 
his progress was arrested by a black 
ravine. Scarcely half a dozen yards di- 
vided him from the opposite precipice by 
which it was formed, but the gulf be- 
neath — no one could shoot a glance at its 
invisible termination without drawing 
back with a cold shudder. 

The Prince knelt down and examined 
the surrounding ground with great care. 
At length he raised a small square stone 
which covered a metallic plate, and taking 
from his vest a cornelian talisman covered 
with strange characters, 9 he knocked 
thrice upon the plate with the signet. A 
low solemn murmur sounded around. 
Presently the plate flew off, and Alroy 
pulled forth several yards of an iron chain, 
which he threw over to the opposite pre- 



OF ALROY. 69 

cipice. The chain fastened without dif- 
ficulty to the rock, and was evidently 
constrained by some magnetic influence. 
The Prince, seizing the chain with both 
his hands, now swung across the ravine. 
As he landed, the chain parted from the 
rock, swiftly disappeared down the opposite 
aperture, and its covering closed with 
the same low, solemn murmur as before. 



VI. 



Alroy proceeded for about a hundred 
paces through a natural cloister of basalt 
until he arrived at a large uncovered 
court of the same formation, which a 
stranger might easily have been excused 
for believing to have been formed and 
smoothed by art. In its centre bubbled 



70 THE WONDROUS TALE 

up a perpetual spring, icy cold ; the 
stream had worn a channel through the 
pavement, and might be traced for some 
time wandering among the rocks, until it 
at length leaped from a precipice, into a 
gorge below, in a gauzy shower of varie- 
gated spray. Crossing the court, Alroy 
now entered a vast cavern. 

The cavern was nearly circular in 
form, lighted from a large aperture in 
the top. Yet a burning lamp in a dis- 
tant and murky corner indicated that its 
inhabitant did not trust merely to this 
natural source of the great blessing of ex- 
istence. In the centre of the cave was a 
circular and brazen table, sculptured with 
strange characters and mysterious figures : 
near it was a couch on which lie several 
volumes. 10 Suspended from the walls 
were a shield, some bows and arrows, 
and other arms. 



OF ALROY. 71 

As the Prince of the Captivity knelt 
down and kissed the vacant couch, a 
figure advanced from the extremity of 
the cavern into the light. He was a man 
of middle age, considerably above the 
common height, with a remarkably ath- 
letic frame, and a strongly marked, but 
majestic countenance. His black beard 
descended to his waist, over a dark red 
robe, encircled by a black girdle embroi- 
dered with yellow characters, like those 
sculptured on the brazen table. Black 
also was his turban, and black his large 
and luminous eyes. 

The stranger advanced so softly, that 
Alroy did not perceive him, until the 
Prince again rose up. 

" Jabaster !" exclaimed the Prince. 

" Sacred seed of David," answered the 
Cabalist, " thou art expected. I read of 



72 THE WONDROUS TALE 

thee in the stars last night. They spoke 
of trouble." 

" Trouble or triumph, Time must prove 
which it is, great master. At present I 
am a fugitive and exhausted. The blood- 
hounds track me, but methinks I have 
baffled them now. I have slain an Ish- 
maelite." 



OF ALROY. 73 



PART III. 



It was midnight. Alroy slept upon the 
couch : his sleep was troubled. Jabaster 
stood by his side motionless, and gazing 
intently upon his slumbering guest. 

" The only hope of Israel," murmured 
the Cabalist, " my pupil and my prince ! 
I have long perceived in his young mind 
the seed of mighty deeds, and o'er his 
future life have often mused with a pro- 
phetic hope. The blood of David, the 
sacred offspring of a solemn race. There 
is a magic in his flowing veins my science 
cannot reach.

" When in my youth I raised our 
standard by my native Tigris, and called 
our nation to restore their ark, why we 
were numerous, wealthy, potent ; we 
were a people then, and they flocked to 
it boldly. Did we lack counsel ? did we 
need a leader ? Who can aver Jabasters 
brain or arm was ever wanting ? And 
yet the dream dissolved, the glorious vi- 
sion. Oh ! when I struck down Mar van, 
and the Caliphs camp flung its blazing 
shadow o'er the bloody river — ah ! then 
indeed I lived. Twenty years of vigil 
may gain a pardon that I then forgot we 
lacked the chief ingredient in the spell, — 
the blood that sleeps beside me. 

" I recall the glorious rapture of that 
sacred strife amid the rocks of Caucasus. 
A fugitive, a proscribed and outlawed 
wretch, whose life is common sport, and 



OF ALROY. J5 

whom the vilest hind may slay without 
a bidding. I who would have been 
Messiah ! 

" Burn thy books Jabaster ; break thy 
brazen tables; forget thy lofty science, 
Cabalist, and read the stars no longer. n 
But last night I stood upon the gulf 
which girds my dwelling : in one hand, 
I held my sacred talisman, that bears the 
name ineffable ; in the other, the mystic 
record of our holy race. I remembered 
that I had evoked spirits, that I had 
communed with the great departed, and 
that the glowing heavens were to me a 
natural language. I recalled, as conso- 
lation to my gloomy soul, that never had 
my science e'er been exercised but for a 
sacred or a noble purpose. And I re- 
membered Israel, my brave, my chosen, 
and my antique race, — slaves, wretched 

e 2 



76 THE WONDROUS TALE 

slaves. I was strongly tempted to fling 
me down this perilous abyss, and end 
my learning and my life together. 

" But as I gazed upon the star of 
David, a sudden halo rose around its rays, 
and ever and anon a meteor shot from out 
the silver veil. I read that there was 
trouble in the holy seed ; and now comes 
this boy, who has done a deed which — " 

" The ark, the ark ! I gaze upon the 
ark !" 

" The slumberer speaks ; the words of 
sleep are sacred." 

" Salvation only from the house of 
David." 

" A mighty truth ; my life too well 
has proved it. 

" He is more calm. It is the holy 
hour. I'll steal into the court, and gaze 
upon the star that sways the fortunes of 
his royal house." 



OF ALROY. 77

The moon-beam fell upon the foun- 
tain ; the pavement of the court was a 
flood of light ; the rocks rose dark around. 
Jabaster seated by the spring, and hold- 
ing his talisman in his left hand, shaded 
his sight with the other, as he gazed upon 
the luminous heavens. 

A shriek, his name was called. Alroy, 
wild and panting, rushed into the court, 
with extended arms. The Cabalist started 
up, seized him, and held him in his care- 
ful grasp, foaming and in convulsions. 

u Jabaster, Jabaster !" 

" I am here, my child." 

" The Lord hath spoken." 

" The Lord is our refuge. Calm thy- 
self, son of David, and tell me all." 



78 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" I have been sleeping*, master ; is it 
not so ?" 

" Even so, my child. Exhausted by 
his flight and the iexciting narrative of 
his exploit, my Prince laid down upon 
the couch and slumbered ; but I fear 
that slumber was not repose." 

" Repose and I have nought in com- 
mon now. Farewell for ever to that 
fatal word. I am the Lord's anointed." 

" Drink of the fountain, David : it will 
restore thee." 

" Restore the covenant, restore the ark, 
restore the holy city." 

" The Spirit of the Lord hath fallen 
upon him. Son of David, I adjure thee 
tell me all that hath past. I am a Le- 
vite ; in my hand I hold the name inef- 
fable." 

" Take thy trumpet, then, summon

our temple. ' The bricks have fallen, 
but we will rebuild with marble/ Didst 
hear that chorus, sir J" 

" Unto thy chosen ear alone it sound-

" Nay, nay, it was not here. And yet, 
Miriam, Miriam, my sister, my sweet 
sister, how thou wouldst weep, to know 
that which has happened, tears, tears of 
joy, girl ! Where am I ? This is not our

" Holy master, thou dost remember 
when I was thy pupil in this cavern.

thy lore with the devotion that must

in my power, I would yield a tear of 
homageo the memory of those days." 

" How calmly have we sat on some 
high brow, and gazed upon the stars !" 

" Tis very true, sweet child." 

" And if thou e'er didst chide me, 
'twas half in jest, and only for my si- 
lence." 

" What would he now infer ? No mat- 
ter, he grows calmer. How solemn is his 
visage in the moonlight ! And yet not

look more beautiful." 

" I never told thee an untruth, Ja-

"My life upon thy faith." 

" Fear not the pledge, and so believe

the starry heavens with thyself, 1 was not 
calmer than I feel, sir, now." 

e 5 



82 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" I do believe thee." 

" Then, Jabaster, believe as fully I am 
the Lord's anointed." 

"Tell me all, my child." 

" Know, then, that sleeping on the 
couch within, my sleep was troubled. 
Many dreams I had, indefinite and 
broken. I recall none of their images, 
except I feel a dim sensation 'twas my 
lot to live in brighter days than now rise 
on our race. Suddenly I stood upon a 
mountain tall and grey, and gazed upon 
the stars. And as I gazed, a trumpet 
sounded. Its note thrilled through my 
soul. Never have I heard a sound so 
awful. The thunder, when it broke over 
the cavern here, and shivered the peak, 
whose ruins lie around us, was but a fee- 
ble worldly sound to this almighty music. 
My cheek grew pale, I panted even for 






OF ALROY. 83 

breath. A flaming light spread over the 
sky, the stars melted away, and I beheld, 
advancing 1 from the bursting radiancy, 
the foremost body of a mighty host. 

" Oh ! not when Saul led forth our 
fighting men against the Philistine, not 
when Joab numbered the warriors of my 
great ancestor, did human vision gaze 
upon a scene of so much martial splen- 
dour. Chariots and cavalry, and glitter- 
ing trains of plumed warriors too robust 
to need a courser's solace ; streams of 
shining spears, and banners like a sunset ; 
reverend priests swinging their perfumed 
censers, and prophets hymning with their 
golden harps a most triumphant future. 

" ' J°y> j°y/ ^ey say, ' to Israel, for 
hecometh; he cometh in his splendour 
and his might, the great Messiah of our 
ancient hopes.' 



84 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" And, lo ! a mighty chariot now ap- 
peared, drawn by strange beasts, whose 
forms were half obscured by the bright 
flames on which they seemed to float. 
In that glorious car a warrior stood, proud 
and immovable, his form, his countenance 
—hold my hand, Jabaster, while I speak 
— that chieftain was myself !" 
" Proceed, proceed, my son/' 
" I started in my dream, and I awoke. 
I found myself upsitting on my couch. 
The pageantry had vanished. Nought 
was seen but the bright moonlight and 
the gloomy cave. And as I sighed to 
think I e'er had waken, and mused upon 
the strangeness of my vision, a small still 
voice descended from above and called 
6 Alroy ! ? I started, but I answered not. 
Methought it was my fancy. Again my 
name was called, and now I murmured — 






OF ALROY. 85 

' Lord, I am here, what wouldest thou ?' 
Nought responded, and soon great dread 
came o'er me, and I rushed out and called 
to thee, my master." 

" It was ' the Daughter of the Voice' I2 
that spake. Since the captivity 'tis the 
only mode by which the saints are sum- 
moned. Oft have I heard of it, but never 
in these sad degenerate days has its soft 
aspiration fallen upon us. These are 
strange times and tidings. The building 
of the temple is at hand. Son of David, 
my heart is full. Let us to prayer !" 



III. 

Day dawned upon Jabaster, still musing 
in solitude among his rocks. Within 
the cavern Alroy remained in prayer. 



86 THE WONDROUS TALE 

Often and anxiously the Cabalist shot 
a glance at his companion, and then again 
relapsed into reverie. 

" The time is come that I must to this 
youth reveal the secrets of my early life. 
Much will he hear of glory, much of 
shame. Nought must I conceal, and 
nought gloss over. 

" I must tell how in the plains of Ti- 
gris I upraised the sacred standard of our 
chosen race, and called them from their 
bondage ; how, despairing of his recreant 
fathers, and inspired by human power 
alone, I vainly claimed the mighty office 
for his sacred blood alone reserved. God 
of my fathers, grant that future service, 
the humble service of a contrite soul, 
may, in the coming glory that awaits us, 
atone for past presumption ! 

" But for him great trials are impend- 



OF ALROY. 87 

ing. Not lightly must that votary be 
proved, who fain would free a people. 
The Lord is faithful to his promise, but 
the Lord will choose his season and his 
minister. Courage, and faith, and deep 
humility, and strong endurance, and 
the watchful soul temptation cannot 
sully : these are the fruits we lay upon 
his altar, and meekly watch if some de- 
scending flame will vouchsafe to accept 
and brightly bless them. 

" It is written in the dread volume of 
our mystic lore, that not alone the Sa- 
viour shall spring from out our house of 
princes, but that none shall rise to free 
us until, alone and unassisted, he have 
gained the sceptre Solomon antiquely 
wielded within his cedar palaces. 

" That sceptre must he gain. This 
fragile youth, untried and delicate, un-

knowing in the ways of this strange 
world, where every step is danger. How 
much hardship, how much peril, what 
withering disappointment, what dull 
care, what long despondency, what never- 
ending lures, now lie in ambush for this 
gentle boy ! O ! my countrymen, is this 
thy hope ? And I, with all my lore, and 
all my courage, and all my deep intelli- 
gence of man ; unhappy Israel, why am 
I not thy prince ?

It was at sunset, on the third day after 
the arrival of Alroy at the cave of the 
Cabalist, that the Prince of the Captivity 
commenced his pilgrimage in quest of the 
sceptre of Solomon. 

Silently the pilgrim and his master 
took their way to the brink of the ravine, 
and there they stopped to part — perhaps 
for ever. 

" It is a bitter moment, Alroy. Human 
feelings are not for beings like us, yet 
they will have their way. Remember, 
remember all. Cherish the talisman as 
thy life — nay ! welcome death with it 
pressing against thy heart, sooner than 
breathe without it. Be firm, be pious. 
Think of thy ancestors, think of thy 
God."

" Doubt me not, dear master ; if 
I seem not full of that proud spirit, which 
was perhaps too much my wont, ascribe 
it not to fear, Jabaster, nor even to the 
pain of leaving thee, dear friend. But 
ever since that sweet and solemn voice 
summoned me so thrillingly, — I know not 
how it is, — but a change has come over 
my temper ; yet I am firm, oh ! firmer 
far than when I struck down the Ish- 
maelite. Indeed, indeed, fear not for 
me. The Lord, that knoweth all things, 
knows full well I am prepared even 
to the death. Thy prayers, Jabaster,

parted, this was the signal of his love : a 
love, my child, strong-, though we greatly 
differed. Take it. The hour may come 
that thou mayst need his aid. It will 
command it. If he live, he prospers. I 
know his temper well. He was made for 
what the worldly deem prosperity. God

of Isaac, and of Jacob." 

They embraced. 

" We linger," exclaimed the Cabalist, 
" we linger. Oh ! in vain we quell the 
feelings of our kind. God, God, bless 
and be with thee. Art sure hast all ?

Tradition delivered that the sceptre of 
Solomon could be found only in the un- 
known sepulchres of the ancient Hebrew 
monarchs, and that none might dare to 
touch it but one of their descendants. 
Armed with the cabalistic talisman, 
which was to guide him in his awful and 
difficult researches, Alroy commenced 
his pilgrimage to the Holy City. At this 
time, the love of these sacred wanderings 
was a reigning passion among the Jews, 
as well as Christians. 



94 THE WONDROUS TALE 

The Prince of the Captivity was to 
direct his course into the heart of those 
great desarts which, in his flight from 
Hamadan, he had only skirted. Follow- 
ing the track of the caravan, he was to 
make his way to Babylon, or Bagdad. 
From the capital of the Caliphs, his 
journey to Jerusalem was one compara- 
tively easy ; but to reach Bagdad he must 
encounter hardship and danger, the pros- 
pect of which would have divested any 
one of hope, who did not conceive him- 
self the object of an omnipotent and par- 
ticular Providence. 

Clothed only in a coarse black frock, 
common among the Kourds, girded round 
his centre by a cord which held his dagger, 
his head shaven, and covered with a large 
white turban, which screened him from 
the heat, his feet protected only by slip-

pers, supported by his staff, and bearing 
on his shoulders a bag of dried meat and 
parched corn, and a leathern skin of 
water, behold a youth toiling over the 
glowing sands of Persia, whose life had 
hitherto been a long '^broken dream of 
t domestic luxury and .nnocent indul- 
gence. 

He travelled during the warm night, or 
the early starlit morn. During the day 
he rested : happy if he could recline by 
the side of some charitable well, shaded 
by a palm tree, or frighten a gazelle from 
its resting-place among the rough bushes 
of some wild rocks. Were these resources 
wanting, he threw himself upon the sand, 
and made an awning with his staff and 
turban. 

Three weeks had elapsed since he 
quitted the cavern of the Cabalist. Hi-

therto he had met with no human being. 
The desart became less arid A scanty 
vegetation sprang up from a more genial 
soil, the ground broke into gentle undula- 
tions, his senses were invigorated with the 
odour of wild plants, and his sight re- 
freshed by the glancing form of some^ 
wandering bird, a pilgrim like himself, 
but more at ease. 

Soon sprang up a grove of graceful 
palm trees, with their tall thin stems, and 
bending feathery crowns, languid and 
beautiful. Around, the verdant sod 
gleamed like an emerald : silver streams, 
flowing from a bubbling parent spring, 
wound their white forms within the 
bright green turf. From the grove arose 
the softening song of doves, and showers 
of gay and sparkling butterflies, borne on 
their tinted wings of shifting light, danced

without danger in the liquid air. A fair 
and fresh Oasis ! 



II. 



Alroy reposed in this delicious retreat 
for two days, feeding on the living dates, 
and drinking of the fresh water. Fain 
would he have lingered, nor indeed until 
lie rested, had he been sufficiently con- 
scious of his previous exertion. But the 
remembrance of his great mission made 
him restless, and steeled him to the suf- 
fering which yet awaited him. 

At the dawn of the second day of his 
journey from the oasis, he beheld, to his 
astonishment, faintly but distinctly traced 
on the far horizon, the walls and turrets 
of an extensive city. 13 Animated by this 

VOLc I. F 



98 THE WONDROUS TALE 

unexpected prospect, he continued his 
progress for several hours after sunrise. 
At length, utterly exhausted, he sought 
refuge from the overpowering heat be- 
neath the cupola of the ruined tomb of 
some Moslemin saint. At sunset he con- 
tinued his journey, and in the morning 
found himself within a few miles of the 
city. He halted and watched with 
anxiety for some evidence of its inha- 
bitants. None was visible. No crowds 
or cavalcades issued from the gates. Not 
a single human being, not a solitary camel 
moved in the vicinity. 

The day was too advanced for the pil- 
grim to proceed, but so great was his 
anxiety to reach this unknown settlement, 
and penetrate the mystery of its silence, 
that ere sunset Alroy entered the gates. 

A magnificent city, of an architecture 



OF ALROY. 99 

with which he was unacquainted, offered 
to his entranced vision its gorgeous ruins 
and deserted splendour ; long streets of 
palaces, with their rich line of lessening- 
pillars, here and there broken by some 
fallen shaft, vast courts surrounded by 
ornate and solemn temples, and luxurious 
baths, adorned with rare mosaics, and yet 
bright with antique gilding : now an 
arch of triumph still haughty with its 
broken friezes, now a granite obelisk 
covered with strange characters, and 
proudly towering o'er a prostrate com- 
panion ; sometimes a void and crumbling 
theatre, sometimes a long and elegant 
aqueduct, sometimes a porphyry column, 
once breathing with the heroic statue 
that now lies shivered at its base— all suf- 
fused with the warm twilight of an Eastern 
eve.

100 THE WONDROUS TALE 

He gazed with wonder and admira- 
tion upon the strange and fascinating 
scene. The more he beheld, the more his 
curiosity was excited. He breathed with 
difficulty ; he advanced with a blended 
feeling of eagerness and hesitation. Fresh 
wonders successively unfolded themselves. 
Each turn developed a new scene of still 
and solemn splendour. The echo of his 
step filled him with awe. He looked 
around him with an amazed air, a flutter- 
ing heart, and changing countenance. All 
was silent: alone the Hebrew Prince stood 
amid the regal creation of the Macedonian 
captains. Empires and dynasties flourish 
and pass away, the proud metropolis 
becomes a solitude, the conquering king- 
dom even a desart ; but Israel still remains, 
still a descendant of the most ancient 
kings breathed amid these royal ruins, 



OF ALROY. 101 

and still the eternal sun could never rise 
without gilding the towers of living 
Jerusalem. A word, a deed, a single day, 
a single man, and we might be a nation. 

A shout ; he turns, he is seized ; four 
ferocious Kourdish bandits grapple and 
bind him. 



Ill 



The bandits hurried their captive 
through a street which appeared to have 
been the principal way of the city. Nearly 
at its termination they turned by a small 
Ionian temple, and clambering over some 
fallen pillars, they entered a quarter of 
the city of a more ruinous aspect, than 
that which Alroy had hitherto visited. 
The path was narrow, often obstructed, 



102 THE WONDROUS TALE 

and around were signs of devastation for 
which the exterior of the city had not 
prepared him. 

The brilliant but brief twilight of the 
Orient was fast fading away ; a sombre 
purple tint succeeded to the rosy flush, 
the distant towers rose black, although 
defined in the clear and shadowy air, and 
the moon, which when he first entered, 
had studded the heavens like a small 
white cloud, now glittered with deceptive 
light. 

Suddenly before them rose a huge pile. 
Oval in shape, and formed by tiers of 
arches, it was evidently much dilapi- 
dated, and one enormous, irregular, and 
undulating rent, extending from the top 
nearly to the foundation, almost separated 
the side to which Alroy and his com- 
panions advanced. 



OF ALROY. ] 03 

Clambering up the remainder of this 
massy wall, the robbers and their pri- 
soner descended into an immense amphi- 
theatre, which seemed vaster in the sha- 
dowy and streaming moonlight. In it 
were groups of men, horses, and camels. 
In the extreme distance, reclining or 
squatting on mats and carpets, was a large 
assembly engaged in a rough but merry 
banquet. A fire blazed at their side, its 
red and uncertain flame mingling with 
the white and steady moonbeam, and 
throwing a flickering light over their 
ferocious countenances, their glistening ar- 
mour, ample drapery, and shawled heads. 

" A spy," exclaimed the captors, as 
they dragged Alroy before the leader of 
the band. 

'* Hang him, then/' said the chieftain, 
without even looking up. 



104 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" This wine, great Scherirah, is excel- 
lent, or I am no true Moslemin," said a 
principal robber ; "but you are too 
cruel ; I hate this summary punishment. 
Let us torture him a little, and extract 
some useful information." 

" As you like, Kisloch," said Sche- 
rirah ; " it may amuse us. Fellow, 
where do you come from ? He cannot 
answer. Decidedly a spy. Hang him up." 

The captors half untied the rope that 
bound Alroy , that it might serve him for 
another purpose, when another of the 
gentle companions of Scherirah inter- 
fered. 

" Spies always answer, captain. He 
is more probably a merchant in disguise." 

" And carries hidden treasure/' added 
Kisloch ; " these rough coats often cover 
jewels. We had better search him." 



OF ALROY. 105 

" Ay ! search him,* said Scherirah, 
with his rough, brutal voice ; " do what 
you like, only give me the bottle. This 
Greek wine is choice booty. Feed the 
fire, men. Are you asleep ? And then 
Kisloch, who hates cruelty, can roast him, 
if he likes/' 

The robbers prepared to strip their 
captive. " Friends, friends !" exclaimed 
Alroy, " for there is no reason why you 
should not be friends, spare me, spare me. 
I am poor, I am young, I am innocent. I 
am neither a spy nor a merchant. I have 
no plots, no wealth. I am a pilgrim." 

" A decided spy," exclaimed Scheri- 
rah ; " they are ever pilgrims." 

" He speaks too well to speak truth," 
exclaimed Kisloch. 

" All talkers are liars," exclaimed Sche- 
rirah. 

F 5 



106 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" That is why Kisloch is the most elo- 
quent of the band." 

" A jest at the banquet may prove a 
curse in the field," replied Kisloch. 

" Pooh !" exclaimed Scherirah. " Fel- 
lows, why do you hesitate ? Search the 
prisoner, I say !" 

They advanced, they seized him. In 
vain he struggled. 

" Captain," exclaimed one of the band, 
" he wears upon his breast a jewel VI 

" I told you so," said the third 
robber. 

" Give it me/' said Scherirah. 

But Alroy, in despair, at the thought 
of losing the talisman, remembering the 
injunctions of Jabaster, and animated by 
supernatural courage, burst from his 
searchers, and, seizing a brand from the 
fire, held them at bay. 



OF ALROY. 107 

" The fellow has spirit," said Scherirah 
calmly. " 'Tis pity it will cost him his 
life." 

" Bold man/' exclaimed Alroy, " for a 
moment hear me ! I am a pilgrim, poorer 
than a beggar. The jewel they talk of is 
a holy emblem, worthless to you, to me 
invaluable, and to be forfeited only by 
my life. You maybe careless of that. 
Beware of your own. The first man who 
advances, dies. I pray you humbly, 
chieftain, let me go." 

" Kill him !" said Scherirah. 

" Stab him !" exclaimed Kisloch. 

" Give me the jewel," said the third 
robber. 

" The God of David be my refuge, 
then !" exclaimed Alroy. 

" He is a Hebrew, he is a Hebrew," 
exclaimed Scherirah, jumping up. " Spare 



108 THE WONDROUS TALE 

him ! spare him ! my mother was a 
Jewess." 

The assailants lowered their arms, and 
withdrew a few paces. Alroy still re- 
mained upon his guard. 

" Valiant pilgrim," said Scherirah, ad- 
vancing, with a softened voice, " are you 
for the holy city ?" 

" The city of my fathers.' 

" A perilous journey. And whence 
from r 

" Hamadan." 

" A dreary way. You need repose. 
Your name ?" 

" David." 

" David, you are among friends. Rest 
and repose in safety. You hesitate. Fear 
not ! The memory of my mother is a 
charm that always changes me." Scheri- 
rah unsheathed his dagger, punctured his 



OF ALROY. 109 

arm, and, throwing* away the weapon, of- 
fered the bleeding member to Alroy. The 
prince of the Captivity touched the open 
vein with his lips. 

" My troth is pledged/' said the ban- 
dit ; " I can never betray him in whose 
veins my own blood is flowing-." 14 So say- 
ing", he led Alroy to his carpet.

" Eat, David/' said Scherirah. 

" I will eat bread," answered Alroy. 

" What have you had so much meat 
lately that you will refuse this delicate 
gazelle that I have brought down this 
morning with my own lance ? 'Tis food 
for a Caliph/' 

" I pray you give me bread " 



110 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" Oh ! bread if you like. But that a 
man should prefer bread to meat, and such 
meat as this, 'tis miraculous." 

" A thousand thanks, good Scherirah ; 
but with our people the flesh of the ga- 
zelle is forbidden. It is unclean. Its 
foot is cloven." 

u I have heard of these things/' replied 
Scherirah, with a thoughtful air. " My 
mother was a Jewess, and my father was 
a Kourd. Whichever be right, I hope to 
be saved." 

" There is but one God, and Mohammed 
is his prophet !" exclaimed Kisloch ; 
" though I drink wine. Your health, 
Hebrew." 

" I will join you," said the third robber. 
" My father was a Guebre, and sacrificed 
his property to his faith ; and the conse- 
quence is, his son has got neither."

" As for me," said a fourth robber, of 
very dark complexion and singularly 
small bright eyes, " I am an Indian, and 
I believe in the great golden figure with 
carbuncle eyes, in the Temple of Delhi." 

" I have no religion/' said a tall negro, 
in a red turban, grinning with his white 
teeth ; " they have none in my country ; 
but if I had heard of your God before, Ca- 
lidas, I would have believed in him." 

" I almost wish I had been a Jew," ex- 
claimed Scherirah musing. " My mother 
was a good woman." 

" The Jews are very rich," said the 
third robber. 

■" When you get to Jerusalem, David, 
you will see the Christians," continued 
Scherirah. 

" The accursed Giaours," exclaimed 
Kisloch, "we are all against them."

" With their white faces," exclaimed 
the Negro. 

" And their blue eyes," said the In- 
dian. 

" What can you expect of men who 
live in a country without a Sun ?" ob-

Alroy woke about two hours after mid- 
night. His companions were in deep 
slumber. The moon had set, the fire had 
died away, a few red embers alone re- 
maining ; dark masses of shadow hung 
about the amphitheatre. He arose and 
cautiously stepped over the sleeping ban- 
dits. He was not, in strictness, a prison- 
er ; but who could trust to the caprice of 



OF ALROY. 113 

these lawless men ? To-morrow might 
find him their slave, or their companion 
in some marauding" expedition, which 
might make him almost retrace his steps 
to the Caucasus or to Hamadan. The 
temptation to ensure his freedom was 
irresistible. He clambered up the t uined 
wall, descended into the intricate wind- 
ings that led to the Ionic fane, that served 
him as a beacon, hurried through the 
silent and starry streets, gained the great 
portal, and rushed once more into the 
desart. 

A vague fear of pursuit made him con- 
tinue his course many hours without 
resting. The desart again became sandy, 
the heat increased. The breeze that plays 
about the wilderness, and in early spring 
is often scented with the wild fragrance 
of aromatic plants, sank away. A lurid 



114. THE WONDROUS TALE 

brightness suffused the heavens. An ap- 
palling stillness pervaded nature ; even 
the insects were silent. For the first 
time in his pilgrimage, a feeling of deep 
despondency fell over the soul of Alroy. 
His energy appeared suddenly to have 
deserted him. A low hot wind began to 
rise, and fan his cheek with pestiferous 
kisses, and enervate his frame with its 
poisonous embrace. His head and limbs 
ached with a dull sensation, more terri- 
ble than pain ; his sight was dizzy, his 
tongue swollen. Vainly he looked around 
for aid, vainly he extended his forlorn 
arms, and wrung them to the remorseless 
heaven. Almost frantic with thirst, the 
boundless horizon of the desart disap- 
peared, and the unhappy victim, in the 
midst of his torture, found himself appa- 
rently surrounded by bright and running 



OF ALROY. 115 

streams, the fleeting waters of the false 
Mirage ! 

The Sun became blood-red, the sky 
darker, the sand rose in fierce eddies, the 
moaning wind burst into shrieks and 
respired a more ardent and still more 
malignant breath. The pilgrim could no 
longer sustain himself. 15 Faith, courage, 
devotion, deserted him with his failing 
energies. He strove no longer with his 
destiny, he delivered himself up to des- 
pair and death. He fell upon one knee 
with drooping head, supporting himself 
by one quivering hand, and then, full of 
the anguish of baffled purposes and lost 
affections, raising his face and arm to 
heaven, thus to the elements he poured 
his passionate farewell. 

" O Life once vainly deemed a 
gloomy toil, I feel thy sweetness now ; 



116 THE WONDROUS TALE 

Farewell, O life, farewell my high re- 
solves and proud conviction of almighty 
fame. My days, my short unprofitable 
days, melt into the past ; and death, with 
which I struggle, horrible death, arrests 
me in this wilderness. O my sister, 
could thy voice, thy sweet, sweet voice, 
but murmur in my ear one single sigh of 
love ; could thine eye with its soft radi- 
ance but an instant blend with my dim 
fading vision, the pang were nothing. 
Farewell, Miriam ! my heart is with thee 
by thy fountain's side. Fatal blast, bear 
her my dying words, my blessing. And 
ye, too, friends, whose too neglected love 
I think of now, farewell ! Farewell, my 
uncle, farewell pleasant home, and Ha- 
madan's serene and shadowy bowers ! 
Farewell, Jabaster, and the mighty lore 
of which thou wert the priest and I the

pupil ! Thy talisman throbs on my faith- 
ful heart. Green Earth and golden Sun, 
and all the beautiful and glorious sights 
ye fondly lavish on unthinking man, 
farewell, farewell ! I die in the desart, 
'tis bitter. No more, oh ! never more, for 
me the hopeful day shall break, and its 
fresh breeze rise on its cheering wings of 
health and joy. Heaven and earth, water 
and air, my chosen country, and my 
antique creed, farewell, farewell ! And 
thou, too, City of my soul, I cannot name 
thee, unseen Jerusalem—" 

Amid the roar of the wind, the bosom 
of the earth heaved and opened, swift 
columns of sand sprang up to the lurid 
sky, and hurried towards their victim. 
With the clang of universal chaos, im- 
penetrable darkness descended on the 
desart.

" The prophet preaches charity, Ab-

It was the Mecca caravan returning to 
Bagdad. The pilgrims were within a 



120 THE WONDROUS TALE 

day's journey of the Euphrates, and wel- 
comed their approach to fertile earth with 
a triumphant chorus. Far as the eye 
could reach, the long line of their strag- 
gling procession stretched across the wil- 
derness, thousands of camels in strings, 
laden with bales of merchandize, and each 
company headed by an animal of superior 
size leading with tinkling bells, groups of 
horsemen, clusters of litters ; all the pil- 
grims armed to their teeth, the van form- 
ed by a strong division of Seljukian 
cavalry, and the rear protected by a 
Kourdish clan, who guaranteed the secu- 
rity of the pious travellers through their 
country. 

Abdallah was the favourite slave of 
the charitable merchant Ali. In obe- 
dience to his master's orders, he unwill- 
ingly descended from his camel, and 



OF ALROY. 121 

examined the body of the apparently life- 
less Alroy. 

" A Kourd, by his dress," exclaimed 
Abdallah, with a sneer, " what does he 
here ?" 

" It is not the face of a Kourd," re- 
plied Ali, " perchance a pilgrim from 
the mountains ?" 

" Whatever he be, he is dead," an- 
swered the slave : " I doubt not an ac- 
cursed Giaour." 

" God is great," exclaimed Ali, " he 
breathes ; the breast of his caftan 
heaved." 

" 'Twas the wind," said Abdallah. 

" 'Twas the sigh of a human heart," 
answered Ali. 

Several pilgrims who were on foot had 
now gathered round the group. 

" I am a Hakim," 17 observed a dignified

Armenian. " I will feel his pulse ; 'tis 
dull, but it beats." 

" There is but one God," exclaimed 
Ali. 

" And Mahomed is his prophet," re- 
sponded Abdallah. " You do not believe 
in him, you Armenian infidel." 

" I am a Hakim," replied the digni- 
fied Armenian. i( Although an infidel, 
God has granted me skill to cure true 
believers. Worthy Ali, believe me, the 
boy may yet live." 

" Hakim, you shall count your own 
dirhems if he breathe in my divan in 
Bagdad," answered Ali ; " I have taken 
a fancy to the boy. God has sent him 
to me. He shall carry my slippers." 

" Give me a camel, and I will save his 
life." 

" We have none," said the servant.

" Walk, Abdallah," said the master. 

" Is a true believer to walk to save the 
life of a Kourd ? Master slipper-bearer 
shall answer for this, if there be any 
sweetness in the bastinado/" murmured 
Abdallah. 

The Armenian blooded Alroy ; the 
blood flowed slowly but surely. The 
Prince of the Captivity opened his eyes. 

" There is but one God !" exclaimed 
Ali. 

"The evil eye fall on him!" 18 muttered 
Abdallah. 

The Armenian took a cordial from his 
vest, and poured it down his patient's 
throat. The blood flowed more freely. 

" He will live, worthy merchant," said 
the physician. 

" And Mahomed is his prophet," con-

hack with disgust. 

" He will die," said the Christian phy-

" And be damned," said Abdallah, 
jumping again on his camel. 

The party rode on, the caravan pro-

forward. He curbed his steed as he pass-

" What accursed slave has wounded 
one of my clan ?" 

The Kourd jumped off his horse, strip- 
ped off a slip of his blue shirt, stanched 
the wound, and carried the unhappy Al- 
roy to the rear. 

The Desart ceased, the caravan entered 



OFALROY. 125 

upon a vast but fruitful plain. In the 
extreme distance might be detected a 
long undulating line of palm trees. The 
van guard gave a shout, shook their tall 
lances in the air, and rattled their scyme- 
tars in rude chorus against their small 
round iron shields. All eyes sparkled, 
all hands were raised, all voices sounded, 
save those that were breathless from 
overpowering joy. After months wan- 
dering in the sultry wilderness they 
beheld the great Euphrates. 

Broad, and fresh, and magnificent, and 
serene, the mighty waters rolled through 
the beautiful and fertile earth. A vital 
breeze rose from their bosom. Every 
being responded to their genial influ- 
ence. The sick were cured, the despond- 
ing became sanguine, the healthy and 
light-hearted broke into shouts of laughter, 



126 THE WONDROUS TALE 

jumped from their camels, and embraced 
the fragrant earth, or wild in their reno- 
vated strength, galloped over the plain, 
and threw their wanton jerreeds in the 
air, 19 as if to show their suffering and la- 
bour had not deprived them of that skill 
and strength, without which it were vain 
again to enter the haunts of their less ad- 
venturous brethren. 

The caravan halted on the banks of 
the broad river glowing in the cool sun- 
set. The camp was pitched, the plain 
glittered with tents. The camels falling on 
their knees, crouched in groups, the mer- 
chandize piled up in masses by their sides. 
The unharnessed horses rushed neigh- 
ing about the plain, tossing their glad 
heads, and rolling in the unaccustomed 
pasture. Spreading their mats, and kneel- 
ing towards Mecca, the pilgrims perform- 



OF ALROY. 127 

ed their evening orisons. Never was 
thanksgiving more sincere. They arose ; 
some rushed into the river, some lighted 
lamps, some pounded coffee. 20 Troops of 
smiling villagers arrived with fresh pro- 
visions eager to prey upon such light 
hearts and heavy purses. It was one of 
those occasions when the accustomed 
gravity of the Orient disappears. Long 
through the night the sounds of music 
and the shouts of laughter were heard on 
the banks of that starry river, long 
through the night you might have listen- 
ed with enchantment to the wild tales of 
the storier, or gazed with fascination on 
the wilder gestures of the dancing girls. 21

The great Bazaar of Bagdad afforded a 
very animated and sumptuous spectacle 
on the day after the arrival of the caravan. 
All the rare and costly products of the 
world were collected in that celebrated 
mart : the shawls of Cashmere and the 
silks of Syria, the ivory, and plumes, and 
gold of Afric, the jewels of Ind, the talis- 
mans of Egypt, the perfumes and manu- 
scripts of Persia, the spices and gums of 
Araby, beautiful horses, more beautiful 
slaves, cloaks of sable, pelisses of ermine, 
armour alike magnificent in ornament 
and temper, rare animals, still rarer birds, 
blue apes in silver collars, white gazelles 
bound by a golden chain, greyhounds, 



OF ALROY. 129 

peacocks, paroquets. And every where 
strange, and busy, and excited groups ; 
men of all nations, creeds, and climes : 
the sumptuous and haughty Turk, the 
graceful and subtle Arab, the Hebrew 
with his black cap and anxious counte- 
nance ; the Armenian Christian, with his 
dark flowing robes, and mild demeanour, 
and serene visage. Here strutted the 
lively, affected, and superfine Persian ; 
and there the Circassian stalked with his 
long hair and chain cuirass. The fair 
Georgian jostled the ebony form of the 
merchant of Dongola or Sennaar. 

Through the long, narrow, arched, and 
winding streets of the Bazaar, lined on 
each side with loaded stalls, all was bustle, 
bargaining, and barter. A passenger ap- 
proached, apparently of no common rank. 
Two pages preceded him, beautiful Geor- 

G 5

gian boys, clothed in crimson cloth, and 
caps of the same material, setting tight to 
their heads, with long golden tassels. 
One bore a blue velvet bag, and the 
other a clasped and richly-bound volume. 
Four footmen, armed, followed their 
master, who rode behind the pages on a 
milk-white mule. He was a man of 
middle age, eminently handsome. His 
ample robes concealed the only fault in 
his appearance, a figure which indulgence 
had rendered somewhat too ample. His 
eyes were large, and soft, and dark ; his 
nose aquiline, but delicately moulded ; 
his mouth small, and beautifully propor- 
tioned ; his lip full and red ; his teeth re- 
gular, and dazzling white. His ebony 
beard flowed, but not at too great a length, 
in graceful and natural curls, and was 
richly perfumed; a delicate mustachio 



OF ALROY. 131 

shaded his upper lip, but no whisker was 
permitted to screen the form and shroud 
the lustre of his oval countenance and 
brilliant complexion. Altogether, the 
animal, perhaps, predominated too much 
in the expression of the stranger's coun- 
tenance, but genius beamed from his pas- 
sionate eye, and craft lay concealed in 
that subtle lip. The dress of the rider 
was sumptuous. His turban formed by 
a scarlet Cashmere shawl, was of great 
breadth, and, concealing half of his white 
forehead, increased by the contrast the 
radiant height of the other. His under 
vest was of white Damascus silk, stiif 
with silver embroidery, and confined by 
a girdle formed by a Brusa scarf of gold 
stuff, and holding a dagger, whose hilt 
appeared blazing with brilliants and 
rubies. His loose and exterior robe was 



132 THE WONDROUS TALE 

of crimson cloth. His white hands 
sparkled with rings, and his ears glittered 
with pendulous gems. 

" Who is this ?" asked an Egyptian 
merchant, in a low whisper, of the dealer 
whose stuffs he was examining. 

" Tis the Lord Honain," replied the 
dealer. 

" And who may he be }" continued 
the Egyptian. " Is he the Caliph's 
son ?" 

66 Poh ! a much greater man— his phy- 
sician." 

The white mule stopped at the very 
stall where this conversation was taking 
place. The pages halted, and stood on 
each side of their master — the footmen 
kept off the crowd. 

" Merchant," said Honain, with a gra- 
cious smile of condescension, and with a 



OF ALROY. 1 33 

voice musical as a flute. f< Merchant, 
did you obtain me my wish ?" 

" There is but one God," replied the 
dealer, who was the charitable Ali, " and 
Mahomed is his prophet. I succeeded, 
please your highness, in seeing at Aleppo 
the accursed Giaour, of whom I spoke, 
and behold that which you desired is 
here." So saying, Ali produced several 
Greek manuscripts, and offered them to 
his visitor. 

" Hah !" said Honain, with a spark- 
ling eye, " 'tis well — their cost ?" 

" The infidel would not part with 
them under five hundred dirhems," re- 
plied Ali. 

" Ibrahim, see that this worthy mer- 
chant receive a thousand." 

'*. As many thanks, my Lord Ho- 
nain." 



134 THE WONDROUS TALE 

The Caliph's physician bowed grace- 
fully. 

"Advance, pages," continued Honain ; 
" why this stoppage ? Ibrahim, see that 
our way be cleared. What is all this ?" 

A crowd of men advanced, pulling 
along a youth, who, almost exhausted, 
still singly struggled with his ungenerous 
adversaries. 

" The Cadi, the Cadi," cried the fore- 
most of them, who was Abdallah, " drag 
him to the Cadi." 

" Noble lord," cried the youth, ex- 
tricating himself by a sudden struggle 
from the grasp of his captors, and seizing 
the robe of Honain, " I am innocent and 
injured. I pray thy help." 

" The Cadi, the Cadi," exclaimed Ab- 
dallah ; " the knave has stolen my ring 
— the ring given me by my faithful 



OF ALROY. 135 

Fatima on our marriage day, and which I 
would not part with for my master's stores." 

The youth still clung to the robe of 
Honain, and mute from exhaustion, fixed 
upon him his beautiful and imploring eye. 

" Silence," proclaimed Honain; " I 
will judge this cause." 

" The Lord Honain, the Lord Honain, 
listen to the Lord Honain." 

(e Speak, thou brawler ; of what hast 
thou to complain ?" said Honain to Ab- 
dallah. 

" May it please your highness," said 
Abdallah, in a whining voice, " I am the 
slave of your faithful servant, Ali : often 
have I had the honour of waiting on your 
highness. This young knave here, a 
beggar, has robbed me, while slumbering 
in a coffee-house, of a ring ; I have my 
witnesses to prove my slumbering. Tis 



136 THE WONDROUS TALE 

a fine emerald, may it please your high- 
ness, and doubly valuable to me as a love 
token from my Fatima. No consideration 
in the world could induce me to part with 
it ; and so being asleep — here are three 
honest men who will prove the sleep — 
comes this little vagabond, may it please 
your highness, who, while he pretends to 
offer me my coffee, takes him my finger, 
and slips off this precious ring, which he 
now wears upon his own beggarly paw, and 
will not restore to me without the basti- 
nado. " 

" Abdallah is a faithful slave, may it 
please your highness, and a Hadgee," said 
Ali, his master. 

" And what sayest thou, boy ?" in- 
quired Honain. 

" That this is a false knave, who lies 
as slaves ever will." 



OF ALROY. 137 

" Pithy, and perhaps true/' said Ho- 
nain. 

" You call me a slave, you young 
scoundrel?" exclaimed Abdallah ; ''shall 
I tell you what you are ? Why, your 
highness, do not listen to him a moment. 
It is a shame to bring such a creature 
into your presence ; for by the holy 
stone, and I am a Hadgee, I doubt little 
he is a Jew." 

Honain grew somewhat pale, and bit 
his lip. He was perhaps annoyed that he 
had interfered so publicly in behalf of so 
unpopular a character as a Hebrew, but 
he was unwilling to desert one whom a 
moment before he had resolved to be- 
friend, and he inquired of the youth 
where he had obtained the ring. 

" The ring was given to me by my 
dearest friend when I first set out upon 



138 THE WONDROUS TALE 

an arduous pilgrimage not yet completed. 
There is but one person in the world, 
except the donor, to whom I would part 
with it, and with that person I am unac- 
quainted. All this may seem impro- 
bable, but all this is true. I have truth 
alone to support me. I am destitute and 
friendless ; but I am not a beggar, nor 
will any suffering induce me to become 
one. Feeling from various circumstances 
utterly exhausted, I entered a coffee- 
house and laid down, it may have been 
to die. I could not sleep although my 
eyes were shut, and nothing would have 
roused me from a tremulous trance, which 
I thought was dying, but this plunderer 
here, who would not wait until death had 
permitted him quietly to possess himself 
of a jewel I value more than life." 
" Show me the jewel." 



OF ALROY. 139 

The youth held up his hand to Honain, 
who felt his pulse, and then took off the 
ring. 

" O my Fatima!" exclaimed Abdallah. 

" Silence, sir !" said Honain. " Page, 
call a jeweller." 

Honain examined the ring very atten- 
tively. Whether he were near-sighted, 
or whether the deceptive light of the 
covered bazaar prevented him from ex- 
amining it with ease, he certainly raised 
his hand to his brow, and for some mo- 
ments his countenance was invisible. 

The jeweller arrived, and pressing his 
hand to his heart, bowed before Honain. 

" Value this ring," said Honain in a 
low voice. 

The jeweller took the ring, viewed it 
in all directions with a scrutinizing glance, 
held it to the light, pressed it to his 



140 THE WONDROUS TALE 

tongue, turned it over and over and 
finally declared that he could not sell 
such a ring' under a thousand dirhems. 

" Whatever be the justice of the case/' 
said Honain to Abdallah, " art thou 
ready to part with this ring for a thou- 
sand dirhems ?" 

" Most certainly," said Abdallah. 

" And thou, lad, if the decision be in 
thy favour, wilt thou take for the ring 
double the worth at which the jeweller 
prizes it ?" 

" My lord, I have spoken the truth. 
I cannot part with that ring for the pa- 
lace of the Caliph." 

" The truth for once is triumphant," 
said Honain. - ■ Boy, the ring is thine ; 
and for thee, thou knave," turning to 
Abdallah, " liar, thief, and slanderer ! — 
for thee the bastinado 22 thou destined for 



OF ALROY. 141 

this innocent youth. Ibraham, see that 
he receives five hundred. Young pil- 
grim, thou art no longer destitute or 
friendless. Follow me to my palace." 



III. 

The arched chamber was of great size 
and beautiful proportion. The cieling, 
encrusted with green fretwork, and 
studded with silver stars, rested upon 
clustered columns of white and green mar- 
ble. In the centre of a variegated pave- 
ment of the same material, a fountain rose 
and fell into a green porphyry basin, and 
by the side of the fountain, upon a couch 
of silver, reposed Honain. 

He raised his eyes from the illuminated 
volume on which he had been long in- 



142 THE WONDROUS TALE 

tent, he clapped his hands, and a Nubian 
slave advanced, and folding- his arms upon 
his breast, bowed in silence before his 
lord. 

" How fares the Hebrew boy, Al- 
naschar ?" 

" Master, the fever has not returned. 
We gave him the potion ; he slumbered 
for many hours, and has now wakened, 
weak but well." 

" Let him rise and attend me." 

The Nubian disappeared. 

" There is nothing stranger than Sym- 
pathy/' soliloquized the physician of the 
Caliph, with a meditative air ; " allresolves 
itself into this principle, and I confess this 
learned doctor treats it deeply and well. 
An erudite spirit truly, and an eloquent 
pen ; yet he refines too much. 'Tis too 
scholastic. Observation will teach us 



OF ALROY. 143 

more than dogma. Meditating upon my 
passionate youth, I gathered wisdom. I 
have seen so much that I have ceased 
to wonder. Howe'er we doubt, there is 
a mystery beyond our penetration. And 
yet 'tis near our grasp. I sometimes 
deem a step, a single step would launch 
us into light. Here comes my patient. 
The rose has left his cheek, and his deep 
brow is wan and melancholy. Yet 'tis a 
glorious visage — Meditation's throne ; and 
Passion lingers in that languid eye. I 
know not why, a strong attraction draws 
me to this lone child. 

" Gentle stranger, how fares it with 
thee ?" 

" Very well, my lord. I come to thank 
thee for all thy goodness. My only 
thanks are words, and those too weak 
ones ; and yet the orphan's blessing is a 
treasure." 



144 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" You are an orphan then ?" 

" I have no parent but my father's 
God. " 

" And that God is—" 

" The God of Israel." 

" So I deemed. He is a Deity we all 
must honour, if he be the great Creator, 
whom we all allow." 

" He is what he is, and we are what 
we are — a fallen people, but faithful still." 

" Fidelity is strength." 

" Thy words are truth, and strength 
must triumph." 

" A prophecy !" 

" Many a prophet is little honoured, 
till the future proves his inspiration." 

" You are young and sanguine/' 

" So was my ancestor within the vale 
of Elah. But I speak unto a Moslemin, 
and this is foolishness." 



OF ALROY. 145 

" I have read something, and can take 
your drift. As for my faith, I believe in 
Truth, and wish all men to do the same. 
By the bye, might I inquire the name of 
him who is the inmate of my house ?" 

" They call me David." 

" David, you have a ring, an emerald 
cut with curious characters, Hebrew, I 
believe." 

"Tishere/' 

" A fine stone, and this inscription 
means — " 

" A simple legend — < Parted, but one'— 
the kind memorial of a brother's love."

" I have a silly fancy for this ring : 
you hesitate. Search my palace, and 
choose the treasure that you deem its 
match."

" Noble sir, the gem is little worth ; 
but were it such might deck a Caliph's 
brow, 'twere a poor recompense for all 
thy goodness. This ring is a trust rather 
than a possession, and, strange to say, 
although I cannot offer it to thee who 
may command, as thou hast saved, the 
life of its unhappy wearer, some stranger 
may cross my path to-morrow, and almost 
claim it as his own." 

" And that stranger is — " 

" The brother of the donor." 

" The brother of Jabaster ?" 

" Jabaster !" 

" Even so. I am that parted brother." 

" Great is the God of Israel ! Take the 
ring. But what is this ? the brother of 
Jabaster a turbaned chieftain ! — a Mosle- 
min ! Say, oh ! but say that thou hast not 
assumed their base belief, — say, oh ! but

say, that thou hast not become a traitor 
to our covenant, and I will bless the for- 
tunes of this hour." 

" I am false to no God. Calm thy- 
self, sweet youth. These are higher ques- 
tions than thy faint strength can master 
now. Another time we'll talk of this, my 
boy. At present of my brother and thy- 
self. He lives and prospers?" 

" He lives in faith ; the pious ever 
prosper." 

" A glorious dreamer ! Though our 
moods are different, I ever loved him. 
And thyself? Thou art not what thou 
seemest. Tell me all. Jabaster's friend 
can be no common mind. Thy form has 
heralded thy fame. Trust me." 

" I am Alroy." 

" What! the Prince of our Captivity?" 

" Even so."

" Ay!" 

" My sympathy was prophetic. I 
loved thee from the first. And what dost 
thou here ? A price is set upon thy 
head : thou knowest it ?" 

" For the first time; but I am neither 
astonished nor alarmed. I am upon the 
Lord's business." 

" What wouldst thou?" 

" Free his people." 

"The pupil of Jabaster: I see it all. 
Another victim to his reveries. I'll save 
this boy. David, for thy name must not

dying. Let us to the terrace, and seek 
the solace of the twilight breeze."

" What is the hour, David ?" 

u Near on midnight. I marvel if thy 
brother may read in the stars our happy

" Men read that which they wish. He 
is a learned Cabalist." 

" But what we wish comes from 
above." 

" So they say. We make our for- 
tunes, and we call them Fate." 

"Yet the Voice sounded — the daughter 
of the Voice that summoned Samuel." 

" You have told me strange things ; I 
have heard stranger solved." 

" My faith is a rock." 

" On which you may split."

" Art thou a Sadducee?" 

" I am a man, who knows men." 

" You are learned, but different from 
Jabaster." 

" We are the same, though different. 
Day and Night are both portions of Time." 

" And thy portion is — " 

" Truth." 

" That is, light." 

" Yes ; so dazzling that it sometimes 
seems dark." 

" Like thy meaning." 

" You are young." 

" Is youth a defect ?" 

" No, the reverse. But we cannot eat 
the fruit while the tree is in blossom." 

« What fruit ?" 

" Knowledge." 

" I have studied." 

« What ?" 



OF ALROY. 151 

" All sacred things." 

" How know you that they are sacred >" 

" They come from God." 

" So does every thing. Is every thing 
sacred ?" 

" They are the deep expression of his 
will." 

" According toJabaster. Ask the man 
who prays in yonder mosque, and he will 
tell you that Jabaster's wrong." 

" After all, thou art a Moslemin ?" 

" No." 

"What then?" 

" I have told you — a man." 

" But what dost thou worship }" 

" What is worship?" 

" Adoration due from the creature to 
the Creator." 

" Which is he ?" 

" Our God."

"The God of Israel?" 

" Even so." 

" A frail minority, then, burn him in-

" We are the chosen people."

" We forgot him, before he chastened us." 

" Why did we ?" 

" Thou knowest the records of our holy

" Yes, I know them : like all records, 
annals of blood." 

" Annals of victory, that will dawn 
again." 

" If redemption be but another name

" Art thou Jabaster's brother ?" 

" So our mother was wont to say : a

" Lord Honain, thou art rich and wise 
and powerful. Thy fellow-men speak of 
thee only with praise or fear, and both are 
cheering. Thou hast quitted our antique 
ark ; why — no matter. We'll not dis- 
cuss it. Tis something, if a stranger, at 
least thou art not a renegade. The world 
goes well with thee, my Lord Honain. 
But if instead of bows and blessings, thou, 
like thy brethren, wert greeted only with 
the cuff and curse ; if thou didst rise each 
morning only to feel existence was dis- 
honour, and to find thyself marked out 
among surrounding men as something foul 
and fatal : if it were thy lot, like theirs, 
at best to drag on a mean and dull career, 
hopeless and aimless, or with no other 
hope or aim but that which is degrading, 
and all this too with a keen sense of thy 
intrinsic worth, and deep conviction of

superior race ; why then perchance 
Honain might even discover 'twere worth 
a struggle to be free and honoured." 

" I pray your pardon, sir ; I thought 
you were Jabasters pupil, a dreaming 
student. I see you have a deep ambi- 
tion ." 

" I am a prince ; and I fain would be 
a prince without my fetters/' 

" Listen to me, Alroy/' said Honain 
in a low voice, and he placed his arm 
round his waist, " I am your friend. 
Our acquaintance is very brief : no mat- 
ter, I love you, I rescued you in injury, 
I tended you in sickness, even now your 
life is in my power, I would protect it 
with my own. You cannot doubt me. 
Our affections are not under our own 
controul ; and mine are yours. The 
sympathy between us is entire. You see 



OF ALROY. 1,55 

me, you see what 1 am : a Hebrew, 
though unknown, one of that despised, 
rejected, persecuted people, of whom you 
are the chief. I too would be free and 
honoured. Freedom and honour are 
mine, but I was my own Messiah. I 
quitted in good time our desperate cause, 
but I gave it a trial. Ask Jabaster how 
I fought. Youth could be my only ex- 
cuse for such indiscretion. I left this 
country, I studied, and resided among 
the Greeks. I returned from Constanti- 
nople with all their learning, some of 
their craft. No one knew me. I as- 
sumed their turban, and I am — the Lord 
Honain. Take my experience, child, and 
save yourself much sorrow. Turn your 
late adventure to good account. No one 
can recognize you here. I will introduce 
you among the highest as my child, by

some fair Greek. The world is before 
you. You may fight, you may love, you 
may revel . War, and women, and luxury,

Vizier. Clear your head of nonsense. 
In the present disordered state of the em- 
pire, you may even carve yourself out a 
kingdom, infinitely more delightful than 
the barren land of milk and honey. I 
have seen it, child; a rocky wilder- 
ness, where I would not let my courser 
graze." 

He bent down, and fixed his eyes upon 
his companion with a scrutinizing glance. 
The moonlight fell upon the resolved vi- 
sage of the Prince of the Captivity. 

" Honain," he replied, pressing his 
hand, " I thank thee. Thou knowest 
not me, but still I thank thee."

" You are resolved then on destruc- 
tion/' 

" On glory, eternal glory." 

" Is it possible to succeed ?" 

" Is it possible to fail ?" 

" You are mad ?" 

" I am a believer." 

" Enough. Not another word. You 
have yet one chance. My brother has 
saddled your enterprize with a condition, 
and an impossible one. Gain the sceptre 
of Solomon, and I will agree to be your 
subject. You will waste a year in this 
frolic. You are young, and can afford it. 
I trust you will experience nothing worse 
than a loss of time, which is, however, 
very valuable. My duty will be, after all 
your sufferings, to send you forth on your

me you will return to Bagdad to accept 
my offers. At present, the dews are de-

divan, and take some coffee." 



V. 



Some few days after this conversation 
on the terrace, as Alroy was reclining in 
a bower, in the beautiful garden of his 
host, meditating on the future, some one 
touched him on the back. He looked 
up. It was Honain. 

" Follow me," said the brother of Ja- 
baster. 

The prince rose, and followed him in 
silence. They entered the house, and, 
passing through the saloon already de- 



OF ALROY. 159 

scribed, they proceeded down a long gal- 
lery, which terminated in an arched flight 
of broad steps, leading to the river. A 
boat was fastened to the end of the stairs, 
floating on the blue line of the Tigris 
bright in the sun. 

Honain now gave to Alroy a velvet 
bag, which he requested him to carry, 
and then they descended the steps and 
entered the covered boat ; and, without 
any directions to the rower, they were 
soon skimming over the water. By the 
sound of passing vessels and the occa- 
sional shouts of the boatmen, Alroy, al- 
though he could observe nothing, was 
conscious that for some time their course 
lay through a principal thoroughfare of 
the city ; but by degrees the sounds be- 
came less frequent, and in time entirely 
died away, and all that caught his ear 



160 THE WONDROUS TALE 

was the regular and monotonous stroke of 
their own oar. 

At length, after the lapse of nearly an 
hour from their entrance, the boat stopped, 
and was moored against a quay. The 
curtains were withdrawn, and Honain 
and his companion disembarked. 

A low but very extensive building, 
painted in white and gold arabesque, and 
irregular but picturesque in form, with 
many small domes, and tall thin towers, 
rose amid groves of cypress on the bank 
of the broad and silent river. The rapid 
stream had carried them far from the city, 
which was visible, but distant. Around 
was no habitation, no human being. The 
opposite bank was occupied by enclosed 
gardens. Not even a boat passed. 

Honain, beckoning to Alroy to accom- 
pany him, but still silent, advanced to a 



OF ALROY. l6i 

small portal, and knocked. It was in- 
stantly opened by a single Nubian, who 
bowed reverently as the visitors passed 
him. They proceeded along a low and 
gloomy passage, covered with arches of 
fretwork, until they arrived at a door of 
tortoiseshell and mother of pearl. 23 Here 
Honain, who was in advance, turned 
round to Alroy, and said, " Whatever 
happen, and whoever may address you, 
as you value your life and mine, do not 
speak." 

The door opened, and they found them- 
selves in a vast and gorgeous hall. Pillars 
of many coloured marbles rose from a 
red and blue pavement of the same mate- 
rial, and supported a vaulted, circular, and 
highly-embossed roof of purple, scarlet 
and gold. 24 Around a fountain, which 
rose fifty feet in height from an immense 



162 THE WONDROUS TALE 

basin of lapiz-lazuli, and reclining on 
small yellow Barbary mats, was a group 
of Nubian eunuchs dressed in rich habits 
of scarlet and gold, 25 and armed with ivory 
battle-axes, the white handles worked 
in precious arabesque finely contrasting 
with the blue and brilliant blades. 

The commander of- the eunuch-guard 
rose on seeing Honain, and pressing his 
hand to his head, mouth, and heart, sa- 
luted him. The physician of the Caliph 
motioning Alroy to remain, advanced 
some paces in front of him, and entered 
into a whispering conversation with the 
eunuch. After a few minutes, this offi- 
cer resumed his seat, and Honain, beckon- 
ing to Alroy to rejoin him, crossed the 
hall. 

Passing through an open arch, they 
entered a quadrangular court of roses, 26 



OF ALROY. 163 

each bed of flowers surrounded by a 
stream of sparkling water, and floating 
like an enchanted islet upon a fairy 
ocean. The sound of the water and the 
sweetness of the flowers blended together, 
and produced a lulling sensation which 
nothing but his strong and strange cu- 
riosity might have enabled Alroy to re- 
sist. Proceeding along a cloister of light 
airy workmanship which connected the 
hall with the remainder of the buildings, 
they stood before a lofty and sumptuous 
portal. 

It was a monolite gate, thirty feet in 
height, formed of one block of green and 
red jasper, and cut into the fanciful un- 
dulating arch of the Saracens. The con- 
summate artist had seized the advantage 
afforded to him by the ruddy veins of 
the precious stone, and had formed them 



164 THE WONDROUS TALE 

in bold relief into two vast and sinuous 
serpents, which shot forth their crested 
heads and glittering eyes at Honain and 
his companion. 

The physician of the Caliph taking his 
dagger from his girdle, struck one of the 
heads of the serpents thrice. The massy 
portal opened with a whirl and a roar, 
and before them stood an Abyssinian 
giant, 27 holding in his leash a roaring lion. 

w Hush ! Haroun," said Honain to the 
animal, raising at the same time his arm, 
and the beast crouched in silence. " Wor- 
thy Morgargon, I bring you a remem- 
brance." The Abyssinian showed his 
tusks, larger and whiter than the lion's, 
as he grinningly received the tribute of 
the courtly Honain ; and he uttered a 
few uncouth sounds, but he could not 
speak, for he was a mute. 



OF ALROY. 165 

The jasper portal introduced the com- 
panions to a long and lofty and arched 
chamber, lighted by high windows of 
stained glass, hung with tapestry of silk 
and silver, covered with prodigious car- 
pets, and surrounded by immense couches. 
And thus through similar chambers they 
proceeded, in some of which were signs 
of recent habitation, until they arrived 
at another quadrangle nearly filled by a 
most singular fountain which rose from a 
basin of gold encrusted with pearls, and 
which was surrounded by figures of every 
rare quadruped 28 in the most costly ma- 
terials. Here a golden tiger with flaming 
eyes of ruby, and flowing stripes of opal, 
stole, after some bloody banquet, to the 
refreshing brink ; a cameleopard raised 
its slender neck of silver from the centre 
of a group of every inhabitant of the 



; 



166 THE WONDROUS TALE 

forest, and brilliant bands of monkeys 
glittering with precious stones, rested, in 
every variety of fantastic posture, on the 
margin of the basin. 

The fountain itself was a tree of gold 
and silver 29 spreading into innumerable 
branches, covered with every variety of 
curious birds, their plumage appropriately 
imitated by the corresponding tints of 
precious stones, and which warbled in 
beautiful melody as they poured forth 
from their bills the musical and refresh- 
ing element. 

It was with difficulty that Alroy could 
refrain from an admiring exclamation, 
but Honain, ever quick, turned to him, 
with his finger pressed on his mouth, and 
quitting the quadrangle, they entered the 
gardens. 

Lofty terraces, dark masses of cypress, 



OF ALROY. 167 

winding walks of acacia, in the distance 
an interminable paradise, and here and 
there a glittering pavilion and bright 
kiosk ! Its appearance on the river had 
not prepared Alroy for the extent of the 
palace itself. It seemed infinite, and it 
was evident that he had only viewed a 
very small portion of it. While they 
were moving on, there suddenly arose 
the sound of trumpets. The sound grew 
nearer and nearer, louder and louder : 
soon was heard the tramp of an approach- 
ing troop. Honain drew Alroy aside. 
A procession appeared advancing from a 
dark grove of cypress. Four hundred 
men led as many white blood-hounds 
with collars of gold and rubies. 30 Then 
came one hundred men, each with a 
hooded hawk. Then six horsemen in 
rich dresses. After them a single horse- 



168 THE WONDROUS TALE 

man, mounted on a steed, marked on its 
forehead with a star. 31 The rider was mid- 
dle aged, handsome, and dignified. He 
was plainly dressed, but the staff of his 
hunting spear was entirely of diamonds 
and the blade of gold. He was followed 
by a company of Nubian eunuchs, with 
their scarlet dresses and ivory battle- 
axes, and the procession closed. 

" The Caliph," whispered Honain, 
when they had passed, placing at the 
same time his finger on his lip, to pre- 
vent any inquiry. This was the first in- 
timation that had reached Alroy of what 
he had already suspected, that he was a 
visitor to the palace of the Commander of 
the Faithful. 

The companions turned down a wild 
and winding walk, which, after some 
time, brought them to a small and gently 



OF ALROY. 169 

sloping lawn, surrounded by cedar trees 
of great size. Upon the lawn was a 
kiosk, a long and many windowed build- 
ing, covered with blinds, and further 
screened by an overhanging roof. The 
kiosk was built of white and green mar- 
ble, and ascended by a flight of steps the 
length of the building, alternately of 
white and green marble, and nearly 
covered with rose trees. Honain as- 
cended these steps alone, and entered the 
kiosk. After a few minutes, he looked 
out from the blinds and beckoned to 
Alroy. David advanced, but Honain, 
fearful of some indiscretion, met him, and 
said to him in a low whisper between his 
teeth, " Remember you are deaf, a mute, 
and an eunuch." Alroy could scarcely 
refrain from smiling, and the Prince of 
the Captivity and the physician of the 
vol. 1. 1 



170 THE WONDROUS TALE 

Caliph entered the kiosk together. Two 
women, veiled, and two eunuchs of the 
guard received them in an ante-chamber. 
And then they passed into a room which 
ran nearly the whole length of the kiosk, 
opening on one side to the gardens, and 
on the other supported by an ivory wall 
with niches painted in green fresco, and 
in each niche a rose-tree. Each niche, 
also, was covered with an almost invi- 
sible golden grate, which confined a 
nightingale, and made him constant to 
the rose he loved. At the foot of each 
niche was a fountain, but instead of 
water, each basin was replenished with 
the purest quicksilver. 32 The roof of the 
kiosk was of mother-of-pearl, inlaid with 
tortoise-shell ; the pavement, a mosaic of 
rare marbles and precious stones, repre- 
senting the most delicious fruits, and the 



OF ALROY. 171 

most beautiful flowers. Over this pave- 
ment a Georgian page flung- at intervals 
refreshing perfumes. At the end of 
this elegant chamber was a divan of light 
green silk, embroidered with pearls, and 
covered with cushions of white satin and 
gold. Upon one of these cushions, in 
the middle of the divan, sat a lady, her 
eyes fixed in abstraction upon a volume 
of Persian poesy reclining on her knees, 
one hand playing with a rosary of pearls 
and emeralds/ 3 and the other holding a 
long gold chain, which imprisoned a 
white gazelle. 

The lady looked up as Honain and his 
companion entered. She was very young, 
as youthful as Alroy. Her long light 
brown hair, drawn off a high white fore- 
head covered with blue veins, fell braided 
with pearls over each shoulder. Her 

1 2 



172 THE WONDROUS TALE 

eyes were very large, and deeply blue. 
Her nose small, but high and aquiline. 
The fairness of her face was dazzling, 
and when she looked up and greeted 
Honain, her lustrous cheeks broke into 
dimples, which were more fascinating 
from their contrast with the general ex- 
pression of her countenance, which was 
haughty and derisive. The lady was 
dressed in a robe of crimson silk, girded 
round her waist by a green shawl, from 
which peeped forth the diamond hilt of a 
very small poignard. 34 Her round white 
arms looked infinitely small, as they oc- 
casionally flashed forth from their large 
loose hanging sleeves. One was covered 
with jewels, and the right arm was quite 
bare. 

Honain advanced, and bending, kissed 
the lady's proffered hand. Alroy fell 
into the back -ground. 



OF ALROY. 173 

" They told me that the Rose of the 
World drooped this morning," said the 
physician, bending- again as he smiled, 
" and her slave hastened at her command 
to tend her." 

" It was a south wind. The wind has 
changed, and the Rose of the World is 
better," replied the lady, laughing. 

Honain touched her pulse. 

" Irregular," said the physician. 

" Like myself," said the lady. " Is 
that a new slave ?" 

" A recent purchase, and a great bar- 
gain. He is good looking, has the ad- 
vantage of being deaf and dumb, and is 
harmless in every respect." 

" 'Tis a pity," replied the lady ; " it 
seems that all good-looking people are 
born to be useless. I, for instance." 

" Yet rumour whispers the reverse," 
remarked the physician. 



174 THE WONDROUS TALE 

ft How so ?" inquired the lady. 

" The young King of Karasme." 

(i Poh ! I have made up my mind to 
detest him. A barbarian !" 

" A hero !" 

(i Did you ever see him ?" 

" I have/' 

" Handsome ?" 

" An archangel." 

" And sumptuous ?" 

" Is he not a conqueror ? All the 
plunder of the world will be yours." 

" I am tired of magnificence. I built 
this kiosk to forget it," 

" It is not in the least degree splen- 
did," said Honain, looking round with a 
smile. 

" No," answered the lady, with a self- 
satisfied air; " here, at least, one can 
forget one has the misfortune to be a 
princess." 



OF ALROY. 175 

" It is certainly a great misfortune," 
said the physician. 

" And yet it must be the only tolera- 
ble lot," replied the lady. 

" Assuredly," replied Honain. 

" For our unhappy sex at least." 

" Very unhappy/' 

" If I were only a man !" 

M What a hero you would be !" 

" I should like to live in endless con- 
fusion." 

" I have not the least doubt of it." 

" Have you got me the books ?" eagerly 
inquired the Princess. 

" My slave bears them," replied Honain. 

* Let me see them directly." 

Honain took the bag from Alroy, and 
unfolded its contents — the very volumes 
of Greek romances which Ali, the mer- 
chant, had obtained for him. 



176 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" I am tired of poetry," said the Prin- 
cess, glancing over the costly volumes, 
and tossing them away. " I long to see 
the world." 

" You would soon be tired of that," re- 
plied the Physician. 

" I suppose common people are never 
tired," said the Princess. 

" Except with labour/' said the Phy- 
sician ; " care keeps them alive." 

" What is Care ?" asked the Princess, 
with a smile. 

" It is a god," replied the Physician, 
" invisible, but omnipotent. It steals 
the bloom from the cheek and lightness 
from the pulse — it takes away the appe- 
tite, and turns the hair grey." 

" It is no true divinity, then," replied 
the Princess, " but an idol we make our- 
selves. I am a sincere Moslemin, and 



OF ALROY 177 

will not worship it. Tell me some news, 
Honain ." 

u The young King of Karasme — * 

" Again ! the barbarian ! You are in 
his pay. I'll none of him. To leave one 
prison, and to be shut up in another — 
why do you remind me of it ? No, my 
dear Hakim, if I marry at all, I will 
marry to be free." 

" An impossibility," said Honain. 

" My mother was free till she was a 
queen and a slave. I intend to end as 
she began. You know what she 
was." 

Honain knew well, but he was too 
politic not to affect ignorance. 

" The daughter of a bandit," continued 
the Princess, " who fought by the side of 
her father. That is existence ! I must be 
a robber. Tis in the blood. I want my

fate foretold, Honain. You are an as- 
trologer; do it." 

" I have already cast your nativity. 
Your star is a comet." 

"That augurs well; brilliant 'confu- 
sion and erratic splendor. I wish I were 
a star/' added the Princess in a deep 
rich voice, and with a pensive air ; * a 
star in the clear blue sky, beautiful and 
free. Honain, Honain, the gazelle has 
broken her chain, and is eating my 



roses/' 



Alroy rushed forward and seized the 
graceful truant. Honain shot him an 
anxious look ; the Princess received the 
chain from the hand of Alroy, and cast at 
him a scrutinizing glance. 

" What splendid eyes the poor beast 
has got !" exclaimed the Princess. 

" The gazelle ?" inquired the physician. 



OF ALROY. 179 

" No, your slave/' replied the Princess. 
" Why he blushes ! Were he not deaf as 
well as dumb, I could almost believe he 
understood me/' 

" He is very modest," replied Honain, 
rather alarmed ; " and is frightened at 
the liberty he has taken." 

" I like modesty," said the Princess ; 
"it is so interesting. I am modest ; 
don't you think so ?" 

" Certainly," said Honain. 

" And interesting ?" 

"Very." 

" I detest an interesting person. After 
all, there is nothing like plain dul- 
ness." 

" Nothing," said Honain. 

" The day flows on so serenely in such 
society." 

" It does," said Honain. 



180 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" No confusion ; no scenes." 

" None." 

" I make it a rule only to have ugly 
slaves." 

" You are quite right." 

" Honain, will you ever contradict me ? 
You know very well I have the hand- 
somest slaves in the world." 

c< Every one knows it." 

" And do you know, I have taken 
a very great fancy to your new purchase, 
who, according to your account, is emi- 
nently qualified for the post. Why, you 
don't agree with me !" 

"Why, yes ; I doubt not your Highness 
would find him eminently qualified, and 
certainly few things would give me 
greater pleasure than offering him for 
your acceptance ; but I got into such dis- 
grace by that late affair of the Circassian, 
that—" 



OFALROY. 181 

" Oh ! leave it to me, leave it to me/' 
said the Princess. 

" Certainly," said the Physician, turn- 
ing the conversation ; " and when the 
young King of Karasme arrives at Bag- 
dad, you can offer him to his majesty as 
a present." 

" Delightful ! and the King is really 
handsome and young as well as brave ; 
but has he any taste ?" 

u You have enough for both." 

" If he would but make war against the 
Greeks !" 

4 'Why so violent against the poor 
Greeks }" 

"You know they are Giaours. Be- 
sides, they might beat him, and then I 
should have the pleasure of being taken 
prisoner." 

" Delightful !"

" Marry the Emperor !" 

' ' To be sure. Of course he would fall 
in love with me." 

" Of course." 

i( And then — and then, I might conquer 
Paris." 

" Paris!" 

" You have been at Paris ?" 35 

"Yes.* 

" The men are shut up there," said the 
Princess, with a smile, " are they not ? 
and the women do what they like ?" 

"You will always do what you like," 
said Honain, rising. 

" You are going ?" 

" My visits must not be too long." 

" Farewell, dear Honain !" said the 
Princess with a melancholy air. " You 



OF ALROY. 183 

are the only person who has an idea in 
all Bagdad, and you leave me. A mi- 
serable lot is mine, to feel every thing, 
and be nothing. These books and flowers, 
these sweet birds, and this fair gazelle — 
ah ! poets may feign as they please, but 
how cheerfullly would I resign all these 
elegant consolations of- a captive life for 
one hour of freedom. I wrote some verses 
on myself, yesterday ; take them, and get 
them blazoned for me by the finest scribe 
in the city ; letters of silver on a violet 
ground with a fine flowing border ; I 
leave the design to you. Adieu ! Come 
hither, mute. 1 ' Alroy advanced to her 
beckon, and knelt. " There, take that 
rosary for thy master's sake, and those 
dark eyes of thine." 

The companions withdrew and reached 
their boat in silence. It was Sunset. 



184 THE WONDROUS TALE 

The musical and sonorous voice of the 
Muezzin resounded from the innumerable 
minarets of the splendid city. Honain 
drew back the curtains of the barque. 
Bagdad rose before them in huge masses 
of sumptuous dwellings, seated amid 
groves and gardens. An infinite popula- 
tion, summoned by the invigorating twi- 
light, poured forth in all directions. The 
glowing river was covered with sparkling 
caiques, the glittering terraces with showy 
groups. Splendour, and power, and lux- 
ury, and beauty, were arrayed before 
them in their most captivating forms, 
and the heart of Alroy responded to their 
magnificence. 

" A glorious vision !" said the Prince 
of the Captivity. 

" Very different to Hamadan," said 
the physician of the Caliph. 



OF ALROY. 185 

" To-day I have seen wonders," said 
Alroy. 

" The world is opening to you," said 
Honain. 

Alroy did not reply ; but, after some 
minutes, he said, in a hesitating voice, 
" Who was that lady ?" 

" The Princess Schirene," replied Ho- 
nain, " the favourite daughter of the 
Caliph. Her mother was a Georgian and 
a Giaour." 



II. 



The moonlight fell upon the figure of 
Alroy lying on a couch ; his countenance 
was hidden in his arm. He was motion- 
less, but did not sleep. 

He rose and paced the chamber with 



186 THE WONDROUS TALE 

agitated steps ; sometimes he stopped, and 
gazed on the pavement, fixed in abstrac- 
tion. He advanced to the window, and 
cooled his feverish brow in the midnight 
air. 

An hour passed away, and the young 
Prince of the Captivity remained fixed 
in the same position. Suddenly he turn- 
ed, dashed to a tripod of porphyry, and 
seizing a rosary of jewels, pressed it to 
his lips. 

cc The Spirit of my dreams, she comes 
at last, the form for which I have sighed 
and wept, the form which rose upon my 
radiant vision when I shut my eyes 
against the jarring shadows of this gloomy 
world. 

" Schirene ! Schirene ! here in this 
solitude I pour to thee the passion long 
stored up— the passion of my life, no

common life, a life full of deep feeling 
and creative thought. Oh ! beautiful, 
oh, more than beautiful, for thou to 
me art as a dream unbroken — why art 
thou not mine, why lose a moment in our 
glorious lives, and baulk our destiny of 
half its bliss ? 

" Fool, fool, hast thou forgotten ? The 
rapture of a prisoner in his cell, whose 
wild fancy for a moment belies his fet- 
ters ! The daughter of the Caliph and 
a — Jew ! 

" Give me my father's sceptre ! 

" A plague on talismans ! Oh ! I need 
no inspiration but her memory, no magic 
but her name. By heavens, I'll enter 
this glorious city a conqueror, or I'll 
die. 

" Why what is Life, for meditation 
mingles ever with my passion — why,

dogs, and tear off the painted mask of 
false society ! Here am I a hero ; with a 
mind that can devise all things, and a 
heart of superhuman daring, with youth, 
with vigour, with a glorious lineage, 
with a form that has made full many a 
lovely maiden of our tribe droop her 
fair head by Hamadan's sweet fount, and 
I am — nothing. 

" Out on Society ; 'twas not made for 
me. I'll form my own, and be the deity 
I sometimes feel. 

" We make our fortunes and we call 
them Fate. Thou saidst well, Honain. 
Most subtle Sadducee ! The saintly blood 
flowed in my fathers' veins, and they 
did nothing ; but I have an arm formed 
to wield a sceptre, and I will win 
one.

" I cannot doubt my triumph. Tri- 
umph is a part of my existence. I am 
born for glory, as a tree is born to bear

bird, will sometimes flag and fall, and 
then I am lost. The young King of Ka- 
rasme, a youthful hero ! Would he had 
been Alschiroch ! My heart is sick even 
at the very name. Alas ! my trials have 
not yet begun. Jabaster warned me : 
good, sincere, Jabaster! His talisman 
presses on my frantic heart, and seems to 
warn me. I am in danger. Braggart to 
stand here, filling the careless air with 
idle words, while all is unaccomplished. 



OF ALROY. 191 

I grow dull. The young King of Ka- 
rasme ! Why, what am I compared to 
this same Prince ? Nothing, but in my 
thoughts. In the full bazaar, they would 
not deem me worthy even to hold his 
stirrup or his slipper Oh ! this con- 
test, this constant, bitter, never-ending 
contest between my fortune and my 
fancy ! Why do I exist ? or, if existing, 
why am I not recognized as I would be ? 
" Sweet Voice, that in Jabasters dis- 
tant cave descended from thy holy home 
above, and whispered consolation, breathe 
again ! Again breathe thy still sum- 
mons to my lonely ear, and chase away 
the thoughts that hover round me. 
Thoughts dark and doubtful, like fell 
birds of prey hovering around an expect- 
ed hero's fall, and gloating on their tri- 
umph o'er the brave. There is something 



192 THE WONDROUS TALE 

fatal in these crowded cities. Faith flou- 
rishes in solitude." 

He threw himself upon the couch, and, 
leaning down his head, seemed lost in 
meditation. He started up, and, seiz- 
ing his tablets, wrote upon them these 
words : — 

" Honain, I have been the whole night 
like David in the wilderness of Ziph ; 
but, by the aid of the Lord, I have con- 
quered. I fly from this dangerous city 
upon his business, which I have too much 
neglected. Attempt not to discover me, 
and accept my gratitude."

A scorching Sun, a blue and burning 
sky, on every side lofty ranges of black 
and barren mountains, dark ravines, deep 
caverns, unfathomable gorges ! 

A solitary being moved in the distance. 
Faint and toiling, a pilgrim slowly clam- 
bered up the steep and stony track. 

The sultry hours moved on, the pil- 
grim at length gained the summit of the 
mountain, a small and rugged table land 
strewn with huge masses of loose and 
heated rock. All around was desolation: 

VOL. I. K 



194 THE WONDROUS TALE 

no spring, no herbage ; the bird and 
the insect were alike mute. Yet still it 
was the summit : no loftier peaks frowned 
in the distance ; the pilgrim stopped, and 
breathed with more facility, and a faint 
smile played over his worn and solemn 
countenance. 

He rested a few minutes, he took from 
his wallet some locusts and wild honey, 
and a small skin of water. His meal was 
short as well as simple. An ardent de- 
sire to reach his place of destination be- 
fore night-fall, urged him to proceed. 
He soon passed over the table-land, and 
commenced the descent of the mountain. 
A straggling olive tree occasionally ap- 
peared, and then a group, and soon the 
groups swell into a grove. His way 
wound through the grateful and unac- 
customed shade. He emerged from the 



OF ALROY. 195 

grove, and found that he had proceeded 
down more than half the side of the 
mountain. It ended precipitously in a 
very dark and narrow ravine, formed on 
the other side by an opposite mountain, 
the lofty steep of which was crested by a 
city gently rising on a very gradual 
slope. 

Nothing could be conceived more bar- 
ren, wild, and terrible, than the sur- 
rounding scenery, unillumined by a sin- 
gle trace of culture. The city stood like 
the last gladiator in an amphitheatre of 
desolation. 

It was surrounded by a lofty turretted 
wall, of an architecture to which the pil- 
grim was unaccustomed : gates with draw- 
bridge and portcullis, square towers, and 
loop-holes for the archer. Sentinels, 
clothed in steel, and shining in the sun-

tious wall, and on a lofty tower a stand- 
ard waved, a snowy standard, with a red, 
red cross ! 

The Prince of the Captivity at length 
beheld the lost capital of his fathers

A few months back and such a specta- 
cle would have called forth all the latent 
passion of Alroy ; but time and suffering, 
and sharp experience, had already some- 
what curbed the fiery spirit of the He- 
brew Prince. He gazed upon Jerusalem, 
he beheld the City of David garrisoned 
by the puissant warriors of Christendom, 
and threatened by the innumerable ar- 
mies of the Crescent. The two great 






OF ALROY. 197 

divisions of the world seemed contending 
for a prize, which he, a lonely wanderer, 
had crossed the desart to rescue. If his 
faith restrained him from doubting the 
possibility of his enterprize, he was at 
least deeply conscious that the world was 
a very different existence to what he had 
fancied amid the gardens of Hamadan 
and the rocks of Caucasus, and that if his 
purpose could be accomplished, it could 
only be effected by one means. Calm, 
perhaps somewhat depressed, but full of 
pious humiliation, and not deserted by 
holy hope, he descended into the Valley 
of Jehosaphat, and so slaking his thirst 
at Siloah, and mounting the opposite 
height, David Alroy entered Jerusalem 
by the gate of Sion. 37 

He had been instructed that the quarter 
of his people was portioned near this 



198 THE WONDROUS TALE 

entrance. He inquired the direction of 
the sentinel, who did not condescend to 
answer him. An old man in very shabby 
robes, who was passing, beckoned to him. 

" What want you, friend ?" inquired 
Alroy. 

" You were asking for the quarter of 
our people. You must be a stranger in- 
deed, in Jerusalem, to suppose that a 
Frank would speak to a Jew. You 
were lucky to get neither kicked nor 
cursed." 

" Kicked and cursed ! Why these 
dogs- — " 

" Hush ! hush ! for the love of God," 
said his new companion, very much 
alarmed. i( Have you lent money to their 
captain that you speak thus? In Jeru- 
salem our people speak only in a whis- 
per." 






OF ALROY. 199 

" No matter : the cure is not by words. 
Where is our quarter ?" 

" Was the like ever seen ! Why he 
speaks as if he were a Frank. I save 
him from having his head broken by a 
gauntlet, and " 

" My friend, I am tired. Our 
quarter ? ' 

" Whom may you want ?" 

« The chief Rabbi." 

" You bear letters to him ?" 

" What is that to you?" 

" Hush ! hush ! You don't know 
what Jerusalem is, young man. You 
must not think of going on in this way. 
Where do you come from ?" 

" Bagdad." 

" Bagdad ! Jerusalem is not Bagdad. 
A Turk is a brute, but a Christian is a 
demon." 



200 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" But our quarter, our quarter ?" 

" Hush ! hush ! You want the chief 
Rabbi ?" 

« Ay ! ay !" 

" Rabbi Zimri >» 

" It may be so. I neither know nor 
care." 

" Neither knows nor cares ! This will 
never do : you must not go on in this 
way at Jerusalem. You must not think 
of it." 

" Fellow, I see thou art a miserable 
prattler. Show me our quarter, and I 
will pay thee well — or be off." 

"Be off ! Art thou a Hebrew ? to 
say ' be off ' to any one. You come from 
Bagdad ! I'll tell you what — go back 
to Bagdad. You will never do for Jeru- 
salem." 

" Your grizzled beard protects you. 



OF ALROY 201 

Old fool, I am a pilgrim just arrived, 
wearied beyond expression, and you 
keep me here listening to your flat 
talk !" 

" Flat talk ! Why ! what would you >" 

" Lead me to the Rabbi Zimri — if that 
be his name." 

" If that be his name ! Why every 
one knows Rabbi Zimri, the chief Rabbi 
of Jerusalem, the successor of Aaron. 
We have our temple yet, say what they 
like. A very learned Doctor is Rabbi 
Zimri/' 

" Wretched driveller. I am ashamed 
to lose my patience with such a dotard." 

" Driveller ! dotard ! Why, who are 
you r 

" One you cannot comprehend. With- 
out another word, lead me to your 
chief."

202 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" Chief! you have not far to go. I 
know no one of the nation who holds 
his head higher than I do here, and they 
call me Zimri." 

" What, the chief Rabbi™ that very 
learned Doctor !" 

'* No less ; I thought you had heard 
of him." 

" Let us forget the past, good Zimri. 
When great men play the incognito, they 
must sometimes hear rough phrases. It 
is the Caliph's lot as well as yours. I 
am glad to make the acquaintance of so 
great a Doctor. Though young, and 
roughly habited, I have seen the world a 
little, and may offer next Sabbath in the 
Synagogue more dirrhems than you would 
perhaps suppose. Good and learned 
Zimri, I would be your guest/' 

" A very worshipful young man ! 



OF ALROY. 203 

And he speaks low and soft now ! But 

it was lucky I was at hand. Good 

what's your name ?" 

" David." 

ie A very honest name — good David. 
It was lucky I was at hand when you 
spoke to the sentinel, though. A Jew 
speak to a Frank, and a sentinel too ! 
Hah ! hah ! hah ! that is very good. 
How Rabbi Maimon will laugh ! Faith 
it was very lucky, now, was not it ?" 

" Indeed, most fortunate." 

" Well, that is candid ! Here ! this 
way. Tis not far. We number few, 
Sir, of our brethren here, but a better 
time will come — a better time will come." 

" I think so. This is your door ?" 

"A humble one. Jerusalem is not 
Bagdad, but you are welcome."

"King Pirgandicus 38 entered them/' 
said Rabbi Maimon, " but no one since." 

ce And when did he live ?'' inquired 
Alroy. 

" His reign is recorded in the Tal- 
mud/' answered Rabbi Zimri, " but in 
the Talmud there are no dates." 

" A long while ago ?" said Alroy. 

" Since the Captivity," answered Rabbi 
Maimon. 

" I doubt that," said Rabbi Zimri, " or 
why should he be called king ?" 

" Was he of the house of David ?" said 
Alroy. 

"Without doubt," said Rabbi Maimon ; 
" he was one of our greatest kings, and 
conquered Julius Csesar." 39 



OF ALROY. 205 

" His kingdom was in the northern- 
most parts of Africa," said Rabbi Zimri, 
l( and exists to this day, if we could but 
find it." 

" Ay, truly," added Rabbi Maimon, 
" the sceptre has never departed out of 
Judah ; and he rode always upon a white 
elephant." 

" Covered with cloth of gold," added 
Rabbi Zimri. 

" And he visited the Tombs of the 
Kings ?" 40 inquired Alroy. 

" Without doubt," said Rabbi Maimon. 
" The whole account is in the Talmud." 

" And no one can now find them ?" 

■" No one," replied Rabbi Zimri ; " but 
according to that learned Doctor, Moses 
Hallevy, they are in a valley in the Moun- 
tains of Lebanon, which was sealed up by 
the Archangel Michael." 

" The illustrious Doctor Abarbanel, of 



206 THE WONDROUS TALE 

Babylon/' said Rabbi Maimon, "gives 
one hundred and twenty reasons in his 
commentary on the Gemara to prove that 
they sunk under the earth at the taking 
of the Temple." 

" No one reasons like Abarbanel of 
Babylon," said Rabbi Zimri. 

" The great Rabbi Akiba, of Punde- 
bita, has answered them all/' said Rabbi 
Maimon, " and holds that they were 
taken up to Heaven." 

" And which is right ?" inquired Rabbi 
Zimri. 

" Neither," said Rabbi Maimon. 

" One hundred and twenty reasons 
are strong proof," said Rabbi Zimri. 

"The most learned and illustrious 
Doctor Aaron Mendola, of Granada," said 
Rabbi Maimon, " has shown that we 
must look for the tombs of the kings in 
the south of Spain/' 



OF ALROY. 207 

" All that Mendola writes is worth at- 
tention," said Rabbi Zimri. 

" Rabbi Hillel, 41 of Samaria, is worth two 
Mendolas any day," said Rabbi Maimon. 

" 'Tis a most learned Doctor," said 
Rabbi Zimri; " and what thinks he ?" 

" Hillel proves that there are two 
Tombs of the Kings," said Rabbi Maimon* 
" and that neither of them are the right 



ones." 



" What a learned Doctor !" exclaimed 
Rabbi Zimri. 

" And very satisfactory/' remarked 
Alrov. 

" These are high subjects," continued 
Maimon, his blear eyes twinkling with 
complacency. " Your guest, Rabbi 
Zimri, must read the treatise of the 
learned Shimei, of Damascus, on ' Effect- 
ing impossibilities/ " 

" That is a work !" exclaimed Zimri. 



208 THE WONDROUS TALE 

" I never slept for three nights after 
reading that work/' zaid Rabbi Maimon. 
"It contains twelve thousand five hun- 
dred and thirty-seven quotations from 
the Pentateuch, and not a single original 
observation ." 

" There were giants in those days," said 
Zimri ; u we are children now." 

'* The first chapter makes equal sense, 
read backward or forward," continued 
Rabbi Maimon. 

" Ichabod !" exclaimed Rabbi Zimri. 

" And the initial letter of every sec- 
tion is a cabalistical type of a king of 
Judah !" 

" The temple will yet be built," said 
Rabbi Zimri. 

" Ay, ay ! that is learning !" exclaimed 
Rabbi Maimon ; " but what is the great 
Treatise on Effecting Impossibilities to 
that profound, admirable, and — "

"Holy Rabbi !" said a youthful reader 
of the synagogue, who now entered, " the 
hour is at hand." 

" You don't say so ! Learned Mai- 
mon, I must to the synagogue. I could 
sit here all day listening to you. Come, 
David, the people await us." 

Zimri and Alroy quitted the house, and 
proceeded along the narrow hilly streets 
to the chief temple of the Hebrews 

" It grieves the venerable Maimon 
much that he cannot join us/' said Rabbi 
Zimri. " You have doubtless heard of 
him at Bagdad ; a most learned doctor/' 

Alroy bowed in silence. 

" He bears his years w r ell. You would 
hardly believe that he was my master." 

" I perceive that you inherit much of 
his erudition." 

" You are kind. If he have breathed 



210 THE WONDROUS TALE 

one year, Rabbi Maimon will be a hun- 
dred and ten next Passover." 

" I doubt it not." 

" When he is gathered to his fathers, a 
great light will be extinguished in Israel. 
You wanted to know something about the 
Tombs of the Kings ; I told you he was 
your man. How full he was ! His mind, 
sir, is an egg" 

" A somewhat ancient one. I fear his 
guidance will hardly bring me the en- 
viable fortune of King Pirgandicus." 

" Between ourselves, good David, talk- 
ing of King Pirgandicus, I cannot help 
fancying that the learned Maimon made 
a slight mistake. I hold Pirgandicus 
was only a prince. It was after the Cap- 
tivity, and I know no authority for any 
of our rulers since the destruction, as- 
suming a higher title. Clearly a prince, 



OF ALROY. 211 

eh ? But, though I would whisper it to 
no one but you, I think our worthy friend 
grows a little old. We should remember 
his years, sir. A hundred and ten next 
passover. 'Tis a great burthen." 

" Ay ! with his learning added, a very 
fearful burthen, indeed !" 

st You have been a week in Jerusalem, 
and have not yet visited our synagogue. 
It is not of cedar and ivory, but it is still 
a temple. This way. Is it only a week 
that you have been here ? Why, you 
look another man ! I shall never forget 
our first meeting : you did not know me. 
That was good, eh ? And when I told 
you I was the chief Rabbi Zimri,howyou 
changed ! You have quite regained your 
appetite. Ah ! 'tis pleasant to mix once 
more with our own people. To the left. 
So ! we must descend a little. We hold 



212 THE WONDROUS TALE 

our meeting's in an ancient cemetery. 
You have a finer temple, I warrant me, 
in Bagdad. Jerusalem is not Bagdad. 
But this has its conveniences. 'Tis safe, 
and we are not very rich, nor wish to 
seem so."

IV. 



A long passage brought them to a num- 
ber of small, square, low chambers, lead- 
ing into each other. 42 They were lighted 
by brass lamps, placed at intervals in 
vacant niches, that once held corpses, 
and which were now soiled by the smoky 
flame. Between two and three hundred 
individuals were assembled in these cham- 
bers, at first scarcely distinguishable by 
those who descended from the broad day- 



OF ALROY. 213 

light : but by degrees the eyesight became 
accustomed to the dim and vaporous at- 
mosphere, and Alroy recognized in the 
final and more illumined chamber a high 
cedar cabinet, the type of the ark, and 
which held the sacred vessels, and the 
sanctified copy of the law. 

Standing in lines, with their heads mys- 
tically covered, 43 the forlorn remnant of 
Israel, captives in their ancient city, 
avowed, in spite of all their sufferings, 
their fidelity to their God, and notwith- 
standing all the bitterness of hope de- 
layed, their faith in the fulfilment of his 
promises. Their simple service was com- 
pleted, their prayers were read, their 
responses made, their law exhibited, and 
their charitable offerings announced by 
their High Priest. After the service, the 
venerable Zimri, opening a volume of the 



214 THE WONDROUS TALE 

Talmud, and fortified by the opinions of 
all these illustrious and learned doctors, 
the heroes of his erudite conversations 
with the aged Maimon, expounded the 
law to the congregation of the people. 44 

" It is written/' said the Rabbi, " 'thou 
shalt have none other God but me.' 
Now know ye what our father Abraham 
said when Nimrod ordered him to worship 
fire ? ' Why not water,' answered Abra- 
ham, ' which can put out fire? why not the 
clouds, which can pour forth water ? why 
not the winds, which can produce clouds ? 
why not God, which can create winds ?' ' 

A murmur of approbation sounded 
throughout the congregation. 

Ci Eliezer," said Zimri, addressing him- 
self to a young Rabbi, " it is written, 
that he took a rib from Adam when he 
was asleep. Is God then a robber ?" 



OF ALROY. 215 

The young Rabbi looked puzzled, and 
cast his eyes on the ground. The con- 
gregation was very perplexed and a little 
alarmed. 

ff Is there no answer ?" said Zimri. 

" Rabbi," said a stranger, a tall, swar- 
thy African pilgrim, standing in a cor- 
ner, and enveloped in a red mantle, over 
which a lamp threw a flickering light. 
" Rabbi, some robbers broke into my 
house last night, and stole an earthen 
pipkin, but they left a golden vase in its 
stead/' 

"It is well said, it is well said," ex- 
claimed the congregation. The applause 
w T as loud. 

" Learned Zimri," continued the Afri- 
can, " it is written in the Gemara, that 
there was a youth in Jerusalem who fell 
in love with a beautiful damsel, and she 



21 6 THE WONDROUS TALE 

scorned him. And the youth was so 
stricken with his passion that he could 
not speak ; but when he beheld her, he 
looked at her imploringly, and she laugh- 
ed. And one day the youth, not know- 
ing what to do with himself, went out 
into the desart; and towards night he 
returned home, but the gates of the city 
were shut. And he went down into the 
valley of Jehosaphat, and entered the 
tomb of Absalom and slept ; 45 and he 
dreamed a dream : and next morning he 
came into the city smiling. And the 
maiden met him, and she said, c Is that 
thou ; art thou a laugher >' And he an- 
swered, ' Behold, yesterday being dis- 
consolate, I went out of the city into the 
desart, and I returned home, and the 
gates of the city were shut, and I went 
down into the valley of Jehosaphat, and 



OF ALROY. 217 

I entered the tomb of Absalom, and I 
slept, and I dreamed a dream, and ever 
since then I have laughed/ And the 
damsel said, ( Tell me thy dream/ And 
he answered and said, e I may not tell 
my dream only to my wife, for it regards 
her honour/ And the maiden grew sad 
and curious, and said, ' I am thy wife, 
tell me thy dream/ And straightforth 
they went and were married, and ever 
after they both laughed/ Now, learned 
Zimri, what means this tale, an idle jest 
for a master of the law, yet it is written 
by the greatest Doctor of the Captivity?" 

" It passeth my comprehension/' said 
the chief Rabbi. 

Rabbi Eliezer was silent ; the congre- 
gation groaned. 

" Now hear the interpretation," said 
the African. " The youth is our people 

VOL. I. L 



218 THE WONDROUS TALE 

and the damsel is our lost Sion, and the 
tomb of Absalom proves that salvation 
can only come from the house of David. 
Dost thou hear this, young man ?" said 
the African, coming forward, and laying 
his hand on Alroy, € ' I speak to thee, be- 
cause I have observed a deep attention in 
thy conduct/* 

The Prince of the Captivity started, 
and shot a glance at the dark visage be- 
fore him, but the glance read nothing. 
The upper part of the countenance of the 
African was half concealed by masses of 
dark matted hair, and the lower by his 
uncouth robes. A flashing eye was its 
only characteristic, which darted forth 
like lightning out of a black cloud. 

" Is my attention the only reason that 
induces you to address me ?" inquired 
Alroy. 



OF ALROY. 219 

" Whoever gave all his reasons ?" re- 
plied the African, with a laughing 
sneer. 

? I seek not to learn them. Suffice it, 
stranger, that how much soever you may 
mean, as much I can understand." 

e< Tis well : learned Zimri, is this thy 
pupil ? I congratulate thee. I will match 
him against the hopeful Eliezer." So 
saying, the lofty African stalked out of 
the chamber. The assembly also broke 
up. Alroy would willingly have imme- 
diately followed the African, and held 
some further and more private conversa- 
tion with him; but some minutes elapsed, 
owing to the officious attentions of Zimri, 
before he could escape ; and when he did, 
his search after the stranger was vain. 
He inquired among the congregation, but 
none knew the African. He was no 

l 2 



220 THE WONDROUS TALE 

man's guest, and no man's debtor, and 
apparently had never before been seen. 



V. 



The trumpet was sounding to close the 
gates, as Alroy passed the Sion entrance. 
The temptation was irresistible. He 
rushed out, and ran for more than one 
hundred yards without looking back, and 
when he did, he had the satisfaction of 
ascertaining that he was fairly shut out 
for the night. The Sun had set, still the 
Mount of Olives was flushed with the 
reflection of his dying beams, but Jeho- 
saphat at its feet was in deep shadow. 

He wandered among the mountains for 
some time, beholding Jerusalem from a 
hundred different points of view, and 



OF ALROY. 221 

watching* the single planets and cluster- 
ing* constellations that gradually burst 
into beauty or gathered into light. At 
length, somewhat exhausted, he descend- 
ed into the vale. The scanty rill of Siloah 46 
looked like a thread of silver winding in 
the moonlight. Some houseless wretches 
were slumbering' under the arch of its 
fountain. Several isolated tombs of con- 
siderable size 47 rose at the base of Olivet, 
and into the largest of these Alroy en- 
tered. He entered through a narrow pas- 
sage into a small square chamber. On 
each side was an empty sarcophagus of 
granite, one with its lid broken . Between 
these the Prince of the Captivity laid his 
robe, and, wearied by his ramble, soon 
soundly slept. 

After some hours he woke He fancied 
that he had been wakened by the sound 



222 THE WONDROUS TALE 

of voices. The chamber was not quite 
dark. A straggling moonbeam fought its 
way through an open fret-work pattern 
in the top of the tomb, and just revealed 
the dim interior. Suddenly a voice spoke 
— a strange and singular voice. 

" Brother, brother, the sounds of the 
night begin." 

Another voice answered, 

(( Brother, brother, I hear them, too." 

" The woman in labour \" 

-The thief at his craft!" 

" The sentinel's challenge !" 

" The murderer's step !" 

iC Oh ! the merry sounds of the night !" 

" Brother, brother, let us come forth 
and wander about the world." 

i( We have seen all things. I'll lie 
here and listen to the baying hound. 
Tis music for a tomb." 



OF ALROY. 223 

" Choice and rare. You are idle. I 
like to sport in the starry air. Our hours 
are few, they should be fair." 

" What shall we see, Heaven or Earth ?" 

" Hell for me, 'tis more amusing-/' 

" As for me, I am sick of Hades. » 

" Let us visit Solomon !" 

" In his unknown metropolis ?" 

" That will be rare." 

u But where, oh ! where ?" 

" Even a spirit cannot tell. But they 
say, but they say — I dare not whisper 
what they say." 

" Who told you ?" 

" No one. I overheard an Afrite whisp- 
ering to a female Ghoul he wanted to 
seduce." 

" Hah, hah ! hah, hah ! choice pair, 
choice pair ! We are more etherial." 

" She was a beauty in her way. Her 



224 THE WONDROUS TALE 

eyes were luminous, though somewhat 
dank, and her cheek tinged with carna- 
tion caught from infant blood/' 

" Oh ! gay, oh ! gay ; what said 
they ?" 

" He was a deserter without leave from 
Solomon's body-guard. The trull wrig- 
gled the secret out." 

" Tell me, kind brother." 

" 111 show, not tell/" 

" I pr'ythee tell me. 55 

" Well, then, well. In Genthesma's 
gloomy cave there is a river none has 
reached, and you must sail, and you must 
sail Brother !" 

" Ay." 

" Methinks I smell something too 
earthly." 

" What's that ?" 

" The breath of man/'

66 Scent more fatal than the morning 
air ! Away, away !"

In the range of mountains that lead 
from Olivet to the river Jordan is the 
great cavern of Genthesma, a mighty 
excavation formed by the combined and 
immemorial work of Nature and of Art. 
For on the high basaltic columns are cut 
strange characters and unearthly forms/ 8 
and in many places the natural ornaments 
have been completed by the hands of the 
sculptor into symmetrical entablatures 
and fanciful capitals. The work, they 
say, of captive Dives and conquered 
Afrites, for the great king. 

It was midnight ; the cold full moon 

L 5 



226 THE WONDROUS TALE 

showered its brilliancy upon this narrow 
valley, shut in on all sides by black and 
barren mountains. A single being stood 
at the entrance of the cave. 

It was Alroy. Desperate and deter- 
mined, after listening to the two spirits 
in the tomb, he was resolved to penetrate 
the mysteries of Genthesma. He took 
from his girdle a flint and steel, with 
which he lighted a torch and then he 
entered. 

The cavern narrowed as he cautiously 
advanced, and soon he found himself at 
the head of an evidently artificial gallery. 
A crowd of bats rushed forward and ex- 
tinguished his torch. 49 He leant down to 
relight it, and in so doing observed that 
he trod upon an artificial pavement. 

The gallery was of great extent, with a 
gradual declination. 50 Being in a straight 



OF ALROY. 227 

line with the mouth of the cavern, 
the moonlit scene was lon£ visible, but 
Alroy on looking round now perceived 
that the exterior was shut out by the 
eminence that he had left behind him. 
The sides of the gallery were covered 
with strange and sculptured forms. 

The Prince of the Captivity proceeded 
along this gallery for nearly two hours. 
A distant murmur of falling water, which 
might have been distinguished nearly from 
the first, increased in sound as he advanced, 
and now, from the loud roar and dash at 
hand, he felt that he was on the brink of 
some cataract. It was very dark. His 
heart trembled. He felt his footing ere 
he ventured to advance. The spray sud- 
denly leaped forward, and extinguished 
his torch. His imminent danger filled 
him with terror, and he receded some 



228 THE WONDROUS TALE 

paces, but in vain endeavoured to re-il- 
lumine his torch, which was soaked with 
the water. 

His courage deserted him . Energy and 
exertion seemed hopeless. He was about 
to deliver himself up to despair, when an 
expanding lustre attracted his attention 
in the opposing gloom. 

A small and bright red cloud seemed 
sailing towards him. It opened, dis- 
charged from its bosom a silvery star, 
and dissolved again into darkness. But 
the star remained, the silvery star, and 
threw a long line of tremulous light upon 
the vast and raging rapid, which now, 
fleet and foaming, revealed itself on all 
sides to the eye of Alroy. 

The beautiful interposition in his fa- 
vour re-animated the adventurous pil- 
grim. A dark shadow in the fore- 



OF ALROY. 229 

ground, breaking the line of light shed 
by the star upon the waters, attracted his 
attention. He advanced, regained his 
former footing, and more nearly examined 
it. It was a boat, and in the boat, mute 
and immovable, sat one of those vast, sin- 
gular, and hideous forms, which he had 
observed sculptured on the walls of the 
gallery. 

David Alroy, committing his fortunes 
to the God of Israel, leapt into the boat. 



VII. 

And at the same moment the Afrite, 51 
for it was one of those dread beings, 
raised the oars, and the boat moved. The 
falling waters suddenly parted in the 
long line of the star's reflection, and the 



230 THE WONDROUS TALE 

barque glided through their high and 
severed masses. 

In this wise they proceeded for a few 
minutes, until they entered a beautiful 
and moonlit lake. In the distance was 
a mountainous country. Alroy examined 
his companion with a feeling of curiosity 
not unmixed with terror. It was re- 
markable that Alroy could never succeed 
in any way attracting his notice. The 
Afrite seemed totally unconscious of the 
presence of his passenger. At length 
the boat reached the opposite shore of 
the lake, and the Prince of the Captivity 
disembarked. 

He disembarked at the head of an 
avenue of colossal lions of red granite 52 
which extended far as the eye could 
reach, and which ascended the side of 
the mountain, which was cut into a flight 



OF ALROY. 231 

of magnificent steps. The easy ascent 
was in consequence soon accomplished, 
and Alroy proceeding along the avenue 
of lions, soon gained the summit of the 
mountain. 

To his infinite astonishment, he beheld 
Jerusalem. That strongly-marked locality 
could not be mistaken : at his feet was 
Jehosaphat, Kedron, Siloah : he stood 
upon Olivet ; before him was Sion. But 
in all other respects, how different was 
the landscape to the one he had gazed 
upon a few days back, for the first time ! 
The surrounding hills sparkled with vine- 
yards, and glowed with summer palaces, 
and voluptuous pavilions, and glorious 
gardens of pleasure. The city, extend- 
ing all over Mount Sion, was encompassed 
with a wall of white marble, with battle- 
ments of gold, a gorgeous mass of gates 



232 THE WONDROUS TALE 

and pillars, and gardened terraces, lofty 
piles of rarest materials, cedar, and ivory, 
and precious stones, and costly columns 
of the richest workmanship, and the most 
fanciful orders, capitals of the lotus and 
the palm, and flowing friezes of the olive 
and the vine. 

And in the front a mighty Temple 
rose, with inspiration in its very form, 
a Temple so vast, so sumptuous, there 
required no priest to tell us that no 
human hand planned that sublime mag- 
nificence ! 

" God of my fathers !" said Alroy, " I 
am a poor, weak thing, and my life has 
been a life of dreams and visions, and I 
have sometimes thought my brain lacked 
a sufficient master — where am I ? Do 
I sleep or live ? Am I a slumberer or a 
ghost ? This trial is too much." He 



OF ALROY. 233 

sank down, and hid his face in his hands : 
his over-exerted mind appeared to desert 
him ; he wept hysterically. 

Many minutes elapsed before Alroy 
grew composed. His wild bursts of weep- 
ing sank into sobs, and the sobs died off 
into sighs. And at length, calm from 
exhaustion, he again looked up, and lo ! the 
glorious city was no more ! Before him 
was a moon-lit plain, over which the 
avenue of lions still advanced, and ap- 
peared to terminate only in the moun- 
tainous distance. 

This limit, the Prince of the Captivity 
at length reached, and stood before 
a stupendous portal, cut out of the solid 
rock, four hundred feet in height, and 
supported by clusters of colossal Cary- 
atides. 53 Upon the portal were engraven 
some Hebrew characters, which, upon 



234 THE WONDROUS TALE 

examination, proved to be the same as 
those upon the talisman of Jabaster. And 
so taking from his bosom that all-precious 
and long-cherished deposit, David Alroy, 
in obedience to his instructions, pressed 
the signet against the gigantic portal. 

The portal opened with a crash of 
thunder louder than an earthquake. Pale, 
panting, and staggering, the Prince of 
the Captivity entered an illimitable hall, 
illumined by pendulous and stupendous 
balls of glowing metal. On each side of 
the hall, sitting on golden thrones, was 
ranged a line of kings, and as the pilgrim 
entered, the monarchs rose, and took off 
their diadems, and waved them thrice, 
and thrice repeated, in solemn chorus, 
" All hail, Alroy ! Hail to thee, brother 
King. Thy crown awaits thee !" 

The Prince of the Captivity stood 



OF ALROY. 235 

trembling, with his eyes fixed upon the 
ground, $nd leaning breathless against 
a column. And when at length he had 
a little recovered himself, and dared again 
to look up, he found the monarchs were 
reseated ; and, from their still and vacant 
visages, apparently unconscious of his 
presence. And this emboldened him, 
and so staring alternately at each side of 
the hall, but with a firm, perhaps des- 
perate step, Alroy advanced. 

And he came to two thrones which 
were set apart from the others in the 
middle of the hall. On one was seated a 
noble figure, far above the common 
stature, with arms folded and downcast 
eyes. His feet rested upon a broken 
sword, and a shivered sceptre, which told 
he was a monarch, in spite of his dis- 
crowned head. 



236 THE WONDROUS TALE 

And on the opposite throne was a ve- 
nerable personage, with a long flowing 
beard, and dressed in white raiment. 
His countenance was beautiful, although 
ancient. Age had stole on without its 
imperfections, and Time had only in- 
vested it with a sweet dignity and solemn 
grace. The countenance of the King 
was upraised with a seraphic gaze, and 
as he thus looked up on high, with eyes 
full of love, and thanksgiving, and praise, 
his consecrated fingers seemed to touch 
the trembling wires of a golden harp. 

And further on, and far above the rest, 
upon a throne that stretched across the 
hall, a most imperial presence straight- 
way flashed upon the startled vision of 
Alroy. Fifty steps of ivory, and each 
step guarded by golden lions, 54 led to a 
throne of jasper. A dazzling light blazed 



OF ALROY. 237 

forth from the glittering diadem and 
radiant countenance of him who sat upon 
the throne — one beautiful as a woman, 
but with the majesty of a god. And in 
one hand he held a seal, and in the other 
a sceptre. 

And when Alroy had reached the foot 
of the throne, he stopped, and his heart 
misgave him. And he prayed for some 
minutes in silent devotion, and without 
daring to look up, he mounted the first 
step of the throne, and the second, and 
the third, and so on, with slow and 
faltering feet, until he reached the forty- 
ninth step. 

The Prince of the Captivity raised his 
eyes. He stood before the monarch face 
to face. In vain Alroy attempted to at- 
tract his attention, or to fix his gaze. 
The large black eyes, full of supernatural 



i 



238 THE WONDROUS TALE 

lustre, appeared capable of piercing all 
things, and illuminating all things, but 
they flashed on without shedding a ray 
upon Alroy. 

Pale as a spectre, the pilgrim, whose 
pilgrimage seemed now on the point of 
completion, stood cold and trembling be- 
fore the object of all his desires, and all 
his labours. But he thought of his 
country, his people, and his God, and 
while his noiseless lips breathed the name 
of Jehovah, solemnly he put forth his 
arm, and with a gentle firmness grasped 
the unresisting sceptre of his great an- 
cestor. 

And as he seized it, the whole scene 
vanished from his sight ! 



OF ALROY. 239 



VIII. 

Hours or years might have passed 
away, as far as the sufferer was con- 
cerned, when Alroy again returned to 
self-consciousness. His eyes slowly open- 
ed, he cast around a vacant stare, he was 
lying in the Cavern of Genthesma. The 
moon had set, but the morn had not 
broken. A single star glittered over the 
brow of the black mountains. He faintly 
moved his limbs, he would have raised 
his hand to his bewildered brain, but 
found that it grasped a sceptre. The 
memory of the past returned to him. 
He tried to rise, and found that he was 



240 



THE WONDROUS TALE 



reposing in the arms of a human being. 
He turned his head— he met the anxious 
gaze of Jabaster !

people, a fragile remnant, nevertheless a 
people, dispersed, or what is worse. I 
have wept for them, although no tear of 
selfish grief has tinged this withered 
cheek. And were I but alone— ay ! 
there's the pang. The solace of my 
days is now my sorrow." 

" Weep not for me, dear uncle. Ra- 
ther let us pray our God will not desert 
us." 

" We know not when we are well. 
Our hours stole tranquilly along, and 
then we murmured. Prospering, we 
murmured, and now we are rightly 
stricken. The legend of the past is 
Israel's bane. The past is a dream ; and 
in the waking present we should discard 
the enervating shadow. Why would we 
be free ? We murmured against cap-

tivity. This is captivity : this damp, 
dim cell, where we are brought to die. 

" Oh ! Youth, rash Youth, thy being- 
is Destruction. But yesterday a child — 
it seems but yesterday I nursed him in 
these arms, a thoughtless child — and now 
our house has fallen by his deeds. I'll 
not think of it ; 'twill make me mad." 

" Uncle, dearest, dearest uncle, we 
have lived together, and we will die to- 
gether, and both in love : but, but, I 
pray you,— speak no harsh word of 
David." 

" Shall I praise him ?" 

" Say nothing. What he has done, 
if done in grief, has been done all in 
honour. Would you that he had spared 
Alschiroch ?" 

" Never ! I would have struck him 
myself. Brave boy, he did his duty, and

wink behind his back and call him nig-

trial ? Was my treasure spared to save 
my people ? Did I shrink from all the 
toil and trouble of that time ? A trying 
time, my Miriam, but compared with 
this, the building of the Temple." 

" You were then what you have ever 
been, the best and wisest. And since our 
fathers' God did not desert us, even in 
that wilderness of wildest woe, I offer 
gratitude in present faith, and pay him 
for past mercies by my prayers for 
more." 

"Well, well; life must end. The 
hour approaches when we must meet our 
rulers and mock trial ; precious justice 
that begins in threats and ends in tor- 
ture. You are silent, Miriam."

" I am speaking* to my God/' 

" What is that noise ? A figure moves 
behind the dusky grate. Our gaoler. 
No, no, it is Caleb ! Faithful child, I 
fear you have perilled much." 

" I enter with authority, my Lord, 
and bear good tidings." 

" He smiles ! Is't possible ? Speak 
on, speak on !" 

" Alroy has captured the Harem of our 
governor, as they journeyed from Bagdad 
to this city, guarded by his choicest 
troops. And he has sent to offer that 
they shall be exchanged for you and for 
your household. And Hassan has an- 
swered that his women shall owe their 
freedom to nothing but his sword. But 
in the meantime it is agreed between him 
and the messenger of your nephew, that 
both companies of prisoners shall be

treated with all becoming' courtesy. 
You, therefore, are remanded to your 
palace, and the trumpet is now sounding 
before the great mosque to summon all 
the host against Alroy, whom Hassan has 
vowed to bring to Hamadan dead or 
alive." 

" The harem of the governor, guarded 
too by his choicest troops. Tis a great 
deed. He did remember us. Faithful 
boy ! The harem of the governor ! — his 
choicest troops ! 'Tis a very great deed. 
Methinks the Lord is with him. He has 
his great father's heart. Only think of 
David — a child ! I nursed him — often. 
Caleb ! Can this be David, our David, 
a child, a girl ! Yet he struck Alschiroch ! 
Miriam ! where is she ? Worthy Caleb, 
look to your mistress; she has fallen. 
Dead, quite dead. Fetch water. 'Tis

palace soon. The harem of the gover- 
nor ! I can't believe it. Sprinkle, 
sprinkle. David take them prisoners ! 
Why, when they pass, we are obliged to 
turn our heads, and dare not look. More 
water : Til rub her hand. Tis warmer ! 
Her eyes open ! Miriam, choice news, 
my darling ! The harem of the gover-

" Once more within our walls, Caleb. 
Life is a miracle. I feel young again. 
This is home ; and yet I am a prisoner. 
You said the host were assembling ; he 
can have no chance. Think you, Caleb, 
he has any chance ? I hope he will die. 



248 THE WONDROUS TALE 

I would not have him taken. I fear their 
tortures. We will die too ; we will all 
die. Now I am out of that dungeon, 
methinks I even could fight. Is it true 
that he has joined with robbers ?" 

" I saw the messenger, and learnt that 
he first repaired to some bandits in the 
ruins in the desart. He had become ac- 
quainted with them in his pilgrimage. 
They say their leader is one of our 
people." 

" I am glad of that. He can eat with 
him. I would not have him eat unclean 
things with the Ishmaelites. ,, 

" Lord, sir ! our people gather to him 
from all quarters. Tis said Jabaster, the 
great Cabalist, has joined him from the 
mountains with ten thousand men." 

" The great Jabaster ! then there is 
some chance. I know Jabaster well. He

is too wise to join a desperate cause. Ar't 
sure about Jabaster ? Tis a great name, 
a very potent spirit. I have heard such 
things of that Jabaster, sir, would make 
you stare like Saul before the spirit ! 
Only think of our David, Caleb, making 
all this noise ! I am full of hope. I feel 
not like a prisoner. He beat the Harem 
guard, and now he has got Jabaster, 
he will beat them all." 

" The messenger told me he captured 
the Harem only to free his uncle and his 
sister." 

" He ever loved me ; I have done my 
duty to him ; I think I have. Jabaster ! 
why, man, the name is a spell ! There are 
men at Bagdad who will get up in the 
night to join Jabaster. I hope David will 
follow his counsels in all things. I would

" Gentle Rachel, I fear I trouble you ; 
sweet Beruna, I thank you for your zeal. 
I am better now ; the shock was great. 
These are strange tidings, maidens." 

" Yes, dear lady ! who would have 
thought of your brother turning out a 
captain ?" 

" I am sure I always thought he was 
the quietest person in the world/' said 
Beruna, " though he did kill Alschiroch." 

" One could never get a word out of 
him," said Rachel. 

" He was always moping alone/' said 
Beruna. 

" And when one spoke to him he 
always turned away," said Leah.

" Or blushed/' added Imra. 

" Well, for my part," said the beauti- 
ful Bathsheba, " I always thought Prince 
David was a genius. He had such beau- 
tiful eyes !" 

(( I hope he will conquer Hassan/' said 
Rachel. 

" So do I" said Beruna. 

" I wonder what he has done with the 
Harem/' said Leah. 

" I don't think he will dare to speak to 
them/' said Imra. 

" You are very much mistaken/' said 
Bathsheba. 

" Hark !" said Miriam. 

" Tis Hassan/' said Bathsheba ; "may 
he never return !'' 

The wild drum of the Seljuks sounded, 
then a flourish of their fierce trumpets, 
and soon the tramp of horse. Behind the 



OF ALROY. 253 

blinds of their chamber, Miriam and her 
maidens beheld the magnificent troop of 
turbaned horsemen, who, glittering* with 
splendid armour and bright shawls, and 
proudly bounding on their fiery steeds, 
now went forth to crush and conquer 
the only hope of Israel. Upon an Arab, 
darker than night, rode the superb Has- 
san, and as he passed the dwelling of his 
late prisoners, whether from the exulting 
anticipation of coming triumph, or from 
a soft suspicion that, behind that lattice, 
bright eyes and brilliant faces were gazing 
on his state, the haughty but handsome 
Seljuk flourished his scimetar over his 
head, as he threw his managed steed into 
attitudes that developed the skill of its 
rider. 

" He is handsomer than Alschiroch," 
said Rachel.

" His scimetar was like lightning," said 
Leah. 

" And his steed like thunder/ 5 said

Bathsheba. 

" Lord, remember David!" exclaimed 
Miriam; " and all his afflictions \" 



IV. 



The deserted city of the wilderness 
presented a very different appearance to 
that which met the astonished gaze of 
Alroy when he first beheld its noble tur- 
rets, and wandered in its silent streets of 
palaces. 

Without the gates was pitched a nu- 



OF ALROY. 255 

merous camp of those low black tents 
common among the Kourds and Turk- 
mans ; the principal street was full of 
busy groups engaged in all the prepara- 
tions of warfare, and all the bustling ex- 
pedients of an irregular and adventurous 
life ; steeds were stalled in ruined cham- 
bers, and tall camels raised their still 
visages among the clustering columns, or 
crouched in kneeling tranquillity amid 
fallen statues and prostrate obelisks. 

Two months had scarcely elapsed since 
Alroy and Jabaster had sought Scherirah 
in his haunt, and announced to him their 
sacred mission. The callous heart of 
him, whose "mother was a Jewess," had 
yielded to their inspired annunciations. 
He embraced their cause with all the fer- 
vour of conversion, and his motley band 
were not long sceptical of a creed which, 



Q56 THE WONDROUS TALE 

while it assuredly offered danger and ad- 
venture, held out the prospects of wealth 
and even empire. From the city of the 
wilderness the new Messiah sent forth his 
messengers to the neighbouring cities to 
announce his advent to his brethren in 
captivity. The Hebrews, a proud and 
stiff-necked race, ever prone to rebellion, 
received the announcement of their fa- 
vourite Prince with transport. The de- 
scendant of David, and the slayer of 
Alschiroch, had double claims upon their 
confidence and allegiance, and the flower 
of the Hebrew youth in the neighbouring 
cities of the Caliphate repaired in crowds 
to pay their homage to the recovered 
sceptre of Solomon. 

The affair was at first treated by the 
government with contempt, and the sul- 
tan of the Seljuks contented himself with 



OF ALROY. 257 

setting a price upon the head of the mur- 
derer of his brother ; but when several 
cities had been placed under contribu- 
tion, and more than one Moslemin cara- 
van stopped and plundered in the name 
of the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 
Jacob, orders were despatched from Bag- 
dad to the new governor of Hamadan, 
Hassan Subah, to suppress the robbers, 
or the rebels, and to send David Alroy 
dead or alive to the capital. 

The Hebrew malcontents were well ap- 
prised by their less adventurous, but still 
sympathizing, brethren of every thing 
that took place at the head-quarters of 
the enemy. Spies arrived on the same 
day at the city of the wilderness who in- 
formed Alroy that his uncle was thrown 
into a dungeon at Hamadan, and that a 
body of chosen troops were about to 



258 THE WONDROUS TALE 

escort a royal harem from Bagdad into 
Persia. 

Alroy attacked the escort in person, 
utterly discomfited them, and captured 
their charge. It proved to be the harem 
of the Governor of Hamadan, and if for 
a moment, the too sanguine fancy of the 
captor experienced a passing pang of dis- 
appointment, the prize at least obtained, 
as we have seen, the freedom and security 
of his dear, though distant, friends. This 
exploit precipitated the expedition which 
was preparing at Hamadan for his de- 
struction. The enraged Hassan Subah 
started from his divan, seized his sci- 
metar, and without waiting for the aux- 
iliaries he had summoned from the 
neighbouring chieftains, called to horse, 
and at the head of two thousand of the 
splendid Seljukian cavalry, hurried to 



OF ALROY. 259 

vindicate his love, and satiate his re- 
venge. 

Within the amphitheatre which he 
first entered as a prisoner, Alroy sat in 
council. On his right was Jabaster, Sche- 
rirah on his left. A youth, little his 
senior, but tall as a palm tree, and strong 
as a young lion, was the fourth captain. 
In the distance, some standing, some re- 
clining, were about fifty men completely 
armed. 

" Are the people numbered, Abner r" 
inquired Alroy of the youth. 

" Even so : three hundred effective 
horsemen, and two thousand footmen ; 
but the footmen lack arms." 

" The Lord will send them in good 
time," said Jabaster, " meanwhile let them 
continue to make javelins." 

" Trust in the Lord," murmured Sche- 



260 THE WONDROUS TALE 

rirah, bending his head, with his eyes fixed 
on the ground. 

A loud shout was heard throughout the 
city. Alroy started from his carpet. The 
messenger had returned. Pale and hag- 
gard, covered with sweat and sand, the 
faithful envoy was borne into the amphi- 
theatre almost upon the shoulders of the 
people. In vain the guard endeavoured 
to stem the passage of the multitude. 
They clambered up the tiers of arches, 
they filled the void and crumbling seats 
of the antique circus, they supported 
themselves upon each other's shoulders, 
they clung to the capitals of the lofty 
columns. The whole multitude had as- 
sembled to hear the intelligence ; the 
scene recalled the ancient purpose of 
the building, and Alroy and his fellow- 
warriors seemed like the gladiators of some 
old spectacle. 



OF ALROY. 2(31 

V Speak/* said Alroy, " speak the 
worst. No news can be bitter to those 
whom the Lord will avenge." 

f Ruler of Israel ! thus saith Hassan 
Subah," answered the messenger ; " my 
harem shall owe their freedom to nothing 
but my sword. I treat not with rebels, 
but I war not with age or woman ; and 
between Bostenay and his household on 
one side, and the prisoners of thy master 
on the other, let there be peace. Go, tell 
Alroy, I will seal it in his best blood. 
And lo ! thy uncle and thy sister are 
again in their palace." 

Alroy placed his hand for a moment 
to his eyes, and then instantly resuming 
his self-possession, he inquired as to the 
movements of the enemy. 

" I have crossed the desart on a swift 
dromedary 56 lent to me by Shelomi of the 



Q6<2 THE WONDROUS TALE 

Gate, whose heart is with our cause. I have 
not tarried, neither have I slept. Ere to- 
morrow's sunset, the Philistines will be 
here, led by Hassan Subah himself. The 
Lord of Hosts be with us ! Since we con- 
quered Canaan, Israel hath not struggled 
with such a power !" 

A murmur ran through the assembly. 
Men exchanged inquiring glances, and 
involuntarily pressed each other's arms. 

" The trial has come," said a middle- 
aged Hebrew, who had fought twenty 
years ago with Jabaster. 

" Let me die for the Ark !" said a 
young enthusiast of the band of Abner. 

" I thought we should get into a 
scrape," whispered Kisloch, the Kourd, to 
Calidas, the Indian. " What could have 
ever induced us to give up robbing in a 
quiet manner ?" 



OF ALROY. 263 

" And turn Jews !" said the Guebre, 
with a sneer. 

" Look at Scherirah," said the Negro, 
grinning. "If he is not kissing the 
sceptre of Solomon !" 

" I wish to heaven he had only hung 
Alroy the first time he met him/' said 
Calidas. 

" Sons of the Covenant !" exclaimed 
Alroy, " the Lord hath delivered them 
into our hands. To-morrow eve we 
march to Hamadan !" 

A cheer followed this exclamation. 

" It is written," said Jabaster, opening 
a volume, u e Lo ! I will defend this city, 
to save it, for mine own sake, and for my 
servant David's sake. 

" ' And it came to pass that night that 
the angel of the Lord went out, and smote 
in the camp of the Assyrians, an hundred 



264 THE WONDROUS TALE 

four score and five thousand : and when 
they arose early in the morning, behold ! 
they were all dead corpses.' 

" Now, as I was gazing upon the stars 
this morn, reading that celestial alphabet 57 
known to the true Cabalist, behold ! the 
star of the house of David and seven other 
stars moved, and met together, and 
formed into a circle. And the word they 
formed was a mystery to me ; but lo ! I 
have opened the book, and each star is 
the initial letter of each line of the 
Targum that I have now read to you. 
Therefore the fate of Sennacherib is the 
fate of Hassan Subah !" 

" Trust in him at all times, ye 
people; pour out your heart before 
him : God is a refuge for us. 
Selah r 

Suddenly a female form appeared upon 



OF ALROY. 265 

the very top of the amphitheatre, upon 
the slight remains of the uppermost tier, of 
which a solitary arch alone was left. The 
chorus instantly died away, every tongue 
was silent, every eye fixed. Hushed, mute, 
and immoveable, even Kisloch and his 
companions were appalled as they gazed 
upon Esther the Prophetess. 

Her eminent position, her imposing ac- 
tion, the flashing of her immense eyes, her 
beautiful, but awful countenance, her black 
hair, that hung almost to her knees, and 
the white light of the moon, just rising 
over the opposite side of the amphi- 
theatre, and which threw a silvery flash 
upon her form, and seemed to invest her 
with some miraculous emanation, while 
all beneath her were in deep gloom, all 
these circumstances combined, rendered 
her an object of universal interest and at-

268 THE WONDROUS TALE 

For, is it a light thing that the Lord 
should send his servant to raise up the 
tribes of Jacob, and to restore the pre- 
served of Israel ? Sing, O heavens, and 
be joyful, O earth, and break forth into 
singing, O mountains, for the Lord hath 
comforted his people, and will have mercy 
upon his afflicted !" 

She ceased, she descended the precipi- 
tous side of the amphitheatre, with rapid 
steps, vaulting from tier to tier, and 
bounding with wonderful agility from 
one mass of ruin to the other. At length 
she reached the level ; and then, foaming 
and panting, she rushed to Alroy, threw 
herself upon the ground, embraced his 
feet, and wiped off the dust from his san- 
dals with her hair. 

The assembly broke into long and loud 
acclamations of supernatural confidence,

their Messiah wave his miraculous sceptre. 
They thought of Hassan Subah and his 
Seljuks only as of victims, and of to-mor-

suppression of the sedition, in which his master had 
been so unsuccessful, he concealed himself in a cave, 
where, according to the Jewish historians, he received 
revelations, which he afterwards delivered to his 
disciples, and which they carefully preserved in the 
book called Sohar. His master Akibha, who lived 
soon after the destruction of Jerusalem, was the 
author of the famous book Jesirah, quoted by the 
Jews as of Divine authority. When Akibha was far 
advanced in life appeared the famous impostor Bar- 
chochebas, who, under the character of the Messiah, 
promised to deliver his countrymen from the power 
of the Emperor Adrian. Akibha espoused his cause, 
and afforded him the protection and support of his 
name, and an army of two hundred thousand men re- 
paired to his standard. The Romans at first slighted 
the insurrection ; but when they found the insur- 
gents spread slaughter and rapine wherever they 
came, they sent out a military force against them. 
At first, the issue of the contest was doubtful. The 
Messiah himself was not taken until the end of four 
years." — Enfield ; Philosophy of the Jews, vol. ii. 

" Two methods of instruction were in use among

secret, or esoteric. The exoteric doctrine was that 
which was openly taught the people from the law of 
Moses, and the traditions of the fathers. The eso- 
teric was that which treated of the mysteries of the 
Divine nature, and other sublime subjects, and was 
known by the name of the Cabbala. The latter was 
after the manner of the Pythagorean and Egyptian 
mysteries, taught only to certain persons, who were 
bound, under the most solemn anathema, not to 
divulge it. Concerning the miraculous origin and 
preservation of the Cabbala, the Jews relate many 
marvellous tales. They derive these mysteries from 
Adam ; and assert, that while the first man was in 
Paradise, the angel Rasiel brought him a book from 
Heaven, which contained the doctrines of heavenly 
wisdom, and that when Adam received this book, 
angels came down to him to learn its contents, but 
that he refused to admit them to the knowledge of 
sacred things entrusted to him alone ; that after the 
fall, this book was taken back into Heaven ; that 
after many prayers and tears God restored it to 
Adam, from whom it passed to Seth. In the dege- 
nerate age before the flood, this book was lost, and 
the mysteries it contained almost forgotten ; but they

were restored by special revelation to Abraham, who 
committed them to writing in the book Jezirah." — 
Vid. Enfield, vol. ii. p. 219. 

" The Hebrew word Cabala, 7 ' says Dom Calmet, 
" signifies tradition, and the Rabbins, who are named 
Cabalists, apply themselves principally to the combi- 
nation of certain words, numbers, and letters, by the 
means of which they boasted they could reveal the 
future, and penetrate the sense of the most difficult 
passages of Scripture. This science does not appear 
to have any fixed principles, but depends upon cer- 
tain ancient traditions, whence its name Cabala. 
The Cabalists have a great number of names which 
they style sacred, by means of which they raise spirits, 
and affect to obtain supernatural intelligence." — See 
Calmet, art. Cabala. 

" We spake before,' 1 says Lightfoot, " of the com- 
monness of Magick among them, one singular means 
whereby they kept their own in delusion, and where- 
by they affronted ours. The general expectation of 
the nation of Messias coming when he did, had this 
double and contrary effect, that it forwarded those that 
belonged to God to believe and receive the Gospel ; 
and those that did not, it gave encouragement to some to 



NOTES. 281 

take upon them they were Christ, or some great pro- 
phet, and to others it gave some persuasion to be de- 
luded by them. These deceivers dealt most of them 
with Magick, and that cheat ended not when Jeru- 
salem ended, though one would have thought that 
had been a fair term of not further expecting Mes- 
sias ; but since the people were willing to be deceived 
by such expectation, there rose up deluders still that 
were willing to deceive them." — Lightfoot, vol. ii.

The Daughter of the Voice. 
" Both the Talmudick and the latter Rabbins," 
says Lightfoot, " make frequent mention of Bath 
Kol, or Filia Vocis, or an echoing voice which served 
under the second temple for their utmost refuge of 
revelation. For when Urim and Thummim, the 
oracle was ceased, and prophecy was decayed 
and gone; they had, as they say, certain strange 
and extraordinary voices upon certain extraordinary 
occasions, which were their warnings and advertise- 
ments in some special matters. Infinite instances 
of this might be adduced, if they might be believed. 
Now here it may be questioned, why they called 
it Bath Kol, the daughter of a voice, and not a 
voice itself ? If the strictness of the Hebrew word 
Bath be to be stood upon, which always it is not, it 
may be answered, that it is called the Daughter of a 
Voice in relation to the oracles of Urim and Thummim. 
For whereas that was a voice given from off the 



NOTES. 283 

mercy seat, within the vail, and this, upon the decay 
of that oracle, came as it were in its place, it might 
not unfitly or improperly be called a daughter, or 
successor of that voice. " — Lightfoot, vol. i. p. 
485, 486.

but was indeed performed by magic art."

duced in the time of Alroy. When we consider that 
the life of an Oriental at the present day mainly 
consists in drinking coffee and smoking tobacco, we 
cannot resist from asking ourselves, " What did he 
do before either of these comparatively modern in- 
ventions was discovered ?" For a long time, I was 
inclined to suspect that tobacco might have been in 
use in Asia before it was introduced into Europe ; 
but a passage in old Sandys, in which he mentions 
the wretched tobacco smoked in Turkey, and ac- 
counts for it by that country being supplied by 
" the dregs of our markets," demonstrates, that in his 
time, there was no native growth in Asia. Yet the 
choicest tobaccos are now grown on the coast of 
Syria, the real Levant. But did the Asiatics smoke 
any other plant or substance before tobacco? In 
Syria, at the present day, they smoke a plant called 
timbac ; the Chinese smoke opium ; the artificial 
preparations for the hookah are known to all Indians. 
I believe, however, that these are all refinements, 
and for this reason, that in the classic writers, who 
were as well acquainted with the Oriental nations as 
ourselves, we find no allusion to the practice of 
smoking. The anachronism of the pipe I have not 



NOTES. 287 

therefore ventured to commit, and that of coffee will, 
I trust, be pardoned. See a short Essay on Oriental 
Smoking in the New Monthly Magazine for Septem- 
ber, 1832, for an account of the Eastern tobaccos.

style, and were then invited, under pain of death,

drink wine consecrated to idols. After long con-

sultation, the Doctors, in great tribulation, agreed to 
save their heads by accepting the last alternative, 
since the two first were forbidden by the law of 
Moses, and the last only by the Rabbins. The King 
assented, the Doctors drank the impure wine, and, as 
it was exceedingly good, drank freely. The wine, as 
will sometimes happen, created a terrible appetite ; 
the table was covered with dishes, and the Doctors, 
heated by the grape, were not sufficiently careful 
of what they partook. In short, the wicked King 
Pirgandicus contrived that they should sup off 
pork, and being carried from the table quite tipsey, 
each of the eleven had the mortification of finding 
himself next morning in the arms of a Pagan mistress. 
In the course of the year all the eleven died sudden 
deaths, and this visitation occurred to them, not 
because they had violated the law of Moses, but 
because they had believed that the precepts of the 
Rabbins could be outraged with more impunity than 
the word of God.

The Tombs of the Kings. 

The present pilgrim to Jerusalem will have less 
trouble than Alroy in discovering the Tombs of the 
Kings, though he probably would not as easily obtain 
the sceptre of Solomon. The tombs that bear this 
title are of the time of the Asmonean princes, and of a 
more ambitious character than any other of the re- 
mains. An open court about fifty feet in breadth, 
and extremely deep, is excavated out of the rock. 
One side is formed by a portico, the frieze of which 
is sculptured in a good Syro- Greek style. There is 
no grand portal ; you crawl into the tombs by a 
small opening on one of the sides. There are a few 
small chambers with niches, recesses, and sarco- 
phagi, some sculptured in the same flowing style as 
the frieze. This is the most important monument at 
Jerusalem; and Dr. Clarke, who has lavished won- 
der and admiration on the tombs of Zachariah and 
Absalom, has announced the Tombs of the Kings as 



296 NOTES. 

one of the marvellous productions of antiquity. But 
the truth is, all that we see of art in Jerusalem is 
of the most mean and contemptible character, exhibit- 
ing not the slightest feeling for the beautiful or the 
grand, and not for a moment to be mentioned with 
the creations of a neighbouring country. It is of 
course out of the question to speak of the pyramids 
of Memphis, and the obelisks of Heliopolis, the tem- 
ples of Karnak, and the palaces of Luxoor, the gi- 
gantic cavern fanes of Ipsambul, the imaginative 
Dendera, and the refined Philae : but it is not too 
much to say, that there are in many Egyptian 
towns, to which the satiated traveller cannot spare a 
parting glance, more surprising monuments than in 
all Jerusalem together ; ranges of painted sepulchres, 
in finitely more striking, from their extent and beauty, 
than the Tombs of the Kings ; and relics of temples 
which must have cost more time and treasure than the 
whole valley of Jehosaphat.

" Rabbi Hillel was one of the eminentest that ever 
was among the Jewish Doctors, both for birth, learn- 
ing, rule, and children. He was of the seed of David 
by his mother's side, being of the posterity of She- 
phatiah, the son of Abital, David's wife. He was 
brought up in Babel, from whence he came up to 
Jerusalem at forty years old, and there studied the 
law forty years more under Shemaiah and Abtalion, 
and after them he was President of the Sanhedrim 
forty years more. The beginning of his Presidency 
is generally concluded upon to have beeen just one 
hundred years before the Temple was destroyed : by 
which account, he began eight-and-twenty years be- 
fore our Saviour was born, and died when he was 
about twelve years old. He is renowned for his 
fourscore scholars." — Lightfoot, vol. ii. p. 2008.

controversies, and the fierceness of their partizans, are
