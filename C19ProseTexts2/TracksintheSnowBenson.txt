CHAPTER I 

ON the morning of the 29th of January, 1896, 
Eustace Peters was found murdered in his bed at 
his house, Grenvile Combe, in the parish of Long 
Wilton, of which I was then rector. 

Much mystery attached to the circumstances of 
his death. It was into my hands that chance threw 
the clue to this mystery, and it is for me, if for 
any one, to relate the facts. 

To the main fact of all, the death of my own 
friend on the eve, as I sometimes fancy, of a 
fuller blossoming of his powers, my writing can- 
not give the tragic import due to it, for it touched 
my own life too nearly. I had come I speak of 
myself, for they tell me a narrator must not thrust 
himself quite into the background I had come 
to Long Wilton, three years before, from a col- 
lege tutorship at Oxford, to occupy the rectory

till, as happened not long after, the son of the 
patron became qualified to hold it. Country-bred, 
fond of country people and of country pastimes, 
I had not imagined, when I came, either the diffi- 
culties of a country parson's task or the false air 
of sordidness which those difficulties would at 
first wear to me ; still less was I prepared for the 
loneliness which at first befell me in a place 
where, though many of my neighbours were wise 
men and good men, none ever showed intellect- 
ual interests or talked with any readiness of high 
things. The comradeship of Peters, who settled 
there a few months after me, did more than to 
put an end to my loneliness; by shrewd, casual 
remarks, which were always blunt and unex- 
pected but never seemed intrusive or even bore 
the semblance of advice, he had, without dream- 
ing of it for he cared very little about the things 
of the Church shown me the core of most of my 
parish difficulties and therewith the way to deal 
with them. So it was that with my growing affec- 
tion for the man there was mingled an excessive 
feeling of mental dependence upon him. So ft 
was that upon that January morning a great blank 
entered into my life. Matters full of interest, in 
my pursuits of the weeks and months that went 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 9 

before, are gone from my memory like dreams. 
My whole sojourn at Long Wilton, important as 
it was to me, is a thing dimly remembered, like a 
page of some other man's biography. Even as I 
call to mind that actual morning I cannot think 
of the immediate horror, only of the blank that 
succeeded and remains. I believe that no one, 
upon whom any like loss has come suddenly, will 
wonder if I take up my tale in a dry-eyed fashion. 
I can use no other art in telling it but that of let- 
ting the facts become known as strictly as may be 
in the order in which they became known to me. 
Eustace Peters, then, was a retired official of 
the Consular Service, and a man of varied cul- 
ture and experience too much varied, I may say. 
He had been at Oxford shortly before my time. 
I gathered from the school prizes on his library 
shelves that he went there with considerable 
promise ; but he left without taking his degree or 
accomplishing anything definite except rowing 
in his college Eight (a distinction of which I knew 
not from his lips but from his rather curious ward- 
robe). He had learnt, I should say, unusually 
little from Oxford, except its distinctive shyness, 
and had, characteristically, begun the studies of 
his later years in surroundings less conducive to 



10 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

study. He left Oxford upon getting some ap- 
pointment in the East. Whether this first appoint- 
ment was in a business house or in the Consular 
Service, where exactly it had been and what were 
the later stages of his career, I cannot tell, for he 
talked very little of himself. Evidently, how- 
ever, his Eastern life had been full of interest for 
him, and he had found unusual enjoyment in 
mingling with and observing the strange types of 
European character which he met among his 
fellow-exiles, if I may so call them. He had ulti- 
mately left the Consular Service through illness 
or some disappointment, or both. About that time 
an aunt of his died and left him the house, Gren- 
vile Combe, at Long Wilton, in which a good 
deal of his boyhood had been spent. He came 
there, as I have said, soon after my own arrival, 
and stayed on, not, as it seemed to me, from any 
settled plan. There he passed much of his time 
in long country rambles (he had been, I believe, 
a keen sportsman, and had now become a keen 
naturalist), much of it in various studies, chiefly 
philosophic or psychological. He was writing a 
book on certain questions of psychology, or, per- 
haps I should say, preparing to write it, for the 
book did not seem to me to progress. My wife 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW II 

and I were convinced that he had a love story, 
but we gathered no hint of what it may have been. 
He was forty-three when he died. 

This is, I think, all that I need now set down 
as to the personality of the murdered man. But 
I cannot forbear to add that, while his interrupted 
career and his somewhat desultory pursuits ap- 
peared inadequate to the reputation which he had 
somehow gained for ability, he certainly gave me 
the impression of preserving an uncompromis- 
ingly high standard, a keenly if fitfully penetrat- 
ing mind and a latent capacity for decisive action. 
As I write these words it occurs to me that he 
would be living now if this impression of mine had 
not been shared by a much cleverer man than I. 

On the 28th my wife was away from home, and 
I had supper at Grenvile Combe, going there 
about seven o'clock. There were three other 
guests at supper, James Callaghan, C.I.E., 
William Vane-Cartwright, and one Melchior 
Thalberg. Callaghan was an old school-fellow 
of Peters, and the two, though for years they 
must have seen each other seldom, appeared to 
have always kept up some sort of friendship. I 
knew Callaghan well by this time, for he had 
been staying three weeks at Grenvile Combe, and 



12 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

he was easy to know, or rather easy to get on 
with. I should say that I liked the man, but that 
I am seldom sure whether I like an Irishman, and 
that my wife, a far shrewder judge than I, could 
not bear him. He was a great, big-chested Irish- 
man, of the fair-haired, fresh-coloured type, with 
light blue eyes. A weather-worn and battered 
countenance (contrasting with the youthful erect- 
ness and agility of his figure), close-cut whiskers 
and a heavy greyish moustache, a great scar 
across one cheek-bone and a massive jaw, gave 
him at first a formidable appearance. The next 
moment this might seem to be belied by some- 
thing mobile about his mouth and the softness of 
his full voice ; but still he bore the aspect of a 
man prone to physical violence. He was plaus- 
ible ; very friendly (was it, one asked, a peculiarly 
loyal sort of friendliness or just the reverse); a 
copious talker by fits and starts, with a great 
wealth of picturesque observation or invention. 
Like most of my Irish acquaintance he kept one 
in doubt whether he would take an exceptionally 
high or an exceptionally low view of any matter ; 
unlike, as I think, most Irishmen, he was the pos- 
sessor of real imaginative power. He had (as I 
gathered from his abundant anecdotes) been at 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 13 

one time in the Army and later in the Indian 
Civil Service. In that service he seemed to have 
been concerned with the suppression of crime, 
and to have been lately upon the North- West 
Frontier. He was, as I then thought, at home on 
leave, but, as I have since learned, he had re- 
tired. Some notable exploit or escapade of his 
had procured him the decoration which he wore 
on every suitable and many unsuitable occasions, 
but it had also convinced superior authorities that 
he must on the first opportunity be shelved. 

Vane-Cartwright, with nothing so distinctive 
in his appearance, was obviously a more remark- 
able man. Something indescribable about him 
would, I think, if I had heard nothing of him, 
have made me pick him out as a man of much 
quiet power. He was in the City, a merchant 
(whatever that large, term may mean) who had 
formerly had something to do with the far East, 
and now had considerable dealings with Italy. 
He had acquired, I knew, quickly but with no 
whisper of dishonour, very great wealth; and he 
was about, as I gathered from some remark of 
Peters, to marry a very charming young lady, 
Miss Denison, who was then absent on the 
Riviera. He had about a fortnight before come 



14 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

down to the new hotel in our village for golf, and 
had then accidentally met Peters who was walk- 
ing with me. I understood that he had been a 
little junior to Peters at Oxford, and had since 
been acquainted with him somewhere in the East. 
Peters had asked him to dinner at his house, 
where Callaghan was already staying. I had heard 
Peters tell him that if he came to those parts 
again he must stay with him. I had not noted the 
answer, but was not surprised afterwards to find 
that Vane-Cartwright, who had returned to 
London the day after I first met him, had since 
come back rather suddenly, and this time to stay 
with Peters. He now struck me as a cultured 
man, very different from Peters in all else but 
resembling him in the curious range and variety 
of his knowledge, reserved and as a rule silent 
but incisive when he did speak. 

Thalberg, though not the most interesting of 
the company, contributed, as a matter of fact, 
the most to my enjoyment on that occasion. I 
tried hard some days later to recall my impres- 
sions of that evening, of which every petty inci- 
dent should by rights have been engraven on my 
memory, but the recollection, which, so to speak, 
put all the rest out, was that of songs by Schu* 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 15 

bert and Schumann which Thalberg sang. I 
drew him out afterwards on the subject of music, 
on which he had much to tell me, while Vane- 
Cartwright and our host were, I think, talking 
together, and Callaghan appeared to be dozing. 
Thalberg was of course a German by family, but 
he talked English as if he had been in England 
from childhood. He belonged to that race of fair, 
square-bearded and square-foreheaded German 
business men, who look so much alike to us, only 
he was smaller and looked more insignificant 
than most of them, his eyes were rather near to- 
gether, and he did not wear the spectacles of his 
nation. He told me that he was staying at the 
hotel, for golf he seemed to imply. He too was 
something in the City, and I remember having 
for some reason puzzled myself as to how Vane- 
Cartwright regarded him. 

I must at this point add some account of the 
other persons who were in or about Peters' house. 
There were two female servants in the house ; an 
elderly cook and housekeeper, Mrs. Travers, 
who was sharp-visaged and sharp-tongued, but 
who made Peters very comfortable, and a house- 
maid, Edith Summers, a plain, strong and rather 
lumpish country girl, who was both younger and 



l6 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

more intelligent than she looked. It subsequently 
appeared that these two were in the house the 
whole evening and night, and, for all that can be 
known, asleep all night in the servants' quarters, 
which formed an annex to the house connected 
with it by a short covered way. In a cottage near 
the gate into the lane lived a far more notable 
person, Reuben Trethewy, the gardener and doer 
of odd jobs, a short, sturdy, grizzled man, of 
severe countenance, not over clean. Peters was 
much attached to him for his multifarious know- 
ledge and skill. He had been a seaman at some 
time, had been, it seemed, all sorts of things in 
all sorts of places, and was emphatically a handy 
man. He was as his name implies a Cornishman, 
and had come quite recently to our neighbour- 
hood, to which in the course of a roving existence 
he was attracted by the neighbourhood of his 
uncle, Silas Trethewy, a farmer who lived some 
three miles off. He was now a man of Methodisti- 
cal professions, and most days, to do him justice, 
of Methodistical practice; but I, who was per- 
haps prejudiced against him by his hostility to 
the Church, believed him to be subject to bitter 
and sullen moods, knew that he was given to out- 
bursts of drinking, and heard from his neigh- 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 17 

hours that drink took him in a curious way, affect- 
ing neither his gait, nor his head, nor his voice, 
nor his wits, but giving him a touch of fierceness 
which made men glad to keep out of his way. 
With him lived his wife and daughter. The wife 
was, I thought, a decent woman, who kept her 
house straight and who came to church; but I 
had then no decided impression about her, though 

she had for some time taught in mv Sundav 

j * 

school, and had once or twice favoured me with 
a long letter giving her views about it. The 
daughter was a slight, childish-looking girl, 
whom I knew well, because she was about to be- 
come a pupil teacher, and who was a most un- 
likely person to play a part in a story of this kind. 
Our party that evening broke up when, about 
ten o'clock, I rose to go; and Thalberg, whose 
best way to the hotel lay through the village, 
accompanied me as far as the Rectory, which was 
a quarter of a mile off and was the nearest house 
in the village. We walked together talking of 
German poetry and what not, and I cannot forget 
the disagreeable sense which came upon me in 
the course of our talk, that a layer of stupidity or 
of hard materialism, or both, underlay the upper 
crust of culture which I had seemed to find in the 



18 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

man when we had spoken of music. However, we 
parted good friends at the Rectory gate, and I 
was just going in when I recollected some ques- 
tion about the character of a candidate for Con- 
firmation, on which I had meant to have spoken 
to Peters that night. I returned to his house and 
found him still in his library. The two guests 
who were staying in the house had already gone 
to bed. I got the information and advice which I 
had wanted it was about a wild but rather attrac- 
tive young fellow who had once looked after a 
horse which Peters had kept, but who was now 
a groom in the largest private stables in the 
neighbourhood. As I was leaving, Peters took up 
some book, saying that he was going to read in 
bed. He stood with me for a moment at the front 
door looking at the frosty starlight. It was a clear 
but bitterly cold night. I well remember telling 
him as we stood there that he must expect to be 
disturbed by unusual noises that night, as a great 
jollification was taking place at the inn up the 
road, and my parishioners, who realised the pre- 
late's aspiration for a free rather than a sober 
England, would return past his house in various 
stages of riotous exhilaration. He said that he 
had more sympathy with them than he ought to 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW IQ 

have, and that in any case they should not dis- 
turb him. Very likely, he added, he would soon 
be asleep past rousing. 

And so, about a quarter to eleven, I parted 
from him, little dreaming that no friendly eyes 
would ever meet his again. 



CHAPTER II 

I WAS up early on the 29th. Snow lay thick on 
the ground but had ceased falling, and it was 
freezing hard, when, while waiting for breakfast, 
I walked out as far as my gate on the village 
street to see what the weather was like. Sud- 
denly Peters' housemaid came running down to 
the village on her way, as it proved, to the police- 
station. Before passing she paused, and breath- 
lessly told me the news. I walked quickly to 
Peters' house. Several neighbours were already 
gathering about the gate of the drive but did not 
enter. I rang the bell, was admitted by the house- 
keeper and walked straight up to Peters' bed- 
room. Callaghan and Vane-Cartwright were there 
already, the former half-dressed, unshaved and 
haggard-looking, the latter a neat figure in bed- 
room slippers and a dressing-gown. We had only 
exchanged a few words when the police-sergeant 
entered, followed a minute or two later by a tall 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 21 

and pleasant-faced young constable, who brought 
with him the village doctor, an ambitious, up- 
to-date youth who had lately come to those 
parts. 

I have some little difficulty in saying what I 
then observed; for indeed, though I looked in- 
tently enough on the dead face and figure, and 
noticed much about them that is not to my present 
purpose, I took in for myself very little that bore 
on that problem of detection which has since in- 
terested me so much. I cannot now distinguish 
the things which I really saw upon hearing the 
others mention them from the things which I 
imagine myself seeing because I knew they were 
mentioned then or later. In fact I saw chiefly 
with the eyes of the Sergeant, who set about his 
inquiries with a quiet promptitude that surprised 
me in one whom I knew only as a burly, 
steady, slow-speaking, heavy member of the 
force. 

There was little to note about the barely fur- 
nished room which showed no traces of disorder. 
On the top of some drawers on the left of the 
bed-head lay a curious, old-fashioned gold watch 
with the watchkey by it, a pocket-knife, a pencil, 
a ring of keys and a purse, the last containing a 



22 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

good deal of money. On a small table on the 
other side of the bed stood a candlestick, the 
candle burnt to the socket; by it lay an open 
book. Under the table near the bed lay, as if it 
had fallen from the dead man's hand or off his 
bed, a book with several leaves crumpled and 
torn, as if, in his first alarm, or as he died, Peters 
had caught them in a spasmodic clutch. I looked 
to see what it was, merely from the natural wish 
to know what had occupied my friend's mind so 
near the end. It was Borrow's Bible in Spain. 
When I saw the title an indistinct recollection 
came to me of some very recent mention of the 
book by some one, and with it came a faint sense 
that it was important I should make this recollec- 
tion clear. But either I was too much stunned as 
yet to follow out the thought, or I put it aside as 
a foolish trick of my brain, and the recollection, 
whatever it was, is gone. The position of the 
body and the arrangement of the pillows gave no 
sign of any struggle having taken place. They 
looked as if when he was murdered he had been 
sitting up in bed to read. He could hardly have 
fallen asleep so, for his head would have found 
but an uncomfortable rest on the iron bedstead. 
But I repeat, I did not observe this myself, and 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 23 

I cannot be sure that anybody noted it accurately 
at the time. 

The surgeon stepped quickly to the body, 
slightly raised the left arm, drew aside the 
already open jacket of the sleeping suit, and 
silently indicated the cause of death. This was a 



knife, a curious, long, narrow, sharp knife for 
surgical use, which the murderer had left there, 
driven home between two of his victim's ribs. I 
say " the murderer," for the surgeon's first words 
were, " Not suicide. 53 I had no suspicion of sui- 
cide, but thought that he pronounced this judg- 
ment rather hastily, and that the Sergeant was 
right when he asked him to examine the posture 
of the body more closely. He did so, still, as I 
thought, perfunctorily, and gave certain reasons 
which did not impress either my judgment or my 
memory. I was more interested by his remark 
that he had studied in Berlin and was familiar 
with the appearance of suicide. I may say at 
once that it appeared afterwards, at the inquest, 
that there was reason to think that Peters had not 
had such a knife, for he never locked up drawers 
or cupboards, and his servants knew all his few 
possessions well. It appeared, too, that the owner 
of the knife had taken precautions against being 



24 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

traced, by carefully obliterating the maker's 
name and other marks on it with a file. 

In the midst of our observations in the room a 
vexatious interruption happened. I have forgot- 
ten to say that the servants had been sent out of 
the room by the police-sergeant, and that, almost 
immediately after, the constable who brought the 
doctor had been sent down to examine the outside 
of the house. For some reason he was slow in set- 
ting about this; it is possible that he stopped to 
talk to the servants, but in any case, he went out 
through the kitchen, and explored first the back 
of the house, where he thought he knew of an 
easy way of making an entrance. Meanwhile the 
neighbours, who had collected about the gate, 
had been drawn by their curiosity into the gar- 
den, and by the time the constable had got round 
to the front of the house several were wandering 
about the drive and the lawn which lay between it 
and the road. They had no more harmful inten- 
tion than that of gazing and gaping at the win- 
dows, but it led to the very serious consequence 
that a number of tracks had now been made in the 
snow which might very possibly frustrate a search 
for the traces of the criminal. This the Sergeant 
now noticed from the window. 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 25 

As for the actual carriage-drive I was fortun- 
ately able to remember (and it was the only useful 
thing that I did observe for myself) that when I 
had arrived there had been no foot-marks between 
the gate and the front door except the unmistak- 
able print of the goloshes worn by the housemaid 
on her way to call the police. But the tracks on 
the lawns and elsewhere about the house might 
cause confusion. 

Upon seeing what was happening the Sergeant 
asked Vane-Cartwright, Callaghan and myself to 
await him in Peters' study, while he went out to 
drive away the intruders, to make the constable 
keep others out and to pursue his own investiga- 
tions. While we waited Vane-Cartwright, who 
had spoken little but seemed to watch all pro- 
ceedings very attentively, made the sensible sug- 
gestion that we should look for Peters' will, as we 
ought to know who were his executors. We con- 
sulted the housekeeper, who pointed out the 
drawer in which the few papers of importance 
were kept, and there we soon found a will in a 
sealed envelope. The first few lines, which were 
all that we read, showed me that, as I had ex- 
pected, I was Peters' executor along with an old 
friend of his whom I had never met but 



26 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

who, I believed, as was the fact, now lived in 
America. 

The Sergeant now rejoined us; he had dis- 
covered nothing outside, and, though the tracks 
of the intruders made it difficult to be certain, he 
believed that there was nothing to discover; he 
thought that the murderer had approached the 
house before the snow began to fall, and he found 
no sign that he had entered the house in the man- 
ner of a housebreaker. He had, I must say, taken 
a very short time about his search. He wished 
now that the servants should be summoned, as of 
course it was necessary to make inquiries about 
the movements of all persons connected with the 
house. But he was here delayed by Callaghan 
who had matters of importance to relate. 

He and Vane-Cartwright had been disturbed 
during the night in a notable manner. They had 
actually had an alarm of murder, and curiously 
enough a false and even ludicrous alarm. About 
1 1 .30 o'clock they had been roused by loud shout- 
ing outside the house, amid which Callaghan 
declared that he had distinguished a cry of ( ' Mur- 
der. 31 He had come tumbling out of his room, call- 
ing Vane-Cartwright, who slept in the next room, 
and who immediately joined him in the passage. 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 27 

Without waiting to call Peters, whose room was 
some distance from theirs and from the staircase 
by which they descended (for there were two stair- 
cases in the main part of the house), they went to 
the front door and opened it. The flash of a 
bull's-eye lantern in the road, the policeman's 
voice quietly telling some revellers to go home 
and the immediate cessation of the noise, showed 
them that they had been roused by nothing more 
serious than the drunken uproar which I had pre- 
dicted to Peters would disturb him. The two men 
had returned to their rooms after locking the front 
door again ; they had noticed that the library door 
was open and the lights out in that room; they 
had noticed also as they went upstairs (this time 
by the other staircase) light shining through the 
chink under Peters' bedroom door ; and they had 
heard him knock out the ashes of a pipe against 
the mantelpiece. The pipe now lay on the man- 
telpiece; and, of course, that particular noise is 
unmistakable. They concluded that, though he 
was awake and probably reading, he had not 
thought the noise outside worth noticing. Cal- 
laghan added that he himself had lain awake 
some time, and that for half an hour afterwards 
there had been occasionally sounds of talking or 



28 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

shouting in the lane, once even a renewal of 
something like the first uproar. 

The report subsequently received from the 
constable who had been on duty along the road 
that night confirmed the above, and a little reflec- 
tion made it appear that the disturbance outside 
had nothing to do with the murder. In fact the 
only thing connected with this incident which 
much impressed me at the time was Callaghan's 
manner in relating it. He had up to now been 
very silent, he now began to talk with furious 
eagerness. He readily saw and indeed suggested 
that the disturbance which he related was of little 
consequence. But having to tell of it he did so 
with a vividness which was characteristic of him, 
so that one saw the scene as he described it, saw 
indeed more than there was to see, for he spoke 
of the ground already white and the snow falling 
in thick flakes, when he was pulled up by the Ser- 
geant who said that the snow had not begun to 
fall till three o'clock that morning. Callaghan 
began angrily persisting, and the Sergeant ap- 
pealed to Vane-Cartwright, who up till now had 
said little, merely confirming Callaghan' s narra- 
tive at various points with a single syllable or 
with a nod of his head, but who now said that Cal- 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 29 

laghan was wrong about the snow. He added the 
benevolent explanation that Callaghan, who was 
really much excited, had combined the impres- 
sions of their false alarm over night with those of 
their all too real alarm in the morning. 



CHAPTER III 

HEREUPON Callaghan, who had a more important 
matter to relate, changed the subject abruptly by 
saying, ' Sergeant, have your eye on that man 
Trethewy.' 3 He told us that, ten days before, 
Trethewy had quarrelled with his master. Peters, 
he said, had met Trethewy in the drive, at a point 
which he indicated, and, noticing a smell of 
spirits, had firmly but quietly taken him to task, 
telling him that his occasional drinking was be- 
coming a serious matter. Callaghan had come up 
at the moment and had heard Trethewy, who was 
by his account dangerous with drink at the time, 
answer with surly insolence, making some malici- 
ous counter-insinuation against his master's own 
habits, exploding for a moment into wild anger, 
in which he seemed about to strike his master, but 
to refrain upon catching sight of Callaghan' s 
powerful frame beside him, then subsiding again 

into surliness and finally withdrawing to his own 

30 



TRACKSINTHESNOW 31 

cottage with muttered curses and a savage threat. 
This was the substance of Callaghan's statement. 
But there was a great deal in it besides substance ; 
the whole of the conversation, from the moment 
at which Callaghan came up, was professedly re- 
peated word for word with a slight but dramatic 
touch of mimicry, and the tone and temper of 
master and man were vividly rendered. I can 
never myself remember the words of any conver- 
sation, and for that reason I am unable now to set 
out Callaghan's narrative, and was unable at the 
time to put faith in its accuracy. Here and there a 
phrase was presumably given truly because it was 
given in Trethewy 's own dialect, but once at least 
the unhappy Trethewy was made responsible for 
a remark which he surely never made, for it was 
pure Irish, and indeed I think it was the very 
threat of picturesque vengeance which I had my- 
self heard Callaghan address to a big boy in the 
street who was on the point of thrashing a little 
boy. One detail of the description was a manifest 
mistake. Callaghan indicated (truly, I have some 
reason to think) the spot in the drive where such 
altercation as did happen took place, but he 
added that Peters stood watching Trethewy with 
his hand upon a young tree. Now Peters had 



3 2 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

planted that tree with Trethewy several days 
later, just before the frost set in ; and other details 
in the story seemed equally incredible. ' Ever 
since then," concluded Callaghan, " I have seen 
murder in that fellow's eye. Mind you, I have 
had to do with murderers in India. Three times 
have I marked that look in a man's eye, and each 
time the event has proved me right, though in one 
case it was long after. I tell you this man Tre- 
thewy " But here Vane-Cartwright stopped 

him. He had already disconcerted Callaghan a 
little by pointing out the Hibernicisms that 
adorned the alleged remarks of Trethewy; and 
now he quelled him with the just, but, as I 
thought, unseasonably expressed, sarcasm, that 
if he had seen murder portended in Trethewy 's 
glance it would have been a kind attention to have 
given his host warning of the impending doom. 
He went on to insist warmly on the totally dif- 
ferent impression he had himself gathered from 
Trethewy 's demeanour to his master. He was not 
apt to say more than was needed, but this time he 
ran on, setting forth his own favourable view of 
Trethewy, till he in turn was stopped by the 
Sergeant who said, ' Really, sir, I do not think 
I ought to listen now to what any gentleman 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 33 

thinks of a man's manner of speaking, not if it is 
nothing more than that/ 3 

The Sergeant then sent for Trethewy. I had 
wondered that we had not seen him before. The 
explanation was that he had been away at night, 
had returned home very late, and so had come 
late to the house in the morning and was still 
doing the pumping when the Sergeant sent for 
him. However, he seemed at last to have slept 
off the effect of whatever his nocturnal potion had 
been, and he gave a clear account of his move- 
ments without hesitation and with a curiously im- 
pressive gravity. He had suddenly made up his 
mind at dusk on the previous evening to go to his 
uncle's house, where there was a gathering of 
friends and kinsfolk, which he had at first in- 
tended to avoid. They had made a night of it. 
He had started home, as several, whom he 
named, could testify, at four o'clock in the morn- 
ing (the church clock near his uncle's was then 
striking), and the violence of the snowstorm was 
abating. He had come across the moor by a track 
of which he knew the bearings well. This track 
struck into the grass lane which passed near the 
back of the house at the other side of the pasture, 
and which curved round into the road, joining it 

2 



34 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

close by Trethewy's cottage. As he came along 
the lane a man on horseback leading a second 
horse had overtaken him and exchanged greet- 
ings with him. He had seen the man before, but 
could not tell his name or dwelling or where he 
was going. The snow had done falling when he 
reached his cottage. Once home, he had turned 
in and slept sound till he was roused soon after 
eight by his wife with the news of the murder. 
He had seen nothing, heard nothing, guessed 
nothing which could throw light on the dreadful 
deed of the night. Trethewy was dismissed 
with a request from the Sergeant to keep in 
his house, where he could instantly be found if 
information was wanted from him. This he 
did. 

The two servants were now summoned, and the 
Sergeant had a number of questions to ask them. 
The housekeeper in particular had a good deal to 
say about her master's ways, the household 
arrangements and so forth, and seemed to find 
satisfaction in saying it at length. So a lot of 
trivial details came forth, which I, who was by 
this time becoming exhausted, had little patience 
to follow. Was the candle which was found burnt 
out a new candle the evening before, or a candle- 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 35 

end, or what? The question was asked of the 
housekeeper, but the housemaid answered with 
promptitude that it was a full new candle which 
she had herself put there last evening, shortly be- 
fore the master went to bed. We learnt also that 
Peters was very irregular about going to bed; 
sometimes he would take a fit of sitting up, work- 
ing or reading, night after night, and sometimes 
he would go to bed early, but always he had a 
book with him and lay awake for a while (often 
for hours and hours, as he had confessed to her) 
reading it after he went to bed. Sometimes it 
would be a story book, but more often one of 
those dull books of his; and much more on the 
same subject would have been forthcoming if the 
housekeeper had not at last been stopped, with- 
out, as I thought, having told us anything of 
importance. 

At last I went home, to find the churchwarden 
irate at my lateness for an appointed interview 
about the accounts of the dole charities, and to 
have a forgotten but much-needed breakfast 
pressed upon me. I would rather have been 
alone, but Callaghan gave me his company as far 
as my house, and expounded his view about Tre- 
thewy all the way. He left me at my door to go 



36 TRACKSINTHESNOW 

in search of Thalberg, whom up to that moment 
we had all forgotten. 

In about three-quarters of an hour Callaghan 
burst in on me. Where he had breakfasted, if at 
all, I neglected to ascertain, but he had contrived 
to get shaved at the village barber's, and he now 
looked fresh and seemed keen. He was this time 
in a state of great indignation against Thalberg. 
He had been unable to see him, but had ascer- 
tained that he was still at the hotel, and that he 
had heard the news of Peters' murder, but had 
seemed little interested in it, and had rejected the 
landlady's suggestion that he might like to go up 
to the house to learn the last news of his unhappy 
friend. It appeared that Thalberg had shut him- 
self up in his room ever since, but had ordered a 
fly to drive him to the afternoon train at the 
station five miles off. The landlady and Cal- 
laghan seemed to have agreed that there was 
something peculiarly heartless in his omission to 
call at Peters' or to make any inquiries. 

Callaghan soon left me, returning, as I 
thought, to Grenvile Combe, while I endeavoured 
to settle myself to prepare my sermon for the next 
day, Sunday, with a mind hardly indeed awake 
as yet to the horror of the morning or to the loss I 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 37 

had sustained, much less able in any connected 
way to think over the meaning of our observa- 
tions, but mechanically asking over and over 
again whether it was reasonable that my now con- 
firmed aversion from Thalberg was somehow 
associated in my mind with the object of our in- 
vestigations. 

I say " our " investigations ; as a matter of fact 
I had no intention whatever at that time of busy- 
ing myself with investigation at all. In the first 
place I was quite aware that I had no aptitude for 
such work, and in the second, and far more im- 
portant place, I, who hold it most undesirable 
that a clergyman should be a magistrate, could 
not but feel it still less fitting that he should be a 
detective in his own parish. But I could not 
escape altogether. About 2.45 I received a visit 
from the Sergeant, a much-embarrassed man now, 
for he brought with him the Superintendent, who 
had driven over in hot haste to take charge of the 
inquiry. The Sergeant had zealously endeavoured 
to rise to the occasion, and to my unpractised 
judgment seemed to have shown much sense. 
Perhaps his zeal did not endear him the more to 
the keen, and as I guessed, ambitious gentleman 
who now took over the inquiry, but any way he 



38 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

had been guilty of real negligence in allowing the 
snow round the house to be trampled over by 
trespassers, and at this the Superintendent, who 
had rapidly gathered nearly all that the Sergeant 
had to tell, seemed greatly exasperated; more- 
over, the Superintendent had noticed, if the 
reader has not, that the public-house had been 
open very late the previous night. His present 
errand was to ask me to come to the house, not 
because I was the deceased man's legal personal 
representative, but because he foresaw possible 
explorations in which my topographical know- 
ledge of my large and scattered parish might be 
of use. 

We returned to Grenvile Combe, and the 
Superintendent went straight to the death-cham- 
ber where he remained some minutes with the 
Sergeant and me, taking note with much minute- 
ness and astonishing rapidity of all the details 
which I have already mentioned. Suddenly he 
opened the door and called up the housemaid ; 
she arrived at length, the housekeeper, who 
fetched her, being refused admittance. ' Why/ 5 
said the Superintendent pointing to one window,, 
of which the latch was unfastened so that it 
sagged perceptibly open, " is that window latch 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 39 

unfastened and the other fastened ? ' The house- 
maid said shyly but quite decidedly that she did 
not know, but this she did know, that both had 
been fastened by her last night, that one of the 
few matters in which her master showed any fussi- 
ness was insisting that a window should be latched 
whenever it was shut, and that he never neglected 
this himself, though, she added, he generally 
opened his own window wide last thing at night. 
Why had the Sergeant not noticed this in the 
morning? Poor Sergeant Speke, already crest- 
fallen, had no answer ; at least he made none. Our 
stay in the room was short. The Superintendent, 
I believe, returned there that evening and spent 
an hour or two in searching microscopically for 
traces of the criminal ; but now he was in haste to 
search the garden. " I shall begin," he said, " at 
the point under that window. It is past three 
already. Come on, there is not a minute of day- 
light to be lost." At the point under the unlatched 
window he made a startling discovery, startling in 
that it had not been made before. 




CHAPTER IV 

I AM now driven to attempt the task, which I had 
hoped to escape, of a topographical description. 
To begin with what is of least importance for the 
present. The village of Long Wilton lies in the 
valley of a little stream, and two roads run North- 
wards from the village along the opposite sides of 
the valley. The road along the Western side 
leads up a steep hill to the church, built at some 
distance from the village for the benefit of the 
former owners of the manor house. Just beyond 
the church lies a house which was the manor 
house, but has now lost its identity in improve- 
ments and extensions and become a new and not 
very beautiful hotel. This hotel owes its origin to 
the South- Western Counties Development Com- 
pany, Limited, which discovered in its neigh- 
bourhood promising golf links, whose promise 
may be fulfilled when the extension of the railway 

is completed. I ought to. but do not. thank the 

4 ' 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 41 

Company for a liberal contribution made for the 
reseating of the church in the days of my prede- 
cessor. The hotel spoils the view from Grenvile 
Combe, across the valley. Its upper windows 
command a prospect of the whole of Peters' 
grounds. This, however, does not concern us yet. 
The road on the other side of the valley leads 
to some outlying hamlets which form part of the 
parish. On the right of it, as you go North- 
wards, the ground rises steeply towards a wide 
tract of moorland. About a quarter of a mile out 
of the village a grass lane diverges from the road 
and leads in a North- Easterlv direction. Gren- 



vile Combe is a little property of some ten acres 
lying between the grass lane and the road, and 
bordered on the North by a fir plantation which 
extends from the road to the lane. The cottage, 
or lodge, which was then Trethewy's, stands 
close to the Southern corner of the grounds, 
where the grass lane turns off ; and the gate of the 
drive is close by. The stables, which Peters had 
not used of late, stand on a detached piece of the 
property across the road. The house itself is near 
the fir plantation. The back of it looks out upon 
a steeply rising pasture field which lies along the 
grass lane. The front looks (across the drive, a 



42 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

I strip of lawn and the road) to the stream and to 
the church and that ugly hotel on the little hill 
beyond. Peters' study was in the front of the 
house at the North-West corner of the main block 
of the building, in other words, it was on your 
left as you entered at the front door; and his 
bedroom was just above it. A path leads from 
the drive under the North wall of the house to the 
kitchen entrance, and on the left of this path, as 
one goes towards the kitchen, stands an out- 
building in which is the pump. A shrubbery of 
berberis and box and laurel, starting near the 
house, just across the path, skirts round the blind 
end of the drive, and straggling along under the 
low brick wall, which separates the drive and 
front lawn from the fir plantation, ends at a fine 
old yew tree which stands just by the road. All 
along the front of the house there is a narrow 
" half area," intended to give so much light and 
air, as servants were once held to deserve, to the 
now disused dungeons where the dinners of 
former owners had been cooked. 

In that area right below the unlatched window 
we saw a ladder lying, a short light ladder, but 
just long enough for an active man to have 
reached the window by it. Now the snow had 



TRACKSINTHESNOW 43 

come with a North-East wind, and any one who^ 
may have wrestled with my essay in topography 
will readily understand that just here was a nar- 
row tract where very little snow had fallen and 
the frozen ground was mostly bare. There was 
accordingly no clear indication that the ladder 
had ever actually been reared tow r ards the win- 
dow, but it might have been. The path to the 
kitchen door was clear enough too, and a man 
might have picked his way just thereabouts and 
left not a footprint behind. Casting about like a 
hound, the Superintendent had found some foot- 
prints near, before his companions had begun 
seeking; footprints pointing both ways. He im- 
mediately returned to the house and got some 
bundles of chips for kindling, with which to mark 
the place of the footprints he discovered. Cal- 
laghan had joined us, and he and I and the 
Sergeant followed the Superintendent, keeping, 
as he bade us, carefully a little behind him. In a 
moment it was plain that some man had climbed 
the wall out of the fir plantation, not far from the 
yew tree, that he had crept along the edge of the 
lawn, planting his feet most of the way under the 
edge of the berberis shrub, but now and then, for 
no obvious cause, but perhaps in guilty haste, de- 



44 TRACK S IN THE SNOW 

viating on to the lawn where his tracks now 
showed in the snow. He had made his stealthy 
way, not quite stealthy enough for him, round the 
end of the drive; no doubt he had found the 
ladder somewhere up that side path, no doubt he 
had opened the latch in the well-known way, 
entered through the window, done the deed, 
slipped out and left his ladder where we found 
it ; and there were his footprints, returning by the 
way he came to the same point in the wall. 

Here we paused for a moment. Not a word 
was said as to the inferences that we all drew 
from those few footprints, but the Superintendent 
sharply asked the Sergeant, ' ' Why was that trail 
not found and followed to an end this morning ?" 
Poor Sergeant Speke looked for an instant like a 
detected criminal, but he pulled himself together 
and made sturdy answer : ' I think, sir, it was 
not there this morning.' 3 " Think!' said the 
Superintendent, and in a very few minutes from 
the discovery of the first footprint, he and all of 
us were over the wall and in the fir plantation. 
And there we paused again, for the fir boughs 
also had kept out of the snow, and the carpet of 
fir needles showed no distinct traces of feet. 
Eventually it seemed a long time but it was a 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 45 

short time we found where the fugitive had 
emerged from the fir plantation over some iron 
hurdles into Peters' field and along a little sort 
of gulley that there ran from the plantation half- 
way along the field. ' Not the best place to break 
cover, but their wits are not always about them,' 3 
said the Superintendent, and he pointed to a 
wedge-shaped snowless tract which, caused by 
some extra shelter from the wind, extended from 
the wall, tapering towards a clump of gorse 
bushes. Then he sped on the trail, making the 
rest of us spread out to make sure that there were 
no other tracks across the field. Southwards, 
right along the field, the trail led till he, and we 
rejoining him, scrambled out of the field, where 
our quarry must have scrambled, into the green 
lane about two hundred yards from Trethewy's 
cottage. Thus far, but no farther; along the now 
well-trodden snow of the lane it was idle to look 
for the print of any particular foot. ' I am 
thinking of the hours of lost daylight," said the 
Superintendent, now depressed. ' Was this a 
likely way for a man making for the moors, Rec- 
tor? >J " You need not look that far," said Cal- 
laghan; "those footprints were the man Tre- 
thewy's. Down at the cottage yonder," he added 



46 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

for the Superintendent's benefit. " They are the 
track of hobnailed boots, sir,' 3 said the Super- 
intendent, "that's all that they are.' 3 "Do you 
see that pattern? " said Callaghan; and there was 
something odd about the pattern of the nails in 
the last footprint just beneath our eyes. You 
never saw it in any footprint before, but I did, 
and it is the pattern I saw in Trethewy's footmark 
not a"fortnight ago when last there was snow." 
He was strung up again now, and he had 
strangely quick eyes when he was strung up. 
That is the man's footprint/ 3 he said, ' and 
there are the man's boots.' 3 Some way along the 
ditch, under brambles and among old kettles and 
sardine tins and worn-out boots (for plentiful rub- 
bish had been dumped just here), lay quite a good 
pair of boots, old boots truly, but not boots that 
I should have thrown away, whatever a poorer 
man might do. The Superintendent had them in- 
stantly. ' Odd they are so full of snow,' 3 said 
Callaghan ; ' ' he did not lace them or they were 
much too big for him. But what possessed him to 
throw them away, anyhow?' 'Oh,' 3 said the 
Superintendent, * they mostly have plenty of 
half -clever ideas. It takes a stupid one to escape 
me, sir,' 3 he interposed to me with a sort of 



TRACKSINTHBSNOW 47 

chuckle, for he had lost no more time in appro- 
priating the discovery than he had done in pick- 
ing up the boots. "The clever idea this time,' 3 
he added, "was just this: The lane is trampled 
enough now, but in the morning, when fewer 
feet had been along it, you might have picked out 
the print of a particular boot by careful looking. 
But a fellow in his socks could shuffle along 
among the few footmarks and make no trace that 
you could swear to ; only he would not go far like 
that by daylight when the people he passed would 
notice his feet. Of course it was madness not to 
hide the boots better, but I expect he had taken a 
good deal of liquor to screw himself up to his 
work. Is that Mr. Trethewy's house, sir?' for 
we were by this time close to it. 

I had been keen enough, as any man 
would have been, from the moment we saw the 
ladder till now, but I hope it will be easily un- 
derstood why I did not accompany the hunters to 
Trethewy's cottage. I went back to the house to 
find Vane-Cartwright, who had stayed there, as it 
seemed, reading gloomily and intently all the 
afternoon, and to arrange for the prompt re- 
moval of him and Callaghan from that now 
cheerless house to the Rectory. The house- 



48 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

keeper, oddly enough, was quite ready to stay, 
and she kept the housemaid with her. 

Callaghan, who soon came back, said that 
Trethewy had come to the door of his house when 
they knocked. ' Mr. Trethewy," said the Super- 
intendent, ' do you know these boots ? ' He 
answered composedly enough, " They look like 
my boots, but I do not know where you found 
them.' 3 Here Mrs. Trethewy came forward and 
said in a very unconvincing tone (so Callaghan 
insisted), ' Why, that is the pair I have looked 
for high and low these three days. Do not you 
remember, Reuben, how angry you were they 
were lost ? ' 

We left the house for the Rectory soon (my 
man was to come with a barrow for the luggage), 
but before we left, one further piece of evidence 
had accidentally come to my knowledge. I learnt 
from something which the housekeeper was say- 
ing to the maid that the ladder was one which was 
always kept in the pump-house, that the pump- 
house was always kept locked, and that Trethewy 
kept the key. 



CHAPTER V 

ON Wednesday, the 2nd of February, Candle- 
mas Day, I read the burial service over my 
friend's body. I will not dwell upon what that 
service was to me, but like many funerals of my 
friends it is associated in my mind with the sing- 
ing of birds. The inquest had taken place on the 
Monday and Tuesday, and while it clearly estab- 
lished the fact that the death had been caused by 
murder, not suicide, nothing was laid before the 
jury whjch would have justified a verdict against 
any particular person. I believe that some doubt 
had arisen as to the identification of the boots. 
The village shoemaker, whose expert opinion 
was asked, had said that though he never 
arranged hobnails in that way himself, he had 
seen the same arrangement in boots that had 
been brought to him to be repaired, by some man 
who was not Trethewy. Later on, however, it was 
ascertained, I fancy through Callaghan's ingen- 

49 



5 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

uity, that Trethewy, who liked dabbling in 
various handicrafts, had cobbled and nailed 
some boots for a friend, that this friend was the 
man whose hobnails had been noticed by the 
shoemaker, and that he had been safe out of the 
way at the time of the murder. Moreover per- 
haps I forgot it, perhaps I assumed that they 
would find it out for themselves and preferred 
that they should anyhow I had not mentioned 
to the police that I heard Trethewy alone had 
had access to the ladder (they found it out later). 
Callaghan and Vane-Cartwright stayed with 
me for the funeral. A large crowd of merely 
impertinent people, as I confess I regarded them, 
collected from the neighbourhood and even from 
far away for the occasion. Two only of Peters' 
family were there, or could have been there. 
He had two nephews in the Army, but they were 
then in India. The rest of his near belongings 
were an old gentleman (a cousin of his father's, 
whom I had heard Peters himself describe as 
a relative whom he had only met at burials, but 
whom he regarded as an essential part of the 
funeral ceremony) and a maiden aunt, his 
mother's sister. Both of them came; both in- 
sisted on staying at the hotel,, instead of at the 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 51 

Rectory, for the night before, but they had 
luncheon and tea at the Rectory after the funeral, 
and departed by the evening train. The old 
gentleman was, I believe, a retired stipendiary 
magistrate. Vane-Cartwright very obligingly de- 
voted himself to entertaining him and took him 
for a walk after luncheon, while Callaghan 
roamed about, observing the people who had 
come for the funeral, expecting, as he told me, 
that there might be something to discover by 
watching them. I was thus left alone for a 
while with Peters' aunt, who, by the way, 
appeared to have known Vane-Cartwright as a 
boy. 

Having with some difficulty overcome her for- 
midable reserve and shyness, I learned from her 
much that I had not known about my friend, her 
nephew, how really remarkable had been the 
promise of his early days, though he had idled 
a little at Oxford, and how he had left Oxford 
prematurely and taken up an appointment 
abroad, because he felt that his parents could 
not well afford to keep him at the university 
until he could earn his living in a profession at 
home. Of his later life too, including his 
latest projects of study, she had much to tell 



52 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

me, for she had followed him and his pursuits 
with an affectionate interest. This contrasted 
strangely both with her evident indifference on 
her own account to books and such matters as 
delighted him, and with the strange calmness 
with which she seemed to regard his death and 
the manner of his death. I was becoming greatly 
attracted by this quiet, lonely old lady, when 
the return of the cousin and Vane-Cartwright 
and of Callaghan at the same time put an end 
to our conversation. Probably it was only that 
she did not feel equal to the company of such 
a number of gentlemen, but I half-fancied that 
some one of the number I could not guess 
which, but I suspected it was the old cousin was 
antipathetic to her. 

I went to London myself that night, returning 
next afternoon. I had to go and see my wife and 
children. They had gone soon after Christmas 
to stay with my wife's father, and she had taken 
the children for a night to London on their way 
home. She was compelled to stop there because 
my daughter, who was delicate, caught a bad 
chill. It was now so cold for travelling that I 
urged her to remain in London yet a little 
longer. 



TRACKSINTHBSNOW 53 

I am not sure why I am being so precise in re- 
cording our movements at that time. Perhaps it 
is merely from an impulse to try and live over 
again a period of my life which was one of great 
and of increasing, not diminishing, agitation. 
But having begun, I will proceed. 

I returned to my rectory the day after the 
funeral hoping to be free from any share in a 
kind of investigation which consorted ill with 
the ordinary tenour of my work. But of course I 
could not remove myself from the atmosphere of 
the crime. To begin with, I had an important 
interview with Trethewy (which I will relate 
later) the day after my return. But, besides, 
rumours of this clue or that, which had been dis- 
covered, came to me in the common talk of my 
parish, for every supposed step towards the dis- 
covery of the criminal seemed to be matter of 
general knowledge. So the crime went with me 
in my parish rounds, and in the privacy of my 
house I was still less able to escape from it, for 
Callaghan was with me, and Callaghan's mind 
was on fire with the subject. 

I discovered very soon that Callaghan, whom 
I had asked to stay for the funeral, was bent 
upon staying in the village as long as he could. 



54 TRACKSINTHESNOW 

He conceived that, with the knowledge he pos- 
sessed and his experience in India, he might, if 
on the spot, be able to contribute to the ends of 
justice; and he seemed to find a morbid satis- 
faction, most unlike my own feeling, in being 
near to the scene of crime and the scene of detec- 
tion. Moreover, he exhibited an esteem and love 
for Peters and a desolate grief at his loss which, 
though I had not known that the two men were 
quite such friends, I was almost forced to think 
unaffected. So I readily invited him to stay at 
the Rectory, and he stayed there some ten days 
altogether, when he declared that he would put 
himself upon me no more and would move to 
the hotel. At the last moment he changed his 
mind, and said he had taken a fancy to stay at 
Peters' house if he might. I was persuaded to 
acquiesce in this, and there he stayed with 
occasional absences in London, till nearly a 
month later, shortly after the time when, as I 
shall tell, Trethewy was committed for trial at 
the Assizes. 

Vane-Cartwright, who remained quiet and 
reserved, thanked me very much the night after 
the murder for having him at the Rectory, say- 
ing, with a feeling that I had not quite expected, 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 55 

that either to hurry away on that day of agita- 
tion or to stay a night longer in Peters' house, 
would have been a trial for him. He added that 
he purposed returning to London immediately 
after the funeral, and after an important City 
meeting, for which he must stay in England, he 
was going out to meet his young lady on the 
Riviera. I suppose that without intending I be- 
trayed before the funeral the fact that I was a 
little worried by my impending duties as execu- 
tor, duties which strangely enough I had never 
had to perform before, and in which I was now a 
little embarrassed by the absence from England 
of my fellow-executor and the principal legatees, 
and by the prospect of having to carry out a 
charitable bequest which left me a large dis- 
cretion and might possibly involve litigation. 
Vane-Cartwright very unobtrusively put me in 
the way of doing whatever was immediately in- 
cumbent on me. I suppose I appeared as grate- 
ful as I felt; anyhow, it ended with a delicate 
suggestion from Vane-Cartwright that he would 
be very glad to stay at the hotel for a day or two 
and make himself useful to me in any way that 
he could. Of course I pressed him to stay at the 
Rectory, and, in spite of an apparent preference 



5$ TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

for staying at the hotel, -he after a while agreed. 
I was expecting that I might soon be leaving 
home for some time, as it might be necessary to 
take my little daughter for a month abroad in a 
warmer climate, and after that I knew I should 
be very busy with Confirmation classes and other 
matters, so that I was anxious to make immediate 
progress, if I could, with winding up Peters' 
estate, and was very glad that Vane-Cartwright 
would stay, as he did stay, at the Rectory. On 
the Saturday however (a week after the murder) 
he received a telegram which compelled him to 
leave that afternoon. I had by this time begun 
to like him, which I confess I did not at first; 
men of his stamp, who have long relied on them- 
selves alone and been justified in their reliance, 
often do not show their attractive qualities till the 
emergency occurs in which we find them useful. 
Trethewy was arrested the day that Vane- 
Cartwright left. I wondered why he was not 
arrested earlier (for there did not seem to be any 
real room for doubt that he had made those foot- 
marks), but I have never ascertained, and can 
only guess that the police felt sure of securing 
him if he attempted to escape, and hoped that, if 
left alone, he might betray himself by such an 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 57 

attempt or otherwise. He never did. He sat in 
his cottage, as I gathered, constantly reading the 
Bible, but once or twice a day pacing thought- 
fully and alone up and down the drive. He did 
the few necessary jobs for the house with punctu- 
ality, but he never lingered in it, never visited 
the field or the lane, and hardly spoke to any one, 
except on the day before his arrest, when, to my 
astonishment (for he was known to be hostile to 
the Church), he sent for me, and we had the 
memorable interview to which I have already 
referred. 

During the days before his arrest, as well as 
after, all sorts of enquiry, of which I knew little, 
were going on. Thalberg's movements after the 
murder were traced. Some attempt was made, I 
believe, to find the man who, according to Tre- 
thewy, had passed him with two horses in the 
lane. But there seems to have been some bungl- 
ing about this, and the man, about whom there 
was no real mystery (he was a farm servant who 
had started off early to take a horse, which his 
master had sold, to its new owner), was not then 
found. Two important discoveries were made 
about Trethewy. After his arrest his cottage was 
searched, and he was found to be the possessor 



58 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

of inconceivably miscellaneous articles. Among 
them were several weapons which he might natur- 
ally have picked up on his travels, but among 
them (which was more to the point) was a small 
case of surgical instruments. Two instruments 
were missing from that case, and the instrument 
used by the murderer might, though not very 
neatly, have fitted into one of the vacant places. 
The case was found, as Callaghan, who contrived 
to be present, told me, at the back of a shelf in a 
cupboard filled with all sorts of lumber and litter 
that had lain there who can say how long. Cal- 
laghan, however, professed to have observed, 
from marks on the dust of the shelf, that the con- 
tents of the cupboard had been recently dis- 
turbed, in order, he had no doubt, to hide the 
instrument case at the back of everything. 

The other new discovery had occurred two 
days before. Trethewy's uncle and the guests 
who had been at his party on that ill-omened 
night were of course sought and questioned. 
They all corroborated Trethewy's own account 
of his movements, but they added something 
more. Trethewy it seemed had been normal and 
cheerful enough as the evening began, but, as 
the night and the drinking went on, fell first into 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 59 

melancholy, then into sullenness, lastly and a 
little before he went home into voluble ferocity. 
He recurred to the topic, to which his uncle said 
he had more than once alluded on previous days 
when he had met him, of his quarrel with Peters, 
against whom he had conceived an irrational re- 
sentment, and he actually, though those who 
heard him did not take him seriously at the time, 
uttered threats against his life. 



CHAPTER VI 

I WAS told of this behaviour of Trethewy's by 
Sergeant Speke the day after the arrest. But it 
was no surprise to me, for I had come myself to 
communicate to the police something to the same 
effect. On mature reflection I had thought it my 
duty to report the matter of the interview which I 
had had with Trethewy some days before. Tre- 
thewy had, unsolicited, made a confession to me 
not a confession of crime, but a confession of 
criminal intent. 

Unchecked by a warning that I could promise 
no secrecy as to what he should say, and a re- 
minder of, what he knew full well, that he was in 
a position of grave danger, he declared to me that 
he had harboured the thought of killing his mas- 
ter, and, though he had never actually laid hands 
on him, was as guilty as though he had done so. 
Starting with this declaration he plunged into a 

long and uninterrupted discourse of which I 

60 



TRACKSINTHESNOW 6 1 

should find it impossible, even if I wished it, to 
give an at all adequate report. 

As for the matter of his statement : if one were 
to accept it as true, it was the tale, common 
enough two centuries ago, but so rarely told now 
that modern ears find it very hard to take it in, the 
tale of the ordinary struggle between good and 
evil in a man, taking an acute and violent form, 
so that the man feels day by day the alternate 
mastery of a religious exaltation, which he be- 
lieves to be wholly good, and of base passions, 
which, when they come upon him, seem to be an 
evil spirit driving him as the steam drives an 
engine. From the manner of the statement, it was 
very hard to gather how much of it was sincere, 
impossible to gather whether or not something 
worse lay concealed behind that which was so 
strangely confessed. Self-abasement and self- 
righteousness, the genuine stuff of Puritan enthu- 
siasm, the adulterated stuff of morbid religious- 
ness, sheer cant, manly straightforwardness, 
pleasure in the opportunity of preaching and that 
to the parson, all these things seemed blended 
together in Trethewy's talk. 

On the most favourable view the story came to 
this. A few years before, Trethewy, after a care- 



62 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

less life, had become suddenly impressed by deep 
religious feelings, no less than by precise and in- 
flexible religious views. His conversion, he 
trusted, had not left his conduct unaffected, but 
though for a time he walked, as he said, happy in 
this new light, it had been the beginning, not the 
end, of his inward warfare. His natural ill- 
temper, that worst sort of ill-temper which 
is both sulky and passionate, began to come 
upon him again in prolonged fits of intense 
wrath, intensified, I suppose, by reaction from 
the pitch at which he often strove to live. 
Besides this, he gave way at times to a keen 
pleasure in alcohol. He was tempted by what he 
called a " carnal ' pride in the strength of his 
head for liquor; and I have sometimes observed 
that drink works its worst havoc upon the very 
men who may appear to be the least affected by it, 
bringing about a slow perversion of the deeper 
motives of action, while for a long time it leaves 
the judgment unclouded upon those more trivial 
and obvious matters in which aberration is readily 
detected. Thus at the time of that altercation with 
Peters of which Callaghan had been a witness, 
Trethewy was already brooding perversely over 
some trumpery or altogether fancied grievance. 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 63 

He was deeply under the influence of drink at 
that moment, and did not know it, but knew he 
had had enough to make most men drunk. His 
very worldly pride had therefore been the more 
offended at the imputation which Peters threw on 
him. His spiritual pride was offended too by a re- 
buke from one, whom, though originally fond of 
him, he had come to regard as a worldling, 
steeped in mere profane philosophy. He had been 
enraged to the point of desiring Peters' death, 
and the threat which Callaghan reported had been 
actually uttered. He had meant, it may be, nearly 
nothing by his threat when he uttered it; but, 
when once this almost insane notion, of killing for 
such a trifle a man whom normally he liked, had 
taken shape in words, it recurred to him every 
time that he was put out, or that a third glass of 
spirits went to his lips. Perhaps it recurred to him 
with all the more terrible power because in better 
moments his conscience was horribly alarmed at 
his having given in, by so much as one thought, to 
this suggestion of the Devil. On the morning be- 
fore Peters' death he had a fresh altercation with 
him on the occasion of some trifling oversight in 
the garden to which Peters had called his atten- 
tion, and I was surprised after what Vane-Cart- 



64 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

wright had said to be told that Vane-Cartwright 
was present on this occasion and had heard the 
insolent language in which he seems to have ad- 
dressed Peters. All day and night after that the 
evil dream had been upon him, and he walked 
home from his uncle's that night plotting murder. 
He awoke in the morning calmer, but his wrath 
still smouldered, till his wife brought him the 
news that Peters was murdered, when it gave 
place in a moment to poignant grief for Peters. 
He could not stir from the cottage ; he sat, he tried 
to pray, he thought, and he saw himself as he was 
perhaps not quite as he was, for he saw him- 
self as a man guilty of blood. 

He would gladly, I think, have talked with me 
of his soul, but, with the suspicion which I had 
in my mind, I did not see how I could say much to 
him. So, having heard him out, I got away with 
some pitifully perfunctory remarks. How was I 
to take this confession ? Was the mental history 
which the man gave of himself a cunning inven- 
tion for accounting for the known quarrel and the 
known threats ? Was the story true with this grave 
correction that Trethewy had carried out his in- 
tent ? Was it the simple truth all through ? Did it 
even go beyond the truth in this, that the man's 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 65 

thoughts had never been so black as he made 
them out ? For days these questions occurred fre- 
quently to my mind, but my real opinion upon 
them was fixed almost as soon as I got away from 
Trethewy. Contrary to my principles I disliked 
him, I felt strangely little sympathy for his 
spiritual struggles ; but I did not doubt that they 
were real, and I did not doubt that he was inno- 
cent of the crime. 

Before the prosecution of Trethewy had gone 
far, a letter arrived which excited my imagina- 
tion unaccountably, or rather two letters arrived. 
The day before Vane-Cartwright had left, a letter 
had come for Peters, bearing the postmark of 
Bagdad. Vane-Cartwright carelessly opened it. 
He had, I think, at my request, on the day when I 
was away in London, opened some letters which 
arrived for Peters' executors. So he had a good 
excuse for opening this. ' Well, that is very un- 
informing," he said, passing the letter over to me, 
with an apology for his mistake, and laughing 
more than was usual with him. Uninforming it 
certainly was. * Dear Eustace," it ran, "I am 
sorry I can tell you nothing about it. Yours, 
C. B." Just a week later, after Vane-Cartwright 

had left, came another letter from the same place, 

3 



66 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

in the same hand, and almost, but not quite, as 
brief : " Dear Eustace, This time I will not delay 
my answer. Longhurst sailed in the Eleanor and 
she did not go down. To the best of my belief she 
still sails the seas. I never liked C. Yours ever, 
Charles Bryanston." 



CHAPTER VII 

AFTER several remands, the proceedings against 
Trethewy before the magistrates came to a close 
about the end of February. There was nothing 
much to note about these proceedings, which 
ended, as I suppose they must have ended, in his 
being committed for trial. The reader knows by 
this time pretty nearly the whole case against him. 
That Peters had been murdered was certain. The 
accused had had several altercations with the 
murdered man. In one of them he had expressed 
a wish to kill him, and he had repeated this wish 
to others upon the fatal night. Footprints had 
been found which, as the reader knows, seemed at 
first sight plainly indicative of his guilt. Then 
there was the ladder. It was undoubtedly kept, 
before the murder, locked up in a place of which 
only Trethewy had the key. That any one could 
have had access to it between the murder and the 

discovery of the ladder was a view supported only 

67 



68 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

by the uncorroborated statement of the accused 
that he had left the key of the pump-house that 
morning, when summoned to speak to the police, 
and had forgotten to go back for it until the next 
day. Lastly, the finding of the instrument case, 
though not very important, at any rate disposed of 
any improbability that Trethewy would have had 
such an instrument as the knife that was used. 

I daresay this would have been enough to hang 
a man if this was all ; and against this there was 
nothing to be set, except the immovable persis- 
tency of Trethewy and his wife from the first in 
the tale which they told. 

Nothing, that is, till after he had been commit- 
ted for trial. But the very evening after his com- 
mittal, a slight but almost conclusive circum- 
stance was brought to light, and entirely altered 
the aspect of the case. That evening I received a 
visit from Peters' housemaid, Edith Summers. 
She had, she said, something on her mind. She 
had told a falsehood to the police-sergeant on the 
morning after the murder. She had interrupted 
the housekeeper to say that the candle by Peters' 
bed had been a long candle the night before ; she 
had said this because she had been very severely 
scolded by the housekeeper for forgetting to put 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 69 

fresh candles in the candlestick ; and so she had 
said what was false, not meaning any harm, but 
thinking for the moment (as she now tried to ex- 
plain) that it was true, and that she had done 
what she had intended. She had confessed to the 
housekeeper since, but the housekeeper had only 
said she was an impudent girl to have put in her 
word then, and had better not put it in again. She 
had gone to the court expecting to be a witness on 
some small point and determined to make the 
matter clear then; but she had not been called. 
She had spoken to a policeman, and had been 
told to speak to one of the lawyers. She had tried 
to get the attention of Trethewy's lawyer, but he 
had been too busy to listen to her. 

I am ashamed to say that listening to her rather 
long explanation, I entirely failed to see the sig- 
nificance of what she told me. I said something 
quite well intentioned about the evil of saying 
what was not true, and then told the girl kindly, 
that I did not think there was any harm done. But 
she had thought about it and was in earnest, and 
she made me see it in a moment. There were, she 
explained, other candles in the room, but they 
were new candles, and they were not lighted that 
night. From this and what we already knew the 



70 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

conclusion was almost inevitable. Peters was mur- 
dered before two inches of ordinary candle, which 
was burning at 11.30 p.m. on the 28th of January, 
burnt down. 



Stupid as it may seem, I had for some time 
been convinced of Trethewy's innocence, and yet 
had never really drawn the necessary inference 
from it. Of course with the two premises in my 
mind Peters was murdered, Trethewy did not 
murder him I had been aware, in a sense, of the 
conclusion, but it had taken no hold of my atten- 
tion. Now, however, I had evidence of Trethewy's 
innocence, which was no longer a private intuition 
of my own, but was something of which every one 
must appreciate the force. Perhaps it was from 
this, perhaps it was from the sentimental effect of 
having the time of the crime fixed within such 
narrow limits ; anyhow the thought, ' Some one 
other than Trethewy murdered Peters/* came 
upon me with a sudden horror which could hardly 
have been greater if I had only that moment be- 
come aware of the original fact of the murder. 

I instantly went over in my mind the list of 
those few who were so placed as to lie within the 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 71 

reach of suspicion. Trethewy could no longer be 
suspected. Thalberg surely could not. I dismissed 
the two women servants from my mind immedi- 
ately. There remained two men three men 
three men, of whom I was one. I knew how easily 
I could clear myself, for the door had been locked 
behind me before that candle was lit. But I was 
the last man known to have seen Peters, and my 
confused current of thought included me as a man 
to be suspected. I asked myself of each in turn, is 
he the guilty man ? and in each case I answered 
no. As I look back now, it seems to me, that the 
answer " no " did not come to my mind with the 
same whole-hearted conviction in each case. But 
I did not in the few moments for which I then re- 
flected, I did not till long after do more than go 
round in this circle : One of us three men mur- 
dered Peters. Was it each of us in turn? No. 

Could it after all be one of the servants ? No ! 
Was there not then in the vast region of possi- 
bility some way of accounting for Peters' death 
without the guilt of any of us. The plainest rea- 
sons bade me answer yes, and yet again I an- 
swered no. And so back round the circle. 

But the girl was with me and I could not keep 
her waiting for ever. I arrested my mental circle 



72 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

where it began, at the thought : it seems Peters 
was murdered while two inches of ordinary 
candle, lighted before 11.30 p.m. on the 28th of 
January, burnt out. I started up to take the girl at 
once to see the police, but on a sudden idea I 
desisted. I wrote a note to the housekeeper, ask- 
ing that the girl should again come to see me at 
eight in the evening, and I sent a message to the 
police-sergeant, asking him to come at the same 
time. Of course I had often interviewed him on 
parish matters, and having got him settled into 
the arm-chair in my study, in which I could 
usually put him at his ease, I fired upon him the 
question, " Sergeant, were those tracks, which we 
found, really there when you came to Mr. Peters 1 
house in the morning?* Now Sergeant Speke 
was a very honest man, but he was (most properly, 
I am sure) a creature of discipline, and his answer 
threw, for me, a flood of light on the problem how 
it is that the very best of the police are so ready to 
back up one another. He answered immediately 
and with conviction : " Well, you see, sir, it is not 
for me to judge." The answer was on the face of 
it preposterous. He alone had searched the front 
of the house that morning, and it was for him 
alone, of all men, to say whether the tracks were 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 73 

there. He obviously did not see this at all, and I 
was wise enough to let go an opportunity for 
moralising to him. I beguiled him, with a glass of 
wine and other devices of the tempter, into feel- 
ing himself off duty for the while, and talking with 
me as fellow-mortal to fellow-mortal. I very soon 
discovered, first, that Sergeant Speke had 
searched carefully enough around the house that 
morning to have seen the tracks if they had been 
there, and, secondly, that the man, Speke, as dis- 
tinct from the Sergeant, knew perfectly well that 
they were not there. 

Not till then did I summon the girl Edith from 
the servants' hall where she was waiting. I made 
her tell her tale. I saw the Sergeant take a due 
note of it for transmission to those, to me mysteri- 
ous, headquarters, where I supposed all such mat- 
ters were digested. I got the assurance that Ser- 
geant Speke was really man enough to see that 
his own evidence, as to the non-existence of the 
tracks that morning, would be noted and digested 
too. I dismissed the Sergeant and Edith, and 
went slowly to bed. Did I suspect this person? 
No ! Did I suspect that person ? N no. At last 
I determined that I would not let my suspicions 
fasten on any one man, while it might be just as 



74 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

reasonable that his suspicions should fasten on 
me. But my mind remained full of horror and of 
the image of a candle-end spluttering out, while 
the man, who had lighted it to read by, lay dead 
in those bloody sheets. Very, very glad I was that 
my wife was at last coming home next day. 

I suppose it was from the association of two 
female names that my dreams, when at last I 
slept, were of nothing more horrible than the ship 
Eleanor , which, as the reader remembers, prob- 
ably still sailed the seas. 



CHAPTER VIII 

WITH some doubt as to whether it was what I 
ought to do, but with no doubt that it was what I 
wanted to do, I sought out Callaghan next morn- 
ing for a final talk with him before he left ; for he 
was at last to tear himself away from the scene 
which he haunted. I tried on him, I do not know 
why, the effects of Edith's disclosure without tell- 
ing him what I now knew about the tracks. I could 
see that he accepted the truth of the girl's state- 
ment, and had grasped, much more quickly than I 
had, what it imported. It was therefore wearisome 
to me, and, in my then state of mind, most jarring, 
that for some time he persisted in playing with the 
idea that Trethewy might still be guilty. He sup- 
ported it, as he went on, with more and more far- 
fetched arguments, so that my patience was nearly 
at an end, when, to my amazement, I found my 
friend off at full speed again upon a fresh track, 

75 



76 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

that of Thalberg. I listened, and this time seri- 
ously, to several things which he told me about 
Thalberg, which were new to me and threw an un- 
pleasant light upon him. Then I interposed. 
Thalberg had left the house with me, and it had 
been made all but certain that he went straight to 
his hotel and never left it until many hours after 
the murder had been discovered. In any case it 
was not he who had made those tracks, for he had 
certainly kept in his hotel from early morning on 
the 29th till he left. And I then told Callaghan 
my reason for believing that those tracks were 
made in the middle of the day on the 29th. ' My 
dear friend," he exclaimed, this time with all the 
appearance of earnestness, " I no more really be- 
lieve than you do that Thalberg actually did the 
deed. He is not man enough. But I have a 
method, I have a method. I am used to these 
things. I am off to town now; I shall be there 
some time; you know my address. I mean," he 
added grandiloquently, " to work through all the 
outside circumstances and possibilities of the 
case, and narrow down gradually to the real heart 
of the problem ; it is my method." 

Well, there may have been some method in his 
madness, for there was certainly some madness in 



TRACKSINTHESNOW 77 

his method. I took leave of him (after he had 
called, that afternoon, to renew acquaintance with 
my wife) little foreseeing what his two next steps 
would be. He stopped on his way to London at 
the county town, where he went to the county 
police office to communicate some information or 
theory about Thalberg. He went on to London, 
as he had said he would, but, instead of remaining 
there as he had said, he suddenly departed next 
day for the Continent, leaving no address behind. 

We have now arrived at the first week in March. 
The several events (if I may include under the 
name of events the slow emergence of certain 
thoughts in my own mind) which prepared the way 
for the eventual solution of our mystery, occurred 
at intervals, and in an order of which my memory 
is not quite distinct, during that and the remaining 
nine months of the year. 

The resolution at which I had arrived, not to 
occupy my mind with suspicions, or to regard the 
detection of crime as part of my business, was not 
a tenable resolution, and it was entirely dissipated 
by my wife in a talk which we had on the first 
evening after her arrival. I was aware that she 
would not be able to share with me in the deter- 
mination not to harbour suspicions of any particu- 



78 TRACKSINTHBSNOW 

lar person, but I had thought she would be averse 
to my taking positive steps towards the detection 
of the crime. She, however, was indignant at the 
idea that I could let things be. " Several innocent 
men will be under a cloud ail their lives," she 
said, "unless the guilty man is found. There is 
Trethewy, I suppose they will let him out some 
day ; but who is going to employ him ? Not that 
uncle of his ; and we cannot. Who do you suppose 
is going to see this through if you do not ? ' She 
was powerfully seconded in this by a neighbour of 
ours, now an old man, who had had much experi- 
ence as a justice. "Mr. Driver," he said, "you 
may think this is the business of the police, but re- 
member who the police are. They do their ordin- 
ary work excellently, but their ordinary work is to 
deal with ordinary crime. This was not an ordin- 
ary crime, and it was done by no ordinary man. If 
it is ever discovered, it will be by a man whose 
education gives him a wider horizon than that of 
professional dealers with criminals." 

I do not know how far the reader may have 
been inclined to suspect Callaghan (that depends, 
I suppose, on whether the reader has been able to 
form any idea of his character, and I myself had 
not, so far, formed any coherent idea of his char- 



' 



TRACKSINTHBSNOW 79 

acter ; there seemed little coherence in it), but the 
police certainly had begun to suspect him. 

On a superficial view of the matter there was 
every reason to do so. Short of bolting on the 
night of the murder, before it was discovered, he 
had done all that, theoretically, a guilty man 
should have done. He had lost no time whatever 
in attempting to put suspicion on one innocent 
man. He had striven to intermeddle officiously in 
the investigations conducted by the police. There 
was more than one apparent lie in the information 
he had given. He had haunted the scene of the 
crime as though it fascinated him. When the first 
innocent man was cleared, he had at once sug- 
gested another man, who was almost certainly 
innocent also, and he had then, after giving false 
accounts of his intentions, quitted the country 
without leaving his address. Then he was cer- 
tainly in the house when the crime was committed. 
His movements on the following day were nearly 
accounted for, but not so fully that he could not 
have made those false tracks. After all it was a 
circumstance of deep suspicion that he had been 
so quick to recognise the peculiar print of Tre- 
thewy's boot. 

Alas, even to the test cui bono, " that stock 



80 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

question of Cassius, 'whom did it profit? 5 ' Cal- 
laghan responded ill. I knew, and somewhat later 
in reply to an enquiry by the police, it was my 
duty to say, that Callaghan was in a certain sense 
a gainer by Peters' death. He had been a most 
imprudent investor (not, I believe, a speculator), 
and had in his embarrassment borrowed ,2,000 
from Peters. Peters, while living, would not have 
been at all hard on him if he had been honestly 
unable to pay, but was just the man to have made 
Callaghan's life a burden to him if he thought he 
was not doing his best to keep above water. 
Peters* will cancelled the debt, and it was not im- 
possible that Callaghan knew it. But this last 
point illustrates the real weakness of the argu- 
ment against him. Nobody could know Callaghan 
a little and think that either this interest in the will 
or any other point in this hypothetical story of his 
crime, however much it might be like human 
nature, was in the least like him. 

Here, for want of a good description of him, 
are a few traits of his sojourn in my parish. He 
was, it is true, with difficulty dragged out of a 
furious brawl with a gentleman from the North 
of Ireland who, he said, had blasphemed against 
the Pope. The man had not so blasphemed, and 



TRACKSINTHBSNOW 8l 

Callaghan himself was not a Roman Catholic. On 
the other hand, he had habitually since his arrival 
lain in wait for the school children to give them 
goodies and so forth. He assaulted and thrashed 
two most formidable ruffians who were maltreat- 
ing a horse, and then plastered their really hor- 
rible bruises with so much blarney that they for- 
gave, not merely him, but the horse. He had 
brought for Peters, with infinite pride, a contra- 
band cargo of his native potheen, a terrible fluid ; 
and after Peters' death he would sit up alone in 
that desolate house, drinking, not the potheen, 
which, in intended charity, he suggested that I 
should bestow on the poor in the workhouse, but 
Mrs. Travers' barley water, and writing a rather 
good and entirely bright and innocent fairy story. 
This is emphatically not evidence, but it made 
me sure of Callaghan's innocence. Looking at 
what I suppose was evidence, I had wondered 
whether I was not soft in this, and I brought the 
matter to the test of my wife's judgment. I knew 
that, at least at her earlier meetings with Cal- 
laghan, she had disliked him, and, out of the facts 
which she knew already, I made what I flattered 
myself was a very telling case against him. It did 
not disconcert me that the lady, who, when told of 



82 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

his flight, had trusted he would remain out of 
England till she went abroad, said without much 
interest, " What stuff," and then suddenly kindl- 
ing, exclaimed, " What, Robert, are you turning 
against the poor man ? ' When I asked for the 
reasons why she scouted the idea of his guilt, she 
seemed to consider the request quite frivolous ; 
but at last I extracted from her a sentence which 
expressed what I think was at the root of my own 
thought. " Mr. Callaghan," she said, " is violent 
enough to commit a murder and cunning enough 
to conceal anything, but I cannot imagine his vio- 
lence and his cunning ever working together." 

Of course we both thought of him as sane, 
though he was just one of those people to whose 
doings one constantly applies the epithet " mad." 



CHAPTER IX 

THE enquiry upon which I had now stirred myself 
to enter, could not be an easy one, but it should 
have seemed for the present to be narrowed down 
to a question about a single man. Perhaps it was 
from repugnance against consciously going about 
to hang a man who had sheltered under my roof, 
that I did not even then definitely put to myself 
the question of that man's guilt. By some half- 
conscious sequence of thought I was led to begin 
my search far afield. It started with the two letters 
which had come for Peters from Mr. Charles 
Brvanston, or rather first with the later letter. 

I had some time before written briefly and 
formally to Mr. Bryanston to acquaint him with 
the fact of Peters' murder, but had, for a while 
since, thought no more of him. Now I began to 
do what one very seldom does, steadily and 
methodically think. I mooned up and down with 

a pipe in my garden or in the lanes. I sat, with 

83 



84 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

those letters in my hand, alone before the fire. I 
sat at my writing-table with paper before me, and 
made incoherent jottings with a pencil. I should 
be afraid to say how often and how long I did all 
these seemingly idle things, till at last, in the 
time between tea and dinner, with the children 
playing in the room, I arrived at actually spelling 
the matter out. 

1 This time I will not delay my answer." " This 

time " Then at other times he did delay his 

answer. That might have some significance when 
I turned to the earlier letter. " This time I will 
not delay my answer." It was an answer to a ques- 
tion in a letter just received from Peters, an 
answer probably by return of post. Why not delay 
it this time as usual ? Why, of course, because the 
question was one which both to Peters and to 
Bryanston seemed important, perhaps moment- 
ous. Simple enough so far. ' Longhurst did sail 
in the Eleanor, and she did not go down." It was 
clear enough that some one had thought that 
Longhurst had sailed in a ship that did go down. 
Peters had thought otherwise, and Peters was 
right. What of that ? There is nothing momentous 
in that. Stop, though. It is not necessarily that. 
Some one need not have thought it he may have 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 85 

said it to Peters, and Peters may have thought it 
was a lie. And what did it matter, and why did 
some one say it? Well, of course, Longhurst 
would be dead if the ship had gone down; and 
Longhurst was not really dead, and some one was 
interested in saying that he was. Perhaps Long- 
hurst was the next heir to some property, and 
search ought to have been made for him ; and my 
mind wandered over all the stories I had ever 
read of lost heirs, in fact or in fiction. Or per- 
haps Who said Longhurst and his ship 

went down? " C." said it, whoever " C." might 
be. 

Then I took up the earlier letter. I knew from 
the other letter that this had been sent late. There 
was nothing further to be gained from the words 
of it, but a flood of suspicion broke upon me as I 
held it in my hand. Had " C." another initial to 
his surname, a double name? Did I know this 
'C."? Had I not seen this very letter in the 
hands of " C." ? Had I not thought it rather odd 
that he, a man so decidedly "all there," had 
opened and read it before it was given to me? 
Had I not rather wondered at the pains he had 
kindly taken to help me with several letters be- 
fore? Did he not laugh rather strangely as he 



86 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

read it, though I never heard him laugh at any- 
thing amusing? Did he not go away just after the 
letter came, though he had not been intending to 
go so soon ? Was it conceivable that he knew that 
Peters had asked that question, and thought the 
first letter (" very uninforming," as he called it) 
was the answer to that question, and an answer 
which made him safe? After that one laugh I 
thought he became suddenly downcast. Had he 
really read in that letter that he need not have 
feared Peters, and that he had yes, murdered 
him for nothing? Had the accident that Peters 
had written, perhaps long before, some unimport- 
ant question to Bryanston, and the accident that 
Bryanston had delayed his answer betrayed this 
man into leaving me alone with my letters a week 
too soon ; and would this trifling mistake lead him 
to to the gallows ? and I remembered with a start 
the grim end which I was preparing. Yes, all this 
was conceivable. There is an old maxim that you 
should beware of going back upon your first in- 
stinctive impressions of liking or dislike when you 
happen to have them. There are qualifications to 
it; the repulsions that start from ugliness or 
strangeness or difference of opinion may not be 
safe guides. But broadly the maxim is true. It 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 87 

was true in this instance. No, I too had never 
liked " C." 

It is strange that I should have received Mr. 
Bryanston's answer the very next morning, a long, 
full, warm-hearted letter on the death of the 
friend to whose letters in life and what letters 
Peters wrote ! he made such scrappy replies. In 
a P.S. at the end, as if the writer had hesitated 
whether to write it, were the words : " It is curious 
and may be news to you that Mr. Peters, at the 
time he was murdered, was unravelling the mys- 
tery of another murder, committed, as he sus- 
pected, many years ago." 

So then, as I had half-guessed, Longhurst was 
dead. It was not that he was alive and Cartwright 
pretended he was dead; he was dead, and Cart- 
wright had a motive for falsely pretending he was 
drowned. 



CHAPTER X 

: TOUT comprendre, c'est tout pardonner," is, I 
do not doubt, a saying which has its truth. Never- 
theless, I have generally noticed, when I have 
read much about murders or other great crimes, or 
about the social or political misdeeds which are 
not called crimes, that every piece of additional 
knowledge about the manner in which the thing 
was done, the inducements that led to it, the con- 
duct that followed it, has, for me at least, set the 
capital act of wrong in a more hideous light. It is 
not, I think, that the picturesque circumstances, 
like the guttering candle whose image got on my 
nerves that night, affect me profoundly. It is, I 
believe, that, while many men, most if you like, 
are middling, the distinctly bad are really much 
worse and the distinctly good are really much 
better than the world of middling people is at all 
ready to allow. When I looked at the whole cir- 
cumstances of the crime, as I now conceived them, 



88 



TRACKSINTHESNOW 89 

a great hatred of Vane-Cartwright possessed my 
soul. There was a passage in my subsequent 
course with regard to him, when a reason personal 
to myself had just been added to the cause of my 
hate, upon which I look back sometimes with self- 
disgust, but I cannot think that the desire, which 
first prompted me to fasten myself upon Vane- 
Cartwright and try to drag him down, was an im- 
pure desire, or that it consorted ill with the inner 
meaning of those precepts which it was my profes- 
sion to teach. 

Whether it was right or wrong, the strength of 
the feeling which then animated me showed itself 
in my resolve to think calmly and to act circum- 
spectly. I was conscious that the structure of my 
theory was held together by no firm rivets of veri- 
fiable fact, but by something which must be called 
feeling. I did not distrust my theory on that 
account; but I did distrust myself, and I deter- 
mined, in what lay before me, to take as few im- 
pulsive steps and to draw as few impulsive con- 
clusions as I could. 

Reflecting, next morning, on what could be 
done immediately to bring my hypothesis to the 
test of fact, I looked in the Postal Guide for such 
information as it gave about the mails to and from 



9 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

Bagdad. I also verified my impression as to the 
date of that occasion when Vane-Cartwright, stay- 
ing at the hotel, had spent the evening with 
Peters. From what I found it seemed to me that 
a letter to Bagdad, posted that night, might have 
been expected to fetch an answer back by the date 
on which the first letter from Bryanston came to 
my hands, or even a few days earlier, but that the 
delays of steamers might easily bring it about that 
an answer should not arrive till a week later, that 
is, when the second letter from Bryanston came to 
me. So far then there was nothing to make my 
conclusion impossible. I may add here that the 
enquiries which I made, as soon as I saw how to 
do it, confirmed what I gathered from the Postal 
Guide, and showed that on this occasion such a 
delay of the mails had actually happened. 

But, assuming this about the mails, what a frail 
edifice my theory still remained ! Upon most 
careful reconsideration, I saw, as the reader may 
see, that it fitted in easily with all the known facts. 
It was just as well founded as many things which 
are taught as established truths of science or his- 
tory. But as for expecting the law to hang Vane- 
Cartwright upon this, I myself, fantastically no 
doubt, refrained a little later from black-balling 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 91 

him at a distinguished club, of which, oddly 
enough, I had in my ambitious youth become a 
member. In large part the case, so to call it, 
against him rested on my observations of his 
demeanour in my house, and especially of his con- 
duct in regard to my business as executor and my 
letters. This was precise and cogent enough for 
me, the observer at first hand ; but it was too much 
matter of general impression to be of use to any 
one but me. Then the attribution of that early 
murder to Vane-Cartwright seemed to me abso- 
lutely requisite to make his murder of Peters con- 
ceivable. But it was the work of my imagination. 
In the region of palpable facts, one thing alone 
was evidence against Vane-Cartwright and not 
against any other man. It will be remembered 
that, when Callaghan first denounced Trethewy, 
Vane-Cartwright said that Trethewy's behaviour 
in his presence to Peters had been friendly and 
respectful. He knew, I now told myself, a better 
way than expressing suspicion of Trethewy, and 
while by his stealthy act he fabricated evidence 
against him, he contrived by his words to cast on 
Callaghan alone the risk of thereafter appearing 
as an innocent man's traducer. But his cunning 
had made a slip. It was gratuitous in doing so to 



92 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

have uttered a refutable lie as to Trethewy's con- 
duct in his presence. He was not the man to have 
seen the imprudence of this. It would have been 
to him inconceivable that a man like Trethewy 
should confess the full extent of his wrong con- 
duct to me. And so, not from any want of cool- 
ness, he had provided me with the one scrap of 
ordinary evidence necessary to give firmness to 
that belief of mine which might otherwise have 
seemed a mere bubble. 



CHAPTER XI 

BY the time that my wife, who had been again 
obliged to be in London while I was spelling out 
this story, had returned, I had long come to the 
conclusion that my theory had enough in it to be 
worth submitting to her criticism. But she fore- 
stalled me with news of her own, and news which 
concerned Vane-Cartwright. The young lady, 
Miss Denison, whcTm he was to have married had 
suddenly broken off the engagement within two 
days of his joining her upon the Riviera. The 
girl could give no good reason for her conduct, 
and her own people loudly condemned it; they 
had been against the engagement, for the differ- 
ence of age was too great; they were still more 
against the flighty breach of it; but she was 
obdurate. She and her people returned home for 
Easter, and my wife, who had already known her 
a little, now met her several times at the house 

of a common friend in London. The foolish or 

03 



94 TRACKSINTHESNOW 

unhappy young lady had given my wife her con- 
fidence. Far from having any suspicion about the 
murder, she had never even heard, when she made 
her decision, that there had been a murder at all ; 
for she and her mother did not read news of that 
order, and Vane-Cartwright, though he had said 
that he had been through a dreadful experience, 
of which he was anxious to tell her, had not yet 
said what it was. There had evidently been a 
quite unaccountable quarrel in which the high- 
tempered girl had, in all things external, begun, 
continued and ended in the wrong; and she did 
not now defend herself. Somehow, she said, he 
was changed. No, not in his manner to her; she 
had not doubted his attachment to her. Only she 
had thought she had loved him before, and she 
knew now that she did not. Something, which she 
had seen in him before but not disliked, now 
jarred upon her feelings in a new way. She had 
been very, very foolish, very, very wrong; she 
could explain nothing; she was very unhappy, 
very angry with herself; but this she knew, and 
this alone she knew, that it would be wrong for 
her to become William Vane-Cartwright's wife. 

So much my wife told me. Then, with that pre- 
cipitancy in travelling to remote conclusions 



TRACKS IX THE SNOW 95 

which sometimes seems so perilous in able women, 
she said, as quietly as if it were the most obvious 
comment, " Robert, it was Vane-Cartwright that 
did the murder/' Now she had never even spoken 
to him. 

Accordingly, she received my theory of the 
murder almost with enthusiasm. None the less, 
she immediately put her finger upon the weakest 
part of it. " I wonder, all the same," she ex- 
claimed, " why he murdered Eustace ? ' " Why," 
I said, " he saw in a moment that Eustace knew 
he was lying and suspected him of the murder." 
" That would not have been enough," she said ; 
:t he must be a very cool-headed man from the 
way he behaved after the murder, and he would 
never have run the risk he ran by a second 
murder, if there had not been much more than 
suspicion of the first." "Then," I suggested, 
' perhaps Eustace already knew it, and the lie 
he told only provoked Eustace into showing it." 
" If," she replied, " Eustace knew it, he would 
never have had him within his doors." " Well," 
I said wearily, because I could not immediately 
see how to answer, " perhaps he did not murder 
Eustace." Then she turned on me with a woman's 
promptitude and a woman's injustice : " You can 



96 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

always argue me down," she said, " but he did 
murder Eustace Peters, and you have got to find 
out all about it and bring him to justice. I am 
sure you have the ability to do it. You may have 
to wait, but, if you wait patiently and keep your 
eyes open, all sorts of things will turn up to help 
you. I shall be very angry with you," she added, 
in a tone not at all suggestive of anger, " if you do 
not do it." 

I felt, like my wife, that it was a matter of 
waiting for what would turn up. In the neigh- 
bourhood of the murder there was probably very 
little to turn up. The police, I felt no doubt, had 
made all manner of enquiries ; and as for anything 
that I was likely to pick up, I supposed I had 
already heard all, and more than all that any per- 
son in the neighbourhood knew about the matter. 
I may anticipate a little and say that in the whole 
of the four months, which, as it proved, were all 
that remained to me as Rector of Long Wilton, 
no fresh information was given to me by my 
neighbours there. It soon occurred to me that the 
murder of Longhurst, far away and long ago, 
might be easier to trace than the recent, but per- 
haps more carefully veiled, crime committed to 
cover it. Peters, I reasoned, must have been in 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 97 

possession of proofs of it, and probably, as I 
searched his voluminous papers, something would 
appear to indicate the nature of those proofs. I 
began, as in any case I should have done, a care- 
ful reading of his papers. It took up no small part 
of my spare time, for I found that he had pre- 
pared little enough for immediate publication, but 
fuller and more valuable materials for his pro- 
jected book of psychology than I should at all 
have expected from his manner of proceeding. 
But, of what now interested me more than my 
friend's philosophy, I found nothing in all this 
mass of letters and notes and journals; nothing, 
that is, which threw direct light on this mystery, 
for indeed his psychological notes and my discus- 
sions with a friend of his, an Oxford philosophy 
tutor, to whom I eventually committed them, did, 
I think, influence me not a little in one important 
part of my enquiry later. 

In pushing enquiries further afield there was 
need for some caution. An indiscretion might 
have brought what I was doing unnecessarily soon 
to the notice of the suspected man, and the great 
ability with which I credited him might suggest 
some effective scheme for baffling my search. But 
of course I wrote early to Mr. Bryanston to ask if 

4 



9$ TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

he would tell me to whom he alluded as " C," 
whether Longhurst was the man whom Peters 
suspected had been murdered, and whether I in- 
ferred rightly that " C." was involved in this sus- 
picion. 

It was my duty to put all that I knew at the dis- 
posal of the police, and the opportunity for doing 
so soon presented itself in the visit, which, as I 
have said, was paid to me to enquire about Cal- 
laghan. My visitor was an important official, since 
dead, whom I need not more clearly indicate. 
He had been a military man, and he struck me as, 
in some ways, admirably qualified for his post. 
He was, I believe, excellent in the discipline he 
maintained among his subordinates and in all the 
dispositions he made for meeting the common 
public requirements. I am told also that he had 
wonderful familiarity with the ways of ordinary 
law-breakers, but he did not appear to me to have 
much elasticity of mind. After answering fully his 
question about Callaghan, I thought it right to 
give my own impression of his innocence. My 
visitor answered me with a somewhat mysterious 
reference to those who really guided the conduct 
of the affair. He could not himself, he said, go 
behind their views. Then, with an evident sym- 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 99 

pathy for my concern about Callaghan, he told 
me in confidence and still more mysteriously that 
the opinion of an eminent specialist had been 
taken. 

I then ventured to press the question of Tre- 
thewy's release, and learnt that it was being care- 
fully considered, but he could not be set free 
immediately. Then I told my visitor of the state- 
ment of Vane-Cartwright when Callaghan first 
spoke of Trethewy, and how Trethewy's confes- 
sion proved this to have been a deliberate false- 
hood. I showed him and gave him copies of the 
letters of Bryanston to Peters and to me. I in- 
formed him, and at my request he noted, that 
Vane-Cartwright had opened the first letter. I 
stated what I had myself observed of Vane-Cart- 
wright's conduct, and indicated frankly the con- 
clusion which I was disposed to draw. It did not 
seem to me that I produced any impression. My 
visitor listened, if I may say so, with the air of 
a man who takes in the fact accurately and sees 
that it should be put in some pigeon-hole, but is 
without either apprehension or wonder as to its 
real bearing. I gathered, on the whole, that the 
official mind was chiefly taken up with the theory 
that Callaghan was guilty ; but that there was also 



100 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

thought to be an off-chance that something might 
yet turn up to repair the seemingly shattered case 
against Trethewy. I gathered too, and, I hope, 
gave due weight to the fact, that there was some 
likely way, of which I had before heard nothing, 
by which an unknown person might have entered 
and escaped from the house that night. One thing 
more I learnt; nothing suspicious had been dis- 
covered about Thalberg's movements, but it ap- 
peared, and this seemed to be considered as in 
his favour, that he had a great deal to do with 
Vane-Cartwright. 

After my visitor had taken courteous leave of 
me, it dawned upon me what was meant by his 
dark sayings about Callaghan. I had wondered 
how the opinions of an eminent specialist in police 
matters could be so cogent in a case about which 
he knew nothing at first hand. Suddenly it 
occurred to me that the eminent specialist really 
was a physician well versed in the symptoms of 
insanity. The police then were not being guided 
by those superficial and so to speak conventional 
notes of guilt, of which I had thought, to the ex- 
clusion to all those sides of character which I had 
noted. On the contrary they had a view of their 
own on which these two conflicting sets of 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW IOI 

phenomena might be reconciled, a view which ex- 
plained why Callaghan was to me so inexplicable. 
The man was not sane. 

I could not conceal from myself that there was 
at least something plausible in this view. There 
is a sort of marked eccentricity and, as it were, 
irresponsibility of conduct of which I had always 
thought as something not merely different from 
incipient madness but very far removed from it. 
Yet I had once before been terribly mistaken in 
thinking thus about a friend, and I might, I re- 
flected, be mistaken now. The natural effect upon 
me was, or should have been, a keener sense of 
the unsubstantial nature of the story which I had 
built up about Vane-Cartwright. But I believed it 
still. 



CHAPTER XII 

IN the course of the summer my wife and I paid 
our annual visit together to London, and I had a 
few days in Oxford before the end of the summer 
term. 

I heard a good deal about Vane-Cartwright in 
London, for he had become a man of some mark 
in society, and moved in a little set, which was 
known among its members by a rather precious 
name, now forgotten though celebrated in the 
gossip of that time, and which included a states- 
man or two of either party and several men of 
eminence in letters, law or learning. By a strange 
coincidence of the sort which is always happen- 
ing, I met at an evening party a friend who men- 
tioned Longhurst, and I had just heard from him 
something of no moment about this man whose 
fate so deeply exercised me, when I saw Vane- 
Cartwright himself standing in another part of the 



1 02 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 103 

throng. I took the opportunity of watching him, 
unobserved myself, as I supposed. I have 
hitherto forborne to describe his appearance, be- 
cause such descriptions in books seldom convey a 
picture to me. But I must say that seen now in a 
room where there were several distinguished 
people, he made no less impression on me than 
before. He was, I should say, five foot eleven in 
height, thin and with a slight stoop, but with the 
wiry look which sometimes belongs to men who 
were unathletic and perhaps delicate when young, 
but whose physical strength has developed in 
after years. Hair which had turned rather grey, 
while the soft texture and uniformly dark hue of 
his skin still retained a certain beauty of youth, 
probably accounted for a good deal of his distinc- 
tion of appearance, for he was not handsome, 
though his forehead, if narrow, was high, and his 
eyes which were small were striking of a dark 
greenish-grey colour, I think. The expression of 
the mouth and of the clear-cut and firm-set jaw 
was a good deal hidden by a long though rather 
thin moustache, still black. I had time while he 
stood there to notice again one trick, which I 
already knew; he was, I supposed, bent upon 



104 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

being agreeable, so he was talking with animation, 
and when, in so talking, he smiled and showed his 
white teeth, his eyelashes almost completely 
veiled his eyes. To me, naturally, it gave him a 
hateful expression, yet I could see a certain 
fascination about it. Then he moved farther off- 
very quietly, but I could see as he made his way 
through the crowd that in reality every motion 
was extraordinarily quick. 

Some ten minutes after, I was about to go, 
when he suddenly came from behind and ad- 
dressed me, asking me to choose a day for dinner 
or luncheon at his club. I declined, and freed 
myself as courteously and as quickly as I could, 
and thought, for the moment, that there had been 
nothing marked in the way in which, obeying irre- 
sistible impulse, I had shaken off the man whom 
I suspected on such slight grounds but so 
rootedly. 

A few days afterwards a great robbery was 
attempted at Vane-Cartwright's house. The 
robbers were after a well-chosen and valuable 
collection of gold ornaments of early periods or 
from strange countries, which he had begun to 
make. It was reported in the papers that the theft 



TRACKSINTHESNOW 105 

had been with great presence of mind interrupted 
and prevented by the owner of the ill-guarded 
treasures. But the robbers themselves got away. 
The matter was much talked of, and conflicting 
tales were told about it, but it seems that Vane- 
Cartwright, hearing some unusual noise, had come 
downstairs and surprised the two men who had 
entered the house before they had succeeded in 
removing any of their spoil. As he came down he 
had rung up the police by the District Messenger 
Company's apparatus which was in the house. 
Coming quietly upon them, and standing in the 
dark while they were in full light, he had first 
ordered them to hold up their hands, and had then 
made each of them singly turn out his pockets and 
restore the smaller stolen articles which they had 
already secreted in them. He then, it was said, 
kept them standing there to await the police. But, 
by some ruse, they distracted his attention for a 
moment, and then, suddenly putting out the 
light, made a rush past him and escaped. Such at 
any rate appears to have been the information 
which he gave to the police who arrived soon 
after. The police actually arrested two men, 
already known to them as suspicious characters, 
who had been observed lurking near the house to- 



106 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

gether and afterwards slinking away separately, 
and they were at first confident that they had 
secured the authors of the attempted robbery. But 
Vane-Cartwright not only could not identify the 
arrested men as the two housebreakers, whom he 
had of course seen well; he insisted firmly that 
they were not the men whom he had seen; nor 
were the right men ever caught. The matter 
caused some surprise, and the police were freely 
blamed for their bungling. I have my own 
reason for doubting whether they were justly 
blamed. 

It is a mere fancy on my part that this incident 
and my meeting with Vane-Cartwright a few days 
before may have had a connection with each other 
and with certain subsequent events in this history. 
I fear that my experience in that year and the next 
has made me ready to see fanciful connections ; 
and the reader, when he knows of those subse- 
quent events, will see what I suspect took place 
upon the discovery of the theft, but will very 
likely think my suspicion extravagant. However 
that may be, Vane-Cartwright's plucky adventure 
and the celebrity which it helped to give to his 
artistic collections, caused me to hear all the more 
of him during my stay in London. 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 107 

Curiously, however, it was at Oxford, where he 
had not distinguished himself, that the fame of 
Vane-Cartwright was most dinned into my ears. 
The University is apt to be much interested in the 
comparatively few of her sons whose road to dis- 
tinction is through commerce ; and, moreover, he 
had lately given to the University Museum a 
valuable collection of East Indian weapons, 
fabrics, musical instruments and what not, which 
he had got together with much judgment. Thus it 
happened that I heard there one or two things 
about him which were of interest to me. A friend 
of mine, an old tutor, the Bursar of the college at 
which Vane-Cartwright had been, described him 
as he was in his undergraduate days. He had, in 
his opinion, been badly brought up, had never 
gone to school, but been trained at home by 
parents who were good people with peculiar 
views, highly scientific and possibly highly moral 
views. He had not fallen into either of the two 
common classes of undergraduates which my old 
friend understood and approved the sportsman- 
like and boyishly fashionable class, or the studi- 
ous class who studied on the ordinary lines ; still 
less into the smaller, but still not small, class 
which combines the merits of the two. He had 



108 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

attainments of his own, which the old tutor did not 
value sufficiently, for he was proficient in several 
modern languages and modern literatures ; more- 
over, the necessary mathematics, Greek and Latin 
grammar, formal logic, etc., which he had to get 
up, gave him not the slightest trouble. Altogether 
he had plenty of cleverness of his own sort, but it 
was a sort which the Bursar thought unwholesome. 
He was quite well conducted, and ought to have 
been a gentleman, coming of the family of which 
he came, but somehow he was not quite a gentle- 
man. Thus it was a great surprise to the possibly 
conventional instructor of his youth that he had 
done so well in the world. 

Then I heard of him from another man, justly 
esteemed in financial circles, who was on a visit to 
his son at Oxford, and whom I met in a common- 
room after dinner. Somebody had hazarded the 
remark that Vane-Cartwright must have been 
either a very hard worker or a very lucky specu- 
lator. " No," said this gentleman, who was a col- 
league of his on the Board of one of the only two 
companies of which he was a director, " I should 
not say that a man like that worked hard as you 
would understand work at Oxford, or at least as 
a few of you would. His hard work was done 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW ICX) 

when he was young. Most of his business is what 
one of his clerks could run, and probably does 
run, for many weeks together, on lines which he 
has planned very carefully and revises whenever 
occasion requires. Nor is he what most people 
would call a speculator. I fancy he very seldom 
takes any uncommon sort of risk, but he always 
does it at the right moment. He has succeeded 
because he is very quick in making his calcula- 
tions and very bold in taking action on them. He 
does not seem to be constantly watching things, 
but when a special emergency or a special oppor- 
tunity occurs he seems to grasp it instantly, and I 
believe he troubles himself very little, too little 
perhaps, about any affair of his when it is once 
well in train." 

Lastly, I heard a story, the narrator of which 
could give me few precise details, of the pains 
which Vane-Cartwright had taken to search out 
the few relations of an old partner of his in the 
East who had died before their affairs turned out 
so successfully, and of the generosity with which 
he had set up these people in life though they had 
very little claim on him. Here at least was some- 
thing which took its place in the story which I was 
weaving ; the rest of what I had heard was little 



110 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

to the purpose, though it served to give life and 
colour to my idea of the man's character. 

Now, however, I was really to discover some- 
thing definite. When we returned to our home at 
Long Wilton, only a little before we finally left 
it, I completed my examination of Peters' papers. 
His various diaries and notebooks, notes of travel 
and notes of study, jottings and completed pas- 
sages for his psychological book, I found to be of 
fascinating interest, and I lingered over them 
long, but there was not a hint among them all of 
Longhurst, the Eleanor or any kindred topic. 
One of the journals, I noticed, had had some 
leaves cut out. The last place of my search was 
a small wooden trunk which I had brought home 
from his house (now sold). On the top of it lay a 
sheet of paper with, written in his mother's hand, 
' Some little things which I have put aside for 
Eustace. His wife or his children may care to see 
them hereafter." It may have been from a false 
sense of pathos, but my eyes filled with tears, and 
I was indisposed to rifle callously these relics so 
lovingly put aside with natural hopes which now 
could never be fulfilled. I was about to make a 
bonfire of the box and all its contents reverently 
but with speed, when my wife arrested me in 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW III 

amazement at my folly. " Why," she said, " can- 
not you see ? His letters to his mother will be in 
it. His letters from the East," she added, as I 
still did not comprehend. And they were in it. 



CHAPTER XIII 

I HERE set down in order of their date several 
extracts from Peters' letters to his mother written 
from Saigon in the years 1878 to 1880. 

First Extract: " I have a new acquaintance, one 
Willie Cartwright, a young fellow who was at 
Oxford just after me. I spend a good deal of tim.e 
with him because of talking Oxford shop and be- 
cause he is fond of books; at least he was brought 
up among them, and reads the books he thinks 
he ought to read. I have not got very much in 
common with him, for he is a narrow-shouldered, 
bilious-looking, unathletic fellow, with no instinct 
of sport in him; but he is a welcome addition to 
my circle, because he is refined in a negative 
way at least and most of my friends' conversa- 
tion here is well, not refined, and it becomes a 
bore." 

Second Extract: l How curious that you 
should have known some of young Cartwright's 



113 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 113 

people, for it is W. V. Cartwright. I thought 
they must have lost their money since I heard of 
him at Oxford. Yes, I will try to ' take care of 
him ' a little, as you say, but really, though he 
is quiet and not sociable among men, he is by no 
means a timid youth, and he has quite got the 
name of a shrewd business man already." 

Third Extract: " I am rather sorry about 
Willie Cartwright. He seems to have got into 
the hands of a fellow named Longhurst, who has 
lately turned up here, no one knows why. He, 
Longhurst, is a rough customer whom no one 
seems to know anything about, except that he 
has been in Australia. He has been a mining 
engineer, and seems to know also a lot about 
tropical forestry. He has wonderful yarns of the 
discoveries he has made in the Philippines, the 
Dutch Indies and all over the shop. I should not 
believe his yarns, but he seems to have made a 
little money somehow. Well, Cartwright now 
talks of becoming a partner with him in some 
wild-cat venture, and I am afraid he will get let 
in. He says himself he thinks Longhurst will try 
to do him. He had much better stick to his hum- 
drum business here, which will give him a living 
at any rate, and perhaps enable him to retire com- 



114 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

fortably when he is, say, forty-five, young enough 
to enjoy life, though one does age soon in this 
climate. " 

Fourth Extract: l Cartwright and Longhurst 
have actually gone off together. Parker, whom 
Cartwright was with, is very sick about it. . . . 
By the way, I ought to confess I was quite wrong 
about Longhurst. I have seen a good deal of him 
since, and found him a very kind fellow, with an 
extraordinary simplicity about him in spite of all 
his varied experiences. I generally assume that 
when a man is spoken of as a rough diamond, the 
roughness is a too obvious fact, and the diamond 
a polite hypothesis, but I was wrong in Long- 
hurst's case. Also I think you may reassure C.'s 
aunt about the chances of his being swindled. In 
strict confidence I think the chances are the other 
way. MacAndrew, the lawyer here, told me a 
story he had no business to tell about the agree- 
ment between . . ." (Part of letter lost.) 

This was all. Peters before long was moved 
to Java; and the letters to his mother ceased soon 
after, for she died. 

Not long afterwards I got Bryanston's answer 
to my letter of enquiry to him. He told me little 
but things of which by this time I was sure. "C : ): 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 115 

was Cartwright (William V. Cartwright, he 
called him) , and was, he conjectured, the man 
whom Peters connected with Longhurst's death. 
He would be glad to tell me at any time anything 
that he could, but he was off now for a sea voyage 
which the state of his health made necessary (a 
long absence immediately before accounted for 
some delay in his answering me) , and at present 
he could think of nothing to tell me but what I 
should see in Peters' letter to him, of which he was 
keeping the original and now enclosed a copy. 

The important part of the letter enclosed was 
as follows : " I have a question to ask you which 
perhaps you will answer this time by return of 
post. Never mind my previous question about 
the old Assyrians. You will remember the time 
in 1882 when you were at Nagasaki, and you will 
remember Longhurst's being there and his sail- 
ing. After his disappearance it got about naturally 
that he sailed in that unhappy ship the William 
the Silent, which went down in a cyclone. Now 
I have a distinct recollection that when I met you, 
some months after that, you told me that you had 
seen Longhurst with Cartwright at Nagasaki, that 
you saw them off, and that they both sailed to- 
gether in the same ship. I have forgotten the 



Il6 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

name of the ship you mentioned, but it was a ship 
with some female name, and it belonged to your 
people. Will you please tell me at once if my 
recollection is right. As for my reason for ask- 
ing, I expect I told you fully my reasons for be- 
lieving that Longhurst died by some foul play. I 
may have told you the suspicion which I had as to 
who did it. It was a suspicion for which I was 
sorry afterwards, for I saw reason to think it quite 
unfounded. But I have just seen a man, whom 
I need not name, who must have known when 
and how Longhurst sailed from Nagasaki; and 
he astonished me by saying that he sailed in the 
William the Silent. Now one of three things: 
either I have got muddled in my recollection as 
to what you said, or, which I can hardly believe, 
I was mistaken in my identification of the body 
which I exhumed from the tomb which the chiefs 
showed me, or I was right in both points, and 
then a conclusion seems to follow which I shrink 
very much from drawing. There is one other 
matter of fact which I suspect and which I can 
easily verify, which would absolutely fix the guilt 
on the man I allude to, but I want to make quite 
sure from you that my memory is right as to 
Longhurst's sailing. A suspicion of my man's 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 117 

guilt came to me as I have said, long ago, but 
after making some enquiries I dismissed it sum- 
marily, for I have, or ought to have, a sort of 
hereditary friendship with him.' 3 

So then my hypothesis had been further put 
to the test of facts, and again some of the points 
which I had guessed had proved to be true. It 
was no longer only a fanciful imagination of my 
own, but a suspicion which any sane man with 
the facts before him must feel, and feel very 
strongly. There was more than enough evidence 
for any sensible historian, for a lawyer there was 
still none at all. 

In September the time came that we were to 
leave Long Wilton for good. We then moved 
to a country parish, w r hich, though deep in the 
country, is yet very near to London (and I thence- 
forward often came to town). Naturally leaving 
one parish and getting into another, not to speak 
of the change of house, filled my whole time with 
work to be finished now or never, and with ar- 
rangements which must instantly be set on foot 
for future work. 

Before the close of the year 1896 (I think it 
was late in October, anyway it was some time 
after I had settled into my new parish) , a further 



Il8 TRACKSINTHESNOW 

record of the sort for which I had been looking 
came to light. It was my business as executor 
to sell certain securities which had belonged to 
Peters, and for a long time there was a difficulty 
in finding with whom those securities were lodged. 
Eventually, however, they were found in the 
hands of the firm who had been his agents while 
he was absent in the East, and in sending them 
to me, the firm sent also a packet which they told 
me had been deposited with them for safe keep- 
ing in the year 1884, on the occasion of a brief 
visit home which Peters had made. The packet 
was a large envelope on which was written 
" Notes on the affair of L.' : On opening it I 
found first two maps drawn by Peters. The one 
was a rough copy of a map of the island Sulu, 
in the Philippines, the other a map on a larger 
scale, very carefully drawn, apparently from 
Peters' own survey, of a small portion of the 
island. It was inscribed " Chart showing the 
spot where the tomb of a dead white man was 
shown me by the two chiefs.'' Next I found a 
number of sheets taken out of Peters' journal, 
kept in the year 1882 in the months of July and 
August. From this it appeared that Peters had 
at that time accompanied one Dr. Kuyper, who 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 119 

seemed to have been a naturalist, upon a cruise 
in the Philippines, and that they had come to a 
village upon the coast of the island, where the 
Filipinos informed them that a month or so be- 
fore, a European, they thought an Englishman, 
had come down from somewhere inland, with 
several Malay and Chinese servants, and had 
requested assistance in burying the body of his 
companion. The dead man, he stated, had been 
killed by a fall from some rocks. The Filipino 
chiefs had told Peters that the servants, who had 
not been present when the fall took place, were 
much excited, and seemed suspicious about it, 
but that the manner and the answers of the 
European traveller had allayed their own sus- 
picion. Something, however, seems to have 
aroused suspicion in Peters and Kuyper, for they 
disinterred the body. Peters' journal proceeded 
to record certain facts about the body, the cloth- 
ing, etc. (in particular the fact that a finger was 
missing on one hand) , which had led Peters to 
identify the body as that of his former acquaint- 
ance, Longhurst. He recorded also that they had 
found two bullets from a revolver in the back of 
the head, and he made a note as to the size and 
pattern of revolver which these bullets would fit. 



120 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

Full enquiries were made by Peters and Kuyper 
as to the movements of the surviving traveller, 
who was presumably the murderer, and he ap- 
peared to have sailed, the day after his arrival, 
in a Chinese junk, which took him up at a point 
which was indicated on the chart. Peters had 
recorded also the description which the Filipinos 
gave of this visitor, and it was plain to me that 
there were points in the description which tallied 
with the appearance of Vane-Cartwright. It 
seemed, though the journal after this point was 
fragmentary, that Peters and Kuyper proceeded 
immediately afterwards to Manilla, very likely to 
communicate their discovery to the officers of 
justice. There was nothing more in the journal 
itself which it is worth while to repeat here. 

Next I found a considerable number of notes, 
which were in large part unintelligible to me and 
perhaps to any one except the man who made 
them. There were many abbreviations in them, 
and very often they were illegible. They included 
descriptions of a number of people with outlandish 
names, and particulars as to where and how it 
was supposed they were to be found. Unfor- 
tunately, it was just in these particulars that the 
abbreviations and illegibility made the difficulties 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 121 

of the reader most serious. There were also re- 
corded the movements, or a great part of the 
movements, of a personage called C X/'' in the 
months June to September in the year 1882. 

Further, on a separate sheet of paper, I found 
an indication of the reason why Peters had de- 
sisted from his pursuit of that person X. whom 
I thought myself able to identify. This sheet of 
paper was headed ' ' Description given me of the 
convict Arkell executed at Singapore in Novem- 
ber, 1882.'' The description corresponded very 
well with that given in the journal of the pre- 
sumable murderer of Longhurst, and so far as it 
went it seemed to show that the convict Arkell 
might well have been confused with the success- 
ful and respected financier, William Vane-Cart- 
wright. At the foot of the paper was a note, with 
the dates queried, as to the time when Arkell 
had been, as he seems to have been, on the island 
of Sulu. 

There was also among these papers one which 
began, : These, so far as I can recollect them, 
are the facts told me by MacAndrew in regard 
to the agreement made in 1880 between X. and 
L.' ! Mac Andrew's story had apparently related 
to changes made in the draft of the agreement, at 



122 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

the instance of X., which MacAndrew evidently 
thought that L. had not understood. The note 
seemed to have been finished in haste and to have 
left out some important facts, which Peters no 
doubt carried in his memory. A lawyer, among 
my friends, tells me that without these facts it 
is impossible to be certain what exactly was the 
trick which "X." played upon " L.," and that 
it is even possible to suppose that there was no 
dishonesty at all in his proceedings. 



CHAPTER XIV 

TOWARDS the end of November, 1896, I again saw 
Callaghan. I had some time before ascertained 
that he had returned to London, and I daresay 
it may appear to the reader strange that I should 
not immediately upon his return have sought him 
out and again compared notes with him. But 
(not to mention that I had no reason, so far, to 
set great store upon Callaghan's observations and 
theories) it must be remembered that I had re- 
ceived a very grave warning as to his possible 
character. It is a serious matter for a father of 
a family to enter into intimate relations with a 
gentleman who, according to an eminent special- 
ist, is a homicidal lunatic. So I made first a few 
enquiries from acquaintances of his in regard to 
his character and recent proceedings. For a while 
I intended to put off seeing him till a time, which 
I was now unhappily compelled to foresee, when 

my wife and children would be safe out of the 

123 



: 

124 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

country. But in the end my enquiries and my 
wife's absolute conviction satisfied me that the 
idea of his lunacy was really, as I had at first 
supposed, quite unfounded and foolish. 

Anyway, I at last invited Callaghan to stay 
for a couple of days in our new home. He ac- 
cepted, but for one night only. He arrived in the 
afternoon full of his Parisian adventures and to 
a less extent of his detective researches. With 
these, or with an adorned version of them, he 
entertained me for an hour or so before dinner. 
It seems that his sudden departure for Paris was 
not altogether motiveless. He had, on his arrival 
in London, heard by some accident of a gentle- 
man in Paris who was a correspondent and in- 
timate of Thalberg. He had immediately con- 
ceived the notion of scraping acquaintance with 
this gentleman and using him as a means of in- 
formation about Thalberg, and he was further 
drawn towards Paris by a fancy that he would 
like to study French methods of criminal investi- 
gation, into which, .through the good offices of 
some friends of his, he thought he could get some 
insight. In the latter respect he was gratified. 
Now it seems that he had already begun before 
Peters' death to cherish the ambition of getting 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 125 

high employment in the Criminal Investigation 
Department at Scotland Yard. So it came to pass 
that his studies in the science of criminal investi- 
gation generally, occupied more of his attention 
from that time till our present meeting than the 
particular investigation which had at first fas- 
cinated him. Moreover, before he had been long 
in Paris he discovered, to his huge amusement, 
that he was himself the subject of suspicion and 
of close observation, and without regard to how 
this might affect his cherished ambition of an ap- 
pointment at Scotland Yard, he entered upon, 
and continued during three whole months, an 
elaborate scheme of mystification for the French 
officials who were observing him, and, through 
them, for that very Department in which he 
wished to fill a high place. Nevertheless, he had 
pursued ingenious enquiries in regard to the (as 
I still thought him) unfortunate Thalberg, for 
which purpose he paid several flying visits to 
London and elsewhere. The result of these en- 
quiries he related to me, mingling it up with the 
tale of his other adventures in such a manner that 
it was hard for me to grasp what its importance 
might be. I was able to see that Callaghan had 
employed quite extraordinary ingenuity and pains 



126 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

in picking up the facts about Thalberg which he 
told me, but that very ingenuity struck me as 
ludicrously disproportionate to the importance of 
the facts which he had found, or was ever likely 
to find along this road. Thalberg was a solicitor 
in the City who had been in a small way of busi- 
ness, till the firm of which he was now the sole 
surviving partner began, a good many years be- 
fore, to be employed by Vane-Cartwright. Vane- 
Cartwright got this firm appointed solicitors to a 
company which was formed to take over his 
original venture in the East, and he still con- 
tinued to employ Thalberg from time to time 
upon private business of his own. Thalberg's 
family were interested in Eastern commerce, and 
he had correspondence with many persons in 
various parts of the far East. Years before he had 
transacted for Vane-Cartwright a good deal of 
correspondence of a nature so secret as to be un- 
known to his clerks, and in the course of this very 
year he had again returned to an employment of 
the like kind for some one or other. It appeared 
that it might have been upon an errand con- 
nected with this secret correspondence that he 
had come down to Long Wilton. Callaghan was 
much excited about a discovery which he had 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 127 

made that Thalberg had in January of this year 
been in correspondence with a personage in 
Madrid, telegraphing to him in a cipher employed 
by the Spanish consulate in London, of which 
he was able to make use through an official in 
that Consulate who had since been discharged 
for misconduct and was now in Paris. There was 
more of this nature as to the mysterious proceed- 
ings of Thalberg, but I cannot well remember 
how much Callaghan told me on that occasion, 
and I must observe that I have set down what he 
then told me as I understand it now. I was not 
able to understand it completely at the time 
owing to the fact that throughout his talk that 
afternoon Callaghan did not once allude to Vane- 
Cartwright by his name. 

I wondered then, and I wonder now, how far 
up to this time Callaghan suspected Vane-Cart- 
wright. I believe that he did not like to avow 
to himself the full suspicion that he felt, and that 
this was why he hesitated to name him to me. I 
am sure that in his heart he disliked him very 
much; he had always seemed to do so. But I 
think that, to my Irish friend, Vane-Cartwright 
appeared the embodiment of those characteristics 
of the Englishman which an Irishman knows he 



128 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

dislikes, but thinks that he ought to respect. So 
I should guess that, as long as he could, he had 
dutifully forced himself to believe in Vane-Cart- 
wright as a very estimable person full of English 
rectitude. In any case, for all the pains he took 
to follow up his suspicion that Thalberg was 
somehow connected with the crime, I know that 
he had not fully seen the conclusion to which 
this was leading him. 

When I went up to dress for dinner, I reminded 
my wife of certain passages in Peters' manuscripts 
on psychology which we had read together with 
very great interest. Among these was a curious 
paper on " Imagination, Truth-telling and Ly- 
ing," in which, beginning with the paradox that 
the correct perception of fact depended far more 
on moral qualities, and truthfulness in ordinary 
speech far more on intellectual qualities than was 
generally supposed, he proceeded to describe 
with great wealth of illustration some of the types 
under which races and individual men fall, in 
respect of their power of getting hold of truth and 
of giving it out. Scattered through these pages 
were a number of remarks which came to my 
mind in this talk with Callaghan. With most of 
them I will not trouble the reader, but in one 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW I2Q 

passage in particular Peters had pointed out the 
mistake of thinking that a man who commits 
glaring inaccuracies is necessarily on that account 
not worth listening to. Ludicrous inaccuracies, 
even glaring falsehoods as they may seem, spring 
often, he insisted, from the peculiar abundance 
and vivacity of the impressions which a man re- 
ceives from what passes before his eyes. A per- 
son with this gift may frequently in his memory 
put something that he has truly noticed into a 
wrong connection, or combine two scattered frag- 
ments of observation, true in themselves, into a 
single totally erroneous recollection of fact. But 
a man who gets things wrong in this way, is, said 
Peters, often more full of information than a more 
sober observer, because he has noticed far more, 
and after all, a very large part of what he has 
noticed is sure to be accurately retained. In 
another passage, which I am afraid I may mar 
by summarising it, Peters described how, with 
all men in some degree, but with some men in 
a wonderful degree, intellectual faculties are the 
servants of emotional interests, so that not only 
the power of inference, but even memory itself 
will do work at the bidding of pain or pleasure, 
liking or dislike, which it will not do upon a 



13 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

merely rational demand. Reminding my wife of 
this, I said I wished I knew by what test I could 
tell the true from the false in Callaghan's remin- 
iscences, and by what spell I could turn the flow 
of those reminiscences into the channel in which 
they would be useful. 

As we went down to dinner she whispered to 
me that, if Callaghan was the sort of man that 
I seemed to think, she would try to turn his 
thoughts in the useful direction; only I must let 
him alone for a little while. In the course of 
dinner, she told our guest what she had told me 
long before about Vane-Cartwright's engage- 
ment, and how it had been broken off, and just 
what the young lady had said to her. Only of 
course she did not go on to tell him the rash 
inference which she had drawn as to Vane-Cart- 
wright's guilt. I could see that Callaghan heard 
her with strange emotion, but my wife speedily 
turned the conversation on to more common- 
place topics, upon which, during the remainder 
of dinner, he responded to her brightly enough, 
but by no means with his usual appearance of 
interest. 

After dinner Callaghan and I retired to my 
study to smoke pipes. He sat for a long while 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 131 

silent, and I thought that he had gone to sleep, 
or should have thought so but for the contraction 
of his brows. Suddenly he sat upright in his 
chair. " Faith! " he exclaimed with great energy, 
and with the air of a man to whom a really 
thrilling thought has just occurred, ' I know 
what became of those eyeglasses of mine." 
"What eyeglasses? ' I asked, disappointed and 
annoyed at the triviality of what came forth as 
the issue of his cogitation. "Why," he said, 
" I once took for a short time to wearing eye- 
glasses. I was looking at the stars with a man 
one night and I found I could not count seven 
Pleiades. So I went to an oculist who said he 
would pass me for the Navy, but as I was paying 
him a fee I might take a prescription for a pair 
of double eyeglasses which I never could keep 
steady on my nose." "Well?' I said sulkily. 
"Well," he answered, "it is only that I lost 
them while I was staying with Peters. Of course 
they went into that big despatch-box, which Vane- 
Cartwright always kept in his room. My dear 
Mr. Driver," he said in a more serious tone, 
"do you really suppose that Vane-Cartwright 
had not possessed himself of something handy 
for throwing suspicion upon you, if you had 



132 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

turned out to be the convenient man? I might 
easily have been the convenient man, and in that 
case, the morning after the murder, my eyeglasses 
would have been found smashed and lying on the 
floor of Peters' bedroom, as if he had knocked 
them off in struggling with me. Only (for- 
tunately for you and me, Mr. Driver), Trethewy 
was chosen as the suitable man, and accidents 
that we know of prevented the plot against 
Trethewy working as well as perhaps the plot 
against you or me might have worked. Well/ 3 
he continued with a smile, <f I have a good deal 
more to tell you about Mr. Thalberg, but that 
will keep for a bit, and we shall understand it 
better later. I suspect there is something different 
that you wanted to ask me about now." 

I asked him for anything that he remembered 
of that evening when Vane-Cartwright had first 
visited Peters at Long Wilton, while Callaghan 
was already staying in the house. He recounted 
to me and to my wife, whom we called in, the 
conversation and events of that evening in great 
detail. An indescribable change seemed to have 
come over him for a time; not only was the 
matter which he had to relate weighty, but the 
man himself gave me an impression of force and 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 133 

character which I had not previously suspected. 
I repeat only so much of his narrative as was of 
special interest for my purpose. 'After a bit, 53 
said Callaghan, " Peters and Vane-Cartwright 
got away on to the subject of their experiences 
in some Cannibal Islands, or French possessions, 
or I do not know where. I was not much inter- 
ested, and I dozed a bit, till suddenly I was 
aroused and saw that there was something up. 
I do not know what Vane-Cartwright had said, 
but suddenly Peters said, 'Sailed in what?* 
three times as quick and three times as loud as 
his usual way of speaking. That was what woke 
me up. ' In the ' I don't remember the name, 
I did not quite catch it, for Vane-Cartwright was 
speaking very quietly, though I could see that his 
face was set hard and that his eyes were bright, 
and I began to think he did not look such a dull 
fellow as I thought him at first. Peters said 
nothing but 'Oh/ and this time very quietly. 
Then he got up and strode slowly about the room 
with his hands clenched. He did not seem to 
notice Vane-Cartwright much, and Vane-Cart- 
wright went on talking, in as indifferent a way 
as he could, about cyclones and things, the usual 
sort of travellers' talk, only without the lies that 



134 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

I should have thrown in; but he was watching 
Peters all the time like a cat. After a while 
Peters sat down again and seemed quite com- 
posed, and talked again in quite a friendly way, 
but it seemed to be an effort. Then he went and 
wrote a letter at the other end of the room, two 
letters rather; one I noticed was addressed to 
Bombay, or Beirut, or somewhere beginning with 
a B. Both the letters had twopenny-halfpenny 
stamps on them. Soon it was bedtime; but Peters 
was for taking his letters down to the post that 
they might go early in the morning, and Vane- 
Cartwright was very anxious to take the letters 
for him, as it would be very little out of his way 
to go down to the post. Peters thanked him in 
that very polite way which he had with him when 
he did feel really obstinate. I was not going with 
them, for I thought I was in the way, but, just 
as he was leaving, Peters turned back and asked 
me rather pressingly to come too. I suppose he 
would have felt lonely in that man's company, 
for certainly he did not want to talk to me. I do 
not think he said more than two words to me after 
we parted from Vane-Cartwright, who, by the 
way, kept with us all the way to the post office, 
which was not on his way home; but, just as we 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 135 

were getting back, Peters said to me suddenly, 
' Let me see, did I ask him to stay with me next 
time he came here?' 'I do not know,' said I. 
'Well, good-night,' said he." 

At this point I broke in upon Callaghan's story 
with loud regrets that Peters had written those 
letters with the murderer in the room, " For you 
know what those letters were about, " I added, 
remembering that he did not. " I know/' said 
he, " but he could not help it; he was an English- 
man. You English always show your hand. Not 
because you are frank and outspoken, for you are 
anything but that, but because you are so proud. 
You know," he went on, " that I have a devout 
belief in the English qualities that all we Irish 
hear so much about; but when I had an English- 
man for my dearest friend, I could not help 
noticing the national defects, could I? I could 
not have acted as Peters did. I rather hope that 
when I had got scent of the fellow's dirty secret 
whatever it was, for I have not a notion about 
that I would have exploded at once and had it 
out with him. I daresay I should not, but, if I 
had not, at least I should have taken the trouble 
to dissemble properly.' 3 " If he had done either," 
I said, "he would be alive to-day, and Vane- 



136 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

Cartwright would not be a murderer, or at least 

1 1 understand you," said he. 
He continued his story, and related with great 
detail what was done and said day by day during 
Vane-Cartwright's calamitous sojourn in Peters' 
house when he returned to stay there. He de- 
scribed the relations of the two men as being 
exactly the reverse of what they had been when 
he had formerly seen them together. Then 
Peters had been genial and friendly, Vane-Cart- 
wright stiff and unforthcoming. Now it was very 
much the other way. Several times, it appeared, 
the conversation had got upon the subject of 
Peters' Eastern travels. Each time the con- 
versation had been led thither by Vane-Cart- 
wright in a way of which I was afterwards to have 
experience. Peters was in a manner compelled 
to enter into it and compelled to yield information 
which Callaghan at the moment had thought 
utterly trivial, but which he now saw clearly 
Vane-Cartwright was anxious to possess. The 
information which was extracted seems to have 
related to all the places that Peters had visited in 
the East, and all the people whom he had ever 
met, and Callaghan remembered, or fancied, that 
several times, while he was being thus drawn out, 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 137 

Peters showed curious irritation. It appeared 
most strikingly from Callaghan's recital that 
Vane-Cartwright had throughout shown the 
coolest readiness to talk about the scene of his 
crime, if he had committed one, and to take 
Peters' recollection back to the old days of his 
association with Longhurst. 

But now I must explain that through all that 
Callaghan told me, ran the same strain of odd 
and fantastic inaccuracy to which I have more 
than once alluded. Several times, for example, 
he said that I was present at conversations at 
which I certainly was not present. He repeated 
to me remarks of my own, which, if I ever said 
anything like them, were made on a totally dif- 
ferent occasion from that of which he spoke. One 
of those remarks had really been made within 
three hours of the time when he repeated it to me, 
and could not have been made previously. This 
is perhaps the best example that I can give of 
what caused me a most exasperating sense of 
disappointment. Disappointment because, where 
I could not check him, Callaghan seemed to be 
supplying me, in the greatest fulness and in the 
most credible manner, with just the information 
that I desired; but where I could check him, 



138 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

though he was now and then curiously accurate 
in his recollection of circumstances well known 
to me, which I had not thought he could have 
observed, it still more often happened that he was 
under some grotesque mistake. 

Worst of all, he gave me new details about the 
fatal night, which, if they could have been trusted, 
would have had greater weight than any other 
piece of evidence that had yet come to me, but 
they were just of the sort in which he was likely 
to be mistaken. Speaking of the moment at which 
he was called out from his room by the disturb- 
ance in the street, he declared that knocking 
immediately at Vane-Cartwright's door he heard, 
as Vane-Cartwright answered from the far corner 
of the room, a click which he was certain came 
from the lock of the despatch-box which he had 
mentioned. He conjectured that among various 
articles which were there for a dark purpose, the 
knife which was the instrument of Peters' death 
lay in that box, and that he had interrupted Vane- 
Cartwright in the act of taking it forth. This of 
course was mere conjecture, but what followed 
seemed at first evidence enough to have hanged 
the criminal. He had opened Vane-Cartwright's 
door, and he now described to me almost every 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 139 

object that was in the room as he entered it. 
Amongst others there lay upon the chest of 
drawers George Borrow 's Bible in Spain in a 
binding which he described. Curiously enough 
he did not know the significance of this; he had, 
as he told me, been so much overwhelmed with 
grief when the murder was discovered that he 
had hardly begun to see or think distinctly till 
after we had all left the room of death; but as 
the reader may remember, this was the very 
book (and it was bound in the same way) which 
was found in that room dropped from the dead 
man's hand with torn and crumpled leaves. 
Who but Vane-Cartwright could have brought 
it there? 

It was one of Peters' oddities, well known to 
me (and perhaps Vane-Cartwright had learnt 
it long ago at Saigon), that he would have 
welcomed at any strange hour the incursion of 
a friend to talk about anything. No doubt, I 
thought, Vane-Cartwright entered his room on 
the pretext of showing him a passage which bore 
on something he had said. Probably between the 
leaves of the Bible in Spain he carried something 
that looked like a paper-knife. Anyway here 
was proof that after the hour at which either of 



140 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

us saw Peters alive, after Vane-Cartwright, by 
his own account, had last seen him, that man 
entered Peters' room. " But/ 3 I exclaimed, as 
all this ran through my mind, "you spoke just 
now of the day when I was riding at Long Wilton, 
whereas I was on a horse to-day for the first 
time for four years. Ten times at least I have 
known you put things out of time or out of place 
just like that, by way of giving colour to your 
story. How do I know that you have not done 
so now, that you did not really see that book in 
Vane- Cart wright's room any one of the other 
times that you went there, that it had not been 
back in Peters' library and been brought up 
again by Peters himself?' 

To my surprise Callaghan answered most 
humbly. He was quite aware, he said, of this 
evil trick of his mind; he had had it from a boy, 
and his parents ought to have flogged it out of 
him. As to the particular point on which I chal- 
lenged him, he could not himself be quite sure. 

During the remainder of his stay with me I 
gave him an outline of what I had so far dis- 
covered, and we compared notes upon it, but he 
was not long with me, as he had an important 
engagement next evening, and our conference 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 141 

was not so full as it should have been. So it 
easily happened that neither of us gained the 
enlightenment which he might have gained if our 
talk had been fuller. But I must confess that I 
fell into the fault which he called English. My 
disclosure was more incomplete than it need 
have been; I had not quite got over my instinctive 
wish to keep him at arm's length, and my pride 
rebelled a little at the discovery that this erratic 
Irishman was not a man whom I could afford to 
patronise. 



CHAPTER XV 

THE chapter which I am about to write may well 
prove dreary. It will be nothing but a record 
of two deaths and of much discouragement. 
Here was I with my theory (for it had been no 
more) grown into a fairly connected history 
which so appealed at many points to a rational 
judgment as to leave little room for doubt of its 
truth. And yet, as I could not but see, there 
was very little in it at present which could form 
even a part of the evidence necessary to convict 
Vane-Cartwright in a Court of Law. I deter- 
mined all the same to get advice upon the matter 
from a lawyer, who was my friend, thinking that 
it was now time to put my materials in the hands 
of the authorities charged with the detection of 
crime, and that, with this to start upon, and with 
the skill and resources which they possessed, 
they could hardly fail before long to discover the 

evidence needed for a prosecution. But my 

142 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 143 

lawyer friend, though he quite agreed with me in 
my conviction that Vane-Cartwright was guilty 
of two murders, doubted whether the facts which 
I had got together would move the authorities to 
take up the matter actively. Still he undertook, 
with my approval, to talk about the subject with 
some one in the Public Prosecutor's office or in 
the Criminal Investigation Department of Scot- 
land Yard, I do not know which. Nothing re- 
sulted from this, and the failure needs little 
explanation. Some want of touch between town 
and country police, some want of eagerness on 
the part of a skilled official who had lately in- 
curred blame and disappointment through the 
ludicrous failure of a keen pursuit upon a some- 
what similar trail, these might account for it all. 
But besides, Callaghan had been beforehand 
with us, and on this occasion had managed to 
raise a spirit of incredulity about it all. Perhaps 
too even hardened experts recoiled instinctively 
from associating with guilt one of the few great 
men of finance who were at once well known 
to the outside public and respected in the City 
itself. 

For me then there was nothing but to wait for 
the further things which I somehow felt certain 



144 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

would turn up. As for Callaghan it happened 
just about this time that he became keenly 
enamoured of an invention, made by an engineer 
friend of his, through which he persuaded him- 
self that he could make his own and his friend's 
fortune. Henceforward for some time the af- 
fair of Peters seems to have passed from his 
mind, and he was prevented from meeting me at 
the few times at which I should have been able 
to see him. 

In the course of December I had a letter 
from my old parish from a friend who was kind 
enough to keep me posted in the gossip of the 
place. He said that the police were now busy 
over a new clue as to the murder. It may be 
remembered that according to Trethewy he had, 
as he returned home on the night of the murder, 
been passed in the lane by a man riding a horse 
and leading another. Well, report said now that 
a man in a neighbouring parish, who had been 
greatly excited about the murder at the time, had 
been having dreams about it night after night, 
which impressed him with the notion that he 
was to discover the truth. Rooting about for all 
the recollections of that time which he could find 
among his neighbours, he heard that in the early 



TRACKSINTHESNOW 145 

morning after the murder a man with two horses 
had been seen between Peters' house and the 
village, that another man, a stranger to the 
village, had come up from the direction of Peters' 
house and had mounted the second horse, and 
that the two had ridden off together. Report added 
that the man whom Trethewy had seen had now 
been traced by the police, and that his answers 
as to the man who had joined him and ridden off 
with him were unsatisfactory and suspicious; and 
it added one more telling detail. The police (as 
I may have mentioned) had before I left Long 
Wilton noticed one window at the back of the 
house as in some respects the readiest way by 
which the house could have been wrongfully 
entered. It belonged to a housemaid's closet, of 
which the door did not shut properly. It was 
very easy to climb up to it; but then the window 
itself was very small, and it was a question 
whether a man of ordinary stature could possibly 
have squeezed himself through it; now the 
strange man of this rumour was described as 
being ridiculously small and thin. There were 
many more picturesque details related, but the 
whole story professed only to consist of unsifted 
rumour. I believed little of it, but I naturally 



146 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

did accept the statement (quite mistaken) that 
the police were busy in the matter. With my 
fixed idea about Vane-Cartwright, I felt sure 
that they were upon a false scent. But I thought 
it very likely that this would for the present 
absorb their attention, and, between this and 
the great pressure of work in a new parish and 
of certain family anxieties, I made no further 
attempt at this time to secure attention to the dis- 
covery which I believed I had made. 

Twice in the few weeks just before Christmas 
my hopes of making further discoveries were 
vainly aroused. I made a call of civility in my 
new parish upon a notable Nonconformist pa- 
rishioner, and, in my rapid survey of his sitting- 
room before he came to me, I noticed several 
indications that he had been in Australia, and 
saw on the mantelpiece a framed photograph. 
It was rather a hazy and faded photograph 
which gave me no clear impression of its sub- 
ject, but under it was written, ' Walter Long- 
hurst, Melbourne, 3rd April, 1875." Could 
that be my Longhurst, and was this one of those 
relations of his, whom, as 1 had heard, Vane- 
Cartwright had treated with suspicious gener- 
osity? Might he not, in that case, be the pos- 



TRACKSINTHESNOW 147 

sessor of information more valuable than he 
knew? He now came in. He was a truly 
venerable man, who in spite of great age was 
still active as a lay-preacher of one of the 
Methodist Churches, and I was attracted by 
the archaic but evidently sincere piety of his 
greeting when he entered the room. But unfor- 
tunately, when by adjusting his gold spectacles 
he had discovered of what profession I was, a 
cloud of suspicion seemed to arise in his mind, 
and he was more anxious to testify, in all charity 
but with all plain dealing, concerning priestly 
pretensions and concerning that educational 
policy which was then beginning to gather 
strength, than to enter into any such conversa- 
tion as I desired. I made out, nevertheless, that 
this Walter Longhurst was probably my Long- 
hurst, and my expectation rose unreasonably. My 
new friend (if he will let me call him so) was 
no relation of his, but had known him at a time 
when both were in Australia. Longhurst was 
from his point of view outside the fold besides 
being a rough kind of man, or, as he put it, a 
' careless liver "; but he evidently flattered him- 
self that he had exercised a good influence over 
Longhurst, and the latter had given money, 



148 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

which he could then ill afford, though he made a 
good deal of money later, to help religious work 
with which my lay-preaching friend was con- 
nected. Later on, when my informant had re- 
turned to England and was for some time in- 
capacitated by an accident which happened on 
the voyage, Longhurst, to his surprise, had from 
time to time sent him presents of money. They 
came in the form of banknotes, sent by a mys- 
terious agent in London, who gave no address 
to which they could be returned, but who wrote 
stating Longhurst's desire that he should use 
them for himself, or, if he absolutely would not, 
should at least use them in his work. All this 
the old man's gratitude obliged him to relate, 
but, when I pressed him for information about 
Longhurst's relations or friends, either he knew 
nothing or his ill-defined suspicion of me returned 
and shut his mouth. I did, however, ascertain 
that some years before (after Longhurst's death) 
a rich gentleman, whose name the old man had 
forgotten, though I thought I could supply it, 
had heard of him in some way as one of Long- 
hurst's beneficiaries, and pressed upon him a 
pension which he had refused, as he would, if he 
could, have refused Longhurst's bounty. 



TRACKSINTHESNOW 149 

Two days later, on Christmas Eve, I was 
urgently summoned to visit Peters' aunt, Miss 
Waterston, whom I had seen at his funeral. I 
had called upon her in the summer at her flat in 
London, but a lady who was staying with her 
remained in the room all the time, in spite, as I 
thought, of several hints that she might go, and 
Miss Waterston, when I left, said how glad she 
would be to see me again, and, she hoped, talk 
with me more fully. I took little note of this at 
the time, but I made up my mind to take my 
wife to see the old lady when I could, and con- 
tinued thinking of it and putting it off till I got 
this summons, which told me that Miss Waterston 
was very ill and had something which she much 
wished to tell me. When I arrived at her flat 
she was dead. The lady who had been looking 
after her told me that she had several times 
shown anxiety that I should come soon, but had 
at last remarked that if I did not come in time 
she would accept it as a sign that what she had 
meant to tell me was best untold. She had two 
weeks before, when she was not yet ill, remarked 
that she would like to see me soon. Various 
straws of things that were told me about her 
suggested that she had lately become concerned 



150 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

afresh about her nephew's death. She had been 
intimate with the Cartwright family, and had to 
the end seen something of a rather neglected 
widowed cousin of William Vane-Cartwright's. 
Of course I have no ground for thinking that she 
had any grave disclosure to make to me. 

Christmas, that year, came sadly to me. We 
must in any case have been full of memories of 
the last Christmas, at which Peters had joined 
our party and added much to the children's and 
our own delight. This Christmas he was dead; 
the hope, not perhaps consonant with Christmas 
thoughts, of avenging him had arisen in my mind 
and was dying, and I came home from the death- 
bed of the last remaining person of his kin who 
had loved him better than we did, and who in the 
little I had seen of her had reflected to me some 
indefinable trace of the same noble qualities as 
I discovered in him. 

I attended her funeral. So did the old cousin 
who had come with her to Peters' funeral. He 
recognised me and greeted me courteously, re- 
marking what a charming person that Mr. Vane- 
Cartwright was whom he had met at my house. 
He looked to me older; his previously grey hair 
was mysteriously turning auburn ; he was as un- 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 151 

attractive to me as the rest of the appanage of 
funerals, but I was grateful to him for being one 
of the very few who came to honour the remains 
of the old woman, almost a stranger to me, whom 
I yet so truly respected. 

By the time the anniversary of Peters' death 
came round I was again alone; it had been 
necessary after Christmas that my daughter 
should go South, and my wife had taken her. I 
was busy and therefore happy enough, and I 
did not often but I did sometimes ask myself, 
would nothing more ever turn up? Yes, before 
long something did turn up; something not to 
help me on but to show me that, in thinking ever 
to unravel the dark history of Longhurst's fate, 
I had started upon a hopeless task. Early in 
February a letter came to me re-directed to Peters 
from the dead letter office at Siena, where it had 
long lain entombed. It was a letter written by 
Peters to a certain Reverend James Verschoyle, 
D.D., addressing him as a person Peters well 
knew and had seen quite lately. It bore the date 
of Vane-Cartwright's first evening at Grenvile 
Combe. It reminded Dr. Verschoyle of a conver- 
sation which he had had with Peters, at their last 
meeting, about a very mysterious event in the 



I5 2 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

Philippines, and of the great surprise which Peters 
had expressed at what Verschoyle then told him. 
" To tell the truth," said Peters, " it should have 
revived a suspicion which I had long ago enter- 
tained against a man who was once my friend. 
Or rather, it should have done more than that, 
it should have convinced me of his guilt and 
given me the means of proving it. How I came 
to put it from my mind I hardly know. I think 
that my recollection of what you told me is pre- 
cise, but I should be greatly obliged if you would 
refer to your journals of the months May to 
October, 1882, and perhaps you will oblige me 
by copying out for me all that has any bearing 
on this matter. I am sorry to trouble you, but 
I am convinced that the ends of justice may be 
served by your doing this for me, and I suspect 
that if they are to be served, I must act as quickly 
as I may." 

I lost no time in tracing the Rev. James 
Verschoyle, D.D., who had about a year before 
been at Siena. He had, after a sojourn in Ger- 
many, come back to England. He had, I found, 
been a missionary in the East. I managed to 
trace him to his latest address, only to find that 
he had died in the previous August. I had an 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW J 53 

interview with some of his family, and found them 
most obligingly willing to search for the journals 
in question. It was strange that the journals for 
the years 1881 to 1883 could nowhere be found. 
I was convinced that they had contained those 
crucial facts to which Peters had referred in his 
letter to Bryanston. 

Evidently there had been information in Dr. 
Verschoyle's possession which in Peters' hands 
might have led to the conviction of Vane-Cart- 
wright. Evidently Peters had once seen that 
information, but had disregarded it, more or -less 
wilfully, in his determination to think his old 
acquaintance innocent, and to put the guilt on 
Arkell who had been hanged at Singapore. 
Evidently the full significance of Verschoyle's 
facts came to his mind when Vane-Cartwright, 
that evening at Grenvile Combe, had revived 
his first suspicion, and he wrote at once to 
recover the precise details. But of what nature 
that information was, and how Vane-Cartwright, 
seeing Verschoyle's name on an envelope, could 
have grasped the full extent of the danger to 
himself, I could not guess then, and I cannot 
guess now. 



CHAPTER XVI 

So then the mystery of Longhurst's fate was not 
for me to unravel. Peters had held the clue of 
it, and had died because he held it; Verschoyle 
perhaps had the clue and was dead too, probably 
from some other cause; neither had recorded his 
secret, or the record could not be found. As for 
the manner of Peters' death, what further place 
was there to look in for some fresh discovery? I 
already had heard all that any of my old pa- 
rishioners, any grown man or woman among 
them, knew, and it was less than I knew, and I 
had searched the neighbourhood for news, 
quietly, but I hoped no less effectively; the 
police, I was now ready to believe, had searched 
as zealously and more wisely. And so Vane- 
Cartwright was to go unhanged, and why not, 
after all? he was not a homicidal maniac but a 
wise criminal, rather more unlikely than most 

men to commit any further crime. Even his gains, 

154 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 155 

however ill-gotten, were not likely to be more 
harmfully spent than those of many a better man. 
And no innocent man suffered under suspicion. 
Trethewy had been found a good place by some 
unlooked-for benefactor, where no memory of 
the crime would pursue him. Callaghan's 
numerous enough friends understood him far too 
well to suspect him, and as for his numerous 
acquaintances who were not friends, if they did 
suspect him, the good man would be rather 
amused than otherwise. Let Vane-Cartwright 
live and adorn society which is adorned by men 
and women worse than he, to whom circum- 
stances have never brought the opportunity of 
dramatic wrong-doing. 

Thus I tried to think, as I left England for 
a few weeks in the late spring of 1897 to join 
my wife and our daughter, who was now much 
stronger, in Italy; but, whatever I tried to 
think, I had always with me that consciousness 
of a purpose frustrated or let go, which is per- 
haps the hardest thing to bear well and the most 
enervating thing to bear ill. 

Some ten days later I was in Florence with 
my wife. The next day we were to go to Rome, 
leaving our daughter at the villa of a friend in 



I5 6 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

Fiesole. I remember at our early breakfast tell- 
ing my wife the facts or reports which I had been 
picking up about that strangely powerful secret 
organisation, the Mafia. I repeated to her what 
I had just heard, that not only prominent Italian 
politicians, but even foreigners who had large 
commercial dealings with Italy, sometimes found 
it convenient to be on good terms with that 
society. But she was little interested in political 
facts which did not connect themselves with any 
particular personality, and I thought she had 
hardly heard me, though she raised her eyes to 
listen from the volume of Senator Villari's 
Savonarola which she was finishing. I little 
imagined that before another day had closed this 
chance remark of mine would have acquired the 
closest personal interest for her, and have been 
turned by her to very practical account. 

Later in the day she was in the Pitti Galleries, 
and I came there from Cook's office to join her. 
She was looking with puzzled interest at a 
picture by Botticelli, when a tall man, dressed 
like an Englishman, placed himself with assumed 
unconsciousness just in front of her, in a position 
of vantage for fixing his connoisseur's gaze upon 
it. She turned away, met me coming in, and began 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 157 

saying, half-amused, that after all there were Eng- 
lishmen who could be as rude as any foreigner, 
when, looking at him again as he moved away 
to leave the gallery, she started and said: " Oh, 
Robert, I know his face." Of course I looked. 
I too knew his face, and knew, as she did not, 
his name. " It is that dreadful man that I told 
you about who was at Crema. Do not you 
remember I told you how he would keep the 
only good room at the hotel when I arrived 
there with mother so terribly ill, the time she 
had that first stroke. And oh, I took such 
pains to write him the nicest note I could ' 
and very nice her notes could be " and I 
could just see his horrid face as he glanced at 
it and said nothing but ' tell the lady I cannot ' 
to the waiter. And oh, poor mother did suffer in 
the dreadful hot room with all the kitchen noises 
and the smells/' I did remember her story well, 
an ordinary story enough, of one of those neglects 
of courtesy which, once in fifty times it may be, 
are neglects of elementary mercy; but I said 
little, and I did not tell her that her rediscovered 
enemy was my enemy already, William Vane- 
Cartwright. I said to myself that I would not 
tell her because she would feel an unreasonable 



158 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

relenting towards Vane-Cartwright, if once she 
realised that she herself owed him a grudge. 
Really I did not tell her because I had promptly 
formed a design which she would have discovered 
and disapproved. 

That evening I left my wife on some pretext, 
and having discovered Vane-Cartwright 's hotel, 
I paid him a friendly call. I suppose it was dis- 
honourable; at least, I have often reproached 
myself for it, but truly I do not know if it was 
really dishonourable. I do know that I was 
very foolish to dream, as I did, that I should 
ferret something out of him. He received me 
in his private sitting-room with cordiality, or, I 
should rather say, effusiveness. He sent a rather 
urgent message to his friend who was travelling 
with him, as if (I thought) he did not wish to be 
alone with me, but he was far from embarrassed. 
" Tell me, Mr. Driver/' he began, as soon as 
we were seated, "has anything further been 
heard about the murder of our friend Peters?' 
I answered that Trethewy had been released and 
had left the neighbourhood, having found a situa- 
tion, through some friends unknown to me, and 
that to the best of my belief, the police had dis- 
covered no further clue. " I am glad about 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 159 

Trethewy," he said. " You know I always sus- 
pected there had been some mistake there, and 
besides, I always liked the man. I do not think 
the police will discover a clue,' 3 he said, ' I 
rather think that the solution of the mystery will 
occur to some of us, his friends, if a solution ever 
is found." I was silent. I could not tell whether he 
had a design to allay possible suspicions of mine, 
or a design to goad me into betraying whether 
I had those suspicions, or whether he was merely 
keeping himself in practice. I wanted to drop 
the subject if I could. " Do you know/' he per- 
sisted, " whether they have found any other way 
in which the house could be entered from outside 
except the window of his room, by which I don't 
believe the murderer did enter?' I said there 
was a small window to a housemaid's closet 
which was not fastened, and that the housemaid 
could not be quite certain that the door of the 
closet was really locked overnight, for it did not 
shut properly; but it was very doubtful whether 
a man could get through the window. "Who in 
the world," he said, "could have a motive for 
killing Peters, dear old Eustace Peters?' I 
was beginning to lose my head, for I felt I was 
playing an unworthy part. "Well," I said, with 



160 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

no particular purpose, "it seems certain that it 
cannot have been Mr. Thalberg." "Certain, I 
should say," he answered. " Oh, no," he added, 
more energetically, " I know Thalberg well, and 
he is not the man. As for Callaghan, one might 
as well suspect you or me me, I should say," 
and he turned away to fetch a cigar, or perhaps 
to watch me for a moment in the mirror. " The 
fact is," he said returning, " it must be far easier 
than we, who have never had occasion to give 
our wits to it, think to commit a murder and 
hide one's tracks absolutely. But here is Mr. 
Poile, let me introduce you, and let us, for 
Heaven's sake, talk of a more cheerful subject. J: 
So we did turn to a subject which I should have 
thought had no pitfalls, the subject of Italian 
brocades, of which Vane-Cartwright was an 
amateur. He produced a large parcel of ancient 
and gorgeous stuffs which had come up on ap- 
proval from a shop. He talked, in a way that 
really held all my interest for the time, about the 
patterns; and, starting from the more conven- 
tional of the designs before us, he proceeded to 
discuss the history of common patterns, telling 
me curious things about the patterns and the 
fabrics of the Eastern Archipelago and the Malay 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW l6l 

Peninsula. Suddenly he picked up a really noble 
piece of brocade, and turning to me, with a face 
of winning simplicity and kindliness which he 
could not have learnt to assume if it had not at 
some time been natural, he said: "Oh, Mr. 
Driver, I am so fond of picking up these things, 
and it is so hard to find any satisfactory use for 
them, it would be a real kindness if you would 
accept this as an altar-cloth for your church. It 
will be wasted in a museum otherwise." It was 
too much for me. The proposition that I should 
accept an altar-cloth for my church from the man 
that I was seeking to convict of murder, sent a 
visible shudder through my frame, and all the 
more because I felt that it was illogical to recoil 
from this when I had not recoiled from affecting 
friendship to him. I said " No " quite violently, 
and, when I collected my wits to utter thanks 
and explanations, they were at once too effusive 
and too lame to have blinded a stupider man than 
Vane-Cartwright. 

I stayed long with him should have outstayed 
my welcome, if I had ever been welcome for I 
was demoralised, and had resolved in mere dull 
obstinacy both to disarm his suspicions somehow 
and to get something out of him. The first would 

6 



162 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

have been impossible for any one, the second was 
impossible for me then, and at last I took leave, 
praying him not to come down with me, and 
descended the stairs a very miserable man. I had 
behaved stupidly, that was certain. I had be- 
haved badly, that was possible. I had shown him 
that I suspected him, that was certain. I ought 
to have known beforehand that he would guess it, 
for my refusal to visit him in London (as I hap- 
pened to have promised I would, before he left 
Long Wilton) had been marked enough to set 
him thinking. Had I done nothing worse than 
betray vague suspicions ? Yes, in my floundering 
efforts I had recurred to his Eastern patterns, 
and so led him to Eastern travels and towards 
topics dangerous to him, only to fall into my own 
trap. He must have seen that I had somehow 
heard before, as not one Englishman in twenty 
thousand has heard, of the little island of Sulu. 
Wholly sick with myself I stood in the hall 
of the hotel, absently watching the porter set 
out the newly arrived letters in little heaps on 
a table. There was one for Vane-Cartwright. 
Had I not noticed that handwriting before? 
Yes, it was a marked hand, one so obviously 
that of a servant and yet so well-formed and 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 163 

with such an elegance. I gazed at the hand- 
writing (somehow I thought of Sunday schools). 
I had just time to note the postmark before 
another letter covered it. 

The corner of my eye had half-caught a 
vision of some one coming downstairs, coming 
very quietly but very quickly. A light step on 
the rug beside me, an unpleasantly gentle hand 
taking my arm, the fingers, I half-fancied, seem- 
ing to take measure of the size and hardness of 
my muscle, and Vane-Cartwright's too cultivated 
voice saying lightly, " Looking to see if there is 
any one else that you know coming to the hotel, 
Mr. Driver? I always do that. Well, good-night 
again, and so many thanks. J: " Caught again," 
I reflected, as I turned into the street, and noth- 
ing gained by spying and being caught spying. 
Yes, something gained. That letter for Vane- 
Cartwright with the postmark Crondall is in the 
handwriting of Mrs. Trethewy. 



One question alone occupied me as I walked 
back: What was the exact significance of the 
almost certain fact that the situation which the 
Trethewvs had obtained was reallv in Vane- 



164 TRACKS IX THE SNOW 

Cartwright's service? Had I learnt that fact a 
day sooner, I might have thought that, murderer 
or not, he had done a true and unobtrusive kind- 
ness in secretly engaging them, but the little 
scene in the Pitti, and the trivial story of the best 
bedroom at Crema, shut that explanation out of 
my mind. I had not resolved this question when 
I got to the hotel and to my wife, who was now 
anxiously expecting me. I had not even thought 
of the other questions to which it led, but I had 
at least returned in far too sensible a mood to 
think any further of disguising anything from 
her. Our talk lasted well into the night. I record 
so much of the substance of its close as really 
concerns my story. " But still I do not see,' 3 I 
said, "why you should say I have spoilt our 
holiday/ 1 " Because you must go by the first 
train to-morrow. Not a moment later. Oh, 
Robert, cannot you see why I have been so angry? 
I have looked forward so to our stay alone to- 
gether at Rome, and at another time I should 
be very angry to lose it; but it is not that. Oh, 
Robert, I could find it in my heart to beg you 
not to do your duty. It is your duty; you would 
not be so full of passion against the man if it was 
not that you knew it was your duty; and I know 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 165 

it too, and you must follow up that clue at once 
before he makes it too late. But, oh, what am I 
saying? It is not your duty I am thinking of. I 
would beg you to let the duty be if that would 
save you. But it is too late now; it's a race for 
life between you and him. Peters has been killed, 
and Verschoyle has been killed, and oh! ' 

The thought was not in the least new to me 
except so far as it concerned Verschoyle. I had 
foreseen a time when my life would be in danger 
from Vane-Cartwright. Stupid as it may seem, 
I had not realised yet that that time was now, 
and anyway I had resolved to treat it lightly 
myself, and hoped that it might not occur to her. 
We spent a while without words. Then I said, 
in the foolish persuasion that it was a manly 
utterance : " I do not think that I am brave, but 
somehow the idea of being murdered, even if I 
put the likelihood of it far higher than I do, is 
not one which, apart from the thought of you, 
would weigh much with me." Whatever I may 
have been going to add, I was allowed to go no 
further. I was made to see in a minute that the 
risk to my life was a real consideration which it 
was selfish and, in a man of normal courage, very 
cheap to overlook; but anyway, the need for 



166 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

haste was real, and, after a very short rest, I was 
to start. To get ahead of Vane-Cartwright, who 
would probably look out for my departure, I had 
resolved to take horses and carriage in the early 
morning, post to Prato, and take the railway 
there. My wife was to go with our daughter to 
our friend's villa. So the next morning found 
me on my way to England, sad to go, and yet, 
I must confess, not a little exhilarated, against 
all reason, by the sense that perhaps it really was 
a race for life on which I had started, and a race 
with a formidable competitor. 



CHAPTER XVII 

CRONDALL is a small market town on a chalk 
stream in a Southern county, and about two 
miles from it down the valley lies the shooting- 
and fishing-box which Vane-Cartwright, as I 
found, had lately taken, with a very considerable 
shooting in the well-wooded hills, which lay be- 
hind it reaching up to the chalk downs, and with 
a mile or so of fishing in the trout-stream which 
passed through the garden. People shoot be- 
cause it is the thing to do, but as a rule they do 
not hunt or fish unless they like it. So it was for 
the shooting that Vane-Cartwright had taken this 
place, a very charming place for a bachelor, and 
within easy reach of town. Trethewy, however, 
had been engaged as a sort of water-bailiff and 
to look after the fishing, which he was more or 
less competent to do. I found him installed in a 
queer old thatched cottage which stood on an 

island, formed by two branches of the stream, at 

167 



168 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

the lower end of the garden. The cottage could 
be approached by a narrow footbridge from a 
private footpath which led from Crondall. On 
the other side of the stream a public footpath 
led towards the small village and the once famous 
fishing inn, at which I took up my quarters for a 
few nights. The bridge just mentioned was 
formed by two narrow brick arches, and above 
them were hatches which were now raised ; and 
just below the bridge the stream was spanned by 
one of the old-fashioned fish-houses which are 
occasionally found on South-country streams, 
under the floor of which were large eel traps in 
which eels migrating down stream were caught. 
Under the fish-house, which was entered from 
Trethewy's cottage, the stream rushed in two 
pent-up channels which joined again in a broad, 
reed-fringed pool, with a deep dark hole imme- 
diately below the fish-house. My eye fastened on 
this pool at once as the best morning bath which 
had been offered me for some years. 

Why was Trethewy there? Was Trethewy 
after all an accomplice in the crime? My wife 
and I were agreed in not inclining to that ex- 
planation, though in some ways it looked the 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 169 

most plausible. It followed that one or more of 
the family was, to the knowledge of Vane-Cart- 
wright, in possession of information which, if it 
came out, would establish Vane-Cartwright's 
guilt. It did not follow that any of them had 
guilty knowledge ; probably they were not aware 
of the significance of what they knew. Which of 
them held this dark secret, and how was I to 
elicit it? 

In the call just after their tea-time, which I 
lost no time in paying, I found that each of the 
family was for a different reason hard to ap- 
proach on the topic on which I was so impatient 
to enter. I was welcomed respectfully and cor- 
dially enough, but they were evidently puzzled 
and surprised at my visit. I tried Trethewy first. 
He struck me as much improved by his season 
of adversity, by the more active life he now led, 
or by the rigid abstinence to which, as I soon 
gathered, he had brought himself ; but he told me 
quite firmly he never spoke, never wished to speak 
of the question of Peters' death. He had himself 
suffered the horror of being accused when he was 
innocent; he wished to run no risk of bringing 
the same on some other possibly innocent man. 



170 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

Besides, the guilt of his own thought and motives 
still weighed on him, and he had no wish to judge 
any other. Nevertheless, he said plainly, when 
I asked how he liked his new position, that he 
was ill at ease to have come and hoped soon to 
get away. From his impenetrable manner, I be- 
gan to fancy that, contrary to what I had at first 
thought, the secret rested with him, and in that 
case the secret would be very difficult to extract. 
As for Mrs. Trethewy, from the time of the mur- 
der two thoughts had mainly occupied her mind : 
anxiety for her husband, and anxiety that her 
daughter, for whose upbringing she was so care- 
ful, should know nothing of the suspicion that 
had rested on her father, and hear as little as pos- 
sible of the horror that had occurred so near her. 
The girl had been bundled away, the very day 
after the discovery, to stay with Mrs. Trethewy 's 
mother, who lived thirty miles away from their 
home. And to this day, the mother told me, the 
girl had no idea that her father had been in prison 
charged with the crime. Accordingly, Mrs. Tre- 
thewy was overflowing with gratitude to Vane- 
Cartwright, who had found them this new home 
far away. She told me that he had always 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW i;i 

seemed to take a fancy to her husband, and had 
visited their cottage several times during his stay 
with Peters ; and that it was after a talk with him 
that she sent the girl away to her grandmother's. 
That the suggestion had actually come from him 
she did not say, it was a mere guess of mine that 
he had contrived to put it into her head. With 
the girl, whom she sent on an errand to Crondall, 
I got no opportunity of talk that night, and 
I had to return to my inn ill-satisfied with 
my exploration so far, and puzzled how to pro- 
ceed. 

I got my bathe next morning in the pool of 
which I have spoken (this is not quite so unim- 
portant as it may seem). Trethewy managed to 
ensure me privacy for the purpose, and after that 
I called on the Trethewy family again. I have 
remarked already that I supposed myself to have 
heard all that any grown-up person in my old 
parish could tell in regard to the murder and its 
surrounding circumstances. It had been borne 
on my mind strongly since my meeting with 
Vane-Cartwright at Florence, that others besides 
adults have eyes and memories, that Trethewy's 
girl had been near the house at the time of the 



I7 2 TRACKSINTIIESNOW 

murder and on the following day, and that I 
could not count on having heard from her parents 
all that she might have to say that might be in- 
teresting to me. When I called on the Trethewys 
again, I found it an easy matter to get a walk by 
the river-side alone with the girl. I had antici- 
pated that, if I were to pay any decent regard to 
her mother's hitherto successful wishes for her 
ignorance, I might have to talk long and round- 
about before I could elicit what I wanted. I soon 
found that it was not so. Ellen Trethewy, 
though little taller than before, had mentally 
grown in those fifteen months from a shy and 
uninteresting schoolgirl to a shy but alert, quick- 
witted and, as it now struck me, rather interesting 
young woman. 

We had many things belonging to old times to 
talk over, but I found her anxious herself to 
talk on the very subject on which I was bent, 
and I found in a moment that her mother's pre- 
cautions had been absolutely vain. Knowing her 
mother's wish, she had never alluded to the 
matter since ; but her grandmother, who disliked 
Trethewy, had taken a keen pleasure in acquaint- 
ing her with all that she herself knew (and a 
good deal more besides) about the course of the 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW *73 

proceedings against him. The girl, not quite 
trusting her grandmother, had procured and 
carefully read the newspaper account of the trial 
before the magistrates. She had never doubted 
for one instant, she told me, that her father was 
innocent, and it was with more than common 
understanding that she studied the details in the 
story which might make his innocence clear. " Is 
it very wicked of me, Mr. Driver? ' she said, 
* that I do not feel a bit, not a bit grateful to 
Mr. Vane-Cartwright, and I do not believe Father 
does. I do believe he would rather have gone 
to the workhouse, if he had known when we 
came here that he was to be under Mr. Vane- 
Cartwright. But he thought the gentleman who 
sent for us, and who was really his agent, was the 
master of the place; and, once we were here, 
Mother begged him so not to go. Mother is 
always saying how good Mr. Cartwright has been 
to us, and father never answers a word ; but I 
am sure he has a plan to take us away somewhere 
far off/ 3 " Tell me," I said, " what makes you 
say all this. Have you seen anything in Mr. 
Vane-Cartwright to make you think he has some 
wrong reason for getting your father to come 
here? " " Oh, I do not say that/' she said, 



174 TRACKS TX THE SNOW 

but I have always feared his looks. Always, 
I think, since he first came to our house to talk to 
Father, and much more since I saw him at the 
window that dreadful morning when poor Mr. 
Peters lay dead.' 3 Why, what could you see 
that morning?' I said. "Oh, very little," she 
said. You see, of course we heard the news as 
Edith passed by on her way to call the police, 
and Mother told me to keep within doors, and 
she kept in herself, and then she went to Father 
and woke him, and she stayed there talking to 
him, and I was alone and I felt so frightened. 
And then the policeman came, and you, sir, and 
the doctor ; and by-and-by some neighbours came 
looking in. One of them was Mrs. Trimmer who 
kept the baker's shop, and I was fond of her, 
and I do not know whether it was that I was 
frightened to be alone, or just inquisitiveness, 
for I was a child then, though it is not so long 
ago, but, though I never disobeyed Mother be- 
fore, I did so that time ; and I went out, and Mrs. 
Trimmer took my hand and we walked up and 
looked at the house. It was not much we saw, 
for all we stood so long staring; but the front 
door opened and we saw that Irish gentleman 
look out, looking so sad, poor man, and then he 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 175 

took a turn or two up and down in the hall, leav- 
ing the door open ; and then we could hear voices, 
and the rest of you came downstairs and into the 
hall, but I could see Mr. Vane-Cartwright come 
to the window of Mr. Peters' room, and he stood 
there looking out of the window with his hand 
leaning on the sash of the window, leaning for- 
ward, seeming to be looking out intently at the 
people below.' 3 : Did he open the latch of the 
window? ' I asked at once. : I couldn't say 
thai," said she. "Why were you so frightened?" 
I asked. " Oh, I do not know," said she; " he 
didn't look anything very terrible, and I couldn't 
see him well for there was frost on the window, 
but I knew him by his black moustache." 

I suppose everyone of my readers has been 
guilty of mislaying some little article of import- 
ance and looking for it everywhere but in the 
right place, which always turns out to have been 
the most obvious place of all. Perhaps I may- 
be forgiven for having all these fifteen months 
been doing something analogous. I had not only 
overlooked Trethewy's daughter; I knew when I 
spoke to Sergeant Speke about those tracks in 
the snow that there was something more I had 
meant to ask him and had forgotten ; and often 



176 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

since I had been dimly conscious of something 
forgotten. That something was the window- 
latch. The girl could not tell me about it, but 
at least it might be possible to prove by others, 
who had been in the room, that none but Vane- 
Cartwright unlatched that window. 

I make this obvious reflection now because I 
made it then, and in making it wasted a moment 
of possible talk with the girl, a trifling waste 
which was near to having momentous conse- 
quences. Of course it was not because the girl 
had been standing then on the lawn that Vane- 
Cartwright had taken the step, when every un- 
necessary step involved risk, of wiling the Tre- 
thewys away in this secret manner. He knew she 
had something more to tell ; she was about to tell 
it me. "I hardly know/ 3 she broke in on my 
silence, " whether I ought to think as I do, but 

I would like to tell you what " " Well, 

Ellen ! : said, in cheerful tones, a voice that 
was somehow not cheerful, ' taking a walk 
who is the happy? why, it is Mr. Driver. I did 
not expect the good luck of meeting you again 
so soon." Where was I staying, What good 
chance brought me there, and Really I must 
move my luggage instantly to his house, and so 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 177 

forth, from the last man in the world whose com- 
pany I desired at that moment. 

I got off staying with him. I got off, I know- 
not on what excuse, true or false, an afternoon's 
fishing and a pressingly urged dinner. But then 
(for an idea struck me) I would, if I had finished 
the sermon I was writing for a Saint's day ser- 
vice (not in the calendar, I fear) at a neighbour- 
ing church to-morrow, stroll over to Vane-Cart- 
wright's after my supper if he was in any case 
going to be in. He would in any case be in, and 
delighted to see me. He would be in from seven 
onwards. He dined at 7.30, and if I thought 
better of it would be delighted to see me then, 
and I must not dress. For the present, as Ellen 
had to go home, might he not show me the short 
way to my inn. It was not what I should have 
thought a short way, but it was delightfully 
secluded, and it led us by quite a curious num- 
ber of places (a rather slippery plank over a dis- 
used lock will do as an example), where I fancied 
that an accident might have befallen an unwary 
man with a too wary companion. Perhaps it was 
only the condition of my nerves that day that 
made me a little proudly fancy such things, for 
I was not only highly strung, I was unusually 



I7 8 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

exhilarated. It was a great change since our last 
meeting, for this time I felt that I had at last 
gained a definite advantage, and, little as he 
showed it, I thought I was talking with a 
desperate man. It is not safe to be dealing with a 
desperate man, but, if you happen not to pity 
him, it is not a disagreeable sensation. As we 
passed over a footbridge (I was going first, and 
there were stakes and big stones below on which 
a man might hurt himself if he fell) it was prob- 
ably one of my fancies that the shadow of my 
companion, cast before him, made an odd, quick 
movement with its arm. Anyhow, I turned my 
head and said with a laugh what a handsome 
stick Mr. Vane-Cartwright was carrying. I 
asked what wood it was. I did not ask whether 
it was loaded. He told me what wood it was, 
where he bought it and what he gave for it. He 
told me what an interesting medallion was set in 
the head of it, but he did not show me that 
medallion. After that I had a further fancy. It 
was that my guide took less polite pains than he 
had taken to let me pass first through every 
narrow place. Let me say at once that I do not 
suppose he very seriously thought of attacking 
me there; perhaps his eyes were open for any 



TUATKS IX THE SXOW 1 79 

very favourable spot, but perhaps it was all my 
fancy. In spite of that fancy I was thoroughly 
enjoying my walk. It was a new sensation, to 
me to be doing most of the conversation, and I 
was surprised and pleased with myself to think 
that I was doing it well. Perhaps I was doing it 
well, but I do not think it was my guidance of 
the talk which brought it back to the subject of 
Trethewy. Vane-Cartwright managed to tell me 
that he hoped no rumour of suspicion attached to 
Trethewy here, or to any one at all connected 
with him. Would I mind trying to find this out 
from the landlord at the inn. He was a greater 
gossip than any old woman in the place, and a 
shrewder one. ! I would not," he added," trust 
everything he says, for he embroiders on what 
he has heard; but he hears everything, and 
he is shrewd, and I discovered a few weeks 
back that he had an acquaintance in your old 
parish." 

By this time we were at the inn door, and I 
noticed the landlord's name, which was the same 
as that of a man of doubtful character who had 
come to Long Wilton just before I left it. 
Several people were about, and they might, if 
they chose, hear every word of what he spoke, 



l8o TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

except when he dropped his voice. ' Stop," he 
cried, and I stood still. c I am going to be open 
with you, Mr. Driver, as open as I thought you 
would have been with me. I have been trying to 
bring myself to it all this walk, and I will now. 
I have not said what I meant " (here he dropped 
his voice) ' about Trethewy. I have really ' 
(this in a whisper) ' c begun to suspect him my- 
self. Oh, yes, you laugh; I know what you 
suspect of me. Do you think I cannot see what 
interpretation you put upon every one of my 
doings that you know of, in your own house, at 
Peters' before long ago at the island of Sulu, I 
daresay. You think 5 (this time so loud that I 
thought the landlord and other men must hear, 
though, as I reflected later, the phrase he used 
was so chosen that a countryman would not 
readily take it in), " you think I am the assassin 
of Eustace Peters. Well, I am not/ 1 We turned 
and walked away again from the inn. f I 
know/ 3 he continued, "how things look. I 
should not wonder if I were fated to hang for 
this. I should not greatly care now, for I have 
thought it so long, but hanging for it and being 
guilty of it are different matters/ 3 He kept his 
eyes fixed steadily on me all this while. You 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW l8l 

thought things looked ugly for Trethewy once, 
did you not ? But I know you thought him inno- 
cent when it was hard to think so. I do not ask 
you to believe me, but I ask you to keep the same 
firm, clear mind now. You think Trethewy did 
not kill Peters. So do I. He did not actually 
kill him, he no more did that than you did. Now I 
know you will answer me straight. You are too 
brave a man to care about playing the part you 
played at Florence. Have you found or have 
you not found any direct evidence whatever, true 
or false, that convicts any man convicts him if 
it is true of making those tracks, or of going to 
or coming from the place where they were made ? 
Shall I repeat my question? Is it not clear, or 
are you still uncertain whether you will answer 
it? ' I could do no other; I told him truly that 
I had nothing but inference to go upon as to who 
made those tracks, and I told him that my infer- 
ence pointed to him. f Naturally/ 3 he said 
quietly (here we turned and paced slowly towards 
the inn again). ' Only, till you have something- 
better than that inference, remember that there 
may be more subtle motives than you think of 
for making false tracks. Anyway (for it is no 
good my arguing with you further, I see that), 



182 TRACKS IX THE SNOW 

here is one piece of advice that you may take or 
leave honestly, you had better take it if you 
value your future peace of mind keep your 
mind open a little longer. Go away from here, 
and visit Long Wilton again and hear what they 
say there now; or, if you will not do that, stay 
here long enough to watch Trethewy, and the 
girl, and the people that you may see about with 
them, one man in particular. Well, good-bye, 
Mr. Driver, pardon my saying I respect you in 
spite of Florence. J! The manner of this last re- 
mark was maddening. I was keenly stung. I 
said, " Mr. Vane-Cartwright, after all, Peters' 
death is not the only mysterious death you and 
I know of." " Oh, Longhurst," he said, with a 
light laugh which this time really took me aback. 
' I will tell you anything you can wish to know 
about poor Longhurst. Not now, as you are not 
in the mind for it. To-night, if you think better 
of your refusal to come, or any time you may 
choose. I only wish," he said sadly, as he finally 
turned away, ' ' old Peters had asked me straight 
out about Longhurst. >: He had puzzled me but 
he had not shaken me. Could he have imagined 
that he was likely to do so ? Probably not, but it 
occurred to me, directly he was gone, that he 



TRACKS IX THE SNOW 183 

now knew for certain that I was dangerous; knew 
that in some ways he could play upon me easily, 
and in some ways not at all ; and knew that I had 
not yet found out what I came to find out from 
Ellen Trethewy. 



CHAPTER XVIII 

WHETHER it was that my fancies pursued me to 
the inn, or that Vane-Cartwright's words had un- 
consciously impressed me, I took and have re- 
tained a great dislike to the gentleman who was 
just arriving at the inn. He came, as he said, for 
dry fly-fishing, but his accent and his looks 
showecl him to be native to a land where dry 
fly-fishing is, I believe, not practised. He was 
near me and about me several times in the course 
of that day, and though he molested me in no 
way, my dislike deepened. It was now near mid- 
day and I contemplated taking no further step 
till evening,, so I had plenty of time for thought, 
and I needed it. It may be imagined that I was 
in a state of some tension. I had rested little 
since I left Vane-Cartwright's hotel at Florence, 
and on arriving at the inn I had news which in- 
creased my agitation. My wife had telegraphed 

to my home saying she had gone for a day or 

184 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 185 

two to the Hotel de Brunswick, saying also, that 
I must pay no attention to any wire, purporting 
to be from her, which did not contain the word 
Fidele.' 3 Evidently there was some one in 
Florence whom she suspected would send false 
messages. I conjectured that Vane-Cartwright 
had an understanding with the Mafia, and had 
obtained through them the services of some 
villain. Well, here was a wire : ' Regret to 
acquaint respected sir, Mrs. Driver suddenly 
unwell. Direttore Hotel Brunswick/ 3 

There is one advantage about being tired. It 
prevents the mind from wandering away on so 
many side tracks. But with all that advantage, 
whatever it may be worth, it took me a full half- 
hour to make up my mind how to regard this ; but 
I came back to my first impulse, not on the first 
occasion to disregard what my wife herself had 
undoubtedly telegraphed. 

On the other main points I may acquit myself 
of having wavered, and I will not mystify the 
reader more than I mystified myself. I had not 
the faintest doubt that Vane-Cartwright's sug- 
gestion about the Trethewy family, whatever its 
object might be, was a well-acted lie. However, 
I determined to follow the suggestion to some 



186 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

extent. I got hold of the landlord; he was all 
that Vane-Cartwright had said, and on a very 
slight hint he began talking of the Long Wilton 
murder and of the charge against Trethewy. I 
was disgusted to find that suspicion had followed 
the people here. It was not clearly to Vane-Cart- 
wright's interest that it should follow them, and 
I suppose it was accident. I found that the land- 
lord was well posted as to Trethewy's story and 
all the proceedings in regard to him. As he went 
on hinting suspicion of him, I said it was a 
curious thing about those tracks. ' Ah/ 3 said 
he, ' little feet can wear big shoes "; and he 
looked wise. " About that lass now of Tre- 
thewy's, not but what I like the lass/ 3 he was 
continuing after a solemn interval, but I need 
not try to repeat his talk. The upshot of the 
suggestion was simply this, that the girl had 
stepped out in her father's boots and made the 
tracks, knowing full well that she could ensure 
the exposure of the trick in due time, but for 
which of two reasons rumour was not certain. 
Either it was really to fasten false suspicion on 
her father till the guilty man, a lover of hers pre- 
sumably, made good his escape ; or her father had 
committed the crime, and she knew it, and to 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 187 

save him had fabricated against him evidence 
which he and she knew would be broken down. 

It was not a likely story to tell to me, and I was 
inclined now, not for the first time, to be thank- 
ful that however great a fool I might be, I looked 
a greater fool than I was. By putting me up to 
eliciting this story, Vane-Cartwright had merely 
supplied me with know-ledge about the situation 
of the Trethewys which I might find useful in 
dealing with them. 

I felt that I had brought danger not only upon 
myself but also upon the Trethewys. I was in 
some doubt whether by going to them again that 
night I might not be bringing danger nearer 
them, but the impulse to be beside them if danger 
were there impelled me to go. I arrived about 
nightfall. I found Trethewy himself preparing 
to leave the house. He had been bidden to go 
and help in repairing a threatening breach of a 
mill-dam some way up the stream, and he 
evidently felt surprised and suspicious about the 
errand on which he was sent. Replying to a look 
of enquiry in my face, he said : " Sir, I never 
disobeyed my master's orders yet. No," he 
added, looking suddenly abashed, : I behaved 
badly enough by my old master, but I never dis- 



188 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

obeyed orders, and I should not like to begin 
doing so now/ 3 I said that, if he went I should 
stay at his house till he returned. He said, ' It 
would be a kindness that I should always remem- 
ber, sir." And so he went. 

Poor Mrs. Trethewy appeared ill-pleased at 
my presence. She seemed to guess that my com- 
ing was in some way to disturb their peace. I 
fancied that, in getting the mastery over his 
drinking and his wrathful ways, Trethewy had 
become very gentle and submissive to his wife. 
In her days of difficulty I had been used to 
admire her for the way in which she brought up 
her daughter. I now did not think her improved 
by rinding herself more the mistress of her house 
than she was wont to be. Still she was civil 
enough, and willing, after the girl had gone to 
bed in a sort of cupboard off the parlour-kitchen, 
to entertain me with her best conversation. I 
interrupted by telling her frankly that I knew 
she wished to keep her daughter in ignorance of 
all concerning Peters' murder, and the suspicion 
that had arisen about it, but that I feared that 
she would find it impossible, for I had learned 
that day that rumour had followed them to their 
new home. From my heart I pitied her, for she 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 189 

seemed utterly cast down as she began to realise 
that Ellen must come to hear all, if indeed she 
had not heard it already. 

Suddenly the girl burst into the room and 
threw her arms round her mother's neck. * Oh, 
Mother, Mother!' she said, "I cannot keep 
on deceiving you. Dear, kind Mother, who 
wanted to deceive me for my good. I would 
have given so much that you should not know 
this, but Grandmother told me all." "Go to 
bed now, dear," said her mother ; " I cannot 
bear more to-night." The mother too went to 
bed, and I lay down under a rug upon the 
sofa. 

I had no intention of keeping awake all night. 
Gladly as in my excited state I would have done 
so, it was a necessity that I should get such rest 
as I could. I lay on a shake-down which Mrs. 
Trethewy provided for me, and I thought of 
Florence and of one whom I had left at Florence. 
Then I slept, and I dreamed, dreamed that she 
was ill and wanted me. I woke with a horrid 
start as some one in my dream pronounced the 
word " poison." Thank God, it was a dream. I 
assured myself of that and slept again to dream 
more pleasantly. 



190 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

I dreamed I was a boy and I was swimming in 
a clear river. Cool, cool river ! 

There was a fish in the river, and I was swim- 
ming after the fish. Cool, cool river ! 

It was an ugly fish, and I was pursuing it, and 
the river was warm. 

The fish was Vane-Cartwright, and I was pur- 
suing him. Warm, warm river ! 

The river was gone from my dream, and I was 
pursuing Vane-Cartwright over a great plain. 
Warmer and warmer ! 

I pursued him through thick woodlands. 
Sultry and stifling ! 

I pursued him over a great mountain. Burn- 
ing, burning hot ! 

I leapt to my feet calling ' Fire ! 

In waking fact, the thatched cottage was in a 
blaze. 

I called with all my might to Mrs. Trethewy. 
I told her to run out while I brought out her 
daughter, and she answered. 

I burst into the girrs little room on the ground 
floor. It was full of smoke; she was suffocating 
before she could wake. I tore her from her bed, 
and bore her through the door and on to the foot- 
bridge. I turned my head back towards the house 
to call again to Mrs. Trethewy, when a hoarse 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

cry of " Fire ! : ' came from the other direction, 
and a man he seemed an old grey-bearded 
rustic ran on to the bridge towards the door, 
dashed with full force against us, and overturned 
me and my half-conscious burden. 

I do not know just how we rolled or fell, but 
we were in the water. I had managed still to 
hold Ellen Trethewy with my right arm, and with 
my left hand to catch the edge of the footbridge. 
I could not by any effort have pulled us both out 
or raised her on to the bridge, but it was easy to 
hold our heads above water, for we were against 
the pier of the bridge, in between the two currents 
that shot under the arches. Mrs. Trethewy would 
be there in a moment and could help us out ; or 
why did not that old rustic help us ? 

They say that men in moments of extreme 
peril take in all manner of things with extra- 
ordinary rapidity, but I do not know whether I 
really saw all as I see it in memory now, or 
whether what I did was from accident and the 
instinct of fear. 

I glanced up, and the old rustic stood over us 
raising a mighty stick which I thought was not 
that which Vane-Cartwright had carried in the 
morning. So much I did see and think. 



IQ2 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

One good blow and I should have been 
stunned, if my brains were not out. Whether we 
got entangled in the eel grating or were carried 
right under the fish-house into the pool, there was 
little chance for either of our lives if that blow 
had fallen where it was aimed. 

I let go my hold on the bridge and threw my 
head back, and the stick crashed idly on the 
bricks of the margin. I tried to get one long 
breath before we went under, but I swallowed a 
horrible gulp of water. Good chance or my con- 
vulsive effort guided us into the arch for which 
I would have steered. Under one arch the old 
eel grating remained. I did not know its struc- 
ture, and I did not know whether the trap-door 
over it was fastened down, but there was little 
hope that we should pass that way alive. Under 
the other arch, as I had found that morning, the 
grating had long been removed, and down that 
archway the strong stream was carrying us, safe, 
if it did not throttle us on the way. How long a 
passage I thought it, though the rush of the water 
seemed so headlong. I could feel the slimy 
growth on the brick archway above us, and my 
nostrils were for a moment above water though 
my mouth was pressed under. Then we were 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 193 

under the floor of the fish-house, and my head 
rose and I got a gulp of air, but my head struck 
a joist of the floor, and the stream swept me on, 
ducking involuntarily under another joist and 
another. We were out in the pool, sucked down 
in the bubble and swirl of the eddy. I opened 
my eyes and could see the glare of the fire 
through great green globes of water. I was on 
the surface ; I was swimming with great gasps ; I 
was under again; I was exhausted. My feet 
struck on pebbles; I was standing in the shallow 
water. I still held the body. Was it lifeless? 
Three strides and I should land her on the bank. 
No, my steps sank in some two feet of almost 
liquid mud. The dragging of my steps furnished 
just the little further effort needed to spend my 
remaining breath. I sank forward on the reeds 
and flags of the margin, with one last endeavour 
to push her body in front of me, and I lay, help- 
less and panting horribly, beside her, while a 
man came and jumped into the marshy fringe of 
the pool and stood over us. That dire old rustic, 
I felt no doubt, and I felt no care. No, it was 
the girl's father. 

In the morning, shooting down that same dark 

cool avenue of sweet water, and swept without an 

7 



194 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

effort far out into the swirling reed-fringed pool, 
I could not have imagined how hardly and how ill 
I was to pass that way again with a living or life- 
less burden. 

She lived ; the first shock of the water had 
roused her, and she had kept a shut mouth, a 
steady grasp where it least incommoded me and 
a heroic presence of mind. 



CHAPTER XIX 

THERE is not much that can be done for a thatched 
cottage once well alight, and for such salvage as 
could be done there were plenty of ready helpers 
soon upon the scene. That aged rustic was not 
among them, nor did I afterwards see or hear of 
him ; but among them before long appeared Vane- 
Cartwright himself, brisk and alert, and forward 
to proffer to Trethewy every sort of help and 
accommodation for his now homeless family. 
Trethewy's response was characteristic total and 
absolute silence. 

It seemed late but was still early morning when 
I had the Trethewys assembled for breakfast in 
my private sitting-room in my inn. Neighbours 
had readily supplied the women with clothes, and 
a cart had been forthcoming to carry them. Tre- 
thewy and I walked to the inn together, and his 
attitude to Vane-Cartwright was naturally quite 

altered. He told me a second time of the dislike, 

195 



196 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

which he had felt from the first, of being in Vane- 
Cartwright's service, and he told me that he had 
just decided to accept a situation which was open 
to him in Canada, and had expected to sail with 
his family, who did not yet know it, in six weeks, 
but supposed he must put it off now. 

At last I really heard what it was that Ellen 
Trethewy could tell and for knowing which she 
had been removed to Crondall, and it did not 
come up to my expectations. 

About noon after Peters' murder, after Cal- 
laghan and I had gone into the village, and while 
Vane-Cartwright, by his own account, had stayed 
reading in the house, the girl had twice seen him 
as she looked out of the window of the cottage. 
She had seen him come out of the gate of the 
drive and turn to the right up the road away from 
the village. About twenty minutes later she had 
seen him turn in again at the gate, and this time 
he came down the green lane. To any one who 
knew the lie of the ground, the significance of this 
was certain. He could not have got round by road 
or by any public footpath in that time ; either he 
had come through the plantation and the fields, 
where the tracks were made, or he must have 
made a round over ditches and hedges and rough 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW IQ7 

ground by which a man taking a casual and inno- 
cent stroll was extremely unlikely to have gone, 
especially in frost and snow. 

The inference was convincing enough to me, 
but then, as I knew, I was ready to be convinced. 
Vane-Cartwright was not likely, I felt, to have 
done so much to prevent the girl revealing merely 
this. Was there nothing more ? 

Yes, there was, but it was something of which 
Ellen did not feel sure. During that twenty 
minutes the sun shone out brilliantly upon the 
snow, and tempted her to stroll out a little way up 
the drive, when she stood for awhile to look, in 
spite of the horror of the time, with delight at the 
spotless covering of the lawn and the shining 
burden of the cedar branches, and then up at the 
sun. Her eyes were soon so dazzled that all sorts 
of fancied shapes danced before them. Turning 
suddenly and looking towards the field, she 
thought for an instant, but only an instant, that 
she saw between two trees a man up in the field, 
about half-way up, walking towards the hedge, to- 
wards a spot in the hedge which we already know. 
She covered her eyes with her hand and looked 
again with clearer vision. There was no one there, 
and she tried to brush aside the fancv that she 



I9 TRACKS IN TTIE SNOW 

had seen any one. But somehow she had often 
wondered since about what she had seen, and 
somehow she connected it in her fancy with the 
murder. She could not connect it with the making 
of the tracks, for she had only read of them in a 
muddled newspaper report which had given an 
entirely wrong impression as to whereabouts they 
were found. Now it was all obvious. Vane-Cart- 
wright, while he made those very tracks, had 
passed before her eyes ; he had seen her standing 
and looking towards him, and he could not enter- 
tain the hope, though it was true, that her eyes 
did not see him clear. 

This much being plain, my first thought was of 
amazement at the coolness of Vane-Cartwright on 
the evening after the murder, while he could not 
be sure that the discovery of the tracks had not 
been told to the girl and had not already drawn 
forth from her an explanation which, if believed, 
must be fatal to him. My second thought was of 
great disappointment that the identification of 
him with the maker of the tracks was still to so 
large an extent a matter of inference. I cannot 
say whether I myself, or Trethewy, or the girl, 
who, having long brooded over these matters with- 
out the necessary clue, now showed astonishing 



TRACKS IX THE SNOW 1 99 

quickness in grasping them, was first to see the 
next step which the enquiry required. Evidence 
must be sought which would show whether Vane- 
Cartwright or some other person had undone the 
window-latch in Peters' room. I was ready imme- 
diately to rush off to Long Wilton and see 
whether Sergeant Speke could recollect anything 
of importance about the movements of the persons 
who were in the room that morning. It was the 
girl who suggested to me a possible witness rather 
nearer at hand. The young doctor had been in 
the room till nearly the last, and, as her mother 
happened to have told her, he had very shortly 
after the event in question removed to London. 
Could not I see him ? 

I resolved to see him, if I could, that day, for I 
thought I could gain nothing by further waiting 
near Crondall. I was anxious about the safety of 
Ellen Trethewy, but I found her father, who was 
as much persuaded as I of the peril which con- 
tinued to hang over her, had formed his own plan 
for promptly removing her ; he thought we should 
be safer separate ; and it reassured me to see a 
reminiscence of his wild youth sparkle in his now 
sober countenance as he said that it w r ould not be 
the first time that he had baffled a pursuit. 



200 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

Upon some calculation, prompted perhaps by 
excessive precaution and futile craft, such as may 
well be excused in excited men who have found 
themselves surrounded by unimagined dangers, 
we decided that I should not start for any of the 
stations on the branch line that passes Crondall, 
but should leave my luggage behind, drive, in a 
fast trap which the baker sometimes let out, to an 
ancient castle in the neighbourhood, thence, three 
miles, to the junction on the main line to London, 
send the trap back with a note to my landlord, and 
go to town by the one fast train in the day which 
there was easy time to catch. I suppose we 
thought I should get some start of Vane-Cart- 
wright, and that this was worth while, as he was 
likely to stick close to me, and had shown already 
his fertility of baleful resource. 

Accordingly, I arrived at the junction just as 
the up-train came in. The train from Crondall 
had arrived a little while before, and was standing 
in a bay on the other side of my platform of 
departure. I was by this time so sleepy that I 
could hardly keep my eyes open as I walked. I 
did barely notice the screaming approach of a 
third train, which was in fact the down-train from 
London, but in which of course I felt no interest, 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 2OI 

and I noticed some but not quite all of the people 
on the platform or in the waiting-shed. I took my 
seat in the far corner of a carriage. I began in- 
stantly to doze, and the train, I believe, waited 
there awhile. I faintly heard shouts and whistles 
which heralded the starting of the train, but it did 
not start immediately. When the carriage door 
again opened and two other passengers got in, I 
did half-open my eyes ; but I started broad awake 
when to those half-open eyes my fellow-pas- 
sengers revealed themselves as Vane-Cartwright 
and the foreign visitor at the inn, whose looks I 
had irrationally disliked. I say broad awake but 
not awake enough to do the proper thing to be 
done. The train was already in motion before 
they sat down, and my fellow-passengers with 
their luggage so encumbered the door that I could 
not have got back on to the platform. I ought, I 
suppose, to have pulled the communication cord. 
As it was, I merely sat up, looking at them as in- 
differently as I could, while really my heart sank 
within me, and I wished my muscles had not been 
so stiff and chilled from my adventure of the night 
before. 

The train was moving but not yet fast. It 
seemed to be slowing down again. There was 



202 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

fresh shouting and whistling on the platform ; the 
stationmaster saying angrily, " Put him in here " ; 
a voice that sounded somehow well known, but 
which I could not recognise, answering him vigor- 
ously; and just as the train began to go faster a 
big man, still shouting and very hot with pursuit, 
tumbled into the carriage. To my delighted sur- 
prise I found myself joined by Callaghan. 

The most surprising turns of good fortune, I 
have learned to think, are generally the reward of 
more than common forethought on the part of 
some one. My rescue in this case, which I will 
none the less call providential, could never have 
happened but for the zealous care of Callaghan 
himself, and of another person many hundred 
miles from the scene. 

But of all this I was soon to hear. Meanwhile, 
Callaghan, who was in the highest of spirits, 
bestowed on me a mere smile of recognition, and 
poured himself forth upon Vane-Cartwright with 
an exuberance of pleasure at the unexpected 
meeting which must have been maddening. It was 
the only time, during my acquaintance with Vane- 
Cartwright, when he appeared to be in the least 
at a loss. Hearty good-humour was, I should 
think, the only attitude towards him which he did 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 203 

not know how to meet. So he passed, I take it, a 
miserable journey. Nor was his mysterious com- 
panion left to enjoy himself. To my astonish- 
ment Callaghan addressed him politely by a 
strange-sounding name, which I suppress, but 
which from the start which the gentleman gave 
appeared to be his name. 

As for me, Callaghan leaving me in the corner 
which I had originally chosen had manoeuvred 
Vane-Cartwright into the other corner of the same 
side of the carriage, and the stranger into the seat 
opposite him, while he placed himself between me 
and Vane-Cartwright, and with his back half- 
turned towards me entertained them both. 

I dozed away again and again, and I daresay I 
was asleep for a good part of the journey, but I 
endeavoured to think out in my waking moments 
what was the nature of the peril which had 
threatened me, for peril assuredly there was, and 
how it could have come about that I was thus 
rescued. 

As to the former question, I got no further than 
the reflection, that to stick me with a knife and 
jump on the line or make a bolt at the London 
terminus (which was our first stop) would have 
been too crude for the purpose. As to the latter 



204 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

question, Callagha.n, suffering our fellow-pas- 
sengers to escape for a moment behind their news- 
papers, roused me with a nudge, and surreptiti- 
ously passed me what proved to be several 
pounds' worth of telegraphic message from my 
wife at Florence to himself. I was hardly yet 
aware how thoroughly my wife's original aversion 
for Callaghan had given way in the day when he 
had been her guest, and when she had passed 
from observing his weaknesses to putting up with 
them and occasionally reproving them. I learned 
now that some hours after I had left her, my wife 
had telegraphed to Callaghan through a mutual 
friend whom she believed would have his address, 
stating the sort of errand on which I had gone, 
and the few particulars known to her which might 
determine my movements, and entreating him to 
find me, and having found me, never to leave me 
alone. But that was not all. The telegram stated 
that Vane-Cartwright was on his way home, hav- 
ing sent home one communication only, a tele- 
gram to a registered telegraphic address in Lon- 
don, that address being the word by which Cal- 
laghan had accosted the stranger. 

As I afterwards learned, my wife, directly 1 
had departed, had removed to Vane-Cartwright's 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 205 

hotel. Vane-Cartwright did not know her by 
sight, and, if he had discovered her, he was the 
sort of man who would probably despise the in- 
telligence of any nice woman. She had taken the 
best rooms in the hotel, close to Vane-Cart- 
wright's, and had otherwise set about, for the first 
time in her life, and for a few hours, to throw 
money about in showy extravagance. By money 
and flattery she had contrived to be informed of 
the address of every letter and telegram that 
Vane-Cartwright sent before his departure, of the 
name and nationality (nothing more was known of 
him) of his only visitor that morning, and of the 
further fact that shortly after Vane-Cartwright's 
departure that visitor had returned and had 
enquired whether she had moved to that hotel, but 
had not asked to see her. She learned also that 
Vane-Cartwright had been at the station when the 
Milan train started, but had returned and waited 
for the next train. The reader already knows that 
she had had the intuition that false messages 
might be sent me in her name. 

Callaghan had been away from home, and had 
not got the message till late in the evening before 
he joined me. He lost no time in going to my 
house to ascertain my address and what had last 



206 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

been heard of me. He called also at Vane-Cart- 
wright's house, where he was only informed that 
he was abroad. He left London by the first train 
in the morning armed with a Bradshaw and a map. 
Study of Bradshaw had led him to notice that I 
might possibly be leaving by a train which would 
be at the junction about the same time as his. So 
he was on the look out, and with his quick sight 
actually saw me in my train as he arrived. By 
running hard and shouting entreaties and prom- 
ises to the officials, he had just managed to catch 
me. 

When our train arrived at Paddington, Cal- 
laghan shook me awake. It appeared to me that 
Vane-Cartwright, who had not been conversa- 
tional before, had just started an interesting sub- 
ject by which he hoped to detain Callaghan while 
our mysterious companion got away from the 
train. It was not a successful effort. Callaghan 
pushed me somewhat rudely out of the carriage, 
and jumping out after me told me to wait for him, 
and kept me, while he stood about on the plat- 
form till every passenger by the train but our- 
selves had gone away. At last he called a han- 
som ; still he did not enter it till the driver of an 
invalid carriage which had been waiting in the 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 207 

rank of cabs appeared to give up the expectation 
that the person for whom he waited was coming, 
and drove away. 

" Do you see that invalid carriage? " said Cal- 
laghan to me. " It was ordered for you." 



CHAPTER XX 

HERE let me mention that I have fancied since 
that I recognised the ill-looking foreigner who 
was with me at the inn and in the train. I recog- 
nised him in a chemist's shop in a very fashion- 
able shopping street. I think it would be libellous 
to name the street. The telegraphic address which 
my wife sent to Callaghan was the telegraphic 
address of that fashionable chemist's shop. 

I had intended to take leave of Callaghan for 
the time upon our arrival at the station, but I 
found that this was not to be done, for Callaghan 
was determined to obey almost to the letter my 
wife's behest to him, not to leave me. He took 
me to luncheon at a restaurant, and then prevailed 
upon me to come with him by one of our fast 
trains to my own house, collect there all the 
papers which I possessed bearing on the affair of 
Peters, and bring them to his chambers, where he 

was resolved I should at present stay. 

208 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 2OQ 

When we arrived there, I was for starting at 
once to seek out the doctor who had been at Long 
Wilton, but I was practically overpowered and 
sent to bed, after handing over to Callaghan, 
amongst other papers, the notes which Peters had 
made as to the death of Longhurst. 

After some hours Callaghan entered my room 
to tell me that dinner would be ready in half an 
hour, that I might get up for it if I liked, or have 
it brought to my bedroom. He then turned on me 
reproachfully. ' W T hy had I not shown him these 
papers long ago, when he came to stay with me ? ' 
I was at a loss for an answer, for in fact when I 
had told him of my suspicions and my reasons for 
them, I had done the thing by halves, because my 
want of confidence in him lingered. 

' Well, well," said my good-natured friend, " I 
daresay I can guess the reason. But these papers 
explain much to me. You never told me it was the 
island of Sulu on which Peters discovered the 
body, or that he went there with Dr. Kuyper. I 
had heard the name of that island and the doctor 
before on the last night of Peters' life while you 
were talking music with Thalberg." 

Next morning I set off early to see the doctor 

o j 

who had been at Long Wilton. Callaghan, who 



210 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

at first seemed to think it his duty to be with me 
everywhere, gave way and consented to go upon 
some business of his own about which he was 
very mysterious ; but he put me in the charge of 
his servant, a man singularly fitted to be his ser- 
vant, an Irishman and an old soldier, who, I dis- 
covered, had made himself very useful to him in 
his spying upon Thalberg, having entered into a 
close and I daresay bibulous friendship with one 
of Thalberg's clerks. My new guardian so far re- 
laxed his precautions as to allow me to be alone 
with the doctor in his consulting-room; he other- 
wise looked after me as though he thought me a 
child, and from the very look of him one could 
see that I was well protected, though indeed I 
hardly imagined then that the perils which beset 
me at Crondall would follow me through the 
streets of London. 

I asked the doctor kindly to give me all his 
recollections as to what occurred in Peters' bed- 
room while he was there. He told me little but 
what was of a professional nature, and he in- 
formed me rather dryly that he made it his prac- 
tice on all occasions to observe only what con- 
cerned him professionally. I therefore put to him 
with very little hope the main question which I 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 211 

had come to ask Had he observed anything 
about the windows. " Certainly," he said, " that, 
as it happens, is a professional matter with me. 
I never enter a sickroom without glancing at the 
windows, and I did so from force of habit this 
time, though " (and he laughed with an ugly 
sense of humour) " it didn't matter much, as no 
fresh air could have revived that patient ; but the 
windows weie shut, and (for I often notice that 
too) they were tight shut and latched." " Are you 
certain," I said, "that both of them were 
latched?' "Certain," he answered; "they were 
both latched when I came into the room, and they 
were latched when I went out, for I happen to 
have looked again. You see that, once one has the 
habit of noticing a certain kind of thing, one 
always notices it and remembers it easily, how- 
ever little else one may see." I asked him then 
whether he happened to remember the order in 
which the persons who had then been in the room 
left it. About this he was not so certain, but he 
had an impression that only two persons were left 
in the room after him. These were the police- 
sergeant, who held the door open for a moment 
while Vane-Cartwright lingered, and who locked 
it when they had all left. I may say at once that 



212 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

this was afterwards confirmed by the police-ser- 
geant, who added that Vane-Cartwright was 
standing somewhere not far from the window in 
question. 

I returned by appointment to Callaghan's 
chambers some time before eleven. I was imme- 
diately taken out by him again upon an errand 
which he refused to explain. We arrived at 
length at an office in the City which from the 
name on the door proved to be that of Mr. Thai- 
berg, Solicitor and Commissioner for Oaths. We 
were ushered into Mr. Thalberg's private room, 
and it immediately appeared that Callaghan had 
come to give instructions for the making of his 
will. He explained my being there by saying 
there was a point in his will about which he 
desired to consult both of us. I was thus com- 
pelled to be present at what for a while struck 
me as a very tedious farce. Callaghan, after con- 
sulting Mr. Thalberg upon the very elementary 
question whether or not he thought it an advis- 
able thing that a man should make a will, and 
after beating about the bush in various other 
ways, went on to detail quite an extraordinary 
number of bequests, some of them personal, some 
of a charitable kind, which he desired to make. 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 213 

There was a bequest, for example, of the Sevres 
porcelain in his chambers to his cousin, Lady 
Belinda McConnell (there was no Sevres porce- 
lain in his chambers, and I have never had the 
curiosity to look up Lady Belinda McConnell in 
the Peerage). So he went on, disposing, I should 
think, of a great deal more property than he 
possessed, till at last the will appeared to be com- 
plete in outline, when he seemed suddenly to be- 
think him of the really difficult matter for which 
he had desired my presence. By this time, I 
should say, it had begun to dawn upon me that 
the pretended will-making was not quite so idle 
a performance as I had at first thought. Cal- 
laghan must in the course of it have produced on 
a person, who knew him only slightly, the impres- 
sion of a good-natured, eccentric fellow, wholly 
without cunning and altogether unformidable. 
This was one point gained, but moreover, Mr. 
Thalberg was rapidly falling into that nervous 
and helpless condition into which a weak man of 
business can generally be thrown by the unkind 
expedient of wasting his time. It now appeared 
that the real subject on which Mr. Thalberg and 
I were to be consulted was the disposal of Cal- 
laghan's papers in the event of his death. Cal- 



214 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

laghan explained that he would leave behind him 
if he died (and he felt, he said, that he might die 
suddenly) a great quantity of literary work which 
he should be sorry should perish. He would 
leave all his papers to the discretion of certain 
literary executors (he thought these would per- 
haps be Mr. George Meredith and Mr. Ruskin), 
but there were memoirs among them relating to 
a sad affair in which persons living, including 
Mr. Thalberg and myself, were in a manner con- 
cerned. He referred to the lamented death of 
Mr. Peters, the circumstances connected with 
which had been for him a matter of profound 
and he trusted not unprofitable study. He felt 
that in any directions he might leave in regard 
to these memoirs it was only fair that he should 
consult the gentlemen present. Mr. Thalberg by 
this time was in a great state of expectation, when 
Callaghan pulled out his watch and, observing 
that it was later than he thought, asked if there 
was a Directory in the office, that he might find 
the address of a certain person to whom he must 
telegraph to put off an appointment with him. A 
clerk brought the London Directory from an out- 
side room, and was about to retire. ' Stop a 
moment, Mr. Clerk, if you don't mind," said Cal- 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 215 

laghan, and he slightly edged back his chair, so 
as to block the clerk's going out, " perhaps it is 
the Suburban Directory that I want. Let us just 
look," and he began turning over the leaves. 
" Ferndale Avenue," he said, " that's not it ; 
Ferndale Terrace you see, Mr. Thalberg," he 
said, " I would like to talk this matter out with 
you before I go Ferndale Crescent right side, 
No. 43, 44, No." (all this time his finger was 
running down a column under the letter B in the 
Trades Directory) " 45, 46, 47 ; I thought he was 
thereabouts. Here's the name," he said. : You 
see, Mr. Thalberg, your own movements, if they 
were not explained, would look rather curious 
47, 49, no, that's not it look rather curious, as I 
was saying, in connection with that murder of 
Peters look ugly, you know 51 Ferndale 
Crescent, that's it. Thank you, Mr. Clerk," and 
he shut the Directory with a bang and handed 
it back to the clerk with a bow, and made way for 
him to leave the room. 

Mr. Thalberg bounded from his chair and col- 
lapsed into it again. " Stop, Mr. Manson," he 
cried to the clerk, " you must be present at what- 
ever else this gentleman may have to say." He 
sat for a moment breathing hard, more I thought 



2l6 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

with alarm than with anger. He did not seem to 
me to have any presence of mind or any of the 
intellectual attributes, at any rate, of guile, and 
I could not help wondering as I watched him, 
whether this really was the man whom Vane- 
Cartwright chose for his agent in employments 
of much delicacy. ' Do you come here to black- 
mail me, sir ? " cried Mr. Thalberg, forcing him- 
self to assume a voice and air of fury. There 
was never seen anything more innocent or more 
surprised and pained than the countenance of 
Callaghan as he replied. He was amazed that his 
motive could be so misunderstood; it was the 
simple fact that what he was forced in his 
memoirs to relate might hereafter suggest sus- 
picions of every one who was in the neighbour- 
hood of the crime, himself and his friend Mr. 
Driver in particular, and, though in a less degree 
of course, Mr. Thalberg. He was giving Mr. 
Thalberg precisely the same opportunity as he 
had given to Mr. Driver, of explaining those pas- 
sages in his (Callaghan's) record, which might 
seem to him to require explanation. Here he 
appealed to me (and I confess I backed him up) 
as to whether he had not approached me in pre- 
cisely the same way. Mr. Thalberg appeared to 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 217 

pass again under the spell of his eccentric 
visitor's childlike innocence, and sat patiently 
but with an air of increasing discomfort while 
Callaghan ran on : " You see, in your case, Mr. 
Thalberg, it's not only your presence at Long 
Wilton, which was for golf of course, wasn't it? 
only you went away because of the snow. 
There is that correspondence with a Dutch legal 
gentleman at Batavia which occurred a little 
afterwards, or a little before was it? And there 
were the messages which I think you sent (though 
perhaps that was not you) to Bagdad. Of course 
I shall easily understand if you do not care to 
enlighten me for the purpose of my memoirs 
which no one may care to read. Pray tell me if it 
is so. I daresay it's enough for you that your cor- 
respondence and movements will of course be 
fully explained at the trial." "What trial?" ex- 
claimed Thalberg, quite aghast. It was Cal- 
laghan's turn to be astonished. Was it possible 
that Mr. Thalberg had not heard the news, which 
was already in two or three evening papers, that 
there was a warrant out for the arrest of Vane- 
Cartwright, and that it was rumoured that he had 
been arrested in an attempt to escape from the 
country. 



218 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

In Mr. Thalberg's countenance increased 
anguish now struggled ludicrously with the sus- 
picion, which even he could not wholly put aside, 
that he was being played upon in some monstrous 
way. He began some uncertain words and 
desisted, and looked to his clerk appealingly. 
That gentleman (not, I believe, the same that had 
fallen under the sway of Callaghan's faithful ser- 
vant) seemed the incarnation of the most solid 
respectability. He was, I should judge, of the 
age at which he might think of retiring upon a 
well-earned competence, and he gave Thalberg 
no help, desiring, I should think, to hear the 
fullest explanation of the startling and terrible 
hint which had been thrown out before him 
against his master's character. While Thalberg 
sat irresolute, Callaghan drew a bow at a venture. 
" At least, Mr. Thalberg," he said, " I thought 
you might like to tell me the results of your inter- 
view with Dr. Verschoyle when you went to 
Homburg to see him." " Sir," said Thalberg, 
making a final effort, " do you imagine that I shall 
tell you what passed at an interview to which I 
went upon my client's business." Thank you, 
Mr. Thalberg," said Callaghan. " I am interested 
to know that you went to Homburg on your 



TRACKS IX THE SNOW 219 

client's business (I thought it might have been 
for the gout), and that you did see Dr. Ver- 
schoyle, for I had not known that till you told 
me. I did know, however, about that correspond- 
ence with Madrid in the Spanish Consul's cipher, 
and I knew that the enquiries you made through 
him were really addressed to an influential person 
at Manilla." 

At this point Mr. Thalberg abruptly went over, 
with horse, foot and artillery, to the enemy. He 
assured Callaghan of his perfect readiness to 
answer fully any questions he might ask about 
his relations with Vane-Cartwright, and if he 
might he would tell him how they began. 

This is what it came to. Thalberg had been 
partner to a lawyer who was Longhurst's solicitor. 
In the early part of 1882, when Longhurst had 
spent a month in England, he had consulted 
Thalberg's partner about some matters that 
troubled him in regard to his partnership with 
Vane-Cartwright. Thalberg could not remember 
(so at least he said) the precise complaint which 
Longhurst had laid before his partner, except 
that it related to Vane-Cartwright's having got 
concessions and acquired property for himself 
which Longhurst considered (without foundation, 



220 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

as Thalberg supposed) should have belonged to 
the partnership. Nor did Thalberg know the 
advice which had been given Longhurst. He had 
heard no more of him beyond the mere report 
that he had been drowned, till, after his death, 
Vane-Cartwright, whom Thalberg had not pre- 
viously known, came to London and employed 
the firm to find out various members of Long- 
hurst's family who were still living, and to whom 
he now behaved with great generosity. Since 
then Thalberg had been, as we knew, solicitor of 
a company which Vane-Cartwright had founded, 
and had occasionally done for him private law 
work of a quite unexciting nature. But in the 
middle of January of last year, 1896, Thalberg 
had been instructed by Vane-Cartwright to make 
for him with the utmost privacy certain enquiries. 
One was of a person in Bagdad, as to the identity 
and previous history of a certain Mr. Bryanston ; 
one concerned a certain Dr. Kuyper, a physician 
and scientist in Batavia, who, it was ascertained, 
was now dead. Another was, as Callaghan knew, 
addressed to a correspondent in Madrid, but 
Thalberg declared that this enquiry went no 
further than to ascertain the name and address 
of the person who then filled the office of Public 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 221 

Prosecutor or, I think, Minister of Justice in the 
Philippines. I ventured to ask the name ; it was a 
name that I had seen before in those notes of 
Peters'. Lastly, there was an enquiry in regard 
to Dr. Verschoyle. Thalberg had been instructed 
if possible to obtain an interview with this gentle- 
man before a certain date. The purpose of the 
interview, he declared, was to obtain from him 
some notes and journals which would be of use 
in the foundation of a new mission in the Philip- 
pines, under the auspices of the Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel, a project in which 
Vane-Cartwright appeared, he said, to be keenly- 
interested (and indeed it was the fact that he had 
previously patronised missionary societies). The 
object of Thalberg's visit to Long Wilton was 
this. He had been told to repair there without fail 
by the date on which he actually came, and to 
inform Vane-Cartwright by word of mouth of the 
result, if any, of his enquiries. That result had 
been, shortly : that Bryanston was the man who 
had at one time been at Nagasaki; that Kuyper 
was dead; that the Minister of Justice (or what- 
ever the precise office was) at Manilla was the 
person already alluded to; and that Verschoyle 
was abroad and had lately been at Siena, but had 



222 TRACKS IX THE SNOW 

departed abruptly some weeks before for Ger- 
many, it was thought, but he had left no address 
behind him. All this Thalberg had duly reported 
to Vane-Cartwright in Peters' house the after- 
noon before the murder occurred. And what all 
this taught Vane-Cartwright, though in part 
obscure, is in part obvious. It taught him that no 
letter from Verschoyle to Peters need at present 
be expected. It taught him that a letter from 
Bryanston, which must be expected, might be 
dangerous and must be intercepted. It taught him 
that Peters would remain inactive only till that 
letter reached his hands. It taught him also that 
if Peters were put to silence, Kuyper, the other 
European who had seen that body in Sulu, could 
tell no tales. 

After Peters' death, Thalberg, still acting 
under instructions, had had an interview with Dr. 
Verschoyle at Homburg, to which he had traced 
him, and had taken with him a letter written on 
the paper of the S.P.G., and signed, as he be- 
lieved, by the secretary of that society. (It has 
since appeared that the secretary had no know- 
ledge of such a letter.) Dr. Verschoyle delivered 
to him some journals which he, Thalberg, never 
read, for transmission to Vane-Cartwright. to 



TRACKS IX THE SNOW 223 

whom he duly delivered them. That, he said, was 
all that he knew of the subjects on which Cal- 
laghan sought information. He denied all know- 
ledge of further communications made on behalf 
of Vane-Cartwright with that important official in 
the Philippines ; but he appeared to me somewhat 
nervous in answering Callaghan's questions on 
this matter, and anxious to appease him with the 
prospect that he might be able, through friends 
of his, to ascertain what communications of this 
nature had actually taken place. 

It was curious to how many questions sug- 
gested to us by what he had said he could give 
no answer. Indeed he informed us, with an air 
of moral self-complacency, that he thought it a 
very sound maxim for a professional man to 
know as little as possible of things which it was 
not his business to know. I guessed that perhaps 
his strict observance of this precept was the thing 
which had commended him to the service of 
Vane-Cartwright, but I really do believe that Mr. 
Thalberg knew nothing behind the facts which 
he now thought it convenient to himself to reveal. 

However that may be, he made no secret of 
anything which he could disclose without injury 
to himself. We had got from him, or I ought to 



224 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

say Callaghan had got from him, evidence which 
might serve to show plainly enough that Vane- 
Cartwright was aware of Peters' suspicions and 
concerned himself greatly about them, and, con- 
tent with this, we were preparing to go when Mr. 
Thalberg stopped us saying that there was one 
important matter of which we had not asked him 
yet, and perhaps should be surprised to know that 
he could tell us anything. I have omitted to say 
that in the course of the conversation he had 
heard something from us about the things which 
had led to Vane-Cartwright's being suspected. 
We had told him in substance the story about the 
tracks, and were much surprised to find that he 
appeared wholly ignorant of the charge that had 
been brought against Trethewy. He now told us 
a fact which had a great bearing upon the history 
of those tracks. He asked us whether or not 
Peters' grounds could be seen from the upper 
rooms of the hotel. I said that no doubt they 
could, for the hotel was only too visible from 
those grounds. He then stated that having con- 
fined himself to his bedroom until it was time for 
him to start for his train, he had at a certain hour 
noticed a man walking across Peters' field (for 
from his description it was plain to me that it was 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 225 

Peters' field, and plain further that the man was 
walking pretty much where those tracks were 
made). This man, even at that distance, he recog- 
nised as Vane-Cartwright; he recognised him by 
his fur coat and a cap which Ellen Trethewy had 
seen him in, and by some peculiarity about his 
gait which he knew well. The man was also 
swinging his stick in Vane-Cartwright's own 
particular manner. The distance was consider- 
able, but I knew that it would be possible for a 
clear-sighted man to recognise at that distance 
any one whom he knew very well. The hour 
which Thalberg named corresponded with what 
Ellen Trethewy had told me. 



CHAPTER XXI 

As we left Thalberg's office and walked down 
the narrow court which led to the street, I dare- 
say our looks and voices, if not our words, 
betrayed the exultation of men who see a long- 
sought object at last within reach. As we turned 
into the street we were stopped by Vane-Cart- 
wright. 

Only the day before I had been expecting to 
find him lurking for me round every corner ; but 
now and here it startled me to meet him. When I 
learnt why he met us, it startled me still more, 
and looking back upon it, I still find it unaccount- 
able. 

" Mr. Driver, Mr. Callaghan," he said, ad- 
dressing us in turn in tones as quiet as ever, but 
with a pale face and highly-strung manner, ' I 
am your prisoner." I suppose we stared for a 
moment, for he repeated, " I am your prisoner. 

I will go with you where you like; or you can 

226 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 227 

give me in charge to the nearest constable. There 
is one. You see you have beaten me. You prob- 
ably do not yet know it yourselves, but you have/' 

" Well," he continued, " if you do not quite 
know what you are going to do, I will ask one thing 
of you. Before you give me up to justice, take me 
somewhere where I can talk with you two alone. 
I want to tell you my story. It will not make you 
alter your purpose, I know that ; but it will make 
you respect me a little more than you do. It is 
odd that I should want that, but I do." 

" Well, gentlemen ? ' he said questioningly, 
as we still hesitated, and his old self-possession 
returning for a moment, a smile of positive 
amusement came over his face. 

I confess that if I had acted on my own 
impulse I should have taken my antagonist at his 
word when he suggested that we should call the 
nearest policeman. But Callaghan had been tak- 
ing the lead in our late movements, and I felt that 
the occasion belonged to Callaghan; and Cal- 
laghan was more generous. 

If you have anything to say, sir," he said, 
come to my chambers and say it. Four- 
wheeler ! ' 

In a moment more we were in a cab how slow 



M 
M 



228 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

the cab seemed Callaghan sitting opposite 
Vane-Cartwright and watching him narrowly lest 
he should play us a trick, while I too watched him 
all through the interminable drive, very ill at ease 
as to the wisdom of our conduct, and wondering 
what could be the meaning of the unexpected and 
desperate hazard which our antagonist was now 
taking. He was evidently going to confess to us. 
But why? If the knowledge we already possessed 
was sufficient, as perhaps it was, to secure his 
conviction, yet he could only partly guess what 
that knowledge was; of the two most telling 
pieces of evidence against him, the fact about the 
window-latch which the surgeon had told us, and 
the fact that Thalberg had recognised him afar 
from his window in the hotel, he must have been 
quite unaware. And then what did he expect to 
gain by the interview which he had sought with 
us ? What opinion had he formed of the mental 
weaknesses of the t :o men with whom he was 
playing ? Was he relying overmuch upon the skill 
and mastery of himself and others which he 
would bring to bear in this strange interview? 
Had the fearful strain under which he had been 
living of late taken away the coolness and acute- 
ness of his judgment? Could he rely so much 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 22Q 

upon the chance of enlisting our compassion that 
he could afford to give us a certainty of his guilt, 
which, for all he knew, we had not got before, 
and to throw away the hope of making an escape 
by flight, which with a man of his resource might 
easily have been successful? Or had he some 
other far more sinister hope than that of stirring 
us to unworthy pity or generosity? I could not 
resolve these questions, but I was inclined to an 
explanation which he was himself about to give 
us. If the cause of suspicion against him became 
public he would have lost everything for which 
he greatly cared, and he was ready to risk all 
upon any chance, however faint, of avoiding this. 
I was, as I have said, ill at ease about it all. I 
did not feel that after the conversation I had held 
with him before, Vane-Cartwright would get over 
me, but it is an experience which one would do 
much to avoid, that of listening obdurate to an 
appeal into which another man puts his whole 
heart; and more especially would one wish to 
have avoided consenting to hear that appeal in a 
manner which might raise false hopes. But for a 
more serious reason it had been a mistake to 
acquiesce in this interview ; I had learned to know 
not only Callaghan's goodness of heart but his 



230 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

cleverness and his promptitude, but I had not 
learned to credit him with wisdom or with firm- 
ness; and the sort of impulsiveness, which had 
made him at once grant the request for this inter- 
view, might easily have further and graver con- 
sequences. 

At last we were in Callaghan's room and seated 
ourselves round a table. 

" I see/' said Vane-Cartwright, " that it puzzles 
you gentlemen why I should ask for this inter- 
view. You think I am an ordinary criminal, 
which perhaps I am, and you thought that like an 
ordinary criminal I should try all means to save 
a disgraced life, which I certainly shall not do. 
I know that you have not got the knowledge 
which would convict me of murder. I do not sup- 
pose you think you have, and in any case you 
have not. And, if you had, I think you know I 
have contrivance enough to take myself off and 
live comfortably out of reach of the law. But I do 
not care for escape, and I do not care for 
acquittal. You have the means to throw suspicion 
on me, and that is enough for me. I cared for 
honour and success, and I do not care for life 
when they are lost." He was looking at each of 
us alternately with an inscrutable but quite un- 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 231 

flinching gaze, but he now hid his eyes, and he 
added as if with difficulty, " Yet I did care for 
one other thing besides my position in the world, 
but that has gone from me too. 

" And now," he resumed, " that my struggle is 
over, and that the people more people and 
bigger people than you would think who have 
been courting me for the last twelve months will 
think of me only with as just abhorrence as Thai- 
berg himself does, I have an odd fancy, and it is 
this : I should like to stand a little better in the 
eyes of the very men who, far from courting me, 
have had the courage to suspect me and the 
tenacity to drag me down." He had raised his 
eyes again, but this time fixed them on Callaghan 
only, for he doubtless saw that I was out of touch 
with him, and, seeing this, he had art enough to 
appear to recognise and acquiesce in it. 

f You know something of my story. Let me 
tell you just a little more of it, and, please, if it 
interests you enough, question me on any point 
you will. I shall not shrink from answering. If a 
man is known to have murdered two of his 
friends, there cannot be much left that it is worth 
his while to conceal. First, I would like to speak 
of my early training. If I had been brought up in 



232 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

the gutter, you could make some allowance for 
that, and give me some credit for any good quali- 
ties I had shown, however cheerfully you might 
see me hanged for my crimes. It is not usual to 
suppose that any such allowance may have to be 
made for a man brought up to luxury and to every 
sort of refinement, and yet such a man too may 
be the victim of influences which would kill the 
good in most characters even more than they have 
in mine. You may have heard a little about my 
people, and perhaps know that their views and 
ways were not quite usual ; I am not going to say 
one word against them (I am not that sort of man, 
whatever I may be), but there were two things in 
my boyhood harder for me than the ordinary 
Englishman can well imagine. I was brought up 
in the actual enjoyment of considerable wealth 
and the expectation of really great wealth, and 
just when I was grown up the wealth and the ex- 
pectations suddenly vanished. That has hap- 
pened to many men who have been none the 
worse for it. But then I was brought up soft. You 
know I am not a limp man or a coward ; but I had 
all the bringing up of one; cared for hand and 
foot, never doing a thing for myself (my good 
people had great ideas of republican simplicity, 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 233 

but they were only literary ideas). None of the 
games, none of the sport that other boys get ; no 
rubbing shoulders with my equals at school ; no 
comradeship but only the company of my elders, 
mostly invalids. Few people know what it is to 
be brought up soft. But there was worse than 
that. You " (he was addressing Callaghan) " were 
piously brought up. Oh, yes, you were really. I 
daresay your home was not a strict one, and you 
were not carefully taught precepts of religion and 
morality or carefully shielded from the sight of 
evil (perhaps quite the contrary, for I have not 
the pleasure of knowing much about you, Mr. 
Callaghan), but I am quite sure that you had 
about you at home or at school, or both, people 
among whom there was some tacit recognition of 
right and wrong of some sort as things incontro- 
vertible, and that there was some influence in 
your childhood which appealed to the heart. But 
in my childhood nothing appealed to the heart, 
nothing was incontrovertible, above all nothing 
was tacit. Everlasting discussion, reaching back 
to the first principles of the universe, and branch- 
ing out into such questions as whether children 
should be allowed pop-guns. That was my moral 
training, and that was all my moral training. It 



234 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

was very sound in principle, I daresay and I am 
not going to pose as an interesting convert to the 
religious way of looking at things, for I am not 
one but it did not take account of practical 
difficulties, and it was very, very hard on me. Not 
one man in ten thousand has had that sort of 
upbringing, and I do not suppose you can realise 
in the least how hard that sort of thing is. 

' So," he continued, ' I found myself at 
twenty-one suddenly made poor; more accus- 
tomed than most lads to think life only worth 
living for refinements which are for the wealthy 
only; taught not to take traditional canons o,f 
morality for granted; taught to think about the 
real utility of every action ; landed in a place like 
Saigon, and thrown in the society of the sort of 
gentry who, we all know, do represent European 
civilisation in such places ; sent there to get a 
living; thoroughly out of sympathy with all the 
tastes and pleasures of the people round me, and 
at the same time easily able to discover that for 
all my strange upbringing I was by nature more 
of a man than any one else there. As a matter of 
fact, there was only one decent man there with 
intellectual tastes, and that was Peters; but 
Peters, who was only two or three years older 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 235 

than I, and, as I own I fancied, nothing like so 
clever, took me under his protection and made it 
his mission to correct me, and it did not do. You 
can easily imagine how, in the three years before 
Longhurst came on the scene, I had got to hate 
the prospect of a life of humdrum, money- 
grubbing among those people in the hope of re- 
tiring with a small competence some day when 
my liver and my brain were gone ; you would not 
have thought any the better of me if I had become 
content with that. At any rate I did not. I meant 
to be quit of it as soon as I could, and I meant 
more. I resolved before I had been three weeks 
in the place to make money on a scale which 
would give me the position, the society and the 
pursuits for which I had been trained. I resolved 
in fact to make the sort of place for myself in the 
world which every man, except the three men in 
this room and Thalberg, thinks I have secured. 
If I had no scruples as to the way in which I 
should carry out that resolve, I differed from the 
people around me only in knowing that I had no 
scruples, and in having instead a set purpose 
which I was man enough to pursue through life. 
And I am man enough, I hope, not to care much 
for life now that that purpose has failed. If I 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

pursued my end without scruple, I think I was 
carrying out to its logical conclusion the princi- 
ples that had been taught me as a boy ; and, as I 
am not going to seek your sympathy on false pre- 
tences, let me tell you I do not know to-day that 
there are any better principles there may be ; I 
hope there are. 

' I waited nearly three years, learning all I 
could about business and about the East, its trade 
and its resources, and waiting all the time for my 
opportunity which I knew would come, and which 
came. It came to me through Longhurst; but I 
must go back a little. I have said that Peters was 
my only equal in our society there. Now let me 
say, once for all, that in nothing that I am going 
to tell you do I wish to blame Peters more than 
I blame myself ; but from the first we did not hit 
it off. Peters, as I have said, took on himself the 
part of my protector and adviser a little too 
obviously; he had not quite tact enough to do it 
well, and I was foolish enough in those days to 
resent what I thought his patronage. At first there 
was no harm done ; Peters thought I should be the 
.better if I entered more into such sport as there 
was in the place, for which I had very little taste, 
and he tried to make me do so by charring me 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 237 

about being a duffer, in his blunt way, which I 
thought rude, and that before other people. You 
would hardly imagine that I was ever shy, but I 
was; and, absurd as it seems, this added a good 
deal to my unhappiness in my new surroundings. 
I should very soon have got over that, for I soon 
found my way about the place, and my shyness 
quickly wore off; but worse than that followed. 
I was fond of arguing, and used to discuss all 
things in heaven and earth with Peters. You can 
easily suppose that his views and mine did not 
agree, and I daresay now that I pained him a 
good deal. I did not mean to do that, but I did 
mean to shock him sometimes, and so I often 
took a cynical line, by which I meant nothing at 
all, telling him the sharp things that I should do 
if I got the chance ; and once or twice I was fool 
enough to pretend that all sorts of things of 
which Peters would not approve went on in our 
business. To my amazement I discovered after a 
time that Peters took all this nonsense seriously. 
I would have given anything to efface the impres- 
sion that I had made, for, though there are few 
men that I ever respected, Peters was one of 
them. But Peters became reserved towards me 
and impossible to get at. Then gossip came in 



238 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

between us. There is sometimes very spiteful 
gossip in a little European settlement in the 
East ; and I am certain, though I cannot prove it, 
that a man there, with whom I had constant busi- 
ness, told Peters a story about a shady transaction 
which he said I was in. The transaction was real 
enough, but neither I nor my firm had any more 
to do with it than you. I know that this man told 
it to other people, for I have heard so from them, 
and I do not doubt that that was what finally 
turned Peters against me. I tried to tax Peters 
with having picked up this story, but he said 
something which sounded like disbelieving me, 
and I lost my temper and broke off; and from 
that day till we met again at Long Wilton we 
never exchanged any more words together, 
though we crossed one another's path as you shall 
hear. 

' Mind, again, I am not saying it was his fault ; 
but it is in itself doing a young man a very ill turn 
to show him that you think him dishonest when as 
yet he is not, and it did me harm. Upon my soul, 
I was honest then ; in fact, in that regard, most of 
my dealings throughout life would stand a pretty 
close scrutiny. But I have often thought that I 
might have become a much better man if Peters 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 239 

would have been my friend instead of suspecting 
me unjustly; and I confess that it rankles to this 
day, and all the more because I always respected 
Peters. After that, however, he did me some 
practical ill turns, disastrously ill turns; rightly 
enough, if he thought as he did. I must tell you 
that our separation came a very little while before 
Longhurst came to the place. Just afterwards I 
had an opening, a splendid opening ; it would not 
have made me the rich man that I am, but it 
would have given me a good position right away, 
and what it would have saved me you shall 
judge. A very eminent person came to Saigon; 
he knew something of Peters and a little of me. 
He saw a great deal of Peters at Saigon, and he 
pressed him to accept a post that was in his gift 
in the Chinese Customs service. Peters refused. 
I suppose he was at that time thinking of coming 
home. The great man then spoke to me about it, 
and had all but offered it to me. How I should 
have jumped at it ! But suddenly it all went off 
and he said no more to me. I believed that Peters 
warned him against me; possibly, being sore 
against Peters, I was mistaken; but at any rate 
that was what I ever afterwards believed. It was 
partly in desperate annoyance about this that I 



240 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

plunged into what then seemed my wild venture 
with Longhurst. 

" And now I must tell you about Longhurst. 
He had been at some time, I suppose, a clever 
man; at least he had a wonderful store of prac- 
tical knowledge about forests, mining and other 
matters, and he had travelled a great deal in all 
parts of that region of the world, and picked up 
many things which he wanted to turn to account. 
He had made a little money which he wished to 
increase, and he had a great scheme of organising 
and developing the trade of South-Eastern Asia 
and its islands in various valuable kinds of 
timber, spices, gum, shellac, etc., etc. He pro- 
mised any one who could join him that in a few 
years, by exploiting certain yet undeveloped but 
most profitable sources of supply, he could get a 
monopoly of several important trades, the sago 
trade, for example. He set forth his scheme to 
the company generally at the English Club the 
first time I met him, and everybody laughed at 
him except me, who saw that if he got into the 
right hands there was something to be made out 
of his discoveries for him and other people. And 
as a matter of fact we did make something of 
them, more than I expected, but not what he 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 241 

expected. I did not make a large sum out of our 
joint venture, not much more than I could have 
made by staying where I was, but I got the know- 
ledge of Eastern commerce, which has enabled 
me since to do what I have done. 

' I saw you smile just now, Mr. Callaghan, 
when I spoke of Longhurst getting into the right 
hands. Well he did ; and I did not. He had been, 
as I said, a clever man, and there was something 
taking about him with his bluff, frank, burly air, 
but he was going off when I met him. People do 
go downhill if they spend all their lives in odd 
corners of the earth ; and, though I did not know 
it at first, he had taken the surest road downhill, 
for he had begun to drink, and very soon it gained 
upon him like wildfire. When he once goes wrong 
no one can be so wrong-headed as a man like 
that, who thinks that he knows the world from 
having knocked about it a great deal doing 
nothing settled ; and I should have found Long- 
hurst difficult to deal with in any case. As it was, 
Longhurst dined with Peters the night before we 
left Saigon together. On the first day of our 
voyage he was very surly to me, and he said, ' I 
heard something funny about you last night, 
Master Cartwright. I wish I had heard it before, 



242 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

that's all.' When I fired up and told him to say 
straight out what it was, he looked at me offen- 
sively, and went off into the smoking-room of the 
steamer to have another drink. That was not a 
cheerful beginning of our companionship, and I 
had my suspicion as to whom I ought to thank for 
it. I believe the same tale-bearer that I men- 
tioned before had been telling Peters some yarn 
about my arrangements with Longhurst, which 
looked as if I was trying to swindle him, and that 
Peters had passed it on. I very soon found that 
Longhurst was not so simple as he seemed. I 
daresay he had meant honestly enough by me at 
first, but having got it into his thick head that I 
was a little too sharp, he made up his mind to be 
the sharper of the two ; and the result was that if 
I was to be safe in dealing with him I must take 
care to keep the upper hand of him, and before 
long I made up my mind that my partner should 
go out of the firm. I could have made his fortune 
if he would have let me, but I meant that the con- 
cern should be mine and not his, and I did not 
disguise it from him. That was my great mis- 
take. I do not know what story, if any, you have 
picked up about my dealings with Longhurst. 
He put about many stories when we had begun to 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 243 

quarrel for he had begun by that time, if not 
before, to drink freely but the matter that we 
finally quarrelled about was this. Of the various 
concessions which we started by obtaining (at 
least I started by obtaining them ; that was to be 
my great contribution to the partnership), two 
only proved of very great importance one was 
from the Spanish Government of the Philippines 
and the other from the Government of Anam, and 
these, as it happened, were for three and four 
years, renewable under certain conditions but also 
revocable earlier in certain events. There was no 
trickery about that, though Longhurst may have 
thought there was. I simply could not get larger 
concessions with the means of persuasion 
(bribery, in other words) at our command. Sub- 
sequently I got renewals and extensions of these 
concessions to myself alone. To the best of my 
belief then and now the transaction held water in 
law and in equity, but whatever a lawyer might 
think of it, the common sense was this : Long- 
hurst had become so reckless and so muddle- 
headed that nothing could any longer prosper 
under his control, if he had the control, and be- 
sides that, I never could have got the extended 
concessions at all if he was to be one of the con- 



244 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

cessionaires. There are some things which an 
Eastern Government or a Spanish Government 
cannot stand, and Longhurst's treatment of the 
natives was one of them. But I must go back a 
bit. There were other things besides this which 
contributed to our quarrel. For one thing, odd as 
it may sound in speaking of two grown-up men, 
Longhurst bullied me physically bullied me. 
He was a very powerful man, more so, I should 
think, even than you, Mr. Callaghan, and when, 
as often happened, we were travelling alone to- 
gether, he used to insist on my doing as he liked 
in small arrangements, by the positive threat of 
violence. To do him justice he did not do it when 
he was sober, and though in those days I was a 
weakly and timid man compared to what I have 
become, I soon learned how to stop it altogether. 
But you can easily imagine that I did not love him ; 
and a bitter feeling towards his chief companion 
is not a wholesome thing for a man to carry about 
through a year or two of hard work in that climate 
(for it is a climate ! none of the dry heat and 
bracing winters you have in Northern India); 
still I hope I did not bear him malice so much for 
that as for other things. I have said I have no 
scruples, but I have no liking for ruffianism and 






TRACKS IN THE SNOW 245 

cruelty. I hate them for the same reason for 
which I hate some pictures and some architecture, 
because they are not to my taste. But I had, in 
out-of-the-way places, among weak savages, 
where law and order had not come, to put up with 
seeing deeds done which people here at home 
would not believe were done by their countrymen, 
and which a man who has served his days in an 
honourable service like the Indian Civil could 
believe in least of all. He had kicked a wretched 
man to death (for I have no doubt he died of it) 
the day he died himself. 

1 But why do I make all these excuses ? for, 
after all, what did I do that needs so much 
excuse? I told Longhurst plainly what I had 
done about the concessions and what I proposed 
to do for him, and he seemed to fall in with it all, 
and then he went home for a month's holiday in 
England. I suppose he saw some lawyer, prob- 
ably Thalberg, and got it into his head that he 
could make out a case of fraud against me. At 
any rate, when he returned, he seemed surly ; he 
did not have it out with me straight, but he began 
to make extravagant demands of me and threaten 
me vaguely with some exposure if I did not give 
in to them, which of course I did not. Then he 



246 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

quarrelled about it in his cups, for the cups were 
getting more and more frequent, and several 
times over he got so violent as to put me in actual 
fear of my life. And at last, unhappily for him, 
it came to a real encounter. We had visited the 
island of Sulu, where I had reason to think we 
might establish a branch of our business, and 
after two or three days in an inland town we were 
returning to the coast, expecting to be picked up 
by a Chinese junk which was to take us back. The 
evening before we started down he produced a 
packet of documents and brandished it at me as 
if it contained something very damaging to me, 
and I could see plainly (for I have an eye for 
handwriting) that on the top of it was an envetope 
addressed by Peters. I am not justified in in- 
ferring from this that Peters who had seen 
Longhurst several times since he had seen me 
had again been repeating to him some malicious 
falsehood with which he had been stuffed before 
he left Saigon; but can you wonder that I did 
infer it? On the march down when we were 
alone, for we had sent on our servants before 
Longhurst began again more savagely than ever, 
and for about an hour he heaped all sorts of 
charges and vile insinuations upon me, which I 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 247 

answered for a while as patiently as I could. At 
last, breaking off in the middle of a curse, he fell 
into silence. He strode on angrily ahead for a 
hundred yards or so. Then at a rocky part of the 
path, where I was below him, he turned suddenly. 
He hurled at me a great stone which narrowly 
missed me, and then he came rushing and clam- 
bering back down the path at me. I fired (he 
turned as I fired). That was the end. Was it 
murder ? " He paused and then braced himself 
up as he answered his own question. " Yes, it 
was, because I was angry, not afraid, and because 
I could easily have run away, only for some 
reason I did not mean to. 

" But I am foolish to weary you with all this 
long preliminary story, for, after all, what do you 
care about Longhurst; it is Peters, your own 
friend, about whom you care. You think that he 
came to suspect me of murdering Longhurst, and 
I killed him for that ; but as sure as I killed him, 
that was not that was not what made me do it." 

Vane-Cartwright sat for a long time with his 
face covered with his hands. At last he sat up 
and looked me straight in the face. " Mr. Driver, 
did you never suspect there was a romance in 
Peters' life of which you knew nothing? I did 



248 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

know of it, and I honoured him for it, but I hated 
him for it too. Certainly you did not suspect that 
there was a romance in mine. It does not seem 
likely that a great passion should come to a calcu- 
lating man like me, with the principles of con- 
duct of which I have made no secret to-day. But 
such things do happen, and a great passion came 
late in life to me. And here is the cruel thing, 
which almost breaks my philosophy down, and 
makes me think that after all there is a curse 
upon crime. It ought to have enriched and 
ennobled my life, ought it not? It came at just 
the moment, in just the shape, and with all the 
attendant accidents to ruin me. 

" It began five years ago. Miss Denison and 
her parents were staying at Pau. I was in the 
same hotel and I met them. I knew nothing then 
of their position and wealth and all that, for I 
had not been long in London. I loved her, and a 
great hope came into my life. One begins to 
weary after a while of toiling just to make money 
for oneself. For a few days all seemed changed, 
the whole world was new and bright to me. Sud- 
denly I got an intimation from the father of the 
lady that my calls were no longer acceptable. I 
could not imagine the reason. I asked for an 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 249 

interview to explain matters, and he refused it. 
I left at once. I did not yet know how hard I 
should find it to give her up. It was only as I 
left the hotel that I learned that Peters, Peters 
whom I had not met since we quarrelled at 
Saigon, and of whom I last heard of the day that 
Longhurst died, was in the hotel and had called 
on my friends. Now I see clearly that I am 
wrong to draw inferences, but again, I ask, could 
I help inferring what I did ? 

' More than four years passed. I tried hard to 
create new interests for myself in artistic things, 
making all sorts of collections ; and I developed 
an ambition to be a personage in London society. 
Then I saw Miss Denison again, and I knew that 
I had not forgotten her, and could not do so. I 
knew now what had happened, and so I abso- 
lutely insisted on an explanation. I had it out 
with the father. I satisfied him absolutely. In a 
few weeks' time I was engaged. For the first 
time in my life I was happy. That was only a 
month before I came to Long Wilton. I must 
tell you that Peters had known the Denisons long, 
and that I knew Miss Denison had been fond of 
him, but we naturally did not talk of him much, 
and I did not know he was at Long Wilton. 



250 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

There, to my complete surprise, I saw Peters 
again. I would not avoid him, but I certainly 
did not wish to meet him. He, however, came up 
to me and spoke quite cordially. I do not know 
whether he had reflected and thought he had been 
hard on me, but he seemed to wish to make 
amends, and I at that time, just for a few short 
hours, had not got it in my heart to be other than 
friendly with any man. 

! That evening I spent at his house. You, Mr. 
Callaghan, were there, and you must have seen 
that something happened. I at any rate saw that 
something I said had revived all Peters' sus- 
picions of me, and this time with the addition of 
a suspicion, which was true, that I had murdered 
Longhurst. 

" Now, I ask you, if you have any lingering 
idea that that was why I killed him, how was it 
possible that he could ever prove me guilty? 
Have you any inkling of how he could have done 
it? I have not. Now what could induce me, on 
account of a mere idle suspicion on the part of a 
man who need be nothing to me, to run the risk 
amounting almost to certainty of being hanged 
for murdering him? 

" But my conscience was active then, for a 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 251 

reason which any man who has loved may guess. 
I wanted to clear up all with Peters. I could not 
get him alone that evening, and I had to go next 
day. I returned the first day I could, bringing 
certain materials for clearing up the early trans- 
action about which he had first suspected me. I 
was honestly determined to make a clean breast 
to him about Longhurst. You can hardly wonder 
that I meant to feel my way with him in this. I 
tried to get to close quarters with him. Mr. Cal- 
laghan saw enough to know how unsuccessful I 
was. I tried all the time, again and again, to draw 
Peters into intimate talk about our days in the 
East, but he always seemed to push me away. I 
determined very soon to obtain a letter from a 
friend, whom I will not name now, who knew how 
Longhurst had treated me, which I could show to 
Peters ; so I wrote to him. But in the meantime 
relations with Peters grew harder and harder. I 
will not spin out excuses, but all his old animosity 
to me returned, and I began while I was waiting 
for that letter to feel once again the old rancour 
I had felt. This man had hurt me by suspecting 
me falsely, when, had he shown me confidence, 
he could have made a better man of me ; he had 
spoilt my best chance of a career; he had 



252 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

poisoned my relations with Longhurst, and so 
brought about the very crime of which he was 
now lying in wait to accuse me ; he had thwarted 
my love for four miserable years. On the top of 
all that came this letter " (he had held a letter in 
his hand all the time he was speaking), :c and it 
shall speak for itself. But first one question. You 
may remember when you first saw me at Long 
Wilton. Well, I came really as it happened upon 
an errand for Miss Denison. Mrs. Nicholas, in 
the village, you may not know, had been her 
nurse. But that does not matter. Between my 
first visit and my return, do you happen to re- 
member that a Mrs. Bulteel was staying at the 
hotel, and visited Mr. Peters of whom she was an 
old friend?" 

Callaghan remembered that it was so. 

" Mrs. Bulteel is, I have always supposed, the 
lady referred to in this letter, which reached me 
(will you note ?) by the five o'clock post at Peters' 
house, seven hours before I killed him." 

He passed the letter to me without looking at 
me. Callaghan and I read it together. It was in 
a lady's hand, signed with the name of Lady 
Denison, the young lady's mother. It appeared 
to be written in great agitation. Its purport was 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 253 

that the young lady had resolved, so her mother 
found, to break off her engagement with Vane- 
Cartwright. She had formerly loved another man, 
whose name the mother thought she must not 
mention though probably Vane-Cartwright knew 
it, but had supposed that he did not care for her 
or had given up doing so. She had now learned 
from an officious lady friend, who had lately seen 
this old lover, that he cared for her still; that he 
had concealed his passion when he found she 
favoured Vane-Cartwright, but that having now 
apparently quarrelled with Vane-Cartwright he 
had authorised her to let this be known if she saw 
her opportunity. The mother concluded by say- 
ing that she had so far failed in reasoning with 
her daughter, who had wished to write and break 
off her engagement, an'd all she could do was to 
lay on her the absolute command not to write 
to Vane-Cartwright at all for the present. 

1 There is only one comment to make on that 
letter," said Vane-Cartwright. " You may wonder 
why I should have assumed that it was hopeless. 
Well, I knew the lady better than vou, better 

J * 

than her mother did, and knew that if her old 
attachment had returned it had returned to stay. 
Besides, I read this letter with my rival sitting in 



254 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

the room (you two gentlemen were sitting in the 
room too as it happens), and when hard, self-con- 
tained people do come under these influences, 
they do not give way to them by halves. 

' Thank you," said Vane-Cartwright, when we 
had read and returned the letter. * I am glad you 
have heard me so patiently. That all this makes 
me less of a villain than you thought me, I do not 
pretend to say; but I think you will understand 
why I wished some men whom I respected, as I 
respect you, to know my story. I do not suggest 
for a moment that it should influence your present 
action. Here I am, as I said to begin with, your 
prisoner. Of course you see that society is just 
as safe from future murders from me as from any 
man. But if your principles of justice demand 
life for life, or if human feeling makes you re- 
solve to avenge your friend, that is just what I 
came here expecting. I am the last man in the 
world who could give an unprejudiced opinion on 
the ethics of punishment." 

He ended with a quiet and by no means dis- 
agreeable smile. 

As I have often said I make no sort of pre- 
tence to report any talk quite correctly, and here, 
where the manner of the talk is of special im- 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 255 

portance, I feel more than ever my incompetence 
to report it. I can only say that the singular 
confession, of which I have striven to repeat the 
purport, was in reality delivered with a great 
deal of restrained eloquence, and with occasional 
most moving play of facial expression, all the 
more striking in a man whom I had seldom be- 
fore seen to move a muscle of his face unneces- 
sarily. It was delivered to two men of whom one 
(myself) was physically overwrought, while the 
other (Callaghan), naturally emotional, was at 
the commencement in the fullest elation of tri- 
umphant pursuit, in other words ready to recoil 
violently. 

We sat, I do not know how long, each wait- 
ing for the other to speak. Vane-Cartwright sat 
meanwhile neither looking at us nor moving his 
countenance only the fingers of one hand kept 
drumming gently upon his knee. 

At last I did what I think I never did but 
once before, obeyed an impulse almost physical 
to speak words which my mouth seemed to utter 
mechanically. If they were the words of reason, 
they were not the words of my conscious thought, 
for that was busy with all and more than all the 
scruples which had ever made this business hard 
to me. 



256 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

"Mr. Vane-Cartwright," I said, "it is my 
painful duty to tell you at once that I do not 
believe one word you have said, except what I 
knew already.'' 

He went white for a moment; then quickly re- 
composed himself and inclined his head slightly 
with a politely disdainful expression. 

"Oh, Driver, 52 said Callaghan, in a gentle 
tone, and he arose and paced the room. He 
was strangely moved. To begin with, though 
he had felt nothing but remorseless glee in his 
share in hunting his victim down, he would in 
any case have felt great repugnance at giving 
him the coup de grace. But then he had once 
taken the step of inviting that victim into his own 
room; he had sat there for an hour and a half 
with that victim by his own fireside, telling his 
life-story and implicitly pleading for his life. 
And the pleading had been conducted under the 
flattering pretext that it was not pleading at all 
but the instinctive confidence of a redoubtable 
antagonist, in one whom he respected for having 
beaten him. As for the story itself, Callaghan 
did not exactly believe it; on the contrary, I found 
afterwards that, while I had not got beyond a 
vague sense that the whole story was a tissue of 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 257 

lies, he had noted with rapid acuteness each of 
the numerous points of improbability in it; but 
to his mind (Irish, if I may say publicly what 
I have said to him) the fact that the story ap- 
pealed to his imaginative sympathy was almost 
as good as its being true, and what in respect of 
credibility was wanting to its effect was quite 
made good by Callaghan 's admiration for the 
.ntrepidity with which the man had carried out 
:his attempt on us. And the story did appeal to 
lis sympathy, he had sympathised with his early 
struggles, he had sympathised still more with 
:he suggestion of passion in his final crime, and 
(Irish again) had ignored the fact that on the 
:riminars own showing the crime conceived in 
Dassion had been carried through with a cold- 
blooded meanness of which Callaghan's own 
lature had no trace. Lastly, he was genuinely 
Duzzled by the problem as to the morality of 
/engeance which Vane-Cartwright had raised 
vith so dexterously slight a touch. 

Whatever his motive, Callaghan was upon 
he point of resolving that, at least from his own 
oom where the criminal had come to appeal to 
lis mercy, that criminal should go away free. 
Vnd if Callaghan had so resolved I should have 



258 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

been powerless for a time; he was prepared and 
I was not as to the steps immediately to be taken 
to secure Vane-Cartwright's arrest. But it seems, 
if for once I may use that phrase with so little 
or else so deep a meaning, that the luck had 
departed from Vane-Cartwright. At this crisis of 
his fate a device of his own recoiled upon him with 
terrible force. 

" I cannot do it! I cannot do it! " Callaghan 
was exclaiming, when the door opened and a 
telegram was brought for me. This was the 
message: ' Clarissa terribly ill, symptoms 
poison, Bancroft, Fidele. >: It meant that my 
wife was dying at the friend's villa to which she 
had gone, and dying by that man's means, and 
it was certified by the use of the password 
which my wife had told me to expect. I did not 
reflect and I did not speak; I grasped Cal- 
laghan's arm and I put the telegram in his hand. 
He knew enough to understand the message well. 
He read it with an altered face. He passed it to 
Vane-Cartwright and said: " Read that, and take 
it for my answer. ' ; I should doubt if Vane- 
Cartwright had often been violently angry, but 
he was now. He dashed the telegram down with 
a curse. "The fool," he said, and he gasped 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 259 

with passion, ' ' if he was going to try that trick, 
why did not he do it before ? ' Callaghan stepped 
up to me, put his big arms round me, and for a 
moment hugged me in them, with tears in his 
eyes. Then without a word he strode across the 
room, and, before I could see what was happen- 
ing, Vane-Cartwright's hands were tied behind 
his back with a great silk handkerchief. 



CHAPTER XXII 

MY story draws towards its close, and of mystery 
or of sudden peril it has little more to tell. Upon 
one point, the most vital to me, let me not give 
the reader a moment's suspense. My wife did 
not die of poison, had not been poisoned, had 
not been ill ; no friend sent that telegram. What 
had happened was this: on one single occasion 
she had not despatched her own message herself; 
through the misunderstanding or too prompt 
courtesy of her host's butler, the telegram which 
she had written had been taken by a messenger, 
and it had fallen into the hands of the enemy's 
watchful emissary. It had revealed to him the 
password which my wife used to me; and in its 
place there had gone over the wires a message 
which would indeed have called me back at any 
stage of the pursuit, but which was fated to arrive 
neither sooner nor later than the moment when 
it must destroy Vane-Cartwright's last hope of 
escape. 26o 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 261 

I say not later, for indeed I have evidence 
strong enough for my now suspicious mind that 
Vane-Cartwright had endeavoured to prepare 
his escape in the event of his failure to persuade 
Callaghan and myself. An unoccupied flat im- 
mediately below Callaghan 's had the day before 
been engaged by a nameless man, who paid a 
quarter's rent in advance, and on the day of his 
interview with us, several strange persons, who 
were never seen there again, arrived with every 
sign of belated haste; but, whatever accident had 
delayed them, they arrived a quarter of an hour 
after we had left. 

And so on the i5th of May, 1897, nearly 
sixteen months after Peters' death, his murderer 
was handed over to the police, with information 
which, including as it did the fact of his confes- 
sion, ensured their taking him into custody. 

Then I, in my turn, became Callaghan J s 
prisoner. I arrived at Charing Cross station in 
good time for the night train, and found my 
luggage already there and registered, and my 
ticket taken. Our tickets taken, rather, for, 
protest as I might, I was escorted by Callaghan, 
indeed nursed (and I needed it) the whole way 
to Florence, and to the villa where my wife was 



262 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

staying. One item remains untold to complete 
for the present the account of the debt which I 
owe him. We had hardly left Charing Cross 
when his quick wits arrived at precisely that 
explanation of the telegram which in happy fact 
was true; but all the way, talkative man though 
he was, he refrained from vexing my bruised 
mind with a hope which, he knew, I should not 
be able to trust. 

When he had learnt at the door that his happy 
foreboding was true, no entreaty would induce 
him to stay and break bread. He returned at 
once to England, leaving me to enter alone to 
that reunion of which I need say nothing, nor 
even tell how much two people had hungered 
for it. 

The reader who is curious in such matters 
might almost reconstruct for himself (in spite of 
the newspaper reports which naturally are mis- 
leading) the trial of William Vane-Cartwright. 
He might pick out from these pages the facts 
capable of legal proof, which, once proved and 
once marshalled into their places, could leave no 
reasonable doubt of the prisoner's guilt. 

But, however late, the trained intelligence of 
the police had now been applied to the matter, 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 263 

and the case wore an altered aspect. No start- 
ling discovery had come to pass, only the revela- 
tion of the obvious. Some points had been 
ascertained which ought to have been ascer- 
tained long before; still more, facts long known 
had been digested, as, surely, it should have 
been somebody's business to digest them from 
the first. In particular, tardy attention had been 
paid to the report of the young constable who, 
as I mentioned, followed Sergeant Speke into 
Peters' room, and who had incurred some blame 
because his apparent slowness had allowed some 
trespassers to come and make footprints on the 
lawn (I fancy his notes had been overlooked 
when some officer in charge of the case had been 
superseded by another). The observed move- 
ments, just after the crime, of two or three people 
who were about the scene, had been set down in 
order. Enquiries, such as only authority could 
make, had ultimately been made among Vane- 
Cartwright's acquaintance in the East, and, 
though disappointing in the main, they yielded 
one fact of importance. Moreover, the researches 
which were made by Callaghan shortly after the 
murder, and which I had supposed at the time 
were so futile, now appeared in another light. 



264 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

Just before that suspicious flight to Paris, he had 
given to the police at Exeter some scrappy and 
ill-explained notes; and on a subsequent visit, 
which I have mentioned, to Scotland Yard, he 
had handed in a long and over-elaborate mem- 
orandum. These now received justice. I must, 
therefore, attempt to state, with dry accuracy, 
the case which was actually presented against the 
accused. 

Upon the fact that he had confessed his guilt, 
though indeed it reversed the surface improba- 
bility that a man in his position was a criminal, 
I must not lay excessive emphasis. Neither judge 
nor prosecuting counsel did so. The defence 
dealt with it upon a theory which turned it to 
positive advantage. I myself can well conceive 
that a man, to whom his life was little and his 
reputation much, might have taken the risk of a 
false confession to us in the hope of binding us 
to silence. 

But, to begin, Peters was without doubt 
murdered on a certain night, and during that 
night Vane-Cartwright was one of a few who 
could easily have had access to him. 

Now years before one Longhurst had disap- 
peared; a report had got abroad that he went 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 265 

down in a certain ship which had been lost; 
the report was false; but he never reappeared; 
several witnesses (traced out by the enquiry of 
the police in the East) appeared at the trial, and 
swore that Vane-Cartwright had often spoken of 
Longhurst's sailing in that ship; yet he must, 
according to Mr. Bryanston's evidence, which 
was procured by commission, have known that 
this was false; and, according to the same 
evidence, he had been in Longhurst's company 
after the time when the rest of Longhurst's 
neighbours last saw him. From this (though the 
other proved facts of their connection amounted 
to little more than they were reputed partners) 
it followed that Vane-Cartwright was in a posi- 
tion in which suspicion of foul play towards 
Longhurst might easily fall on him. 

Next, Peters at the time of his death not 
merely entertained this suspicion but was taking 
steps to obtain proof of its truth; for there were 
his letters to Bryanston and to Verschoyle still 
extant, and admissible in evidence as res gestce, 
the actual first steps which he had taken with 
this aim. 

Next, Vane-Cartwright knew of Peters' sus- 
picion and was greatly perturbed by the knowl- 



266 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

edge. His whole conduct was in this regard 
most significant. Callaghan showed that on the 
first evening when he had seen the two men to- 
gether their intercourse had at first been easy, 
but that by the end of the evening something had 
happened which completely altered their man- 
ners; the one became abstracted and aloof, the 
other eagerly watched him. Of the talk which 
caused this change Callaghan had only caught 
Peters' question, ' sailed in what, ): but it was 
evident now to what that question referred. It 
was in itself strange that after this Vane-Cart- 
wright should have availed himself of a general 
invitation given by Peters earlier, and have come 
rather suddenly to his house, putting off (as it 
was now shown) for that purpose a previous 
important engagement. It was a sinister fact 
that, before he did so, he had set on foot mys- 
terious enquiries, some of which related to the 
two men to whom, in his presence, Peters had 
written letters about the affair of Longhurst, 
while the rest, though less obviously, appeared 
to be connected with the same matter. The first 
fruits of these enquiries (and they were telling) 
had been, by his arrangement, brought to him 
on the very afternoon before the murder. After 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 267 

the murder he had, it now seemed plain, stayed 
on at my house merely in the hope of intercepting 
Bryanston's answer. By what means he knew 
that the sting of Dr. Verschoyle lay in his 
journals cannot be conjectured, but there was 
no mistaking the purpose with which, a little 
later, he obtained these journals by deceit. Al- 
together his conduct had been that of a man in 
whom Peters had aroused an anxiety so intense 
as to form a possible motive for murdering him. 
And altogether his conduct after the murder 
bore, now that it could be fully traced, the 
flagrant aspect of guilt. He had unlatched the 
window; this was now certain, though of course 
of that act by itself an innocent account might 
be given. The reader knows too the whole 
course of his action in regard to Trethewy and 
his family, beginning with the lie, which made 
him appear as screening Trethewy when in fact 
he was plotting his undoing, and ending with his 
breaking in upon my talk with Ellen Trethewy, 
who had stood where she might have seen him 
making those tracks in the snow. The making of 
the tracks, this, of course, was the key to his 
whole conduct, the one thing, which, if quite 
certain, admitted of but one explanation. Only 



268 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

just here, when last we dealt with that matter, a 
faint haze still hung. Thalberg swore to having 
seen him in the field, where those tracks and no 
others were just afterwards found; Ellen Tre- 
thewy had seen him start to go there and again 
seen him returning. Yet, though the two cor- 
roborated each other, there might be some doubt 
of the inference to be drawn from what Ellen 
Trethewy saw (that depended on knowledge of 
the ground) , and of the correctness of the ob- 
servation made by Thalberg from afar. After 
all, was it absolutely impossible that Trethewy 
had through some strange impulse, rational or 
irrational, made those tracks himself, perhaps, 
with his sense of guilt and in the over-refinement 
of half-drunken cunning, he had fabricated 
against himself a case which he thought he could 
break down. 

But here the late revealed evidence came in. 
It was certain, first, that those tracks did not 
exist in the morning. The constable who had 
let the trespassers come in stopped them when he 
found them, and noted carefully how far they 
had gone; he got one of them, an enterprising 
young journalist, to verify his observation, and 
it resulted in this, that the part of the lawn where 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 269 

those guilty tracks began was absolutely un- 
trodden then. Next it was certain now that 
throughout the time when those tracks were 
made Trethewy had been in his house. Now, 
when the whole course of events that morning 
was considered, there could be no doubt that 
those tracks were made by some one who knew 
exactly what the situation was. Since it was 
not Trethewy, it lay between Sergeant Speke, 
myself, Callaghan and Vane-Cartwright. Ser- 
geant Speke and I could easily give account of 
our time that day, but I think I mentioned that 
there had arisen some doubt as to where Cal- 
laghan had been just at the critical hour. It was 
explained now; Callaghan had been too far away; 
just at that time he had gone again to the hotel, 
moved by one of his restless impulses to try and 
spy upon Thalberg. It lay then beyond doubt 
that the tracks were made by Vane-Cartwright, 
and it was beyond doubt why he made them. 

But the case did not rest there. The front 
door of Grenvile Combe had been bolted on the 
inside that night, before Peters died. Presum- 
ably Peters did it; anyway Vane-Cartwright and 
Callaghan, as they had said next morning, found 
it bolted when they came down disturbed by the 



270 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

noise, and themselves bolted it again; and Peters 
was then living, for they heard him in his room. 
The other doors had been bolted in like manner 
by the servants. Every window but two had 
also been latched. The doors had remained 
bolted till the servants were about in the morn- 
ing, when Peters must have been some hours 
dead. The fastened windows were still fastened 
when we came to the house (a window in the 
back servants' quarters had been open for a short 
while in the morning, but the servants had been 
about all the time) , for the constable, before he 
obeyed the Sergeant and began his search out- 
side, had been in every room and noticed every 
fastening. The two exceptions were Vane-Cart- 
wright's own open window, which did not matter, 
and the little window at the back, already named 
as a possible means of entrance. Careful experi- 
ment had now been made (Callaghan had long 
ago suggested it), and it showed that, whoever 
could climb to that window, only an infant could 
pass through it. No one then had entered the 
house by night, or, if he had previously entered 
it, had escaped by night; and it was also certain 
that no one could have lurked there concealed 
in the morning. Therefore, Peters was murdered 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 271 

by an inmate of the house, by the housemaid, or 
by the cook, or by Vane-Cartwright, or by Cal- 
laghan. Now the housemaid and the cook had 
passed a wakeful night; the disturbance in the 
road had aroused them and left them agitated and 
alarmed; each was therefore able to swear that 
the other had remained all night in the bedroom 
which they shared. Therefore, Peters was mur- 
dered either by Vane-Cartwright or by Callaghan. 
And why not, it might be asked, by Callaghan, 
against whom at one time such good grounds of 
suspicion were to be found? The reader must 
by this time have seen that the eccentric and 
desultory proceedings of Callaghan, even his 
strange whim of staying in that crime-stricken 
house and the silly talk with which he had put 
me off about his aim, had, as he once boasted to 
me, a method, which though odd and over- 
ingenious, was rational and very acute. The 
neglected memorandum he had made for the 
police was enough in itself (without his frankness 
under cross-examination) to set his proceedings 
since the murder in a clear light. Callaghan, 
moreover, was the life-long friend of Peters. 
True it was that (as the defence scented out) he 
had owed Peters 2,000, and Peters' will forgave 



272 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

the debt. True, but it was now proved no less 
true that since that will was made the debt had 
been paid, and paid in a significant manner. 
Callaghan had first remitted to Peters 500 from 
India. Peters, thereupon, had sent Callaghan 
an acquittance of the whole debt. Callaghan 's 
response was an immediate payment of 250 
more. And the balance, 1,250, had been paid 
a very few days before Peters was killed. This 
was what an ill-inspired cross-examination re- 
vealed, and if the guilt lay between Vane-Cart- 
wright and Callaghan, there could be no doubt 
which was the criminal. 

So Callaghan and I had gone through tangled 
enquiries and at least some perilous adventures 
to solve a puzzle of which the solution lay all the 
while at our feet, and at the feet of others. 

It would be melancholy now to dwell on the 
daring and brilliance of the defence. No wit- 
ness was called for it. It opened with a truly 
impressive treatment of Vane-Cartwright's con- 
fession; and the broken state of his tempera- 
ment, originally sensitive and now harassed by 
suspicion and persecution, was described with 
a tenderness of which the speaker might have 
seemed incapable, and which called forth for the 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 273 

hard man in the dock a transient glow of 
human sympathy. Every other part of his 
conduct, so far as it was admitted, was made 
the subject of an explanation, by itself plausible. 
But little was admitted. Every separate item of 
the evidence was made the subject of a doubt, 
by itself reasonable. If a witness had been 
called to tell some very plain matter of fact, that 
kind of plain fact under one's eyes was notori- 
ously the sort of thing about which the most 
careless mistakes were made. If a witness had 
had a longer tale to tell he had revealed some 
poisonous pre-possession. I, for example, a 
most deleterious type of cleric, had, besides a 
prejudice against unorthodox Vane-Cartwright, 
an animus to defend Trethewy, arising from 
that sickly sentiment towards Miss Trethewy 
which I betrayed when I fled to her from my 
ailing family at Florence. In Trethewy 's case 
again there had been a confession of a very 
different order; and the suggestion was dexter- 
ously worked that something still lay concealed 
behind Trethewy's story. Withal the vastness 
of the region of possibility was exhibited with 
vigorous appeals to the imagination. Strong 
in every part, the defence as a whole was bound 



274 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

to be weak; the fatality which made so many lies 
and blunders work together for evil was be- 
yond belief; the conduct which needed so much 
psychology to defend it was indefensible. 

So the verdict was given and the sentence was 
passed. 



CHAPTER XXIII 

ONCE again I saw William Vane-Cartwright. At 
his own request I was summoned to visit him in 
the gaol. It was not the interview of penitent and 
confessor; none the less I am bound to silence 
about it, even though my silence may involve 
the suppression of something which tells in his 
favour. One thing I may and must say. Part of 
his object in sending for me was to make me his 
agent in several acts of kindness. 

As I look back, I often ask myself: Was there 
indeed no truth, beyond what we knew, in the 
tale that this man told to Callaghan and me, 
and which was skilfully woven to accord as far 
as possible with many things which we might 
have and had in fact discovered. In point of 
vital facts it was certainly false. I could now 
disprove every syllable of that love story; his 
acquaintance with Miss Denison was only a few 
months old; she had never known Peters; and 

the letter that he showed us was a forgery of 

275 



276 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

course. I happen, moreover, too late for any use- 
ful purpose, to have met several people who knew 
Longhurst well; all agree that he was rough and 
uncompanionable, all that he was strictly honest 
and touchingly kind; all testify that in his later 
days he was a total abstainer. 

Yet, in the face of this, I believe that Vane- 
Cartwright described fairly, as well as with in- 
sight, the influences which in boyhood and early 
manhood told so disastrously upon him. I now 
know, as it happens, a good deal about his 
parents, for one of my present neighbours was a 
family friend of theirs. They were a gifted but 
eccentric couple, with more "principles' than 
any two heads can safely hold. Little as I like 
their beliefs, I cannot but suspect that their 
home life was governed by a conscientiousness 
and a tender affection for their child, from which, 
if he had wished to be guided right, some light 
must have fallen on his path. Yet without doubt 
their training was as bad a preparation as could 
be for what he was to undergo. He lost his 
fortune early, and was exiled to a settlement in 
the East which, by all accounts, was not a school 
of Christian chivalry. Almost everything in his 
surroundings there jarred upon his sensibility 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 277 

which on the aesthetic side was more than com- 
monly keen. Dozens of English lads pass through 
just such trials unshaken, some even unspotted, 
but they have been far otherwise nurtured than 
he. Peters too had an influence upon his youth. 
I, who knew Peters so well, know that he cannot 
have done the spiteful things which Vane-Cart- 
wright said, but I do not doubt for one moment 
that he did repel his young associate when he 
need not have done so. Peters was young too, 
and may well be forgiven, but I can imagine that 
by that chill touch he sped his comrade on the 
downward course which chanced to involve his 
own murder. 

Altogether it is easy enough to form some 
image, not merely monstrous, of the way in 
which that character formed itself out of its sur- 
roundings; to understand how the poor lad be- 
came more and more centred in himself; to 
praise him just in so far as that concentration 
was strength; to note where that strength lay, in 
the one virtue which in fact he had claimed as his 
own, in the unflinching avowal to himself of the 
motive by which he meant to live. 

That motive, a calculated resolve to be 
wealthy, to become detached in outward fact 



278 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

as he was already in feeling from the sort of 
people and the sort of surroundings amid which 
his present lot was cast, had already been 
formed when the partnership with Longhurst 
offered him his opportunity. One may well 
believe him that the three years of that partner- 
ship cost him much. His one companion was a 
man whom, I take it, he was incapable of liking, 
and his position at first was one of subjection to 
him. He had lied to us much about Longhurst, 
but I fancy that he had spoken of him with 
genuine, however unjust, dislike. What par- 
ticular fraud he played upon him, or whether it 
was, strictly speaking, a fraud at all, I do not 
know. But no doubt he was by nature mean 
(though ready enough to spend money) , and he 
was probably more mean when his strength was 
not full fledged and his nascent sense of power 
found its readiest enjoyment in tricks. Assuredly 
he intended from the first to use the partnership 
as much as possible for himself and as little as 
possible for his partner. I am told that this is in 
itself a perilous attitude from a legal point of view, 
and that it is, in many relations of life, harder than 
laymen think to keep quite out of reach of the law 
by any less painful course than that of positive 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 279 

honesty. Let us suppose that he did only the sort 
of thing which his own confession implied, ob- 
taining for himself alone the renewal of conces- 
sions originally made to his firm. Even so, I 
understand, he may have found himself in this 
position, that Longhurst would have been en- 
titled to his share (the half or perhaps much 
more, according to the terms of partnership) of 
extremely valuable assets upon which Vane- 
Cartwright had counted as his own. Moreover, 
that possibly stupid man would have had his 
voice about the vital question of how and when 
to sell this property. 

Even if this was all, it still meant that the 
hope upon which Vane-Cartwright had set his 
soul, the hope not of a competence but of eminent 
wealth, was about to slip away, and to slip 
away perhaps irretrievably. For, as I have lately 
learnt, he was then ill, could not remain in that 
climate, would not, if he fell down the ladder, 
be able to start again, with more money and 
more experience, where he had started three 
years before. In the choice which then arose he 
was not the man to set his personal safety in the 
scales against his ambition. And so the incredible 
deed was done, and fortune favoured the mur- 



280 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

derer with the report that his victim had been 
lost in a wrecked ship (possibly even he had met 
with that report before he killed him) . Hence- 
forward, watchful as he had to be for a while, 
the chief burden which his guilt laid upon him 
was that of bearing himself with indifference. 

Thirteen years had passed, years of unvarying 
success. The watchfulness was now seldom 
needed, and the indifference had become a pose. 
And so at last, on his first evening at Grenvile 
Combe, he fell talking in his wonted way of 
Longhurst, and gave that false account of his 
end to one of the only two living men with whom 
it behoved him to take care. Instantly the spectre 
of his crime, which he thought had been laid, 
confronted him, and confronted him, as some 
recollection warned him, with the real peril of 
public shame, perhaps conviction and death. In- 
stantly too there arose, as if to his aid, not as yet 
the full strength of his intellect and courage, but 
the ingrained, dormant spirit of crime. If he had 
only said to Peters, " He sailed in the Eleanor 
with me. I killed him. I will tell you all about 
it," I have not a shadow of a doubt that his con- 
fession would have been kept inviolate. Only 
there were trials from which even his nerve re- 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 281 

coiled, and plain facts of human nature which his 
acuteness never saw. So the same deed was done 
again in quiet reliance upon that wonderful luck 
which this time also had provided him with a 
screen against suspicion, and this time also 
seemed to require nothing of him after the act 
was accomplished except to bear himself care- 
lessly. Indeed he began to bear himself care- 
lessly too soon, for he trusted characteristic- 
ally that Peters had this night followed the prac- 
tice of opening the window which he was oddly 
fond of preaching, and he went out of the room 
without troubling to look behind the curtain, 
thus leaving himself one risky step to take 
next day. But his confidence seemed justified, 
for the window latch by itself would never 
have betrayed him. There was nothing in the 
room or in the house, nothing under the wide 
vault of that starlit sky that was destined to tell 
the tale. 

Morning brought to his eyes, though not yet to 
his comprehension, the presence of a huge 
calamity, for the ground was white with snow in 
which, if Trethewy had come through it, his tracks 
would still be seen. Soon he heard that Trethewy 
had in fact come home when the snow lay there. 
Then at last his whole mind rose to the full height 



282 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

of the occasion, to a height of composure and 
energy from which in all his later doings he never 
declined far. I have an unbounded hatred for 
that prevalent worship of strong men which seems 
to me to be born of craven fear. Yet it extorts 
my most unwilling admiration of this man that, 
when safety depended so much upon inaction, the 
only action he took was such as at once was 
appallingly dangerous and yet was the only way 
to avoid an even greater peril. 

But strangely enough as I shut my mind 
against that haunting memory which I have 
written these pages to expel, far different traits 
and incidents from this keep longest their hold 
upon my imagination. I remember Peters not as 
he died but as he lived ; and the murderer stands 
before me, as I take my leave, not in virtue of 
signal acts of crime (which I could more easily 
have forgiven) but of little acts, words, even 
tones of hardness and of concentrated selfishness, 
faintly noted in my story, rendered darker to me 
by the knowledge that he could be courteous and 
kind when it suited him. He stands there as the 
type to me, not of that rare being the splendid 
criminal, but of the man who in the old phrase is 
" without bowels." And men (on whose souls also 
may God have mercy) are not rare among us, who, 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 283 

without his intellect or his daring, are as hard as 
he, but for whom, through circumstances not un- 
common and I do not call them fortunate the 
path of consistent selfishness does not diverge 
from the path of a respectable life. 

Strangely too, one of those lesser acts of un- 
kindness was needed to bring about his downfall. 
If I had never seen him at Florence, the spark 
of my baffled ire would not have been rekindled, 
nor could I have met Trethewy's family till they 
had gone beyond the seas. And I should never 
have seen him at Florence but that my wife with- 
out knowing who he was, recalled upon seeing him 
that little delinquency at Crema of which she and 
I can think no longer with any personal spleen. 
It seems as if he might have murdered his partner 
and murdered his host with cruel deliberation and 
gone unpunished; but since one day without a 
second thought he refused a common courtesy to 
a suffering woman and a harassed girl, he had set 
in motion the cunning machinery of fate, and it 
came to pass in the end that the red hand of the 
law seized him and dealt to him the doom which 
the reader has long foreseen. 



284 TRACKS IN THE SNOW 

Let some surviving characters of this story 
briefly bid farewell. For my wife and me, we are 
settled in our country rectory, so near in distance 
to London and in effect so far off ; and, if the now 
delightful labours of my calling seem to me not 
more unsuccessful than perhaps they should 
always seem to the labourer, I like to think it 
means that what Eustace Peters, half-unknow- 
ing, did for me abides. 

Callaghan was our guest not two months ago, 
a welcome guest to us, and even more to our 
children. He talked alternately of a project of 
land reclamation on the Wash and of an imme- 
diate departure for the East in search of a clue 
to the questions left unsolved in these pages. He 
has since departed from this country, not, I be- 
lieve, for the East, but neither we nor any of his 
friends know where he is, or doubt that wherever 
he is, he can take care of himself and will hurt no 
other creature. Mr. Thalberg continues his law 
business in the City, though the business has 
changed in character. I bear him no ill-will, and 
yet am sorry to be told that (while the disclosures 
in the trial lost him several old clients, as well as 
his clerk, Mr. Manson) on the whole his business 
has grown. Trethewy is now our gardener. His 



TRACKS IN THE SNOW 285 

daughter is a board-school mistress in London. I 
hope he will long remain with us, for I now like 
him as a man but could not lay it upon my con- 
science to recommend him as a gardener. Peters' 
nephews, unseen by the reader, have hovered 
close in the background of my tale. Both have 
distinguished themselves in India. Yesterday I 
married the elder to Miss Denison, on whom, I 
hope, the reader has bestowed a thought. In the 
other, who is engaged to my eldest daughter, his 
uncle's peculiar gifts repeat themselves more 
markedly and with greater promise of practical 
achievement.
