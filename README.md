#c19prose
Corpus of British prose from the long 19th century (1780-1920)

This repository of texts currently contains 1,450 pieces of British prose (Fiction and non-fiction) published between 1780 and 1920, gathered from ProQuest, Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, and HathiTrust. Curation is ongoing, with plans to expand to include greater quantity of non-fiction, journalistic prose, short fiction, and colonial Anglophone literatures.

Since it was orginally created for the purposes of textual analysis, robust metadata for these texts is currently unavailable except from their source hosts (see C19ProseContents.csv)
